transitions of their individual ATPase subunits (Erzberger and Berger, 2006; Puchades et al., 2020). How the energy from ATP hydrolysis is captured to perform mechanical work by these coordinated movements is unknown. In this study, we developed a novel approach for delineating the nucleotide-dependent free-energy landscape (FEL) of the proteasome’s heterohexameric ATPase complex based on complementary structural and kinetic measurements. We used the FEL to simulate the dynamics of the proteasome and quantitatively evaluated the predicted structural and kinetic properties. The FEL model predictions are consistent with a wide range of experimental observations in this and previous studies and suggested novel mechanistic features of the proteasomal ATPases. We find that the cooperative movements of the ATPase subunits result from the design of the ATPase hexamer entailing a unique free-energy minimum for each nucleotide-binding status. ATP hydrolysis dictates the direction of substrate translocation by triggering an energy-dissipating conformational transition of the ATPase complex.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>In cells, many biological processes are carried out by large complexes made up of different proteins. These macromolecules act like miniature machines, flexing and moving their various parts to perform their cellular roles. One such complex is the 26S proteasome, which is responsible for recycling other proteins in the cell. The proteasome consists of approximately 31 subunits, including a ring of six ATPase enzymes that provide the complex with the energy it needs to mechanically unfold proteins.</p><p>To understand how the proteasome and other large complexes work, researchers need to be able to monitor how their structure changes over time. These dynamics are challenging to probe directly with experiments, but can be assessed using computer simulations which track the movement of individual molecules and atoms. However, currently available computer systems do not have enough power to simulate the dynamics of large protein assemblies, like the 26S proteasome: for example, it would take longer than a thousand years to model how each atom in the complex moves over a timescale in which a biological change would happen (roughly 100ms).</p><p>Here, Fang, Hon et al. have developed a new approach to simulate the structural dynamics of the proteasome’s ring of ATPase enzymes. Different known structures of the proteasome were used to identify the range of possible movements and shapes the complex can make. Fang, Hon et al. then used this data to calculate the energy level of each structure – also known as the ‘free energy landscape’ – and the rate of transition between them. This made it possible to simulate how the different ATPase enzymes move within the ring under a wide range of conditions.</p><p>The simulated ATPase movements predicted how the proteasome machine would behave during various tasks, including degrading other proteins. Fan, Hon et al. carefully examined these predictions and found that they were consistent with experimental observations, validating their new simulation method.</p><p>This work demonstrates the feasibility of simulating the actions of a large protein complex based on its free energy landscape. The results offer important insights into the functional mechanics of the 26S proteasome and related protein machines. Further work may help to simplify this process so the approach can be used to investigate the dynamics of other protein assemblies.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>cell-free system</kwd><kwd>biochemistry</kwd><kwd>reconstitution</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>None</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM134064-01</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lu</surname><given-names>Ying</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100012643</institution-id><institution>Edward Mallinckrodt, Jr. Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lu</surname><given-names>Ying</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100006691</institution-id><institution>Harvard Medical School</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Dean's initiative award</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lu</surname><given-names>Ying</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Empirical energy landscape allows simulating the structural dynamics of the proteasomal ATPase complex, which yields predictions that are widely consistent with experimental observations and reveals the functional mechanism of the proteasome in substrate degradation.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The ring-shaped oligomeric ATPases control key biological processes including protein folding, transcription, DNA replication, cellular cargo transport, and protein turnover (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Erzberger and Berger, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Puchades et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">White and Lauring, 2007</xref>).

The proteasome holoenzyme consists of a barrel-shaped 20S core particle (CP) capped by 19S regulatory particles (RPs) on one or both ends (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bard et al., 2018</xref>). Each RP features a nine-member Lid subcomplex and a heterohexameric ring of AAA+ ATPases assembled from six distinct gene products (RPT1–RPT6) that share 85% sequence identity. These ATPases use the energy from ATP hydrolysis to mechanically unfold substrates and translocate them into the CP for proteolysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>The architectures of the proteasomal ATPase complex and its interaction with substrate.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) A schematic showing a half 26S proteasome engaged with an unfolded substrate through the PL1s (color loops) on the ATPase subunits with bound nucleotides (color blobs).

In previous investigations of the structural mechanism of proteasomal degradation, cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) of the substrate-engaged proteasome captured seven states, E<sub>A1</sub>–E<sub>D2</sub>. E<sub>A1</sub> and E<sub>A2</sub> likely represent the resting states of proteasome; E<sub>D1</sub> and E<sub>D2</sub> are hypothesized to be involved in substrate translocation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dong et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">de la Peña et al., 2018</xref>). In these structures, an unfolded substrate primarily interacts with aromatic residues on the pore-1 loop (PL1) of each ATPase. These short structured loops form a right-handed helical ‘staircase’ delineating the interior of the translocation channel. Changes in bound nucleotides at the ATPase interfaces are associated with rearrangements of the architecture of the PL1 staircase and the proteasome-substrate interaction, as a result of both translational and pivot movements of these ATPases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dong et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">de la Peña et al., 2018</xref>). One or two PL1s are disengaged from substrate interaction in each state. These disengaged PL1s usually occupy distal, or top, positions in the staircase away from the CP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). To account for substrate translocation, we and others have proposed that when certain PL1s disengage and move to the top, substrate-engaged PL1s may move in the opposite direction, toward the CP. This conformational rearrangement may provide the power stroke to promote axial translocation of substrate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dong et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">de la Peña et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>In spite of these structural insights, important questions regarding the dynamics of proteasomal structures remain, in particular how the six proteasomal ATPases coordinate during conformational transitions to achieve substrate translocation. Based on these cryo-EM structures, we previously proposed that the conformation and nucleotide-binding status of the ATPase hexamer may cycle consecutively through six different states with rotational equivalence, thus driving processive substrate translocation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dong et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hua et al., 2002</xref>). A similar model of sequential transitions was proposed in an independent study of yeast proteasome structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">de la Peña et al., 2018</xref>). Only two out of the six conformations proposed in the sequential-transition model were identified in these structural studies, and direct experimental study of the transition sequence has not been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dong et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">de la Peña et al., 2018</xref>). Transiting into the next state involves multiple changes in nucleotide status and a complex conformational rearrangement of the ATPase hexamer. We still do not know the order of these events and how the chemical energy from ATP hydrolysis may be harvested to drive these transitions.</p><p>In addition, there are experimental findings that appear inconsistent with the predictions of a strict sequential-transition model. For example, mutations of the Walker-A (WA) or Walker-B (WB) motifs on an ATPase impede its nucleotide-binding or hydrolysis activity, and are therefore predicted to inactivate the proteasome by blocking the transition sequence. However, Walker mutations on some ATPases of the proteasome are in fact well-tolerated in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Rubin et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Eisele et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kim et al., 2013</xref>). Similarly, mutations of other functional motifs on different proteasomal ATPases have varying effects on protein degradation, leading to the hypothesis that the six ATPases may have nonequivalent roles in the proteasome activities despite their high levels of similarity in sequence and structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Rubin et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Beckwith et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Erales et al., 2012</xref>). These functional properties of the proteasome are not interpreted by the previous models and so far no alternative model that is consistent with both structural and functional observations has been suggested.</p><p>Computational approaches, such as molecular dynamics simulations, are frequently employed to decipher the structural dynamics of proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brini et al., 2020</xref>). However, despite recent advances, it is still impractical to perform a full-atom simulation of a large system such as the proteasome at a biologically relevant time scale (~100 ms) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gecht et al., 2020</xref>). We therefore developed a novel approach to simulate the conformational dynamics of the proteasomal ATPase hexamer by constructing a physical model based on the nucleotide-dependent free-energy landscape (FEL) of the ATPase complex. To obtain the FEL, we first performed comparative analysis on known proteasome structures to identify the primary degrees of freedom (DOFs) of proteasome’s conformational changes, and applied these DOFs as the conformational coordinates of the FEL. We then parameterized the free energy surface based on the mode of nucleotide-ATPase interactions, and experimentally determined the nine parameters of the FEL. Conformational changes of the ATPase complex are mapped to simple stochastic transitions on the FEL which evolves as the nucleotide status changes, driven by independent chemical processes at each nucleotide-binding pocket.</p><p>To address whether the simulated dynamics based on the FEL model recapitulates the actual dynamics of the ATPase complex, we experimentally tested the model predictions in a wide range of conditions that are distinct from the results used for model construction, as well as comparing the predictions with published results. We found that the FEL predictions were widely congruent with the experimental measurements in this and previous studies.</p><p>Our work introduces a new method for studying the dynamics of a complex protein machine such as the 26S proteasome, and provides a coherent explanation for a variety of structural and kinetic observations. It also provides a satisfying picture of the underlying mechanism by which the AAA+ hexamer on the proteasome operates in driving substrate translocation.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Structure-based construction of the FEL of the proteasomal ATPase complex</title><p>In this work, we elect a combination of the ATPase complex’s conformation and the nucleotide distribution in the six ATPase pockets to specify a ‘state’ of the proteasome, for consistency with nomenclature in structural studies. A description of the FEL of proteasome is represented by the potential of mean force of a specific proteasome population measured as a bivariate function of its conformational coordinates and the nucleotide distribution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kirkwood, 1935</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Rodnina et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>The conformational coordinates of the FEL are defined by the primary DOFs of proteasome’s conformational changes, identified by comparing proteasome structures. We designate each conformation in the FEL by whether the interfaces of the six ATPase domains on proteasome are open or closed, based on the observation that the solvent-excluded surface area (SESA) of these interfaces mostly adopts binary values in these cryo-EM structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). A large SESA is associated with closed interfaces that appear to arrange the PL1s on neighboring ATPases into a staircase that interacts with substrate peptide. In contrast, a smaller SESA suggests an open interface and the relative geometry of the neighboring ATPases tends to vary (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). An ATPase subunit that is flanked by two open interfaces is disengaged from substrate interaction, as observed in the cryo-EM structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). In the FEL, we constrain the total number of open interfaces in each hexamer conformation to be either 2 or 3, as observed in the cryo-EM structures except for the E<sub>A</sub> states which involve only one open interface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>) (see Discussion). This defines 30 conformations, after excluding 5 with ambiguity in assigning ATPase-substrate interaction due to symmetry (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>; Materials and methods 'Defining a discrete conformational space of the proteasome ATPase complex by extrapolating the cryo-EM observations'). States in the FEL are also differentiated by the nucleotide distribution in these ATPases. Each nucleotide pocket may be occupied by ATP, ADP, ATP-γS (a slowly-hydrolyzing ATP analog), or no nucleotide. We ignore the transient ADP•Pi state due to the very weak affinity between free phosphate and the proteasome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>); also, no such state has been identified so far in proteasome structures. The total number of distinct states in the FEL model is therefore 30×4<sup>6</sup>=122,880.</p><p>The molecular details of the nucleotide-ATPase interactions suggest a strategy to parameterize the free energy of each conformation as a function of its nucleotide status. Each nucleotide-ATPase interaction on the proteasome involves several conserved elements: the WA, WB, sensor I, and sensor II motifs from the <italic>cis</italic> ATPase and the arginine fingers from the <italic>trans</italic> ATPase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Ogura and Wilkinson, 2001</xref>). The arginine fingers are the major components interacting with the γ- and β-phosphate groups on ATP at a closed interface. We found that the <italic>cis</italic> elements exhibited rather minor rearrangements among different states of either substrate-free or substrate-engaged proteasomes (root-mean-square deviation [RMSD] ~0.58 Ȧ) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). We therefore parameterized the total free energy of the ATPase hexamer as a sum of the contributions from each individual ATPase interface. Each interface’s contribution is subdivided into three components: the basal energy <italic>E<sub>b,</sub></italic> which derives from direct interactions between adjacent ATPases at a closed interface; the pocket energy <italic>E<sub>p</sub></italic> from the nucleotide-<italic>cis-</italic>element interactions, which are similar for ADP and ATP; and the bridge energy <italic>E<sub>Br</sub>,</italic> which differentiates ADP from ATP and originates from the engagement of arginine fingers and other <italic>trans</italic> elements with the γ- and β-phosphate on the nucleotide at a closed interface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). The <italic>cis</italic> pockets of disengaged ATPases exhibit either low or no nucleotide density in cryo-EM maps, and are associated with slightly rearranged <italic>cis</italic> motifs (<italic>p</italic>=0.014) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dong et al., 2019</xref>). We therefore assign a separate pocket energy <italic>E<sub>p</sub><sup>APO</sup></italic> for disengaged ATPases to reflect their low affinity for nucleotides. The chemical energy in ATP is excluded from the free energy calculation, since it does not explicitly contribute to the simulation of ATPase dynamics (see the next section).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Parameterization of the nucleotide-dependent free-energy landscape.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The interaction map of the residues on Rpt4 and Rpt3 with the bound ATP or ADP in the E<sub>D1</sub> or E<sub>D2</sub> states.

A critical parameter is the difference in the bridge energies (<italic>E<sub>Br</sub></italic>) between ATP and ADP interfaces, which we find is key for determining the directionality of translocation. This parameter was measured using a single-molecule binding assay, based on the relationship between the dissociation constant (<italic>K<sub>d</sub></italic>) of the nucleotides and these energy terms.

For the 12 ATPase-hexamer conformations that are characterized by either a single or two adjacent disengaged ATPase units, as in the observed E<sub>D</sub> or E<sub>C</sub> states, uniform ATP binding generates a flat FEL. The presence of ADP in a single pocket breaks the symmetry and lowers the relative free energy of a subset of conformations by 1.6 kcal/mol. The further addition of an empty pocket next to the ADP pocket produces a well-separated energy-minimum conformation in which the empty and ADP <italic>cis</italic> pockets are found in the disengaged ATPase and its counterclockwise neighbor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Although we did not impose any coupling between nucleotide status and ATPase conformation, this energy-minimum arrangement of nucleotide and conformation is identical to those observed in the E<sub>D1</sub> and E<sub>D2</sub> states of proteasome, possibly explaining the prevalence of this arrangement in proteasome structures as well as in related AAA+ ATPases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dong et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Majumder et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cooney et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>We simulated the dynamics of the ATPase complex as stochastic transitions in a discrete 12 (6 conformational+6 nucleotide) dimensional space (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). The transitions between conformations were described as a simple bi-state process with a rate constant determined by the Arrhenius equation. The ATP cycle at each pocket proceeds independently, as described by the basic chemical rate equations. The off-rate of a nucleotide is calculated from its <italic>K<sub>d</sub></italic> as a function of the energy parameters, with the on-rate set at a constant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>; Materials and methods 'Determining the FEL and kinetic parameters' and 'Determining the parameters related with substrate translocation'). The detailed process of a conformational change is not considered explicitly (i.e., as ‘adiabatic’) in that the change of nucleotide distribution alters the FEL and causes repopulation of the conformational space of proteasome. We do not include any assumption on the coordination of the nucleotide cycles, or the coupling of the nucleotide and conformational changes, or any predetermined sequence of transitions.</p><p>To generate testable predictions from simulated ATPase dynamics, we introduced a substrate peptide that is mechanically coupled with the continuous segment of the PL1 staircase. In these simulations, the disengaged PL1s occupy the top staircase position, as observed in cryo-EM structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dong et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">de la Peña et al., 2018</xref>). The unit step of translocation is defined by the axial separation between PL1s, corresponding to approximately two amino acids (AAs) in the substrate polypeptide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). The force coupling with a translocating substrate may affect the rates of ATPase conformational changes. We represent this effect as a titling of the FEL and simplify by ignoring the stochastic and sequence-dependent variations of these forces and introduce two constant values to capture the average effect on the forward and backward processes (Materials and methods 'Determining the parameters related with substrate translocation').</p><p>To experimentally determine these two force parameters and another parameter for defining the activation energy barrier, we employed a quantitative degradation assay based on the decay of a fluorescent reporter of the ubiquitylated cyclinB N-terminus fused with an infrared fluorescent protein iRFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lu et al., 2017</xref>). The N-terminal cyclinB is an unstructured protein that is efficiently degraded by the proteasome starting from its N-terminus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">King et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Yamano et al., 2004</xref>). We find that degradation of cyclinB-iRFP follows Michaelis-Menten-like kinetics with <italic>K<sub>M</sub></italic>=5.6 nM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). We performed each measurement at substrate concentrations much higher than the <italic>K<sub>M</sub></italic> to maximize the signal-to-noise ratio, and tested five substrate concentrations, each with three replicas, to verify the saturation condition. It took an average of 55 s (i.e., the turnover time) for the proteasome to degrade a 46 kDa cyclinB-iRFP molecule in a process that could be rate-limited by several steps including substrate commitment, unfolding, and translocation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Collins and Goldberg, 2017</xref>).</p><p>To determine the actual rate-limiting step, we engineered a mutant of cyclinB containing only three lysine residues, and conjugated fluorescent ubiquitin chains onto these lysines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lu et al., 2015</xref>). We examined this substrate using a single-molecule translocation assay developed previously (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hon and Lu, 2019</xref>). The processive translocation of a substrate coincides with the stepwise removal of entire ubiquitin chains by the deubiquitinase Rpn11 on the proteasome, which was detected by TIRF to measure the ubiquitin copies on a substrate molecule (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). The decay rate of fluorescent ubiquitins on three-lysine cyclinB suggests a translocation rate of 10.5 (±0.8) AA/s (Materials and methods 'Single-molecule proteasome assay'). A similar translocation rate was found in a measurement of <italic>V</italic><sub>max</sub> of proteasomal degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Peth et al., 2013b</xref>).</p><p>With this translocation rate, a cyclinB-iRFP peptide containing 445 AAs would take at least 44 s to progress into the CP, that is, 80% of the 55 s total turnover time. This suggests that translocation is the limiting step of the entire degradation process for this substrate. Degradation of these substrates is unlikely to be limited by deubiquitylation because substrates with multiple Ub chains are degraded faster than the same substrate with fewer chains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lu et al., 2015</xref>). Therefore, in the experiments described below, we used the measured degradation rate of cyclinB-iRFP as an approximation for the translocation rate. This reporter assay also gives consistent results with direct single-molecule measurements under perturbed conditions, such as in the presence of ADP or ATP-γS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). We next determined the translocation rate of cyclinB-iRFP in the presence of 500 μM ATP and different concentrations of ADP, and estimated the three translocation-related parameters using these data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref> and Materials and methods 'Determining the parameters related with substrate translocation').</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>The FEL-predicted kinetics of substrate degradation</title><p>Directly probing the dynamical behavior of the proteasomal ATPases is challenging.

This inhibition is not due to extra Mg<sup>2+</sup>, proteasome disassembly, degradation-independent iRFP inactivation, or a general slowdown of ATP hydrolysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref> to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplements 3</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s5">5</xref>). As the FEL model suggests, coordinated movements of the ATPase subunits require the ATPase complex to have a unique energy-minimum conformation for each nucleotide status typically occurring during physiological operation, so that, when the nucleotide status changes, these ATPase’s conformations undergo a well-defined collective change, leading to translocation. Very high ATP concentrations bias the proteasome toward all-ATP status and a flat FEL, resulting in a loss of ATPase cooperativity and abrogating the directionality of translocation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4A</xref>). This result is in contrast to the predictions of a sequential-transition model, which would predict a monotonic increase of translocation rate at increasing ATP concentrations, regardless of the parameters and reaction details, inconsistent with the observation (Materials and methods 'The translocation rate at different ATP concentrations as predicted by a strict sequential-transition model').</p><p>The FEL-predicted translocation kinetics are also consistent with the results of competition experiments involving ATP-γS. In the simulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>), ATP-γS introduces pauses between processive phases of substrate translocation, longer at higher concentrations, which closely resembles the ATP-γS-induced translocation pauses in single-molecule force measurements of ClpXP, a proteasome-like ATPase in prokaryotes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Sen et al., 2013</xref>). In the reporter experiment, 36 μM ATP-γS inhibited the translocation rate by 50% in the presence of 500 μM ATP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>), despite the fact that the difference in the apparent <italic>K<sub>i</sub></italic> values between ATP and ATP-γS is only twofold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). ATP-γS alters the ATPase dynamics which in turn affects the kinetics of nucleotide turnover. This process is required to interpret the low IC<sub>50</sub> for ATP-γS, as suggested by the FEL model.</p><p>We also performed an ATP-γS competition experiment at a level where the high-ATP-inhibition effect is apparent (15 mM ATP). Despite an overall reduction in translocation and a dramatic shift in IC<sub>50</sub>, the FEL-predicted rates still closely match the experimental results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). The FEL model also predicts that the translocation rate should linearly depend on the rate of ATP hydrolysis at varying ATP-γS concentrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>), consistent with a previous observation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Peth et al., 2013b</xref>).</p><p>For structurally stable substrates, unfolding may be a limiting step in proteasomal degradation. To test the FEL model in the context of such substrates, we created a fluorescent reporter by inserting a dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) domain from <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> between cyclinB and iRFP. We found that adding a DHFR ligand, folic acid, led to a dose-dependent stabilization of the ubiquitylated cyclinB-DHFR-iRFP in the presence of the proteasome, while the degradation of the original cyclinB-iRFP was unaffected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). In the presence of folic acid, cyclinB-DHFR-iRFP degradation is still complete, or processive (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>). The IC<sub>50</sub> value for folic acid in inhibiting the degradation is 800 μM, much higher than the 1 μM dissociation constant between DHFR and folic acid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Posner et al., 1996</xref>). This is likely because unfolding of the DHFR domain by the ATPase’s actions primarily occurs when DHFR is transiently unliganded, consistent with the linear relationship between folic acid concentration and the inverse of the degradation rate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3</xref> and Materials and methods 'Interpreting the degradation kinetics of unfolding-limited substrates'). The FEL model suggests that folic acid lowers the overall efficiency of ATP utilization in degrading DHFR-containing substrates as reported previously (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Peth et al., 2013b</xref>). We tested the degradation rates of ubiquitylated cyclinB-DHFR-iRFP with 800 μM folic acid in an ATP-titration experiment, and found that folic acid did not affect the EC<sub>50</sub> value of ATP in the up-phase of the rate curve, although it lowered the peak degradation rate. However, folic acid significantly reduced the degree of degradation inhibition at high ATP concentrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A and B</xref>).

A stable ligand, such as methotrexate, can inhibit the degradation of cyclinB-DHFR-iRFP at a low concentration by preventing the unfolding of DHFR, resulting in partial cleavage of the substrate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Johnston et al., 1995</xref>).

ATP hydrolysis at the Rpt3–Rpt4 pocket is important for the transition from the E<sub>D1</sub> to E<sub>D2</sub> cryo-EM state; its inactivation mimics a WB mutation and strongly reduces the transition frequency from the E<sub>D1</sub>- to the E<sub>D2</sub>-equivalent conformation in an FEL simulation. This loss of ‘flow’ was compensated by an increase in the transition to an E<sub>C</sub>-like conformation, so that the overall translocation rate was only reduced by 11% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). Transition networks with an inactivated ATPase also show an expansion of the E<sub>D</sub>-like conformations in which the ATPases at the –2 or –3 positions are flanked by open interfaces (0=mutant, negative=counterclockwise); this trend is consistent with and may explain a previous cryo-EM analysis on WB mutant proteasomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Eisele et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>The order of the elementary steps of reactions and transitions is an important part of the ATPase mechanism and is challenging to observe directly. Different sequences of these steps have been hypothesized to drive the orderly conformational transitions of the proteasome and other AAA+ ATPases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dong et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Majumder et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Monroe et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lyubimov et al., 2011</xref>). Our simulation identifies the most-likely reaction sequence by enumerating all the possible sequences that can promote transitions between two states and calculating their probabilities. For the E<sub>D1</sub>-to-E<sub>D2</sub> transition, the most-likely reaction sequence begins with ATP hydrolysis at the Rpt3–Rpt4 pocket, followed by ATP binding to Rpt5 and a conformational rearrangement of the ATPase complex. This conformational change exchanges the ADP-bound Rpt3–Rpt4 interface for an ATP-bound Rpt5–Rpt1 interface and drives a unit-step translocation of two AAs by rearranging the PL1 staircase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>). In this process, 1.6 kcal/mol energy is dissipated. This energy-dissipating step is important for establishing the directionality of translocation in the simulation. This conformational change also drives Rpt4 into a disengaged APO state with a weak nucleotide affinity, allowing rapid release of bound ADP. Otherwise, the rate of ADP release would be incompatible with the fast kinetics of substrate translocation. Phosphate release is unlikely to be limiting since phosphate has a <italic>K<sub>i</sub></italic> value of 70 mM measured in a competition assay, a much weaker affinity than ADP for the ATPases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>Identifying this ‘most-likely’ reaction sequence is critical for obtaining the formula for the EC<sub>50</sub> value of ATP (Materials and methods 'Deriving a formula for the EC<sub>50</sub> value in the ATP titration experiment'). In a proteasome with non-hydrolyzing Rpt3, the E<sub>D1</sub>-to-E<sub>C</sub> transition that partially rescues the ‘flow’ is initiated by ATP hydrolysis at the Rpt6–Rpt3 pocket. The associated conformational change drives a translocation of two unit-steps, or four AAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3</xref>). These larger steps occur stochastically even in the wild-type (WT) proteasome, though they are less energetically favorable. Nonetheless, these occasional larger steps likely explain the experimentally observed translocation efficiency of 2.6–3.0 AAs per ATP consumption (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Peth et al., 2013b</xref>).</p><p>We next address the question of whether our model can help to interpret the observed functional disparity among the proteasomal ATPases. The model described above is symmetric, with all ATPases having identical parameter. One potential source of symmetry-breaking is the proteasome Lid-ATPase interaction. The Lid subcomplex interacts extensively with the ATPase domains, primarily on Rpt3/6, in the E<sub>A</sub>-like or E<sub>A</sub>-like states in which the PL1s on Rpt3 and Rpt2 respectively occupy the top and bottom niches in the staircase and Rpt6 is in a disengaged position (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dong et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chen et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Zhu et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Beck et al., 2012</xref>). This arrangement closely resembles one E<sub>D</sub>-like conformation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s4">Figure 6—figure supplement 4</xref>, gray node). Weakening the Lid-ATPase interaction by mutations reduces the fraction of proteasome in the E<sub>A</sub>-like states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Greene et al., 2019</xref>). We therefore hypothesize that the Lid-ATPase interaction may effectively stabilize this specific ATPase conformation by lowering its standard free energy. We implemented such a stabilizing effect in the FEL simulation by lowering the free energy of this E<sub>D</sub>-like conformation by an arbitrary value, and found that this resulted in significant expansion of the occupancy of the E<sub>D1</sub>- and E<sub>D2</sub>-conformations and a simultaneous shrinkage in other E<sub>D</sub>-like conformations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s4">Figure 6—figure supplement 4</xref>), consistent with the cryo-EM observations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dong et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">de la Peña et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>To study whether the Lid-ATPase interaction may contribute to the different growth phenotypes in yeast WB mutants, we examined how the translocation rate changed after simulated inactivation of the ATP-hydrolysis activity of individual ATPases in the presence of the Lid. We found that the predicted translocation rate is generally correlated with the corresponding growth phenotype in a range of the Lid-ATPase interaction strength, which suggests that this interaction may contribute to the growth phenotypes of yeast WB mutants, potentially in conjunction with other compensatory mechanisms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s5">Figure 6—figure supplement 5</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Protein machines accomplish complex tasks, driven by their exquisite structural dynamics at the molecular level. Studying these dynamics is challenging for both experimental investigation and molecular simulation.</p><p>In this work, we exercised the principle of parsimony to reconstruct the FEL of the proteasomal ATPase complex and experimentally determined its parameters in an attempt to uncover the mechanism in polypeptide translocation. The FEL is an intrinsic property of a protein or a complex and is a key component of physical models that have provided important insights into the mechanisms of molecular motors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Wang and Oster, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Tu and Cao, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bustamante et al., 2001</xref>). FELs can be derived from conformational occupancies in cryo-EM studies through the Boltzmann equation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dashti et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Fischer et al., 2010</xref>. Identification of the very large number of proteasomal states is challenging and the nonequilibrium transitions further complicate the analysis. The FEL-based simulation introduced in our study generates various predictions which we used to examine the validity of the simulated ATPase dynamics and this overall approach. We found that the simulation recapitulated a number of important experimental observations including degradation kinetics, state distributions in cryo-EM datasets and the growth phenotypes of WB mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). Moreover, this study reveals that these varieties of phenomena are in fact driven by a coherent and simple principle embodied in our model, thus offering mechanistic insights into the ATP-driven cooperative actions of the ATPases in promoting the translocation of substrate polypeptides.</p><p>The observation that the nucleotide status of three consecutive ATPase subunits on the proteasome represents a continuous sequence in an ATP cycle has led to a sequential rotary model and ‘hand-over-hand’ translocation for proteasomal ATPase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Puchades et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dong et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">de la Peña et al., 2018</xref>). A strict sequential mechanism requires that the ATP-bound subunit adjacent to the ADP subunit must hydrolyze ATP first. We compared the nucleotide-interacting motifs in all high-resolution structures of the proteasome but failed to identify a consistent trend that could suggest an allosteric effect between the ATP-pocket and other parts of the complex. As an alternative, we considered the possibility that the apparent cooperativity between different subunits might emerge from the modulation of their collective FEL by ligand binding, as proposed in the celebrated Monod-Wyman-Changeux concerted model for allosteric regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Changeux, 2012</xref>). Loss of ATPase cooperativity due to flattening of the FEL at above-physiological ATP concentrations reduces the rate of substrate degradation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). A similar inhibitory effect has been reported for a bacterial pilus assembly motor, though the exact mechanism is still unclear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Sukmana and Yang, 2018</xref>). Although sacrificing some translocation efficiency, the flat FEL of the all-ATP state facilitates interchange among proteasomal conformations, even under physiological ATP concentrations. This property may be important for bypassing an occasional stuck or defective ATPase subunit that would completely inhibit proteasomal activity in a strict sequential-transition model. The resulting network of conformational transitions is analogous to the ‘ring-resetting’ model for the ClpXP ATPase complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Stinson et al., 2013</xref>). It is interesting to note that the peptidase activity of the proteasome is also inhibited by ATP concentrations above a threshold; however, this is likely to be due to a different mechanism since the critical concentration for peptidase inhibition is ~50× lower than that for translocation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Smith et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>One or two ATPase units are disengaged from substrate peptide or from the translocation channel in all identified states of the proteasome. These disengaged ATPases are flanked by two open interfaces except in E<sub>A</sub> states, where the ‘disengaged’ subunit is associated with one open interface. We speculate that this is due to the extensive Lid-ATPase interaction in these states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chen et al., 2016</xref>). The presence of disengaged ATPases ensures that there is a unique energy-minimum conformation, and thus ensures a high level of cooperativity among the ATPase subunits. The smaller pocket energy <italic>E<sub>p</sub></italic> of these disengaged units also allows a fast nucleotide exchange, which is required for efficient translocation. Disengaged ATPase units are frequently observed in the structures of ring-shaped ATPases and may have a similar role in their activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Majumder et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Fei et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Puchades, 2017</xref>).</p><p>The nonequilibrium transitions of the ATPase complex identified by the FEL approach reveal important features of proteasome functions. Our model shows that substrate translocation steps are directly coupled to an energy-dissipating conformational transition which swaps an ADP-bound closed interface with another ATP closed interface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>). We propose that this coupling may dictate the directionality of translocation. The simulated translocation process deviates from a strict ‘hand-over-hand’ mechanism in that the step size in our model can adopt multiples of 2× AA, depending on which ATP molecule is first hydrolyzed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3</xref>). Variations in step size have been observed in substrate translocation by ClpXP, though its connection with our simulation is unclear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Sen et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Shi et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>We used the cryo-EM structures of proteasome as the basis for model construction. These structures are mainly for identifying the DOFs of the ATPase’s conformational change (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). Other aspects of the structural information, such as the conformational occupancy and nucleotide distribution, are not required for model construction but are still consistent with its predictions. The inter-subunit signaling motif has been suggested to mediate ATPase communication and coupling with nucleotides and may contribute to the bridge energy in the FEL model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chang et al., 2017</xref>). We did not include explicit allosteric coupling between ATPases in our model, as we find that it is not essential for explaining the current experimental observations. Adding allosteric effects to the model would be straightforward and may accommodate the ‘coordinated bursts’ mechanism to extend this model to other ATPase systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Fei et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>Partial degradation, or processing, by the proteasome is a natural process in the maturation of certain protein factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Nassif et al., 2014</xref>). The backward process on proteasome is much less understood and may contribute to efficient release of partially degraded substrates. In our study, modeling the substrate-escape kinetics as a first-passage time problem yields predictions consistent with the measurements. Other mechanisms, such as loss of grip on certain substrates, may also contribute to the escape kinetics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Nassif et al., 2014</xref>). In the current model, we simplified the mechanical force on a substrate during translocation as a constant. Incorporating the precise unfolding landscape of a substrate and the interaction energy with the ATPase into the FEL model would be straightforward (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Saha and Warshel, 2021</xref>), and may shed light on the mechanism of partial or nonprocessive degradation of certain substrates.</p><p>The same mutation in the six highly-similar ATPases often have different effects on proteasome activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Rubin et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Eisele et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Beckwith et al., 2013</xref>). Previous studies lead to no consensus on whether certain subunits play a more important role in substrate degradation and the extent to which the sequence divergence among the six ATPases contributes to these functional heterogeneities is unclear. Interestingly, we found that it is possible to rationalize at least some of these functional heterogeneities without invoking disparity at the level of individual ATPases. The introduction of Lid-ATPase interactions as a simple conformation-stabilizing parameter in the FEL simulation, recapitulates the asymmetric cryo-EM state distributions and may explain the different phenotypes of WB mutants. Direct interpretation of WA mutants remains challenging, as these mutations often lead to proteasome assembly defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Beckwith et al., 2013</xref>). In the simulation, large heterogeneities of energy parameters among the six ATPases can alter the ATPase dynamics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s6">Figure 6—figure supplement 6</xref>). Interestingly, this effect is significantly blunted by incorporating the Lid-ATPase interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s6">Figure 6—figure supplement 6</xref>). This may contribute to the inessentiality of parameter variations in recapitulating the experimental results. Including the Lid-ATPase interaction in the model yields predictions that are compatible with all the kinetic measurements in our study and indicates that the proteasome may occasionally visit an E<sub>A</sub>-like state during translocation. However, the peak translocation rate is underestimated by 20%–25% in this case, suggesting that our understanding of the symmetry-breaking mechanism is still incomplete.</p><p>The FEL presented here is undoubtedly an approximation of the actual FEL of the proteasome. Results in future studies may identify additional mechanisms, such as allosteric effects, to increase the accuracy of the simulated ATPase dynamics. As one example of the results that are not well recapitulated by the current model, protein substrates and ubiquitin chains activate the ATPase activity of the proteasome by ~2-fold, larger than the predicted 9% increase by the FEL model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Peth et al., 2013a</xref>). This activation step may be independent of the processive translocation phase described by the FEL model, and may involve a transition from the resting to translocating states of the proteasome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bard et al., 2019</xref>). In the E<sub>A</sub> states of the proteasome, all ATPases bind nucleotides, suggesting that the disengaged subunit in the resting states may have higher nucleotide affinity than the disengaged ones in the translocating states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dong et al., 2019</xref>). This high affinity may limit nucleotide turnover in the resting states. Similarly, our model may not accurately describe the behaviors of substrates whose degradation is limited by steps other than translocation, such as the DHFR-containing substrates in this study. Extending the FEL model to cover such substrates may reveal other important aspects of the proteasome’s activities.</p><p>We expect this FEL approach to have many applications in guiding the experimental design and data analysis, and to provide valuable insights into the mechanism of proteasomal ATPases and other AAA machines.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom">Reagent type (species) or <break/>resource</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Designation</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Source or reference</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Identifiers</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Recombinant <break/>DNA reagent</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">pT7-CyclnB-iRFP (plasmid)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">This study</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">pLM254</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">For expressing cyclinB-iRFP(available upon request)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Recombinant <break/>DNA reagent</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">pT7-cyclinB-DHFR-iRFP (plasmid)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">This study</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">pLM428</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">For expressing cyclinB-DHFR-iRFP(available upon request)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Recombinant <break/>DNA reagent</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">pT7-cyclinB-iRFP-DHFR (plasmid)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">This study</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">pLM429</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">For expressing cyclinB-iRFP-DHFR(available upon request)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Recombinant <break/>DNA reagent</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">pT7-cyclinB (K18, 36, 64) (plasmid)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">This study</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">pLM120</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">For expressing cyclinB (K18, 36, 64)(available upon request)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Peptide, <break/>recombinant <break/>protein</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Dylight550-Ubiquitin</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lu et al., 2015</xref>;

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by David Ron as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Gregory R Bowman (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>All three referees felt that the paper is extremely technical and difficult to follow for those who are not computationalists or steeped in the minutia of AAA+ unfoldases. They also noted that it is unclear how the findings advance the conceptual or mechanistic understanding of AAA+ unfoldases beyond what is currently accepted in the field. These criticisms were counter-balanced by a sense that there is novelty and impact in the findings that have the potential for broad appeal. In addition to the specific comments noted below, the general writing and organization of the manuscript need to be substantially improve to more clearly describe the computational approach and the data analysis, and to better frame the explanatory power, impact and novelty of the results.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Page 6 and methods.

For example, the authors ignore states with more than 3 open interfaces. Presumably they are present, but I expect at much lower probabilities. Could the authors comment on how much lower probability these conformations would have than those included in the model, and how reasonable ignoring them is on that basis?

I think an exhaustive study is beyond the scope of this work, but I would be curious to see a little bit of data. For example, would the depiction in Figure 6 look more or less the same if each interface had a different energetic separation between the open/closed states? E.g. I could imagine having a different e_b parameter for each interface, where each is chosen by multiplying the constant used so far by a random factor between 0.5 and 2. It should be easy to do this many times. Ideally the authors could make a statistical statement on how sensitive the topology is across this distribution of models, but even showing some examples to give a qualitative sense of the variability in an SI figure would probably be sufficient for this first paper.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.71911.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>All three referees felt that the paper is extremely technical and difficult to follow for those who are not computationalists or steeped in the minutia of AAA+ unfoldases.

This may have created difficulties in understanding our work. While some technical terms may be necessary, we replaced them with nontechnical language as far as possible without compromising accuracy. In this revision, we:</p><p>– Substantially rewrote the introduction to include a non-technical summary of the work.</p><p>– Updated Figure 4-Figure supp. 1 (previously S7) to include the workflow of the entire study, including the key observations and measurements for model construction, the experimental validations of the predictions and the major insights into the mechanism of proteasomal ATPases. This should improve the communication of the logic and the structure of this work.</p><p>– Improved the structure of the writing, especially in section II. We use the starting sentence of each paragraph to summarize the main results and conclusions, so that readers can understand the main thrust of the discussion without reading every detail.</p><p>– Substantially rewrote the Discussion to better frame the novelty and contribution of this study. Major biological insights are emphasized and discussed. We also better discussed the caveats of this method.</p><p>– Attempted to clarify points that caused confusion.</p><p>– Updated Figure 2, Figure 3, Figure 6 and Figure 2-Figure supp. 2 (previously S4) according to the suggestions.</p><p>A major contribution of our study is demonstrating the feasibility of performing a meaningful simulation of the dynamics of a large ATPase system in a biologically-relevant time scale. Therefore, most of the manuscript is dedicated to introducing the FEL-based simulation approach and validating the predictions. Due to limitations in the allowed length of the manuscript, we are only able to elaborate on the most important biological insights that have not been identified previously in the proteasome system. The model and the simulated dynamics carry insights that are not discussed in the manuscript. One example is the results from the analysis suggested by reviewer #3. We will make the computational code available and easy to execute, so that readers can explore the full potential of the model.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>Page 6 and methods. Is it legitimate to exclude the chemical energy of ATP from the calculations?</p></disp-quote><p>The FEL model does not force any coupling between nucleotide and conformation, so that the nucleotide status is stable during an instantaneous change of the ATPase conformation. The rate of a conformational transition depends only on the free energy difference but not on the absolute free energy values (See Methods). Therefore, whether we include the chemical-energy term or not does not affect the simulation results. Nucleotide cycles are described by rate equations, which also do not require a chemical-energy term.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>P. 7. Concerning the statement &quot;…we made the simplifying assumption that all six ATPases share an identical set of parameters. This assumption does not contradict the experimental finding of functional disparity among the six ATPases&quot;. What is the evidence for this claim?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for pointing out this awkwardly-worded sentence. We reworded this part to clarify. Essentially, we find that a model using the same parameters for all 6 ATPases can nevertheless recapitulate the degradation kinetics, the asymmetric cryo-EM occupancies and effects of Walker-B mutations. This approximation is also technically important to avoid overinterpretation, because incorporating Lid-ATP interaction requires only one more parameter and in contrast 18 more parameters are required to describe the ATPases’ differences. We therefore believe that this approximation is useful. Please note that we are not saying that the parameters are <italic>actually</italic> identical for the six ATPases (which of course is unlikely). All we are saying is that any parameter difference between the ATPases turns out to be unimportant in this context. We are aware that there are published results reporting functional asymmetry of these ATPases in the presence of other mutations e.g. Walker-A or pore loops. Due to the known proteasome assembly defects of these mutants or ambiguity of mapping a mutation to the model, we are unable to clearly evaluate the model in these contexts. We discuss this question in the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Many parts of section II are dense with jargon and difficult to follow for the non-specialist. The language of this section should be simplified and clarified. Blanket statements and assumptions need to be accompanied with supporting evidence and arguments.</p></disp-quote><p>We hope that the writing in section II is now substantially improved. We specifically clarified the basis for each statement by citing a published result or an observation in this study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>P. 7 and Figure 3B. There is ample evidence of cooperativity between nucleotide and substrate binding throughout AAA+ ATPases; i.e., the presence of peptide can alter the affinity for ATP and ADP and vice versa. However, it appears that the measurement of the nucleotide binding affinities was carried out using substrate-free (no peptide) proteosomes. How can the authors know that the values they obtained are relevant to when the ATPases are in a translocation state? And if these values are critical for estimating bridge energies, how can one be sure that these estimations have not thus been miscalculated?</p></disp-quote><p>The general consistency between the model predictions and experimental results (degradation kinetic and etc. ) supports the relevance of these affinity constants. The model has nine parameters, three of which are directly related to these affinity constants. Significant deviation from the actual values is unlikely to yield predictions that are consistent with the experiments (Figure 5-Figure supp. 5). While it is possible that these three parameters change when the proteasome moves into the translocation state, we nevertheless observe good agreement between model predictions and experimental observations. This indicates that the parameters we derived from observations of the substrate-free proteasome are close approximations to the true values. Undoubtedly, the model will be improved in the future by the incorporation of more specific measurements of affinity constants of each pocket.</p><p>Structural comparisons show that there is no significant change of the nucleotide pocket geometry between the resting and translocating states, indicating that the current affinity measurement should be a good approximation of the actual values. To test this, we analyzed the nucleotide-pocket geometries in the cryo-EM structures either with or without substrate peptide in the ATPase channel, and compared these geometries in Figure 2- figure supp. 2. While nucleotide-bound and unbound pockets are clearly different, we do not observe any significant change caused by substrate among pockets with the same nucleotide status.</p><p>Please note that the current model does not necessarily contradict the general observation that substrate may alter nucleotide affinity, because a higher rate of nucleotide turnover can be caused by accelerated ATPases dynamics in the presence of substrate. The current affinity measurement is an equilibrium method requiring ADP or ATP-γS and no substrate, which greatly simplifies data interpretation. How substrate leads to accelerated ATPase dynamics is unclear and is beyond the scope of the current study. In our model, efficient nucleotide turnover requires disengaged ATPases that have low affinity for nucleotides. We speculated in Discussion that the disengaged ATPases in the translocating states may have lower nucleotide affinity than the disengaged ones in the resting states, which may lead to a higher rate of nucleotide turnover in the presence of substrate.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 2C.

Is there a counterargument for this concern?</p></disp-quote><p>As mentioned in the manuscript, the model does not force any coupling between nucleotide and conformation, and therefore, is unbiased in this sense. The concern may come from the fact we use structural information to build the model. As summarized in Figure 4-Figure supp. 1, we only extracted a few simple rules from these cryo-EM structures, without referring to any particular state. Any single state, such as ED1 or ED2, in the cryo-EM dataset can be omitted from the analysis and essentially the same model and predictions would result.</p><p>The energy landscape we give in Figure 2C is only an example: we could have used any nucleotide state in this example. The reason we chose the same nucleotide state as in the ED1 state was to allow comparison with structural observations. Although all possible combinations of nucleotide and conformation are allowed in the model, the fact that the energy-minimum ATPase conformation at the nucleotide status “TDETTT” is identical to the ED1 conformation in fact supports the FEL model, and may explain the coincidence of this ATPase conformation and the “TDETTT” status in the previous structural study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 3.

Without describing the FEL model in detail, the data interpretation and mechanistic insights are not possible to assess. Therefore, we devoted a significant part of the manuscript to establishing and validating the FEL model, leaving less room for biological implications than would be ideal. We have done our best to simplify and streamline the presentation in this revised manuscript, as described at the beginning of this letter.</p><p>In this paper we show that the FEL model provides a clear and unified mechanistic interpretation that is compatible with experimental observations and rooted in fundamental physical/chemical processes. Certainly, the model has caveats that may lead to alternative interpretations of some results. In our revision we substantially expanded the discussion about the limitations of this model and offered alternative interpretations of the results affected by the limitations. We list the main biological insights that may interest proteasome biologists:</p><p>– A transition sequence of the ATPase conformation during substrate translocation (Figure 6A, B), which is compatible with both the cryo-EM structures and the kinetic results in this and previous studies. This transition sequence is different from the previous sequential model, the only previous model (to our knowledge) that has been proposed for the proteasome.</p><p>– An explanation for the cooperative mechanism of the ATPase subunits. The FEL model suggests that the proteasome has a unique energy-minimum conformation for each typical nucleotide-bound status. This uniqueness leads to high ATPase cooperativity because it entails define transitions of the ATPases’ conformation at the change of nucleotide status. This is the first plausible explanation of the cooperativity between these ATPases, to our knowledge.</p><p>– An explanation for the differences between these ATPases in functional studies. Our study suggests that the Lid-ATPase interaction alters the ATPase dynamics, giving rise to predictions that are consistent with conformational occupancies of both WT proteasome and the Walker-B mutants and are also qualitatively consistent with the growth phenotypes due to Walker-B mutations. Previous interpretations often invoke intrinsic differences between the six ATPases. However, the contribution or phenotype of each ATPase often varies significantly in different assays, leading to no consistent interpretation of the symmetry-breaking mechanism. Please note that this result does not dismiss the possibility that there are in fact intrinsic differences among these ATPases – we simply argue that such differences are not required to explain the phenotypes observed. Future studies may identify phenotypes that can only be explained by incorporating the intrinsic differences among the ATPases in the FEL model.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>I expect other high energy states are present (and may even be important) but have low enough probability that this model still performs well.

We removed all these constraints in a modified model designated model 1<bold>.</bold> We went through the same process of reevaluating the three translocation-related parameters in model 1. As the reviewer suggested, allowing these high-energy states does not significantly change the steady-state conformational distribution. The occupancy of these high-energy states is also very small, in total less than 5% (Author response image 1). The most populated conformation is the 3+3 (two 3xATPase staircases, separated by open interfaces), which represents 2.3% of the conformations in model 1.</p><fig id="sa2fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Testing alternative FEL models.</title><p>(A) Steady-state occupancies for different conformations.

Interestingly, it failed to quantitatively recapitulate the translocation measurements, although the trend remains.

Next, we developed a new modified model excluding only the 3+3 conformation model 2. Model 2 recapitulates the experimental measurements similarly to model 0 (Author response image 1).
