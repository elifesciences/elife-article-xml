activity, the consequent increase in energy demand can be met by the coordinated activation of glycolysis, the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, and oxidative phosphorylation. However, the trigger for glycolytic activation is unknown and the role for Ca<sup>2+</sup> in the mitochondrial responses has been debated. Using genetically encoded fluorescent biosensors and NAD(P)H autofluorescence imaging in acute hippocampal slices, here we find that Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake into the mitochondria is responsible for the buildup of mitochondrial NADH, probably through Ca<sup>2+</sup> activation of dehydrogenases in the TCA cycle. In the cytosol, we do not observe a role for the Ca<sup>2+</sup>/calmodulin signaling pathway, or AMPK, in mediating the rise in glycolytic NADH in response to acute stimulation. Aerobic glycolysis in neurons is triggered mainly by the energy demand resulting from either Na<sup>+</sup> or Ca<sup>2+</sup> extrusion, and in mouse dentate granule cells, Ca<sup>2+</sup> creates the majority of this demand.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>neuronal glycolysis</kwd><kwd>mitochondrial calcium</kwd><kwd>mitochondrial calcium uniporter</kwd><kwd>brain metabolism</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 NS102586</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yellen</surname><given-names>Gary</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 GM124038</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yellen</surname><given-names>Gary</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000052</institution-id><institution>NIH Office of the Director</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DP1 EB016986</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yellen</surname><given-names>Gary</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>F32 NS100331</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Díaz-García</surname><given-names>Carlos Manlio</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>F32116105</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Meyer</surname><given-names>Dylan J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100009345</institution-id><institution>Department of Neurobiology, Harvard Medical School</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Fix Fund Postdoctoral Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Díaz-García</surname><given-names>Carlos Manlio</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100009345</institution-id><institution>Department of Neurobiology, Harvard Medical School</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Mahoney Postdoctoral Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Meyer</surname><given-names>Dylan J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>When neurons are stimulated, calcium entry into mitochondria upregulates mitochondrial energy production, but glycolytic energy production in the cytosol is stimulated by elevated energy demand, not Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Energy demand in neurons is proportional to the frequency of action potentials, which can increase dramatically upon neuronal stimulation. During neuronal activity, Na<sup>+</sup> and Ca<sup>2+</sup> enter the cell via specific voltage-gated ion channels in the plasma membrane. This, in turn, accelerates Na<sup>+</sup> and Ca<sup>2+</sup> pumping and leads to higher ATP consumption, which is replenished by oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) and glycolysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Attwell and Laughlin, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib122">Yu et al., 2018</xref>). However, whether the upregulation of ATP synthesis is provoked simply by the degradation of ATP (and increases in ADP), or by a feedforward signal such as elevation of intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> or AMP, is still not fully understood. (AMP can act as a feedforward signal via AMPK activation [(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Herzig and Shaw, 2018</xref>)], or, like ADP, it can directly activate the glycolytic enzyme phosphofructokinase [(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Passonneau and Lowry, 1962</xref>)].)</p><p>Both as an energy burden and as a feedforward signal, intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> is a strong candidate for coordinating the fast-metabolic responses to increased neuronal activity. Calcium handling is metabolically expensive and compartmentalized, involving several transporters at the plasma membrane and the endoplasmic reticulum. In addition, Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake into the mitochondria can directly dissipate the mitochondrial membrane potential (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Duchen, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Berndt et al., 2015</xref>) and increase OXPHOS while activating several dehydrogenases in the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Denton et al., 1972</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Denton et al., 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">McCormack and Denton, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Denton, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib114">Wescott et al., 2019</xref>).

Since NADH production in the cytosol is also increased upon acute neuronal stimulation, we tested if several Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling pathways, or Ca<sup>2+</sup> itself, were necessary for this response.

To monitor the metabolic changes that occur in response to neuronal stimulation, we measured the NADH/NAD<sup>+</sup> ratio in the cytosol using Peredox (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Hung et al., 2011</xref>), which reflects the overall activity of glycolysis. We also imaged mitochondrial NADH in a population of dentate granule cells (DGCs) of the mouse hippocampus using UV-excited autofluorescence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Chance et al., 1962</xref>). This is known as the NAD(P)H signal because of a small contribution of the spectrally indistinguishable cofactor NADPH. In neurons, this signal is thought to predominantly reflect NADH changes in the mitochondria, because both the NADH concentration and the fraction of brighter protein-bound NADH, are higher in the mitochondrial matrix compared to the cytosol (reviewed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Kann and Kovács, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Shuttleworth, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib120">Yellen, 2018</xref>).

Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry through the voltage-activated Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels (Ca<sub>V</sub>) can lead to ATP hydrolysis by two different pathways: it can activate the plasma membrane Ca<sup>2+</sup> pump/ATPase (PMCA), or the Na<sup>+</sup>,Ca<sup>2+</sup> exchange transporter (NCX) can pump the Ca<sup>2+</sup> out in exchange for Na<sup>+</sup>, leading to increased Na<sup>+</sup> pumping through the Na<sup>+</sup>,K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase. ADP produced from any of these ATP hydrolysis reactions can affect glycolysis either by altering the mass action ratio for the phosphoglycerate kinase reaction or by allosteric effects (for instance, on phosphofructokinase; references in the main text).

Therefore, we first tested whether the NADH signals in the cytosol could occur independently from the responses in the mitochondria.</p><p>The production of NADH in the mitochondria is preferentially fueled by pyruvate, which can be produced either from glycolysis or from lactate re-oxidation (via the lactate dehydrogenase reaction). Pyruvate is transported into the mitochondria via the mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (MPC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Bricker et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Herzig et al., 2012</xref>), where it is converted to acetyl-CoA by the enzyme pyruvate dehydrogenase and then further catabolized in the TCA cycle. We hypothesized that by inhibiting the MPC, pyruvate should fail to enter mitochondria and fuel the TCA cycle, and, as a result, the mitochondrial NAD(P)H signals (but not glycolysis) should be attenuated and pyruvate should accumulate in the cytosol.</p><p>We first confirmed that MPC inhibition leads to cytosolic pyruvate accumulation by expressing the pyruvate-sensitive FRET sensor Pyronic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">San Martín et al., 2014</xref>) in the cytosol of DGCs.

Using this manipulation, we tested the independence of the cytosolic NADH transient. We co-expressed the genetically encoded biosensors Peredox and RCaMP1h to monitor the cytosolic NADH/NAD<sup>+</sup> ratio and the Ca<sup>2+</sup> level, respectively, in individual DGCs.

As previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Díaz-García et al., 2017</xref>), antidromically stimulating DGCs induced a fast spike in RCaMP1h fluorescence lifetime and a slower increase in Peredox lifetime, consistent with a transient buildup of the NADH/NAD<sup>+</sup> ratio in the cytosol (NADH<sub>CYT</sub>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref> Left, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4</xref>). This reflects an increase in glycolytic NADH production in the cytosol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Díaz-García et al., 2017</xref>). The cytosolic NADH/NAD<sup>+</sup> ratio, however, was not immune to MPC inhibition.</p><p>After MPC inhibition, there was reduction but not abolition of the NADH<sub>CYT</sub> transients: baseline Peredox lifetime decreased by 3.4 ± 1.6% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4</xref>) and the magnitude of the NADH<sub>CYT</sub> transients (expressed as the ΔPeredox/ΔRCaMP lifetime ratio) was attenuated by almost 40% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref> Right), but far less than the ~7-fold reduction in the mitochondrial overshoot transient. Are the reduced transients evidence that cytosolic and mitochondrial NADH responses to stimulation are inextricably connected? Not necessarily: an alternative explanation is that by accumulating pyruvate in the cytosol, MPC inhibition indirectly drives increased NADH re-oxidation via the LDH reaction. Indeed, in the continuous presence of an LDH inhibitor to oppose the pyruvate-driven re-oxidation, further application of UK5099 did not change the magnitude of the NADH<sub>CYT</sub> transient in response to stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5">Figure 2—figure supplement 5</xref>). This result indicates that the stimulation-induced acceleration of neuronal glycolysis, as detected by NADH production in the cytosol, is not affected by impaired NADH production in the mitochondria. MPC inhibition still abolished the mitochondrial NAD(P)H transients in the presence of the LDH inhibitor, by about 8-fold (similar to the effect without LDH inhibition; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2e</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s6">Figure 2—figure supplement 6</xref>).

In addition, this coupling might require a relatively calmodulin-insensitive isoform like PMCA2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Elwess et al., 1997</xref>; reviewed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Brini et al., 2013</xref>), which would be consistent with the preservation of the NADH<sub>CYT</sub> transient after the application of calmidazolium, a drug that delays Ca<sup>2+</sup> clearance through PMCAs as a result of inhibiting calmodulin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Markram et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Scheuss et al., 2006</xref>). However, although Ca<sup>2+</sup> ATPases typically present a higher affinity for Ca<sup>2+</sup> when compared to the Na<sup>+</sup>/Ca<sup>2+</sup> exchanger, they also exhibit a lower turnover rate, so their contribution to Ca<sup>2+</sup> extrusion would depend on the density and localization of transporters in the membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Blaustein and Lederer, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Brini and Carafoli, 2011</xref>), and likely on the strength of stimulation as well.</p><p>Future work is required to identify the precise routes of Ca<sup>2+</sup> extrusion coupled to neuronal glycolysis and to fully understand the biological significance of this process. Glycolysis may provide a fast and localized ATP supply via the phosphoglycerate kinase and pyruvate kinase reactions near the site of high energy demand, as well as additional ATP production from the oxidation of reducing equivalents shuttled into the mitochondria. In addition, the GAPDH-derived NADH<sub>CYT</sub> transients may also reflect some contribution from the pentose phosphate pathway since some intermediates can be re-introduced into the glycolytic pathway, thus providing the much needed antioxidant capacity for neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Herrero-Mendez et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>In summary, our work provides novel evidence on how neurons cope with moment-to-moment energy demands during bouts of action potentials, highlighting the different roles of Ca<sup>2+</sup> in coordinating increases in the TCA cycle and glycolysis. Considering the differences in morphology, Ca<sup>2+</sup> buffering capacity, ion channels, and other cellular components, we anticipate variations in the metabolic responses—and their regulation—in small compartments (e.g. dendrites/spines and axons/synaptic terminals), as well as in different cell-types in the brain (e.g. interneurons and astrocytes).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Reagent type (species) or resource</th><th valign="top">Designation</th><th valign="top">Source or reference</th><th valign="top">Identifiers</th><th valign="top">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Chemical compound, drug</td><td valign="top">NBQX (6-Nitro-7-sulfamoylbenzo[f]quinoxaline-2,3-dione, Disodium Salt)</td><td valign="top">Toronto Research Chemicals</td><td valign="top">Cat#N550005;

A different slicing solution was used for 2–4 months-old adult mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">Ting et al., 2014</xref>), consisting of (mM): 93 N-Methyl-D-Glucamine, 2.5 KCl, 1.2 NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 30 NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 20 HEPES, 10 MgSO<sub>4</sub>, 0.5 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 25 D-glucose, 5 sodium ascorbate, 2 thiourea, 3 sodium pyruvate (~310 mOsm/kg; pH 7.4 adjusted with HCl).</p><p>Brains were glued by the dorsal side on a specimen tube holder and embedded in warm PBS with 2% low-melting agarose. The agarose was quickly congealed using a chilling block. The specimen tube was inserted in a chamber containing the same slicing solution (previously oxygenated) and horizontal slices were cut at a thickness of 275 µm using a Compresstome slicer (VF-300-0Z, Precisionary, Natick, MA). Alternatively, brains were glued by the dorsal side in a chamber containing the same slicing solution and horizontal slices were cut at a thickness of 275 µm using a vibrating slicer (7000smz-2, Campden Instruments, Loughborough, England).</p><p>Slices were immediately transferred to a chamber filled with artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF) at 37°C, containing (in mM): 120 NaCl, 2.5 KCl, 1 NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 26 NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 2 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, and 10 D-glucose (~290 mOsm/kg). All solutions were continuously bubbled with a mix of 95% O<sub>2</sub> and 5% CO<sub>2</sub>, for adequate oxygenation and pH buffering around 7.4. Slices were incubated at 37°C for 35 min and then at room temperature for at least 30 min before the experiments, which were executed in the next 5 hr after slicing.</p><p>The Ca<sup>2+</sup>-free ACSF contained (in mM): 120 NaCl, 2.5 KCl, 1 NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 26 NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 1 EGTA, 4.38 MgCl<sub>2</sub> (~4.1 free) and 10 D-glucose. In these experiments, the control solution was modified to include EGTA, as follows (in mM): 120 NaCl, 2.5 KCl, 1 NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 26 NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 1 EGTA, 3 CaCl<sub>2</sub> (~2 free as in regular ACSF), 1 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, and 10 D-glucose.

The solution was maintained at 33–34°C using inline heaters (Warner Instruments, Hamden, CT) or custom-made heaters. To prevent degassing in perfusion line, solutions were preheated at 38°C in a waterless bead bath (Cole-Parmer, Vernon Hills, IL) for 2p-FLIM experiments, or in water bath (VWR) for autofluorescence experiments.</p><p>DGCs were stimulated with a concentric bipolar electrode CBBEC75 (FHC, Bowdoin, ME) placed in the hilus. During the experiments, the ACSF contained NBQX (5 µM), D-AP5 (25 µM), and picrotoxin (100 µM) to block synaptic activity. Stimulation was delivered in trains of 25–200 brief (0.1 ms) pulses at a frequency of 50 Hz, using an A360 stimulus isolation unit (WPI, Sarasota, FL). The stimulation intensity was adjusted to reliably evoke spike activity, which typically ranged from 750—1500 µA for antidromic stimulation (in autofluorescence experiments, the stimulation intensity was always set at 1000 µA).</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Two-photon fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy</title><p>Lifetime imaging data were acquired with a modified Thorlabs Bergamo II microscope (Thorlabs Imaging Systems, Sterling, VA), with hybrid photodetectors R11322U-40 (Hamamatsu Photonics, Shizuoka, Japan); the light source was a Chameleon Vision-S tunable Ti-Sapphire mode-locked laser (80 MHz,~75 fs; Coherent, Santa Clara, CA). The objective lens used for brain slice imaging was an Olympus LUMPLFLN 60x/W (NA 1.0). An excitation wavelength of 790 nm was used for the Peredox and RCaMP sensors. Fluorescence emission light was split with an FF562-Di03 dichroic mirror and bandpass filtered for green (FF01-525/50) and red (FF01-641/75) channels (all filter optics from Semrock, Rochester, NY). For the Pyronic sensor, excitation was at 850 nm, and emission light was split with an FF506-Di03 dichroic mirror and bandpass filtered for CFP (FF01-475/35) and YFP (FF01-542/27) channels. The photodetector signals and laser sync signals were preamplified and then digitized at 1.25 gigasamples per second using a field programmable gate array board (PC720 with FMC125 and FMC122 modules, 4DSP, Austin, TX).</p><p>Laboratory-built firmware and software performed time-correlated single photon counting to determine the arrival time of each photon relative to the laser pulse; the distribution of these arrival times indicates the fluorescence lifetime (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib121">Yellen and Mongeon, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Mongeon et al., 2016</xref>). Lifetime histograms were fitted using nonlinear least-squares fitting in MATLAB (Mathworks, Natick, MA), with a two-exponential decay convolved with a Gaussian for the impulse response function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib119">Yasuda et al., 2006</xref>). Microscope control and image acquisition were performed by a modified version of the ScanImage software written in MATLAB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Pologruto et al., 2003</xref>; provided by B. Sabatini and modified by G.Y.).</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Lifetime imaging quantification</title><p>Image analysis was performed using MATLAB software developed in our laboratory. Regions of interest (ROIs) were defined around individual cells, and photon statistics were calculated for all pixels within the ROI. Typical ROIs encompassed 100–900 pixels, in images of 128 × 128 pixels acquired at a scanning rate of 2 ms per line. Lifetime values were calculated as a standardized ‘tau8’ value, which minimizes the variability of the fits by restricting the averaging to the approximate time window of the actual data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Díaz-García et al., 2019</xref>). Most data points in the time series plots of lifetimes are for the mean value of 20 sequentially acquired frames, except that for RCaMP1h (Calcium) data in the 10 s after stimulation, the data points represent individual frames.</p><p>Bleedthrough of green Peredox fluorescence into the red RCaMP optical channel was corrected using the ratio of measured red to green fluorescence observed when only Peredox was expressed, approximately 6.0% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Díaz-García et al., 2017</xref>). Similarly, RCaMP1h expression alone led to some signal in the green optical channel, probably due to an immature fluorophore, in direct experiments approximately 4.4% of the red fluorescence intensity, and having a tau8 of ~0.675 ns; these values were used to correct the baseline in dual expression experiments.</p><p>Neurons with sudden and irreversible increases in the baseline lifetime of RCaMP or Peredox were excluded from the analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Widefield fluorescence microscopy and electrical stimulation</title><p>Autofluorescence signals in brain slices (also expressing a red Ca<sup>2+</sup> biosensor, RCaMP1h or mito-RCaMP1h) were visualized with an Olympus BX51WI upright microscope using an LUMPlanFl/IR 60x/0.90W objective. The excitation light was delivered by an AURA light engine (Lumencor, Beaverton, OR) at 365, 480 and 575 nm to excite NAD(P)H, FAD<sup>+</sup> and the red Ca<sup>2+</sup> biosensor, respectively. The times of exposure were 100 ms (excitation at 365 nm), 50—85 ms (excitation at 480 nm), and 5—85 ms (excitation at 575 ms). The fluorescence emission light was split with an FF395/495/610-Di01 dichroic mirror and bandpass filtered with an FF01-425/527/685 filter (all filter optics from Semrock, Rochester, NY). Images were collected with a CCD camera (IMAGO-QE, Thermo Fisher Scientific), at a rate of 1 frame every two seconds in non-stimulated conditions, alternating the excitation wavelengths in each frame. During the fast response to stimulation, the acquisition rate was temporarily increased to six frames per second, for a total duration of 10 s (starting 2 s prior to each stimulation), and then returned to the initial lower frequency acquisition rate. Image acquisition and analysis was performed using laboratory-built software written in MATLAB (Mathworks, Natick, MA). This software communicated with an electrophysiology setup by sending an external trigger to a protocol written in pClamp 10 (Molecular Devices, San Jose, CA), which in turn controlled a A360 stimulus isolation unit (WPI, Sarasota, FL) via a Digidata 1321A digitizer (Molecular Devices, San Jose, CA). In pilot experiments, some recordings of local field potentials in the DGC layer were collected and amplified via a Multiclamp 700B (Molecular Devices, San Jose, CA) to confirm the stimulation, but they were not performed routinely in subsequent experiments.</p><p>For analysis, the DGC layer was identified in an image obtained with transmitted light, and an ROI was drawn around the somata. Typical ROIs encompassed 4000–4500 pixels, in images of 172 × 130 pixels acquired at 16 bits per pixel and a binning of 8. The average fluorescence (as Arbitrary Units; A.U.) per pixel was calculated in each ROI (A.U./px), as well as the relative fluorescence intensity changes (ΔF/F).</p><p>Unlike many stimulation paradigms used for recording autofluorescence signals in brain slices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Shuttleworth et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Brennan et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Brennan et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Ivanov et al., 2014</xref>), ours prevented the signaling through ionotropic receptors by direct electrical stimulation of the axons and the inclusion of synaptic blockers in the ACSF. Therefore, we measured signals in response to backpropagating action potentials in the somata. By limiting our analysis to the DGC layer, we minimized the contribution of astrocytes to these signals: this region in the dentate gyrus is densely packed with neurons, and its neuron-to-astrocytes ratio is higher than the average value for the whole hippocampus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Lana et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Keller et al., 2018</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Extracellular O<sub>2</sub> recordings</title><p>These measurements were executed simultaneously with the imaging of the autofluorescence signals. The Clark type oxygen glass microsensors, with tip diameters of 10 or 25 µm (Unisense, Aarhus, Denmark), were pre-polarized overnight for the initial calibration, which was performed in ACSF saturated with 20% or 95% O<sub>2</sub>, and an anoxic solution of 0.1 M sodium ascorbate and 0.1M NaOH (following the manufacturer instructions). Subsequent calibrations were performed at least once a week using two points: zero (anoxic solution) and 20% O<sub>2</sub> in ACSF, both at 33–34°C. For routine calibrations, the pre-polarization times ranged between 1 and 2 hr, or until the signal was stable for 10 min. The microelectrode was connected to an OXY-Meter amplifier (Unisense, Aarhus, Denmark), and the signal acquired with the Sensor Trace software (Unisense, Aarhus, Denmark) at a rate of 1 Hz. The microsensor tip was inserted ~140 µm into the slice, in the DGC layer, and the signal was calibrated and expressed as [O<sub>2</sub>] in µM. The data was exported to an Excel file, and then analyzed offline using laboratory-built software written in MATLAB (Mathworks, Natick, MA). Interpretation of the O<sub>2</sub> changes in terms of ATP synthesis are made with the assumption that the proton leak across the mitochondrial membrane (independent of ATP synthesis and Ca<sup>2+</sup> pumping) is unchanged.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad InStat v3.06 (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA). Data were tested for normality with a Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. If the data did not fulfill all the assumptions for parametric tests (paired or unpaired Student’s t-test, one-way or repeated measures ANOVA with a Student-Newman-Keuls post-test), an equivalent non-parametric test was used. For comparisons of two populations with normal distributions but different SDs, a Welch’s t-test was used. The alternatives used in this study were: the Mann-Whitney test (for unpaired comparisons between two groups), the Wilcoxon matched pairs test (similar but for paired comparisons), the Kruskal-Wallis test (for multiple comparisons) and the Friedman test for repeated measures, with a Dunn’s post test. The selected tests and post-tests, as well as the descriptive statistics, are indicated in the figure legends and throughout the manuscript.

The median of the distribution is represented by a horizontal line inside the box, and the mean is represented by a cross symbol (×).</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank the members of the Yellen laboratory for valuable discussions, and to Hannah Zucker for technical assistance.

Using acute hippocampal slices as an experimental model, an appropriate ensemble of genetic and pharmacological tools, and NADH- and Ca<sup>2+</sup>-indicators as readouts of metabolic activity and activation status, respectively, these authors found that NADH signals in the cytosol occur independently of those in mitochondria. Using mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> uniporter (MCU)-knockout mice, they further demonstrated a direct role for mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> in driving TCA metabolism. However, they found no evidence for a role for Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent signaling in driving glycolysis in the cytoplasm. Instead, they propose that the trigger for glycolytic activation in response to neuronal activity is enhanced energy demand resulting from the ATP-dependent operation of surface membrane Ca<sup>2+</sup> (and Na<sup>+</sup>) extrusion mechanisms. On the basis of these basic relationships, they conclude that Ca<sup>2+</sup> plays distinct roles in the rapid control of neuronal glycolysis and the mitochondrial TCA cycle.</p><p>The results convincingly demonstrate that energetic responses to neuronal activation in the cytoplasm and mitochondria are independent of each other and that mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> is important in TCA cycle activation. They are also consistent with the conclusion that the energy required to pump Ca<sup>2+</sup> and Na<sup>+</sup> out of the cell ultimately drives glycolysis.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Figure 1B legend. Please provide a more complete description of this experiment. The bottom trace shows the Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal so that should be stated in the legend and the exact time of the train of pulses is not shown so it's timing relative to the RCAMP signal should be indicated. Also, there should be a very brief description of the meaning of fluorescence lifetime. I was familiar with this measurement from previous Yellen reports but some readers may not be.</p><p>2) Subsection “Calcium entry into mitochondria is required for strong activation of TCA metabolism”. Based on the results in Figure 2A the loss of MCU seems to be having a specific effect. The magnitude of the initial Ca<sup>2+</sup> increase in response to stimulation seems to be about the same with and without MCU, but without MCU the influx is not sustained. (I think they discuss later that this may be a non-MCU mechanism of Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx but some comment should be made about this here). Also, the initial baseline (AU per px) is higher in the MCU knockdown neurons – is that just variation or does it reflect a higher resting Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration in the matrix?</p><p>3) In Figure 2A Ca<sup>2+</sup> is measured as AU/px not in lifetime, but in panel C the cytosolic Ca is reported in lifetime units. Please comment on why this was done and how that affects the significance and quality of the data and interpretation of the different types of experiments.</p><p>4) In Figure 2B – 50% decay times are reported. Is that 50% of the initial spike of Ca? Or is it from a curve fitting to what appears to be a normal exponential decay curve that occurs following the spike. In other words is the decay of mitochondrial Ca biphasic and if so shouldn't both two time constants and their relative contributions be reported?</p><p>5) In the MCU knockdown mitochondrial NADP(H) signals in Figure 2A the oxidative transients seem smaller than in the controls. That does not seem representative based on Figure 2—figure supplement 3. To avoid confusion would it be possible to use a more representative experiment for Figure 2A?</p><p>6) Subsection “Calcium entry into mitochondria is required for strong activation of TCA metabolism”. I think there should also be some discussion of AGC1 activity being stimulated directly by cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup>. This is mentioned briefly later in the Discussion but it seems like it could be a significant factor in these studies and in their interpretation.</p><p>7) Subsection “Energy demand from Na<sup>+</sup> or Ca<sup>2+</sup> pumping triggers aerobic glycolysis”. Adding strophanthidin in the zero Ca<sup>2+</sup> shows that ATP consumption stimulates GAPDH activity. However, wouldn't it be also worthwhile to determine if strophanthidin also blocks the cytosolic NADH increase triggered by stimulation when Ca<sup>2+</sup> is present? In other words can the authors address whether Ca<sup>2+</sup> does or does not contribute to accelerated glycolysis (independently of increased energy demand)?</p><p>8) Discussion. Please address here whether or not Ca<sup>2+</sup> regulation of AGC1 (i.e. enhanced MAS activity) also could contribute to elevated NADH in the matrix. (this is a reiteration of my comment #6).</p><p>9) Discussion: Is the &quot;rapid dip&quot; blocked by strophanthidin?</p><p>10) The data presented show that Ca<sup>2+</sup> is little more than a bystander in the regulation of glycolysis. The &quot;distinct roles&quot; formulation of the paper needs to be walked back.</p><p>11) A scheme showing the biochemical linkages and cell-biological relationships (subcellular compartments, etc) under consideration is necessary. Readers should not be made to forage through biochemistry texts and online resources to make sense of the basic questions a paper is attempting to address.</p><p>12) It is important to know the extent of MCU protein depletion; but it is acknowledged that this may be technically difficult. Have all the options been exhausted? Because the extent of MCU depletion is not known, references to possible non-uniporter routes of mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry (subsection “Calcium entry into mitochondria is required for strong activation of TCA metabolism”) are not only speculative but are potentially provocative.</p><p>13) The NADHcyto transient: There was a decrease in the NADHcyt transient with MCU depletion that could not be explained by (greater) flux through LDH because it was not &quot;rescued&quot; by the LDH inhibitor. It was stated in the text that the decrease could reflect increased MAS activity; this would constitute a compensation for loss of MCU.</p><p>14) NAD(P)H dip: There was a small decrease in the amplitude of the NAD(P)H autofluorescence dip in MCU kd slices, and the kinetics of the dip were altered; these changes, while small, were significant (Figure 2—figure supplement 3A).</p><p>15) Likewise, there were small but significant changes in the concomitant O<sub>2</sub> signal, in both the amplitude and kinetics (specifically, in the &quot;time to O<sub>2</sub> dip&quot; (Figure 2—figure supplement 3B).</p><p>FAD+ undershoot during the NAD(P)H overshoot: In MCU kd slices, there was less of a decrease in the FAD+ undershoot compared to decrease in the NAD(P)H overshoot. What does the FAD+ undershoot reflect: PDH activity (the E3 subunit: FADH2 -&gt; FAD+), SDH activity (FAD+ -&gt; FADH2) or the glycerol-3-P-dehydrogenase (FADH2 -&gt; FAD+)? Though the latter describes the NAD(P)H overshoot phase, the fact that there is a different effect on the NAD(P)H overshoot and FAD+ undershoot suggests that the FAD+ signal does not simply reflect TCA FAD+ -&gt; FADH2 (at SDH), and that what contributes to the FAD+ signal may differ between Ctrl and MCU kd. The latter point would support\ that metabolic fluxes in response to stimuli can be different in MCU kd slices.</p><p>16) FAD+ undershoot in MCU kd slices likely does not reflect flux through PDH or through SDH (since otherwise less of an attenuation of the NAD(P)H signal would be expected). So what does the FAD+ undershoot reflect in MCU kd? Increased glycerol-3-P-dehydrogenase activity? If yes, then there can be substantial ROS associated with that activity (see Quinlan 2013 PMID: 24024165), which could provoke additional changes.</p><p>17) Discussion: focus is on emphasizing the effect of MCU kd on the NAD(P)H overshoot and the changes to the dip (NAD(P)H and O<sub>2</sub>) and the FAD+ undershoot seems to be deemphasized. At least in the text of Results, a fuller description of the changes in the dip and undershoot would be needed.</p><p>18) This dataset might be the first actual evidence that metabolism compensates/responds/is not neutral to MCU loss (beyond the surprising observations in other studies that MCU loss appears to not impact metabolism). Acknowledging this evidence that metabolism is not neutral to MCU loss seems important in light of observations from several studies that MCU loss appears to not alter metabolism, which can lead to the conclusion that MCU plays no role in metabolism.</p><p>19) MAS depends on AGC1/2 (aralar/citrin or SLC25A12/SLC25A13) which contain EF-hands that face the IMS and are therefore theoretically exposed to cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup>; it would be worth pointing this out, and that the higher cyto Ca<sup>2+</sup> during the pulses may lead to greater activation of MAS. The same would be the case for glycerol-3-P-dehydrogenase if it were to play a role.</p><p>20) Referring to the NAD(P)H overshoot as TCA-refilling may be incorrect, and prematurely elevates an observation into an interpretation. That there is an NAD(P)H overshoot suggests that stimulation is followed by a phase in which the mitochondrial matrix is in a relatively reduced state. This may reflect a disproportionate NADH generation by PDH and TCA cycle relative to NADH oxidation by the electron transport chain. The overshoot could reflect a shift in oxidation state of the NADPH pool.</p><p>21) About the mixed results in the literature on the effects of mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> the different phases of NAD(P)H response to stimulation: That there are &quot;contradictory results&quot; is &quot;merely&quot; mentioned in Results and in Discussion. Has the current study been designed in any way that attempts to better understand the role of mito Ca<sup>2+</sup> in the NAD(P)H response?</p><p>22) Discussion: &quot;We found that oxygen utilization,.…, was not altered by MCU knockdown&quot;. This does not seem to be accurate based on the data of Figure 2—figure supplement 3.</p><p>The sentence &quot;More importantly, Ca<sup>2+</sup> itself may not be necessary if.… Ca<sup>2+</sup> extrusion&quot;. Metabolic response to Ca<sup>2+</sup> extrusion and the use of/requirement for Ca<sup>2+</sup> as part of that metabolic response can be independent.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.64821.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Figure 1B legend.

The bottom trace shows the Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal so that should be stated in the legend and the exact time of the train of pulses is not shown so it's timing relative to the RCAMP signal should be indicated.</p></disp-quote><p>We have modified the legend to have a more complete description of the experiment, including the RCaMP Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals, and we have now shown the stimulation times with arrows in the figure.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Also, there should be a very brief description of the meaning of fluorescence lifetime. I was familiar with this measurement from previous Yellen reports but some readers may not be.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this suggestion. A brief description of fluorescence lifetime has been included in the Results.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Subsection “Calcium entry into mitochondria is required for strong activation of TCA metabolism”. Based on the results in Figure 2A the loss of MCU seems to be having a specific effect. The magnitude of the initial Ca<sup>2+</sup> increase in response to stimulation seems to be about the same with and without MCU, but without MCU the influx is not sustained. (I think they discuss later that this may be a non-MCU mechanism of Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx but some comment should be made about this here). Also, the initial baseline (AU per px) is higher in the MCU knockdown neurons – is that just variation or does it reflect a higher resting Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration in the matrix?</p></disp-quote><p>We have changed the analysis and presentation of the mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals to better accord with the reviewers’ correct understanding of the effect of MCU-KD. Instead of “decay time”, we now report area-under-the-curve for the mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals, which gives an integrated measure of both the amplitude and the sustained time course.</p><p>We have also performed additional experiments using two-photon fluorescence lifetime measurements of the RCaMP signal in MCU-KD and control neurons (Figure 3—figure supplement 2). These give results that are completely consistent with the widefield fluorescence data, but they also give a more reliable indication of baseline mitochondrial [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] and show that this is in fact lower in the MCU-KD neurons, as might be expected. We now describe this result in the Results.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) In Figure 2A Ca<sup>2+</sup> is measured as AU/px not in lifetime, but in panel C the cytosolic Ca is reported in lifetime units. Please comment on why this was done and how that affects the significance and quality of the data and interpretation of the different types of experiments.</p></disp-quote><p>Experiments like those in Figure 2A [now Figure 3A] were performed with a widefield fluorescence microscope (one-photon) that does not provide lifetime measurements. As explained in our response to #2 above, we now provide additional RCaMP lifetime measurements in Figure 3—figure supplement 2; these are quite consistent with the conclusions based on the widefield experiments.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) In Figure 2B – 50% decay times are reported. Is that 50% of the initial spike of Ca? Or is it from a curve fitting to what appears to be a normal exponential decay curve that occurs following the spike. In other words is the decay of mitochondrial Ca biphasic and if so shouldn't both two time constants and their relative contributions be reported?</p></disp-quote><p>As explained in our response to #2 above, we now avoid any confusion about kinetics of the mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals by providing an integrated measurement of the area under the curve. A detailed study of the kinetics of mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> handling is beyond the scope of our experiments.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) In the MCU knockdown mitochondrial NADP(H) signals in Figure 2A the oxidative transients seem smaller than in the controls. That does not seem representative based on Figure 2—figure supplement 3. To avoid confusion would it be possible to use a more representative experiment for Figure 2A?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for pointing this out. We have now included a more representative experiment.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Subsection “Calcium entry into mitochondria is required for strong activation of TCA metabolism”. I think there should also be some discussion of AGC1 activity being stimulated directly by cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup>. This is mentioned briefly later in the Discussion but it seems like it could be a significant factor in these studies and in their interpretation.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now included a paragraph in the Results, on the possible compensation by MAS (or the glycerol-P shuttle), especially during the activity-associated rise in cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup>. Nevertheless, MCU KD has a much larger effect on matrix Ca<sup>2+</sup> than on cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup>, so the matrix-side effect is likely the more important one to mention here (as we do).</p><p>In the Discussion, we consider the possible contributions of Ca<sup>2+</sup> stimulation of AGC1 and of upregulation of MAS in the MCU KD.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) Subsection “Energy demand from Na<sup>+</sup> or Ca<sup>2+</sup> pumping triggers aerobic glycolysis”. Adding strophanthidin in the zero Ca<sup>2+</sup> shows that ATP consumption stimulates GAPDH activity. However, wouldn't it be also worthwhile to determine if strophanthidin also blocks the cytosolic NADH increase triggered by stimulation when Ca<sup>2+</sup> is present? In other words can the authors address whether Ca<sup>2+</sup> does or does not contribute to accelerated glycolysis (independently of increased energy demand)?</p></disp-quote><p>This is a complicated question, because blockade of the Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup> pump is not necessarily sufficient to prevent ATP hydrolysis associated with Ca<sup>2+</sup> extrusion (through other pathways), and because Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup> pump inhibition leads rapidly to cell death by swelling under normal ionic conditions. Strophanthidin also causes severe dysregulation of Ca<sup>2+</sup> and Na<sup>+</sup>, even at low doses. Our future experiments are targeted to address this general conceptual question.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) Discussion. Please address here whether or not Ca<sup>2+</sup> regulation of AGC1 (i.e. enhanced MAS activity) also could contribute to elevated NADH in the matrix. (this is a reiteration of my comment #6).</p></disp-quote><p>As mentioned in #6, we have discussed this possibility in the Discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) Discussion: Is the &quot;rapid dip&quot; blocked by strophanthidin?</p></disp-quote><p>As mentioned in #6, we have discussed this possibility in the Discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10) The data presented show that Ca<sup>2+</sup> is little more than a bystander in the regulation of glycolysis. The &quot;distinct roles&quot; formulation of the paper needs to be walked back.</p></disp-quote><p>We would not say it is a “bystander”, as eliminating Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx makes the NADHcyt transients nearly disappear. Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx plays a major role, but not specifically as a signaling molecule. We have added a better explanation of its apparent role in energy demand, as a surprisingly large contributor (Results).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>11) A scheme showing the biochemical linkages and cell-biological relationships (subcellular compartments, etc) under consideration is necessary. Readers should not be made to forage through biochemistry texts and online resources to make sense of the basic questions a paper is attempting to address.</p></disp-quote><p>We are happy to provide a scheme of the relevant biochemical processes and their compartmentation, now shown in Figure 1; (the figure supplements show additional features related to the NADH shuttles and ion ATPases; these are included as separate figures to avoid overwhelming complexity).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>12) It is important to know the extent of MCU protein depletion; but it is acknowledged that this may be technically difficult. Have all the options been exhausted? Because the extent of MCU depletion is not known, references to possible non-uniporter routes of mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry (subsection “Calcium entry into mitochondria is required for strong activation of TCA metabolism”) are not only speculative but are potentially provocative.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for pointing this out. We know the MCU knockdown is quite variable and may be incomplete; we have revised this sentence to mention that remnant MCU may be responsible in the Results. Additional explanations for the initial peak in mitoRCaMP are also included in the Results.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>13) The NADHcyto transient: There was a decrease in the NADHcyt transient with MCU depletion that could not be explained by (greater) flux through LDH because it was not &quot;rescued&quot; by the LDH inhibitor. It was stated in the text that the decrease could reflect increased MAS activity; this would constitute a compensation for loss of MCU.</p></disp-quote><p>As mentioned in #6, we have added a local explanation (Results) about the possibility of increased/compensatory expression of the mitochondrial shuttles.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>14) NAD(P)H dip: There was a small decrease in the amplitude of the NAD(P)H autofluorescence dip in MCU kd slices, and the kinetics of the dip were altered; these changes, while small, were significant (Figure 2—figure supplement 3A).</p></disp-quote><p>In the Results, we mentioned that the dip of MCU-KD mice decreases when slices are stimulated with 25 pulses. In the figure legend of now Figure 3—figure supplement 3A, we now mention that the change in the kinetics of the dip likely reflects less overlap between the oxidative and reductive phases of the NAD(P)H signal due to the attenuation of the overshoot.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>15) Likewise, there were small but significant changes in the concomitant O<sub>2</sub> signal, in both the amplitude and kinetics (specifically, in the &quot;time to O<sub>2</sub> dip&quot; (Figure 2—figure supplement 3B).</p></disp-quote><p>We have emphasized the changes in the O<sub>2</sub> signal in the Results section. In the Discussion section, we now say that the O<sub>2</sub> dip is slightly diminished or delayed by MCU knockdown (depending on the duration of the stimulus).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>FAD+ undershoot during the NAD(P)H overshoot: In MCU kd slices, there was less of a decrease in the FAD+ undershoot compared to decrease in the NAD(P)H overshoot. What does the FAD+ undershoot reflect: PDH activity (the E3 subunit: FADH2 -&gt; FAD+), SDH activity (FAD+ -&gt; FADH2) or the glycerol-3-P-dehydrogenase (FADH2 -&gt; FAD+)? Though the latter describes the NAD(P)H overshoot phase, the fact that there is a different effect on the NAD(P)H overshoot and FAD+ undershoot suggests that the FAD+ signal does not simply reflect TCA FAD+ -&gt; FADH2 (at SDH), and that what contributes to the FAD+ signal may differ between Ctrl and MCU kd. The latter point would support\ that metabolic fluxes in response to stimuli can be different in MCU kd slices.</p></disp-quote><p>This is an interesting point. We have now commented on the possibility of the glycerol-P shuttle contributing to the transfer of reducing equivalents into the mitochondria (please see #6). However, we also mention the possibility of glutamate and glutamine sustaining flux through part of the TCA cycle involving SDH, by entering at the α-ketoglutarate level and exiting as oxaloacetate (Discussion).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>16) FAD+ undershoot in MCU kd slices likely does not reflect flux through PDH or through SDH (since otherwise less of an attenuation of the NAD(P)H signal would be expected). So what does the FAD+ undershoot reflect in MCU kd? Increased glycerol-3-P-dehydrogenase activity? If yes, then there can be substantial ROS associated with that activity (see Quinlan 2013 PMID: 24024165), which could provoke additional changes.</p></disp-quote><p>As commented in #15, there is still the possibility of SDH involvement if glutamate becomes a substrate for the TCA cycle. We have mentioned that the glycerol-P shuttle may also compensate for the reduced TCA cycle activity due to MCU loss (see #6). The relative contributions of these potential pathways, and their consequences for ROS production, are relevant topics for further investigation but are beyond the scope of the present study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>17) Discussion: focus is on emphasizing the effect of MCU kd on the NAD(P)H overshoot and the changes to the dip (NAD(P)H and O<sub>2</sub>) and the FAD+ undershoot seems to be deemphasized. At least in the text of Results, a fuller description of the changes in the dip and undershoot would be needed.</p></disp-quote><p>We now mention the unexpected findings on the less attenuated FAD<sup>+</sup> undershoot in the Results.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>18) This dataset might be the first actual evidence that metabolism compensates/responds/is not neutral to MCU loss (beyond the surprising observations in other studies that MCU loss appears to not impact metabolism). Acknowledging this evidence that metabolism is not neutral to MCU loss seems important in light of observations from several studies that MCU loss appears to not alter metabolism, which can lead to the conclusion that MCU plays no role in metabolism.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this observation. We hope that the current version of the manuscript emphasizes more the impact of MCU loss on neuronal metabolism.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>19) MAS depends on AGC1/2 (aralar/citrin or SLC25A12/SLC25A13) which contain EF-hands that face the IMS and are therefore theoretically exposed to cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup>; it would be worth pointing this out, and that the higher cyto Ca<sup>2+</sup> during the pulses may lead to greater activation of MAS. The same would be the case for glycerol-3-P-dehydrogenase if it were to play a role.</p></disp-quote><p>We have addressed this possibility in the previous answers (please see #6, we have discussed this possibility in the Discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>20) Referring to the NAD(P)H overshoot as TCA-refilling may be incorrect, and prematurely elevates an observation into an interpretation. That there is an NAD(P)H overshoot suggests that stimulation is followed by a phase in which the mitochondrial matrix is in a relatively reduced state. This may reflect a disproportionate NADH generation by PDH and TCA cycle relative to NADH oxidation by the electron transport chain.</p></disp-quote><p>We cannot find the statement on the NAD(P)H overshoot acting as a TCA-refilling event, but perhaps this comment refers to the statement about “a major role for [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>MITO</sub> in activating dehydrogenases in the TCA cycle to resupply mitochondrial NADH after neuronal stimulation.” We think this statement agrees with the last sentence of the comment, as indeed we think that the overshoot arises from the imbalance between the “resupply” of NADH encouraged by Ca and the oxidation by the ETC spurred by ATP demand.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The overshoot could reflect a shift in oxidation state of the NADPH pool.</p></disp-quote><p>We acknowledge this possibility. However, the NAD(P)H overshoot does behave as expected from TCA-based production of NADH from pyruvate, based on the MPC inhibition. Nevertheless, it could be flux diverted to malic enzyme, or could occur via transhydrogenase (which connects the redox states of NADH and NADPH) – but it does depend on pyruvate and Ca<sup>2+</sup>.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>21) About the mixed results in the literature on the effects of mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> the different phases of NAD(P)H response to stimulation: That there are &quot;contradictory results&quot; is &quot;merely&quot; mentioned in Results and in Discussion. Has the current study been designed in any way that attempts to better understand the role of mito Ca<sup>2+</sup> in the NAD(P)H response?</p></disp-quote><p>The previous work was done with widely divergent preparations (cultured DRG vs. brain slice) and methods of stimulation (electrical vs. application of kainate or glutamate). Our study is designed to use a wide range of manipulations, ion removal, pharmacologic, and genetic, to alter mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup>. We offer our results to augment rather than supersede the literature on this subject, while the effects on glycolysis are completely novel.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>22) Discussion: &quot;We found that oxygen utilization,.…, was not altered by MCU knockdown&quot;. This does not seem to be accurate based on the data of Figure 2—figure supplement 3.</p><p>The sentence &quot;More importantly, Ca<sup>2+</sup> itself may not be necessary if.… Ca<sup>2+</sup> extrusion&quot;. Metabolic response to Ca<sup>2+</sup> extrusion and the use of/requirement for Ca<sup>2+</sup> as part of that metabolic response can be independent.</p></disp-quote><p>This sentence has been rewritten and now states that: “More importantly, activity-induced increases in [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>CYT</sub> may not be necessary for the metabolic transient, although this increase apparently accounts for a surprisingly large part of the metabolic transient. It may be that the fast glycolytic response is simply reactive to the energy demand resulting from Ca<sup>2+</sup> extrusion, and that this is a large fraction of the total energy demand produced by activity.”</p></body></sub-article></article>
