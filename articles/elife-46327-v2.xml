primarily controlled by regulatory RNA-binding proteins (RBPs). It has been proposed that a small number of master splicing regulators might control cell-specific splicing networks and that these RBPs could be identified by proximity of their genes to transcriptional super-enhancers. Using this approach we identified RBPMS as a critical splicing regulator in differentiated vascular smooth muscle cells (SMCs). RBPMS is highly down-regulated during phenotypic switching of SMCs from a contractile to a motile and proliferative phenotype and is responsible for 20% of the AS changes during this transition. RBPMS directly regulates AS of numerous components of the actin cytoskeleton and focal adhesion machineries whose activity is critical for SMC function in both phenotypes. RBPMS also regulates splicing of other splicing, post-transcriptional and transcription regulators including the key SMC transcription factor Myocardin, thereby matching many of the criteria of a master regulator of AS in SMCs.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>All the cells in our body contain the same genetic information, but they only switch on the genes that they need to fulfill their specific role in the organism. Genetic sequences known as enhancers can turn on the genes that are required by a particular cell to perform its tasks.</p><p>Once a gene is activated, its sequence is faithfully copied into a molecule of RNA which contains segments that code for a protein. A molecular machine then processes the RNA molecule and splices together the coding segments. RNA binding proteins can also regulate this mechanism, and help to splice the coding sections in different ways depending on the type of cell. The process, known as alternative RNA splicing, therefore creates different RNA templates from the same gene. This gives rise to related but different proteins, each suited to the needs of the particular cell in which they are made.</p><p>However, in some cell types, exactly how this happens has not yet been well documented. For example, in cells that line blood vessels – known as vascular smooth muscle cells – the RNA binding proteins that drive alternative splicing have not been identified.</p><p>To find these proteins, Nakagaki-Silva et al. used catalogs of DNA regions called super-enhancers as clues. These sequences strongly activate certain genes in a tissue-specific manner, effectively acting as labels for genes important for a given cell type. In vascular smooth muscle cells, if a super-enhancer switches on a gene that codes for a RNA-binding protein, this protein is probably crucial for the cell to work properly.</p><p>The approach highlighted a protein called RBPMS, and showed that it controlled alternative RNA splicing of many genes important in smooth muscle cells. This may suggest that when RBPMS regulation is disrupted, certain diseases of the heart and blood vessels could emerge. Finally, the results by Nakagaki-Silva et al. demonstrate that super-enhancers can signpost genes important in regulating splicing or other key processes in particular cell types.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>alternative splicing</kwd><kwd>RNA binding protein</kwd><kwd>smooth muscle</kwd><kwd>super-enhancer</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Rat</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000274</institution-id><institution>British Heart Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PG/16/28/32123</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sinha</surname><given-names>Sanjay</given-names></name><name><surname>Smith</surname><given-names>Christopher WJ</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000274</institution-id><institution>British Heart Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>FS/11/85/29129</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Buckroyd</surname><given-names>Adrian</given-names></name><name><surname>Smith</surname><given-names>Christopher WJ</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000274</institution-id><institution>British Heart Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>FS/18/46/33663</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sinha</surname><given-names>Sanjay</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>092900/Z/10/Z</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Smith</surname><given-names>Christopher WJ</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>209368/Z/17/Z</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Smith</surname><given-names>Christopher WJ</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003593</institution-id><institution>Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>206813/2014-7</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Nakagaki-Silva</surname><given-names>Erick E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>By focusing on RNA-binding proteins whose genes have super enhancers in smooth muscle cells, the protein RBPMS was identified as an alternative splicing master regulator.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Alternative splicing (AS) is an important component of regulated gene expression programmes during cell development and differentiation, usually focusing on different sets of genes than transcriptional control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Blencowe, 2006</xref>). AS programs re-wire protein-protein interaction networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Buljan et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Ellis et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Yang et al., 2016</xref>), as well as allowing quantitative regulation by generating mRNA isoforms that are differentially regulated by translation or mRNA decay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">McGlincy and Smith, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Mockenhaupt and Makeyev, 2015</xref>). Coordinated cell-specific splicing programs are determined by a combination of <italic>cis</italic>-acting transcript features and <italic>trans</italic>-acting factors that compose ‘splicing codes’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Barash et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chen and Manley, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Fu and Ares, 2014</xref>). The interactions between the <italic>trans</italic> component RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) and the <italic>cis</italic> component regulatory elements in target RNAs coordinate the activation and repression of specific splicing events. Many regulatory proteins, including members of the SR and hnRNP protein families, are quite widely expressed, while others are expressed in a narrower range of cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">David and Manley, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Fu and Ares, 2014</xref>). A further conceptual development of combinatorial models for splicing regulation has been the suggestion that a subset of RBPs act as master regulators of cell-type specific AS networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Jangi and Sharp, 2014</xref>). The criteria expected of such master regulators include that: (i) they are essential for cell-type specification or maintenance, (ii) their direct and indirect targets are important for cell-type function, (iii) they are likely to regulate the activity of other splicing regulators, (iv) they exhibit a wide dynamic range of activity, which is not limited by autoregulation, and (v) they are regulated externally from the splicing network, for example by transcriptional control or post-translational modifications. It was further suggested that expression of such splicing master regulators would be driven by transcriptional super-enhancers, providing a possible route to their identification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Jangi and Sharp, 2014</xref>). Super-enhancers are extended clusters of enhancers that are more cell-type-specific than classical enhancers and that drive expression of genes that are essential for cell-type identity, including key transcription factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hnisz et al., 2013</xref>). By extension, RBPs whose expression is driven by super-enhancers are expected to be critical for cell-type identity and might include master regulators of tissue-specific AS networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Jangi and Sharp, 2014</xref>).</p><p>Vascular smooth muscle cells (SMCs) are important in cardiovascular physiology and pathology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bennett et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Fisher, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Owens et al., 2004</xref>). Unlike skeletal and cardiac muscle SMCs exhibit phenotypic plasticity and are not terminally differentiated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Owens et al., 2004</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). In healthy arteries, vascular SMCs exist in a differentiated contractile state. In response to injury or disease, the SMC phenotype switches towards a more synthetically active, motile and proliferative state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Fisher, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Owens et al., 2004</xref>). The transcriptional control of SMC phenotypic switching has been intensely studied, but the role of post-transcriptional regulation has been relatively neglected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Fisher, 2010</xref>). For example, some markers of the contractile state, such as h-Caldesmon and meta-Vinculin, arise via AS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Owens et al., 2004</xref>), but nothing is known about the regulation of these events. A number of known splicing regulators, including PTBP1, CELF, MBNL, QKI, TRA2B, and SRSF1, have been implicated in the regulation of individual SMC-specific ASEs, but these proteins are not restricted to differentiated SMCs and most act primarily in the de-differentiated state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Gooding et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gooding et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Gromak et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Shukla and Fisher, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">van der Veer et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Xie et al., 2017</xref>). Indeed, global profiling confirmed a widespread role of PTBP1 in repressing exons that are used in differentiated mouse aorta SMCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Llorian et al., 2016</xref>), but did not identify RBPs that act as direct regulators of the differentiated state. Biochemical identification of such RBPs is hampered by the fact that SMCs rapidly dedifferentiate in cell culture conditions.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>RBPMS is associated with SMC super-enhancers and is highly expressed in the differentiated PAC1 cells.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Diagram of the SMC dedifferentiation.

RBPMS is highly expressed in differentiated SMCs, where it promotes AS of genes that are important for SMC function. These include many components of the actin cytoskeleton and focal adhesion machineries, modulation of whose function is key to the transition from contractile to motile phenotypes. RBPMS also targets other splicing regulators, post-transcriptional regulators and the key SMC transcription factor Myocardin where RBPMS promotes inclusion of an exon that is essential for maximal SMC-specific activity. RBPMS therefore meets many of the criteria expected of an AS master regulator in SMCs, and its identification validates the approach of identifying key cell-specific regulators via the super-enhancer-proximity of their genes.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>RBPMS is a SMC splicing regulator</title><p>To identify potential SMC master splicing factors we used a catalog of 1542 human RBPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gerstberger et al., 2014</xref>) and data-sets of super-enhancers from three human SMC-rich tissues (aorta, bladder, stomach smooth muscle) and skeletal muscle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hnisz et al., 2013</xref>) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>).

These encoded two major protein isoforms (RBPMSA and RBPMSB) sharing a common N-terminus and RNA Recognition Motif (RRM) domain. RBPMSA and B differed by short C-terminal tails encoded by alternative 3' end exon 7 and exon 8 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), and corresponded in size to the two protein bands seen in western blots (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). Other mRNA isoforms differed by inclusion or skipping of exon six and by alternative 3' UTR exon inclusion. RBPMS and RBPMS2, which are 70% identical, have a single RRM domain that is responsible for both RNA binding and dimerization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Sagnol et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Teplova et al., 2016</xref>).

In addition to analysis of effects of RBPMS depletion and overexpression, comparison of the differentiated and proliferative PAC1 control samples revealed changes associated with differentiation state. Principal Component Analysis based on mRNA abundance showed clear separation of differentiated and proliferative samples (PC1, 82% variance, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>). This suggests that at the level of mRNA abundance the differences between differentiated and proliferative PAC1 cells far outweigh any effects of manipulating RBPMS levels. Consistent with this, RBPMS knockdown was associated with ~10 fold fewer changes at the transcript abundance level (110 increased, 82 decreased, padj &lt;0.05, fold change &gt;2 fold) compared to the differentiated vs proliferative control comparison (830 increased, 1444 decreased, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). RBPMS overexpression led to an intermediate number of changes in mRNA abundance levels, but only 29 genes were affected by both overexpression and knockdown, and of these only four genes other than <italic>Rbpms</italic> were regulated reciprocally.</p><p>RBPMS knockdown and overexpression had substantial effects at the level of AS affecting all types of AS event (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>). RBPMS knockdown led to changes in 318 AS events (FDR &lt; 0.05, |ΔPSI| &gt; 0.1, where PSI is <underline>P</underline>ercent <underline>S</underline>pliced <underline>I</underline>n), which was only 2-fold less than the number of events regulated between control differentiated and proliferative cells. Cassette exons were the largest group of events, with roughly equal numbers of up- and down-regulated exons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). RBPMS overexpression led to a larger number of AS changes (4934 regulated events), probably resulting from the combination of RBPMS expression in excess of levels usually present in differentiated PAC1 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>) and also because we expressed the more active RBPMSA isoform (see below). Cassette exons affected by RBPMS overexpression were strongly skewed (80%) towards greater exon skipping. A subset of ASEs observed in the RNA-Seq experiments, encompassing RBPMS activated and repressed cassette exons and mutually exclusive exons were validated by RT-PCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E,F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplements 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">3</xref>). ΔPSI values determined by RT-PCR and RNA-Seq were in good agreement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3B</xref>). As an additional negative control, doxycycline induction of empty lentiviral transduced cells had no effect on RBPMS-regulated AS events (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A</xref>).</p><p>In each of the three comparisons, the overlap between genes regulated at the levels of splicing and mRNA abundance was small: 0.8% of all genes regulated at splicing or abundance level for RBPMS knockdown, 3.2% for RBPMS overexpression, and 1.6% for PAC1 phenotype, (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref>). However, there were substantial overlaps of ASEs regulated by RBPMS knockdown, overexpression and PAC1 phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Twenty percent of ASEs regulated in PAC1 cell differentiation were congruently regulated by RBPMS knockdown, representing 40% of ASEs affected by RBPMS knockdown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A and B</xref> left panel). The high correlation (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.95) suggests that for these 127 events changes in RBPMS expression are sufficient to explain their differentiation-specific splicing changes. Similarly, RBPMS overexpression shared 180 events in common with PAC1 differentiation status (28% of differentiation specific events, 3.7% of overexpression regulated events). The ΔPSI correlation for these AS events was lower than for RBPMS knockdown (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.86, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A and B</xref> right panel).

However, for some events overexpression of RBPMS led to splicing patterns similar to tissue SMCs. For example the <italic>Actn1</italic> SM exon is included to 69% in differentiated PAC1 cells, but to 93–94% in RBPMS overexpressing cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>) and aorta tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3C</xref>). We therefore hypothesized that some ASEs regulated by RBPMS overexpression but not knockdown, might reflect tissue SMC AS patterns that are not usually observed in cultured SMCs. To address this possibility, we used RNA-Seq data monitoring de-differentiation of rat aorta SMCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplements 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">3</xref>). Of 1714 ASES regulated between tissue and passage 9 SMCs, 265 (15%) were also regulated by RBPMS overexpression in PAC1 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C,D</xref>, R<sup>2</sup> = 0.68). Strikingly, hierarchical clustering of cassette exons regulated between aorta tissue and passage nine cultured SMCs showed that the RBPMS overexpression sample clustered together with tissue, away from all other samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). Two clusters of AS events shared very similar splicing patterns in tissue and RBPMSA overexpression, and differed in all remaining samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). Cluster 1 comprised 28 RBPMS-activated exons, of which 20 were not regulated between PAC1 phenotypes. For example, inclusion of a cassette exon in <italic>Fermt2</italic> was observed only in tissue and RBPMS overexpression samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>). Similarly, inclusion of <italic>Cald1</italic> exon four in conjunction with a downstream 5’ splice site on exon 3a, producing the hCald1 marker in tissue SMCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C,D</xref>), and inclusion of the meta-vinculin exon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>) were also only seen upon RBPMS overexpression. Cluster four contained exons that are skipped in tissue and upon RBPMS overexpression (e.g. <italic>Tsc2</italic>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>), the majority of which are not regulated in PAC1 differentiated cells. Likewise <italic>Tpm1</italic> mutually exclusive exon three is skipped nearly completely upon RBPMS overexpression in a similar pattern to tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>).

We initially established that transient expression of RBPMSA in HEK293 cells was sufficient to switch AS of endogenous <italic>FLNB</italic>, <italic>TPM1, MPRIP</italic> and <italic>ACTN1</italic> towards the SMC splicing pattern (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C,G</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>). For comparison, we also transfected expression constructs for the RBPMSB isoform and the paralog RBPMS2. We found that RBPMSB had lower activity for some events (<italic>ACTN1</italic>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>), but that transfected RBPMS2 had similar activity to RBPMSA in all cases. RBPMSA and RBPMS2 also strongly activated inclusion of the <italic>Flnb</italic> H1 exon in a minigene context while RBPMSB activated to a lower extent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). <italic>Tpm1</italic> exon three is the regulated member of a pair of mutually exclusive exons and is repressed in SMCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ellis et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gooding et al., 1994</xref>).

In contrast, RBPMSA expression was sufficient to cause a near complete switch from exon inclusion to skipping (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H</xref>). RBPMS2 had lower activity, but RBPMSB was by far the least active protein. Likewise, RBPMSA and RBPMS2 completely switched splicing of <italic>Actn1</italic> constructs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Gromak et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Southby et al., 1999</xref>) from the NM to the SM mutually exclusive exon, while RBPMSB was nearly inactive (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2A</xref>). A construct containing only the <italic>Actn1</italic> SM exon was unresponsive to cotransfection, while a construct containing only the NM exon, which has three upstream CAC clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>) showed a complete switch from inclusion to skipping upon cotransfection of RBPMSA or RBPMS2, but not RBPMSB. Thus, for two mutually exclusive events RBPMSA is able to switch splicing to the SMC pattern by repressing the exon that is usually used in non-SMCs, while RBPMSB is less active.</p><p>We mutated CAC motifs in suspected binding sites to CCC, which disrupts RBPMS binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Farazi et al., 2014</xref>). Mutation of 12 CACs downstream of the <italic>FlnB</italic> H1 exon had no effect on basal splicing, but the H1 exon was completely resistant to activation by RBPMSA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). Likewise, mutation of 9 CAC motifs upstream of <italic>Tpm1</italic> exon three had no effect on exon inclusion in the absence of RBPMSA, but completely prevented exon skipping in response to RBPMSA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4I</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2B</xref>), while mutations of individual clusters had intermediate effects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2B</xref>). The response of both <italic>Flnb</italic> H1 exon and <italic>Tpm1</italic> exon three therefore depends on nearby CAC motifs. To test whether these are binding sites for RBPMS, we used in vitro transcribed RNAs and recombinant RBPMSA and B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F,J</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4</xref>). Using both electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) and UV crosslinking, both RBPMSA and B were found to bind to the <italic>FlnB</italic> wild type RNA (apparent Kd ~0.5 μM), but not to the mutant RNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). With <italic>Tpm1</italic>, RBPMSA and B bound to the WT RNA as indicated by EMSA assays (Kd ~0.5 μM) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4J</xref>). Binding was reduced by the mutations that abrogated RBPMSA repression of <italic>Tpm1</italic> exon 3 (Kd &gt;0.5 μM). Finally, we tested the effects of mutations in RBPMS to disrupt the RNA binding and dimerization interfaces of the RRM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Sagnol et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Teplova et al., 2016</xref>). Both RNA binding and dimerization mutants of RBPMSA had lost all splicing regulatory activity upon overexpression in HEK293 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref>), revealing RBPMS dimer-dependent splicing activity.

RBPMS overexpression AS targets were also not enriched for aorta super-enhancer-associated genes (p=0.37). This discrepancy might be accounted for by the high level of RBPMS overexpression leading to changes in some AS events that are not physiological targets.

To ensure that all target events were biologically relevant we used only AS events that are coregulated by RBPMS knockdown and PAC1 differentiation state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A,E</xref>) or by RBPMS overexpression and in aorta tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C,F</xref>). We also restricted the output network to high confidence interactions. RBPMS targets comprised a network (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>) focused on functions associated with cell-substrate adhesion (yellow nodes) and the actin cytoskeleton (blue). Six of the network proteins (SORBS1, CALD1, PDLIM5, PDLIM7, ACTN1 and ARHGEF7) are also components of the consensus integrin adhesome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Horton et al., 2015</xref>), which mechanically connects, and mediates signalling between, the actin cytoskeleton and the extracellular matrix. Underlining the importance of this network to SMC function, many of the genes are themselves super-enhancer-associated in one or more smooth muscle tissues (bold text, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). Actomyosin activity, and its mechanical connection to the extracellular matrix are important for both the contractile and motile states of SMCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Min et al., 2012</xref>). It appears that RBPMS plays an important role in modulating the activity of this protein network to suit the needs of the two cell states. Despite these coordinated changes in AS, we were unable to observe obvious changes in PAC1 cell phenotype after under the overexpression and knockdown treatments used for RNA analysis. We reasoned that more sustained perturbation of RBPMS levels might be required to allow turnover of protein isoforms before phenotypes would become apparent. We therefore prolonged RBPMS knockdown to a total of 120 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D–F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplements 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">3</xref>). Effective knockdown of RBPMS protein and RNA, and effects upon known RBPMS-regulated AS events were all confirmed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3</xref>). Under these conditions we observed a modest reduction in levels of smooth muscle actin (Acta2) protein and RNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3</xref>), which had not been seen with shorter knockdown. Strikingly, we observed substantial changes in cell morphology and actin organization of differentiated PAC1 cells upon prolonged RBPMS depletion. Compared to control cells, PAC1 cells treated with RBPMS siRNA (D KD) displayed less alignment of actin fibers, as indicated by the lower actin anisotropy score (~0.6 fold), accompanied by larger nuclear (~1.7 fold) and cell sizes (~2.6 fold) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D,F</xref>). Remarkably, the RBPMS knockdown differentiated cells closely resembled the proliferative cells in these characteristics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D,E</xref>). Therefore, the control of a functionally coherent set of targets that are important for SMC morphology and function is consistent with the hypothesis that RBPMS is a master regulator of AS in SMCs.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>RBPMS controls post-transcriptional regulators</title><p>Among the direct targets of master splicing regulators are expected to be events controlling the activity of other AS regulators leading to further indirect AS changes. Consistent with this, we noted that RBPMS affected splicing of <italic>Mbnl1</italic> and <italic>Mbnl2</italic>. RBPMS promoted skipping of the 36 nt and 95 nt alternative exons of <italic>Mbnl1</italic> (here referred to as exons 7 and 8), as indicated by both knockdown and overexpression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A,B</xref>). In <italic>Mbnl2</italic> the 36 nt exon was fully skipped in all conditions but the 95 nt exon was repressed by RBPMS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). Consistent with the RNA-Seq data, we obtained <italic>Mbnl1</italic> and <italic>Mbnl2</italic> cDNAs from PAC1 cells that varied by inclusion of the 36 and 95 nt exons. Corresponding shifts in MBNL1, but not MBNL2, protein isoforms could be observed by western blot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). These events affect the unstructured C-termini of MBNL proteins and have been shown to affect their splicing activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Sznajder et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Tabaglio et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Tran et al., 2011</xref>), suggesting that RBPMS might indirectly affect some AS events by modulating MBNL activity. To test this, we made expression constructs of rat MBNL1 isoforms with and without exons 7 and 8 (FL, Δ7, Δ8, Δ7Δ8) and MBNL2 with and without exon 8 (FL and Δ8), obtained as cDNAs from PAC1 cells. When transfected into HEK293 cells, full length MBNL1 and 2 caused a shift from use of the downstream to an upstream 5' splice site (5'SS) on <italic>NCOR2</italic> exon 47 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>), an event that is differentially regulated by MBNL isoforms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Sznajder et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Tran et al., 2011</xref>). The shorter MBNL isoforms showed lower activity in shifting towards the upstream 5'SS, although the difference was not statistically significant for the MBNL1 shorter isoforms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>). In proliferative PAC1 cells, <italic>NCOR2</italic> exon 47 mainly uses the upstream 5'SS, and knockdown of MBNL1 and 2 caused a significant shift to the downstream 5'SS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>).

Effects of lentiviral RBPMS-A overexpression were less clear (PSI -Dox = 37.7 ± 5.1, PSI + Dox = 47.1 ± 11.9), possibly related to the very low <italic>Myocd</italic> expression in the transduced lines. A conserved 200 nt region downstream of exon 2a contains two clusters of CAC motifs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>), suggesting that RBPMS directly activates exon 2a splicing. To better understand the regulation of the <italic>Myocd</italic> exon 2a, we created a minigene of exon 2a and its flanking intronic regions. In transfected PAC1 cells exon 2a in the minigene was included to a basal level of ~30% and RBPMS-A or RBPMS-B significantly increased exon 2a inclusion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>). The <italic>Myocd</italic> minigene was also tested in HEK293 cells. As expected, exon 2a was fully skipped in the non-smooth muscle cell line, but was highly responsive to RBPMSA and B with inclusion increasing to ~75% and 37%, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>). To test the role of the downstream CAC clusters we mutated each cluster (CAC to CCC mutations). Mutation of cluster 1 (mCAC) had a modest effect on activation by RBPMSA, although RBPMSB activity was severely impaired. Mutation of cluster two impaired activity of both RBPMS isoforms, while the combined mutations abolished all activation by RBPMS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>). Insertion of a previously defined RBPMS site (Ube2v1 from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Farazi et al., 2014</xref>) into the double mutant minigene restored activation by RBPMS-A, although RBPMS-B had minimal activity in this context (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7G</xref>). To confirm binding of RBPMS to the CAC motifs, EMSAs and UV crosslinking were carried out with in vitro transcribed RNAs containing the wild-type and mutant CAC clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref>). RBPMS A and B were both able to bind to the wild-type RNA at similar affinities as indicated by EMSA (apparent Kd ~0.5 μM) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref> upper panels). Binding was modestly reduced by mutation of the first cluster (Kd ~0.5–2.0 μM), more severely affected by mutation of the second cluster (Kd ~2.0 μM), and eliminated by combined mutation of both clusters. UV crosslinking of RBPMS was inefficient with only a very faint signal evident with wild type, but not mutant, probes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref> lower panels).

However, we did not observe changes in expression levels of SMC marker genes upon RBPMS knockdown or overexpression and changes in RNA abundance were outnumbered by regulated AS events (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). As a splicing regulator RBPMS can only affect actively transcribed genes, so it is unlikely to be sufficient to initially drive SMC differentiation.

MEC-8 was reported to regulate splicing of Unc-52 in <italic>C. elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Lundquist et al., 1996</xref>), but otherwise RBPMS family members have not been reported to regulate splicing. PAR-CLIP with over-expressed RBPMS in HEK293 cells revealed its preferred binding site, but accompanying mRNA-Seq did not identify regulated AS events associated with PAR-CLIP peaks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Farazi et al., 2014</xref>). Using rMATS to re-analyze the RNA-Seq data of Farazi et al, we found a small number of regulated AS events, including the <italic>Flnb</italic> H1 exon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C–F</xref>). We readily detected specific binding of RBPMS to target RNAs by EMSA, but UV crosslinking was inefficient, even with purified protein and in vitro transcribed RNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4F,J</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7F</xref>). This suggests that CLIP might significantly under-sample authentic RBPMS-binding sites. Nevertheless, the functional binding of RBPMS to <italic>Flnb</italic>, <italic>Tpm1</italic> and <italic>Myocd</italic> RNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7</xref>), the strong enrichment of dual CAC motifs with RBPMS-regulated exons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>), the associated requirement for RBPMS RNA binding and dimerization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref>), and distinct positional signatures for activation and repression of splicing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A,B</xref>), indicate that RBPMS acts widely to directly regulate splicing in differentiated SMCs. While earlier reports have shown that RBPMS can act in other steps in gene expression, our data provide the strongest evidence to date for a widespread molecular function of RBPMS as a splicing regulator.</p><p>Cell-specific splicing programs are usually driven by more than one regulatory RBPs. A number of splicing regulatory RBPs are known to promote the proliferative SMC phenotype, including QKI, PTBP1, and SRSF1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Llorian et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">van der Veer et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Xie et al., 2017</xref>). The extent to which these proteins coordinately regulate the same target ASEs remains to be established. RBPMS and QKI antagonistically regulate at least two targets in addition to <italic>Myocd</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). The <italic>Flnb</italic> H1 exon is activated by RBPMS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>) and repressed by QKI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Li et al., 2018</xref>), while the penultimate exon of <italic>Smtn</italic> is repressed by RBPMS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3A</xref>) but activated by QKI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Llorian et al., 2016</xref>). Moreover, QKI binding motifs are significantly associated with exons regulated during SMC dedifferentiation, and with exons directly regulated by RBPMS overexpression or knockdown (data not shown). It is therefore an interesting possibility that RBPMS and QKI might target a common set of ASEs perhaps acting as antagonistic master regulators of differentiated and proliferative SMC phenotypes. The two RBPs show reciprocal regulation of expression levels during SMC dedifferentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B,C</xref>), which combined with antagonistic activities could lead to switch like changes in many ASEs. For <italic>Myocd</italic> splicing, QKI appears to have dominant activity, driving skipping of exon 2a even when RBPMS is present at higher levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7G</xref>), so full inclusion of exon 2a requires the presence of RBPMS and absence of QKI. The logic of this regulatory input can explain inclusion of <italic>Myocd</italic> exon 2a in SMC and skipping in cardiac muscle and is consistent with the observation that RBPMS is super-enhancer associated both in vascular SMCs and heart left ventricle, while QKI is super-enhancer associated in left ventricle but not differentiated SMCs. Notably, QKI also controls a significant fraction of ASEs regulated during myogenic differentiation of skeletal muscle cells, but it promotes differentiated myotube AS patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hall et al., 2013</xref>), in contrast to its promotion of dedifferentiated splicing patterns in SMCs.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Activity of RBPMS isoforms</title><p><italic>RBPMS</italic> was originally characterized as a human gene that encoded multiple isoforms of an RBP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Shimamoto et al., 1996</xref>), but differential activity of common RBPMS isoforms has not previously been reported. Human RBPMSA and B have similar activity for co-regulation of AP1 transcriptional activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Fu et al., 2015</xref>) although a third human-specific isoform had lower activity. We found differential activity of RBPMSA and B upon some ASEs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7</xref>). In general, RBPMSA has higher activity particularly for repressed targets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplements 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">2A</xref>). The differential activity was seen with similar levels of overall expression, although we could not rule out the possibility of variation in nuclear levels as GFP-tagged RBPMS was predominantly cytoplasmic. Nevertheless, some ASEs were differentially responsive to RBPMSA or B while others responded equally (e.g. compare <italic>MPRIP</italic> with <italic>ACTN1</italic>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>). The differential activity upon <italic>Tpm1</italic> splicing could not be accounted for by differences in RNA binding by RBPMSA or B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F,H</xref>). Therefore, it is possible that RBPMS repressive function depends on other interactions mediated by the 20 amino acid RBPMSA C-terminal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). While the RRM domain is sufficient for RNA binding and dimerization in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Sagnol et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Teplova et al., 2016</xref>), previous studies have shown the extended C terminal region downstream of the RRM domain to be involved in several aspects of RBPMS/RBPMS2 function including granular localization in retinal ganglion cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hörnberg et al., 2013</xref>) and interaction with cFos in HEK293 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Fu et al., 2015</xref>). In vitro assays suggested that the C-terminal region increases RNA-binding affinity and possibly the oligomeric state of RBPMSA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Farazi et al., 2014</xref>) and the C-terminal 34 amino acids of <italic>Xenopus</italic> RBPMS2 is required for binding to <italic>Nanos1</italic> RNA in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aguero et al., 2016</xref>). In preliminary studies we have also found the C-terminal region to be essential for splicing regulation (data not shown). Future work will aim to address the mechanisms of RBPMS splicing activation and repression as well as isoform-specific differential activity.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>RBPMS targets numerous mRNAs important for SMC function</title><p>SMC phenotypic switching involves interconversion between a contractile phenotype and a motile, secretory, proliferative state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Owens et al., 2004</xref>). The actin cytoskeleton and its connections to the extracellular matrix (ECM) via focal adhesions are central to the function of both cell states, but with contrasting outcomes: tissue-wide contraction or independent movement of individual cells. RBPMS-mediated AS plays a major role in remodelling the actin cytoskeleton, the integrin adhesome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Horton et al., 2015</xref>) and ECM components in the two cell states. This is reflected in the similar GO terms shared by RBPMS-regulated AS events and the entire PAC1 cell AS program and in the morphological changes, including actin fiber reorganization, observed upon RBPMS knockdown in PAC1 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplements 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">2</xref>). The importance of many of the RBPMS target genes to SMC function is further indicated by their proximity to super-enhancers in SMC tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B,C</xref>). Indeed, three targets - ACTN1, FLNB and TNS1 - are all super-enhancer associated, interact directly with both actin and integrins and are components of distinct axes of the consensus integin adhesome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Horton et al., 2015</xref>). ACTN1 is a major hub in the network of proteins affected by RBPMS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). The AS event in ACTN1 produces a functional Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding domain in the motile isoform, but lack of Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding in the differentiated isoform stabilizes ACTN1 containing structures in contractile cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Waites et al., 1992</xref>). Many other RBPMS-regulated AS events have not previously been characterized. Focal adhesion complexes and the integrin adhesome are mechanosensitive complexes that connect the cytoskeleton and ECM, and are hubs of regulatory tyrosine phosphorylation signalling. We found a small network of RBPMS-regulated AS events in the receptor tyrosine phosphatase PTPRF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>) and two interacting proteins PPFIA1 and PPFIBP1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3A</xref>).

An RBPMS repressed exon lies within the conserved Piezo domain immediately adjacent to the mechanosensing ‘beam’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Liang and Howard, 2018</xref>). ECM components affected by RBPMS include fibronectin (FN1), which interacts directly with integrins, and HSPG2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3A</xref>). Notably, HSPG2 (also known as Perlecan) is the basement membrane heparan sulfate proteoglycan that is the identified splicing target of MEC-8 in <italic>C. elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Lundquist et al., 1996</xref>).</p><p>In addition to direct regulation of numerous functionally related targets, by directly targeting transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulators RBPMS has the potential for more widespread action (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figures 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7</xref>). RBPMS-regulated events in MBNL1 and 2 modulate their splicing regulatory activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Sznajder et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Tabaglio et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Tran et al., 2011</xref>). Changes in secondary AS targets are challenging to observe in a short duration overexpression experiment. Nevertheless, the modest change in <italic>NCOR2</italic> splicing appears to be attributable to an RBPMS-induced switch to less active MBNL isoforms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>). The regulated event in LSM14B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G–I</xref>) also has the potential to regulate mRNA stability, or an as yet uncharacterized nuclear role of LSM14B (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Kırlı et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>We also identified the SMC transcription factor as a direct target of RBPMS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). A similar role has been shown for the proposed myogenic AS master regulator RBM24 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Jangi and Sharp, 2014</xref>), which stabilizes mRNA of the transcription factor Myogenin by binding to its 3'UTR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Jin et al., 2010</xref>). Similarly, by activating inclusion of <italic>Myocd</italic> exon 2a (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>), RBPMS directs production of a Myocardin isoform that more potently promotes the differentiated SMC phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">van der Veer et al., 2013</xref>). Additional effects upon transcription could also be conferred by RBPMS activation of the FLNB H1 exon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). FLNB is primarily an actin binding and adhesion protein, but inclusion of the H1 hinge domain allows nuclear localization and antagonism of the transcription factor FOXC1 in epithelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Li et al., 2018</xref>). FOXC1 and FOXC2 are expressed at higher levels in adult arteries than any other human tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">GTEx Consortium, 2013</xref>). The modulation by RBPMS of FLNB isoforms therefore provides another route for indirect transcriptome regulation.

Ectopic RBPMS2 overexpression led to loss of differentiated contractile function <italic>via</italic> translational upregulation of <italic>Noggin</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Notarnicola et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Sagnol et al., 2014</xref>). This contrasts with our observations that RBPMS exclusively promotes differentiated SMC AS patterns. RBPMS2 is expressed at low levels in PAC1 and primary aorta SMCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) and its knockdown was without effect. Nevertheless, ectopic expression of RBPMS2 in PAC1 or HEK293 cells promoted differentiated SMC AS patterns in a similar manner to RBPMSA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplements 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">2</xref>), suggesting that RBPMSA and RBPMS2 have intrinsically similar molecular activities. The reasons for the apparent discrepancy between the promotion by RBPMS2 of differentiated SMC splicing patterns, but de-differentiated visceral SMC phenotypes, remain to be resolved. Possible explanations include variations in cell-specific signalling pathways, pre-mRNA and mRNA targets, interacting protein partners, post-translational modifications and subcellular localization, all of which could differentially modulate RBPMS and RBPMS2 activity in different SMC types.</p><p>In conclusion, our data vindicate the proposal that tissue-specific AS master regulators might be identified by the association of their genes with superenhancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Jangi and Sharp, 2014</xref>), paving the way for the identification of further such regulators in other tissues. While our data suggest that RBPMS has a critical role in SMCs, it is likely to play important roles in other cell types where its expression is also super-enhancer driven, including cardiac muscle and embryonic stem cells. Our approach aimed to identify AS master regulators common to diverse smooth muscle types (vascular, bladder, stomach). However, SMCs show a great deal of diversity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Fisher, 2010</xref>), even within single blood vessels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cheung et al., 2012</xref>). The splicing regulator Tra2 β is responsible for some splicing differences between tonic and phasic SMCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Shukla and Fisher, 2008</xref>), and it is possible that other RBPs might act as master regulators of some of these specialized SMC types. Our future studies aim to understand the mechanisms of splicing regulation by RBPMS, the role of the RBPMS-regulated splicing program in controlling different aspects of SMC phenotype and the potential role of subversion of this program in cardiovascular diseases. While the changes in actin organization observed upon RBPMS knockdown were striking (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>), it will be important to directly test various functional readouts of SMC physiology related to actin function and cell adhesion, including cell motility and agonist-induced cell contraction. VSMCs can be generated by controlled differentiation from human embryonic stem cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cheung et al., 2012</xref>). In combination with the use of genomic safe harbors to allow inducible protein or shRNA expression, these cells provide an ideal model system in which to test the effects of RBPMS on VSMC differentiation and function. In the longer term, conditional knockout mouse models will provide invaluable insights into the role of RBPMS in vivo.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type (species) or resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Gene (<italic>R. norvegicus</italic>)</td><td>RBPMSA</td><td/><td>NCBI: XM_006253240.2;

Before further analysis, the results from reads on target and junction counts were filtered to include only events with a total of read counts above 50 across the triplicates in at least one of the conditions compared. Removal of events with low counts discarded false positive events. Only ASE with an FDR less than 0.05 were considered significant and a minimal inclusion level difference of 10% imposed to significant AS events. Finally, to identify specific AS events, unique IDs were created using the AS type, gene name and the chromosomal coordinates of the regulated and flanking exons (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>).</p><p>For visualization of differentially spliced exons, sashimi plots were generated using rmats2sashimiplot (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gohr and Irimia, 2019</xref>). The sashimi plots show the RNAseq coverage reads mapping to the exon-exon junctions and PSI values from rMATS. Twenty eight ASE identified by rMATS in the RBPMS knockdown or overexpression were also validated by RT-PCR in the same manner as described in the qRT-PCR and RT-PCR section. ΔPSI predicted from the RNAseq analysis and the ΔPSI observed in the RT-PCR were then tested for a Pearson correlation in RStudio (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.rstudio.com/">http://www.rstudio.com/</ext-link>).</p><p>For comparison and visualization of the overlap between the genes with different mRNA abundance and the genes differentially spliced in the RBPMS knockdown, RBPMS overexpression and the PAC1 dedifferentiation, proportional Venn diagrams were made using BioVenn (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Hulsen et al., 2008</xref>). Venn diagrams were also generated for the visualization of the common AS events across RBPMS knockdown, overexpression and the PAC1 or aorta tissue dedifferentiation datasets.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>RBPMS motif enrichment analysis</title><p>RBPMS motif enrichment analyses in the regulated cassette exons (SE) of RBPMS knockdown and overexpression, PAC1 and Aorta tissue dedifferentiation were performed using the toolkit MATT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gohr and Irimia, 2019</xref>). Cassette exons in transcripts identified by rMATS with significant changes (FDR &lt; 0.05 and |ΔPSI| &gt; 10%) were used to test enrichment or depletion of CACN<sub>1-12</sub>CAC RBPMS recognition element (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Farazi et al., 2014</xref>), against a background set of unregulated exons defined as events with FDR &gt; 0.1 and |ΔPSI| &lt; 5%. 250 bp of the flanking intronic regions were examined for RBPMS motif signals. The motif enrichment scores were first obtained using the test_regexp_enrich command of the Matt suite in the quant mode with statistical significance determined using a permutation test with 50,000 iterations. This module inherently divides the examined regions (exons or 250 bp of the introns) into thirds and provides positional information for the occurrence of the RBPMS motif.</p><p>RNA maps for distribution of the RBPMS motif were generated using the rna_maps command in the Matt suite. Here the unregulated set of exons was randomly downsampled to include a final background of 2000 events only. Additionally, the program was instructed to scan only 135 bp of the cassette exon and 250 bp at either end of the flanking introns. A sliding window of 31 was used for scanning the motif and the statistically significant regions (p&lt;0.05) for enrichment or depletion were identified by the permutation tests specifying 1000 iterations.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Gene ontology and PPI analysis</title><p>Enrichment for gene ontology terms in the differentially abundant and spliced genes were obtained from Gorilla (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Eden et al., 2009</xref>). Two unranked lists of genes, target and background lists, were used for the GO analysis. The target list contained either the significant differential abundant genes (p-adj &lt;0.05 and log2 Fold Change greater than one or less than −1) or the significant differentially spliced genes (FDR &lt; 0.05 and ΔPSI threshold of 10%). Background gene lists were created for the PAC1 experiments and aorta tissue by selecting the genes whose expression were higher than 1 TPM in either of the conditions analyzed. For visualization, only the top five enriched GO terms of each category (biological process, cell component and molecular function) were shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>.

RBPMS-regulated genes were obtained by merging two lists: i) overlap of genes concordantly differentially spliced in the RBPMS knockdown and PAC1 experiments and, ii) overlap of genes concordantly differentially spliced in the RBPMSA overexpression and the aorta tissue datasets that were shown to be regulated in the same range in both conditions. A cut off of ΔPSI greater than 10% was also applied to the RBPMS-regulated gene list, similar to the GO analysis. The human database was chosen for the analysis and the following parameters applied to the PPI network: confidence as the meaning of the network edges, experiments and database as the interaction sources and high confidence (0.700) as the minimum required interaction score. STRING functional enrichments, using the whole genome as statistical background, were also included for visualization.

Recombinant RBPMS A protein was purified using Blue Sepharose six and HisTrap HP columns whereas RBPMS B was purified only through the latter, since low binding was observed to Blue Sepharose 6.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Douglas Black as the Reviewing Editor and James Manley as the Senior Editor.

The authors found that the <italic>RBPMS</italic> gene is associated with superenhancers active in smooth muscle cell (SMC) rich tissues, similar to other key smooth muscle effector genes. Using the PAC-1 cell line to model the transition between the differentiated (D) and proliferative (P) states of SMC's, they show that RBPMS is high in the D state but repressed upon transition to the P state, similar to several key markers of SMC differentiation and in parallel with changes in the alternative splicing of SMC transcripts. To assess the role of RBPMS in alternative splicing, they set up a series of RNAseq comparisons. Data sets were generated from control differentiated cells, D cells with RBPMS depleted by siRNA, and from proliferating cells transduced with RBPMS or control empty lentivirus. The lentiviral transgene was under tet control, so the two virally infected P cells were examined both plus and minus doxycycline to induce RBPMS. From these data, they identify large sets of splicing events that shift during the D to P transition, or in response to RBPMS depletion or over expression. Some of these splicing events are confirmed in RT/PCR assays. Splicing patterns changing upon differentiation have significant overlap with those responding to RBPMS overexpression, and especially RBPMS depletion. These comprise two of four clusters of splicing events that are altered between D and P, one cluster of RBPMS activated exons and one exhibiting apparent repression by the protein. These events and their clustering were confirmed in differentiating primary cells from Aorta.</p><p>The authors estimate that 20% of the splicing events specific to differentiated SMC are driven by RBPMS expression. RBPMS is known to recognize two closely spaced CAC motifs. Examining their exons that are repressed by RBPMS, these motifs were found to be enriched upstream and within the exon. For exons activated by the protein, CAC motifs are enriched downstream, in keeping with widely observed positional effects of splicing regulators. The authors confirm the direct regulation of particular exons using minigenes to show that the effects of RBPMS overexpression match the endogenous transcripts and that RBPMS mediated regulation is lost upon CAC motif mutation. The direct recognition of this motif is demonstrated in RNA mobility shift binding assays. GO and STRING analyses were used to examine the function of transcripts regulated by RBPMS. Although exons affected by RBPMS overexpression were not easily categorized, exons changing upon RBPMS knockdown showed enrichment for terms associated with cytoskeletal functions, cell adhesion, and actin-based processes. Many of these could be grouped into a protein-protein interaction network using STRING. Looking at particular transcripts with known function in SMC biology, the authors find RBPMS dependent splicing of the regulators Mbnl1 and Myocardin. Myocardin in particular is a transcription factor affecting both cardiac and smc development. The authors identify a RBPMS dependent exon in this gene whose inclusion creates the isoform specific to differentiated SMC. They show that RBPMS induces this exon through direct CAC motif binding, and that RBPMS action is blocked by Qk1, a previously identified regulator of Myocardin splicing.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The reviewers all found this to be a well-developed study that identifies a new regulator of smooth muscle development. The authors implicate RBPMS in SMC biology by a clever means and then go on to characterize it with well controlled experiments. Tissue-restricted splicing regulators are still relatively rare. All three reviewers felt that the study would be strengthened by additional data on the role of the RBPMS splicing program in muscle physiology. What does RBPMS serve to master regulate? Does it drive a detectable physiological change in cell determination or behavior? To what extent is RBPMS required to gain the smooth muscle phenotype?</p><p>It is not expected that the authors develop a mouse model to address this, but is there some cell culture assay that would shed additional light on the biology? For example, does gain/loss of RBPMS accelerate/retard the transition between the contractile and motile/proliferative smooth muscle cell phenotypes? The authors should assess how they might gain additional insights into the biological role of RBPMS.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.46327.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The reviewers all found this to be a well-developed study that identifies a new regulator of smooth muscle development.

We were not previously able to discern an obvious phenotype under the conditions used for RNA analysis (typically 24-48 hr knockdown or overexpression), probably because this time-frame was insufficient to allow turnover of pre-existing protein isoforms and replacement by alternative isoforms. We now include new data (Figure 5D-F, Figure 5—figure supplements 2 and 3) showing that after sustained RBPMS knockdown for 120 hr in differentiated PAC1 cells there is a substantial reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton so that the cells now resemble proliferative PAC1 cells in overall cell morphology and actin cytoskeleton. This fits well with the enrichment among RBPMS targets of cytoskeletal and focal adhesion functions that we observe.</p><p>This is obviously only a start; in the future we aim to address the physiological roles of RBPMS using a number of model systems and different functional readouts. Ultimately, we plan to use conditional knockout mice but in the medium term we will use human stem cell derived vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) using protocols developed by the Sinha lab. We can use genomic safe harbors to inducibly express either RBPMS or shRNAs targeting RBPMS, either prior to or following differentiation of VSMCs from neural crest or lateral plate mesoderm lineages. This is a better defined model cell system than the PAC1 cells, in which it should be possible to test for a range of cell functions affected by RBPMS, including cell motility and single cell contraction. However, this is beyond the scope of what we can achieve for revisions of the current manuscript. We have included a short section at the end of the Discussion addressing these future plans which, combined with the new cell phenotype data, we hope sufficiently addresses the requested Essential Revisions.</p></body></sub-article></article>
