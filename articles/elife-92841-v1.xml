DLBCL is the most prevalent type among them, accounting for around 30% of all non-Hodgkin lymphomas. DLBCL was initially classified by the Hans algorithm into two subtypes: germinal center B-cell-like (GCB) and non-GCB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Hans et al., 2004</xref>). Further differentiation has since identified three distinct gene-based subtypes: GCB, activated B-cell-like (ABC), and the unclassified category (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Sehn and Salles, 2021</xref>). After undergoing R-CHOP chemotherapy, about 60% of patients achieve long-term remission; however, approximately 30% of patients experience relapse, resulting in poor prognosis and a considerable number of deaths from refractory lymphoma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Autio et al., 2021</xref>). Consequently, to explore the characteristics of DLBCL in detail is urgently needed for developing more effective therapy.</p><p>Solid tumor tissue comprises tumor cells and the surrounding stroma, which encompasses diverse types of matrix cells, immune cells, endothelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Joyce and Pollard, 2009</xref>), etc. The tumor microenvironment (TME) is a complex and dynamic system that consists of the extracellular matrix and a variety of cellular components. Recent studies have unveiled multiple subgroups of immune cells within the microenvironment of DLBCL, including T cells, B cells, NK cells, monocytes/macrophages, dendritic cells, as well as the distribution of stromal cell components like fibroblasts and endothelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Steen et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Ciavarella et al., 2018</xref>). Despite the relatively limited composition of the TME in DLBCL, its role in tumor proliferation and evasion of the immune system should not be disregarded. The interaction between tumors and the microenvironment is a vital factor that impacts the development and prognosis of B-cell lymphoma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Ennishi et al., 2020</xref>). Nevertheless, the existing research on the influence of the TME on the prognosis of DLBCL patients is limited and lacks a consensus.</p><p>Moreover, the comprehensive investigation of non-immune cell components in the TME is still lacking. Previous research on stroma in DLBCL has predominantly indicated that a higher quantity of extracellular matrix is associated with a more favorable prognosis, while increased vascular density is associated with poorer prognosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Miyawaki et al., 2022</xref>). Furthermore, higher stromal scores have been associated with an improved prognosis in DLBCL patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Schmitz et al., 2018</xref>). Additionally, a fibrotic tumor microenvironment has been correlated with a better prognosis after DLBCL chemotherapy and immunotherapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Lou et al., 2022</xref>). These research findings stem from computational analysis of stromal and immune scoring in gene databases and have not been experimentally validated as of yet.</p><p>Tumor purity quantifies the relative ratio of tumor cells to the surrounding stromal components in solid tumors, elucidating the dynamics between tumor cells and their microenvironment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Gong et al., 2020</xref>). It can partly reflect the characteristics of TME, namely, a higher tumor purity indicates a lower abundance of stromal components in TME. Tumor purity is associated with patients’ prognosis, and the strength of this association varies across different tumor types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Lou et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Zhao et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Zhang et al., 2017</xref>). Therefore, when investigating the influence of TME on the prognosis of DLBCL patients, it is crucial to analyze not only the immune cell components but also the significance of non-immune cell components.</p><p>This study utilized bioinformatic analysis to establish the relationship between immune and stromal components and the prognostic outcomes of DLBCL patients. We developed a novel immunohistochemical panel to assess prognostic outcomes and treatment sensitivity by detecting the expression of VCAN, CD3G, C1QB, CD68, CD4, and CD8 in both the TME and tumor cells of 190 DLBCL patients. We then explored their relationship with DLBCL clinicopathological features as well as overall survival (OS).</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Data collection and tumor purity-related genes (TPGs) selection</title><p>The RNA-Sequence and clinical data of GSE53786 and GSE32918 datasets were downloaded from GEO database.

The findings indicate that higher expression of VCAN, increased infiltration of CD3G+ T cells, and decreased expression of C1QB are correlated with favorable prognostic outcomes. Conversely, a lower infiltration of CD68 + macrophages and lower infiltration of CD8 + T cells are associated with poorer prognosis. Furthermore, we investigated the relationship between risk genes related to tumor purity and treatment sensitivity and established a list of possible drugs that might be helpful for enhancing outcomes.</p><p>Previous studies have extensively investigated the VCAN gene in relation to tumorigenesis and metastasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baghy et al., 2016</xref>). VCAN, also known as versican, is a crucial component of extracellular matrix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Wight, 2017</xref>), and exists in several isoforms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Fujii et al., 2015</xref>). Research has shown that VCAN plays a multifaceted role in TME depending on the cell type expressing it. When expressed by myeloid cells, VCAN induces an anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive microenvironment. Conversely, its expression by stromal cells typically leads to a pro-inflammatory response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Wight et al., 2020</xref>). In gastric cancer, high expression of VCAN has been associated with increased infiltration of fibroblasts, significant enrichment of stromal-associated signaling pathways, and poor prognosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Song et al., 2022</xref>). In hepatocellular carcinoma, VCAN exhibits a strong association with immune checkpoint gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Wang et al., 2022</xref>). Despite these findings in other tumor types, the role of VCAN in DLBCL has not been explored yet. Our study reveals that high expression of VCAN is actually associated with a more favorable prognosis. This suggests that VCAN may have different functions in different tumor types. One possible mechanism through which VCAN influences prognosis is that VCAN overexpression in DLBCL may also impact tumor cell proliferation. A study has shown that overexpression of VCAN V1 has an inhibitory effect on cell proliferation, partly due to its promotion of activation-induced cell death in lymphoid cell lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Fujii et al., 2015</xref>). Hence, the high expression of VCAN in DLBCL could impact not only the TME but also tumor cell proliferation, suggesting a potential mechanism for the observed preferable prognosis.</p><p>C1q is synthesized in the tumor microenvironment and functions as an extracellular matrix protein, and C1QB is a component of C1q (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Yang et al., 2022</xref>). Previous studies have provided insights into the diverse roles of C1q in cancer progression. However, the majority of these results, as observed in non-small cell lung carcinoma and gastric cancer, indicate that high C1q expression in TME is associated with a poor prognosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Li et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Mangogna et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Jiang et al., 2020</xref>). Additionally, C1QB has been found to exert an impact on the TME and is positively associated with infiltration levels of CD8 + T cell, as well as with M1 and M2 macrophages in osteosarcoma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chen et al., 2021a</xref>). Moreover, C1QB expression shows a positive correlation with predictive biomarkers for immunotherapy, such as PD-L1 expression and CD8 + T cell infiltration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Jiang et al., 2020</xref>). Furthermore, in malignant melanoma, C1QB promotes proliferation, migration, and invasion, while inhibiting cell apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Zheng et al., 2021</xref>), and the high-expression group exhibits significant enrichment of genes related to immune and apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Yang et al., 2022</xref>). In our study, we found that high expression of C1QB in DLBCL was associated with a worse prognosis and positively correlated with CD8 + T cells infiltration. Based on these findings, we propose that C1QB in DLBCL might share similarities with its functions in other tumor types, particularly regarding the promotion of recruitment and subsequent deactivation of CD8 + T cells within the TME through the induction of immune checkpoint effects. These results shed light on the intricate role of C1QB in TME and its potential significance as a prognostic marker in DLBCL.</p><p>CD3G is a member of the TCR/CD3 complex primarily expressed in lymphocytes subgroups. It plays a crucial role in initiating the activation of T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Wang et al., 2008</xref>). It is also involved in coupling antigen recognition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chen et al., 2021b</xref>). It is reported to be associated with long-term OS and good prognosis in breast invasive carcinoma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Wang et al., 2019</xref>) as well as in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Wang et al., 2021</xref>). However, its role in DLBCL has not been fully explored. In our study, we revealed that high infiltration of CD3G+ T cells is correlated with good prognosis. The infiltration of CD3G+ T cells was found to be positively related to the infiltration of CD8+, CD4 +, and CD68+ cells. This indicates that CD3G+ T cells in DLBCL may enhance the tumor antigen recognition process and stimulate the infiltration of immune cells, leading to an increased abundance of immune cell infiltration in the TME. The presence of CD3G+ T cells in the TME may contribute to a favorable prognosis by facilitating the activation of immune responses against tumor cells.</p><p>Macrophages play a crucial role in TME, and CD68 is a surface marker specific to macrophages. Macrophages can be roughly classified into two types based on their functional features: M1 or M2. M1 macrophages exert anti-tumor effects, whereas M2 macrophages promote tumor growth and progression in TME (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Zhang et al., 2021</xref>). A previous study found that low infiltration of CD68 + macrophages was associated with an inferior prognosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Croci et al., 2021</xref>). Similarly, our study has yielded similar results, revealing a noteworthy correlation between a high proportion of CD68 + macrophages in the TME and improved prognosis. Additionally, by analyzing the datasets, we observed a higher proportion of M1 macrophages infiltration compared to M2 macrophages. This suggests that, within our DLBCL cohort, these macrophages may also exhibit the M1 phenotype and consequently play a protective role against tumor progression.</p><p>CD8 is widely recognized as a marker of CD8 + T cells, also known as cytotoxic T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Farhood et al., 2019</xref>). These cells are crucial for the immune response against tumors. However, in DLBCL, CD8 + T cells exhibits elevated levels of inhibitory molecules on their surface, such as PD-1, PD-L1, and TIM3. High expression of TIM3, an inhibitory immune checkpoint receptor, on CD8 + T cells has been associated with tumor progression and poor outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Roussel et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Xu-Monette et al., 2019</xref>). These inhibitory molecules may impair the function of CD8 + T cells and hinder their anti-tumor activity. Surprisingly, our study demonstrates a correlation between the infiltration of CD8 +T cells and favorable prognosis in DLBCL. Here, we propose a hypothesis that in our study, the observed high expression of VCAN might create a suppressive environment for PD-1 + CD8+ T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Wight et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hirani et al., 2021</xref>). Intriguingly, our study revealed a statistically significant correlation between VCAN expression, C1QB expression, and CD8 + T cell infiltration. VCAN has the potential to modulate immune infiltration by reducing the immunosuppressive phenotype of immune cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Huang et al., 2021</xref>), thus enabling a more efficient anti-tumor response. This aspect is still worth of consideration.</p><p>Taken together, our findings underscore the significant roles of VCAN, CD3G, and C1QB, which influence both the TME and the behavior of tumor cells. The interaction between each component and the TME is rather complicated. To fully comprehend the underlying mechanisms and identify potential therapeutic targets in DLBCL, further investigation is required.</p><p>However, this study still has several limitations that should be addressed. First, the patients included in this study were from a single center, which may introduce biases into the results. Although we made efforts to minimize these biases, it is inevitable that some may persist. Second, we hypothesized that VCAN, CD3G, and C1QB could serve as continuous prognostic parameters, thereby eliminating the need for a cut-off. However, the methodology used in this study, which utilized IHC staining to assess the protein expression levels, may have potential limitations. While IHC is a widely used technique, additional validation is needed to confirm the prognostic value of VCAN, CD3G, and C1QB in DLBCL. Furthermore, due to the potential variability in interpreting IHC results across different centers, a standardized coefficient and formula have not been established to calculate the final prognostic index for patients with DLBCL. Developing a standardized approach would be beneficial in ensuring consistent and accurate interpretation of IHC results. To address these limitations and expand upon our findings, future studies should strive to incorporate a diverse range of patients from multiple centers. Additionally, it is crucial to employ rigorous experimental techniques to authenticate the prognostic significance of VCAN, CD3G, and C1QB in DLBCL.</p></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing – original draft</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Validation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing – original draft</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Resources, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Resources, Formal analysis, Supervision, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Supervision, Methodology, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>The study was designed according to the Declaration of Helsinki and approved by the institutional ethics committee of Cancer Hospital Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences.

They show that increased tumor purity (ie, a higher proportion of tumor cells relative to surrounding stromal components) is associated with worse prognosis. They then show that three genes associated with tumor purity (VCAN, CD3G, and C1QB) correlate with patterns of immune cell infiltration and can be used to create a risk scoring system that predicts prognosis, which can be replicated by immunohistochemistry (IHC), and response to some therapies.</p><p>(1) The two strengths of the study are its relatively large sample size (n = 190) and the strong prognostic significance of the risk scoring system. It is worth noting that the validation of this scoring with IHC, a simple technique already routinely used for the diagnosis and classification of DLBCL, increases the potential for clinical translation. However, the correlative nature of the study limits the conclusions that can be drawn in regards to links between the risk scoring system, the tumor microenvironment, and the biology of DLBCL.</p><p>(2) The tumor microenvironment has been extensively studied in DLBCL and a prognostic implication has already been established (for instance, Steen et al., Cancer Cell, 2021). In addition, associations have already been established in non-Hodgkin lymphoma between prognosis and expression of C1QB (Rapier-Sharman et al., Journal of Bioinformatics and Systems Biology, 2022), VCAN (S. Hu et al., Blood, 2013), and CD3G (Chen et al., Medical Oncology, 2022). Nevertheless, one of the strengths and novelty aspect of the study is the combination of these 3 genes into a risk score that is also valid by immunohistochemistry (IHC), which substantially facilitates a potential clinical translation.</p><p>(3) Figures 1A-B: tumor purity is calculated using the ESTIMATE (Estimation of Stromal and Immune cells in Malignant Tumor tissues using Expression data) algorithm (Yoshihara et al., Nature Communications, 2013). The ESTIMATE algorithm is based on two gene signatures (&quot;stromal&quot; and &quot;immune&quot;). It is therefore expected that tumor purity measured by the ESTIMATE algorithm will correlate with the expression of multiple genes. Importantly, C1QB is included in the stromal signature of the ESTIMATE algorithm meaning that, by definition, it will be correlated with tumor purity in that setting.</p><p>(4) Figure 2A: as established in figure 1C, high tumor purity is associated with worse prognosis. Later in the manuscript, it is also shown that C1QB expression is associated with worse prognosis. However, figure 2A shows that C1QB is associated with decreased tumor purity. It therefore makes it less likely that the prognostic role of C1QB expression is related to its impact on tumor purity. The prognostic impact could be related to different patterns of immune cell infiltration, as shown later. However, the evidence presented in the study is correlative and nature and not sufficient to draw this conclusion.</p><p>(5) Figure 3G: although there is a strong prognostic implication of the risk score on prognosis, the correlation between the risk score and tumor purity is significant but not very strong (R = 0.376). It is therefore likely that other important biological factors explain the correlation between the risk score and prognosis, as suggested in the gene set enrichment analysis that is later performed.</p><p>(6) Figure 6: the drug sensitivity analysis includes a wide range of established and investigational drugs with varied mechanisms of action. Although the difference in sensitivity between tumors with low and high risk scores show statistical significance for certain drugs, the absolute difference appears small in most cases and is of unclear biological significance. In addition, even though the risk score is statistically related to drug sensitivity, there is no direct evidence that the differences in drug sensitivity are directly related to tumor purity.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="author-comment" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.92841.3.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Ye</surname><given-names>Zhenbang</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Cancer Hospital of Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Beijing</named-content></addr-line><country>China</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Huang</surname><given-names>Ning</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Cancer Hospital of Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Beijing</named-content></addr-line><country>China</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Fu</surname><given-names>Yongliang</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Cancer Hospital of Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Beijing</named-content></addr-line><country>China</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Tian</surname><given-names>Rongle</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Cancer Hospital of Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Beijing</named-content></addr-line><country>China</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Liming</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Cancer Hospital of Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Beijing</named-content></addr-line><country>China</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Huang</surname><given-names>Wenting</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Cancer Hospital of Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Beijing</named-content></addr-line><country>China</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>eLife assessment</bold></p><p>The findings in this study are useful and may have practical implications for predicting DLBCL risk subject to further validating the bioinformatics outcomes.

In fact, we have searched the treatment information of DLBCL patients in our own cohort, however, unfortunately all patients were treated strictly according to the guidelines issued by authorities of China, which suit Chinese patients fine but do not include the drugs explored in the present study. Therefore, more further investigations should be designed and conducted to validate our conclusion. Here, we provided a possible direction for future studies base on large cohorts, which could not only provide more reliable conclusions, but gain more attentions to the role of tumor microenvironment in influencing outcome and drug sensitivity.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Public Reviews:</bold></p></disp-quote><p>Sincere thanks for all reviewers’ positive comments on our study and their helpful recommendations for improving our manuscript. For this part, we have sorted out the comments and recommendations from all reviewers, and made corresponding revisions. And here are our responses.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(1) How did we determined the three genes (VCAN, C1QB and CD3G) in the prognostic model?</p></disp-quote><p>Just as was mentioned in the “Prognostic model” in Materials and Methods section, the gene was selected by “survival” package in R. After we obtained the nine genes, we input the expression value of them, and analyzed with “survival” package in R. And the function “step” in that package can optimize the model, that is, to construct a model with as less factors as possible, and the finally enrolled factors were representative and presented the least collinearity. Through this way, the prognostic model we got could be more practical in clinical practice.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) Different centers have different protocols of IHC, so how could we put this model into clinical practice under this circumstance?</p></disp-quote><p>Not only did different centers have different protocols, the materials like antibodies also vary. Therefore, there is actually a long way to go in putting our study into clinical practice. As far as we’re concerned, there are at least three problems to solve. First, diagnostic antibodies should be used in clinical practice, which usually manifest better specificity and sensitivity. And this may be the reason why the staining of VCAN and C1QB was strong and difficult to differentiate. Second, a standardized protocol should be made. Last but not least, more precise analyses and studies should be conducted to make it clear which type of cells specifically express these genes (just as was mentioned by Reviewer #2). We are now endeavoring to solve these problems by utilizing as many techniques as possible, like multi-omics and mIHC. From revealing the true expression pattern to developing high quality antibodies and even standardized test kit, we are looking forward to a clinical translation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) The analyses about immune infiltration and the key genes in DLBCL were superficial, limited within the correlation analyses.</p></disp-quote><p>Due to the model constructed based on tumor purity of DLBCL, the risk score could be associated with the enrichment of cell functions. We conducted GSEA analysis based on the differentially expressed genes between high-risk group and low-risk group in the two datasets (Figure 5H-I). It showed that the extracellular organization and cellular adhesion were different between the two groups, in which way the immune infiltration and activity might be regulated owing to the motility of immune cells. Besides, we have validated the infiltration of M1 macrophages and M2 macrophages with our own cohort (Supplementary Figure 3P).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) The drug sensitivity was just analyzed based on the model, which should be validated in real world research or lab study. And the sensitivity score seemed not different too much in most cases, even though there were statistical significance.</p></disp-quote><p>We tried to search the treatment information of DLBCL patients in our own cohort, however, unfortunately all patients were treated strictly according to the guidelines issued by authorities of China, which suit Chinese patients fine but do not include the drugs explored in the present study.

Here, we provided a possible direction for future studies base on large cohorts, which could not only provide more reliable conclusions, but gain more attentions to the role of tumor microenvironment in influencing outcome and drug sensitivity. As for the differences between high- and low-risk group, as a matter of fact, sometimes a little dose of drug could have a huge effect, because the dose-effect curve is usually nonlinear. Therefore, reduce the dose, even just 1%, the adverse effects could be avoided. To sum up, the drug sensitivity analyses in our study could provide more possibility for clinical trial and practice, and we are taking it into consideration to design reasonable clinical research.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) C1QB was associated with decreased tumor purity and worse prognosis, but decreased tumor purity was related to better prognosis. How to elucidate the contradiction?</p></disp-quote><p>Just as discussed in Discussion section, previous studies have revealed the role of C1QB in promoting an immunosuppressive microenvironment in cancer (see reference 22-26). C1QB might recruit the infiltration of pro-tumor immune cells, resulting in a reducing tumor purity on its perspective. However, the immune microenvironment was regulated by multi factors which form a network and combat or synergize each other. The statistical analysis often gives a possible phenomenon, but could not provide mechanism explanation. Therefore, more mechanic studies are needed to reveal the connection and key node. This is exactly what we will explore next.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(6) Others:</p></disp-quote><p>(1) Line 51 has been rewritten.</p><p>(2) References for ESTIMATE algorithm (reference 16) and CD3G+ T cells has been added (reference 17).</p><p>(3) The illegible figure labels might be caused by the incompatibility between the PDF file we submitted and the submission system.
