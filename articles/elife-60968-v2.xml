Chloroplast biogenesis requires the import of thousands of nuclear-encoded preproteins by essential import receptor TOC159. We demonstrate that the small ubiquitin-related modifier (SUMO) pathway crosstalks with the ubiquitin–proteasome pathway to affect TOC159 stability during early plant development. We identified a SUMO3-interacting motif (SIM) in the TOC159 GTPase domain and a SUMO3 covalent SUMOylation site in the membrane domain. A single K to R substitution (K1370R) in the M-domain disables SUMOylation. Compared to wild-type TOC159, TOC159K1370R was destabilized under UPS-inducing stress conditions. However, TOC159K1370R recovered to same protein level as wild-type TOC159 in the presence of a proteasome inhibitor. Thus, SUMOylation partially stabilizes TOC159 against UPS-dependent degradation under stress conditions. Our data contribute to the evolving model of tightly controlled proteostasis of the TOC159 import receptor during proplastid to chloroplast transition.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>chloroplast</kwd><kwd>SUMO3</kwd><kwd>TOC159</kwd><kwd>proteostasis</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>A. thaliana</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001711</institution-id><institution>Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Förderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>31003A_156998</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kessler</surname><given-names>Felix</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001711</institution-id><institution>Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Förderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>31003A _176191</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kessler</surname><given-names>Felix</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>SUMOylation contributes to the fine-tuning of the proteostatic equilibrium of essential chloroplast protein import receptor TOC159 at early plant development.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Chloroplasts are unique organelles that carry out photosynthesis. Although chloroplasts contain their own genome, the majority of chloroplast proteins are encoded by the nuclear genome and synthesized as preproteins in cytosol, and these preproteins are imported into the chloroplast through TOC-TIC complexes (<bold>T</bold>ranslocon at the <bold>O</bold>uter or <bold>I</bold>nner membrane of the <bold>C</bold>hloroplast) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Jarvis and López-Juez, 2013</xref>). The core of the TOC complex contains two related GTP-dependent preprotein receptor GTPases, TOC159 and TOC33, which interact with a β-barrel membrane protein, TOC75, that forms a protein-conducting channel, and is regulated by specific interactions with nuclear-encoded preproteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Schnell et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kessler et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Jarvis et al., 1998</xref>). TOC159 is a major point of entry for highly abundant photosynthesis-associated preproteins arriving at the translocon complex. It is therefore regarded as the major chloroplast protein import receptor. TOC159 has a three-domain structure: a highly acidic N-terminal domain (A-domain), a central GTP-binding domain (G-domain), and a C-terminal membrane anchor domain (M-domain). Chloroplast biogenesis, the transition of a non-photosynthetic proplastid to a photosynthetically active chloroplast, depends on the essential import receptor TOC159 and its mutation results in non-photosynthetic albino plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bauer et al., 2000</xref>).</p><p>Recent studies have shown that during the etioplast to chloroplast transition, the TOC components are ubiquitinated by a novel chloroplast RING-type E3 ubiquitin ligase SP1 (suppressor of ppi1 locus 1). Ubiquitinated TOC components are extracted from the chloroplast outer envelope membrane with the help of SP2 (an Omp85-like β-barrel protein) and Cdc48 (a cytosolic AAA+ chaperone) providing the extraction force. The ubiquitinated TOC component is degraded by the 26S proteasome in the cytosol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Ling et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Ling et al., 2019</xref>). This proteolytic pathway has been named CHLORAD. In a different context, chloroplast biogenesis takes place during the proplastid to chloroplast transition. It is dependent on the plant hormone gibberellic acid (GA). Under unfavorable seed germination conditions when gibberellic concentrations are low, a DELLA (RGL2) (a negative regulator of GA signaling) promotes the ubiquitylation and degradation of TOC159 by the 26S proteasome to insertion into the outer membrane of the chloroplast. This mechanism delays the onset of chloroplast biogenesis at an early developmental stage and has been shown to be independent of SP1 and presumably CHLORAD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Shanmugabalaji et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>A recent study employed a yeast-two-hybrid screen to identify putative Arabidopsis small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) substrates. The E2 SUMO conjugating enzyme (SCE1) was used as bait, and TOC159 was identified as a high-probability interaction candidate. TOC159 contains a predicted SUMO attachment site (ψKXE/D) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Elrouby and Coupland, 2010</xref>). The SUMO, a 11 kDa protein, covalently modifies a large number of proteins. SUMO-dependent regulation is involved in many cellular processes, including gene expression, signal transduction, genome maintenance, protein localization, and activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gill, 2004</xref>). SUMOylation plays a crucial role in plant development and stress responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Elrouby, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Augustine and Vierstra, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Morrell and Sadanandom, 2019</xref>). This reversible and dynamic SUMOylation starts with the attachment of SUMO to the target protein by a conjugation pathway, mechanistically analogous to the ubiquitylation system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Augustine and Vierstra, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Novatchkova et al., 2012</xref>). The target protein covalently modified by SUMO performs specific functions, which may subsequently be reversed by SUMO proteases that hydrolyze the isopeptide bond between SUMO and the target protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Yates et al., 2016</xref>). In addition, SUMO can also interact with target proteins through a SUMO-interacting motif (SIM). The non-covalent SUMO–SIM interaction may work as a molecular signal for protein–protein interaction and affect stability of proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Geiss-Friedlander and Melchior, 2007</xref>).</p><p>In this study, we address the role of SUMO modification of TOC159 in the context of the proplastid to chloroplast transition and investigate both covalent SUMOylation and non-covalent SUMO interaction. The biochemical and genetic evidence showed that the TOC159 G-domain contains a SIM that interacts with the SUMO3 and that SUMOylation of TOC159 at the M-domain is the key regulatory mechanism to protect it from further depletion under low GA conditions. The data provides new insight for TOC159 SUMO-binding and SUMOylation, demonstrating that SUMOylation positively influences protein stability with regard to the UPS. Thereby SUMOylation contributes to the proteostatic fine-tuning of TOC159 levels during TOC159-dependent chloroplast biogenesis in early plant development.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>SUMO3 interacts with the TOC159 G-domain and is SUMOylated at the TOC159 M-domain</title><p>An earlier study using an in vitro SUMOylation assay showed that of the three SUMO isoforms (SUMO1, SUMO2, and SUMO3), only SUMO3 SUMOylated TOC159 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Elrouby and Coupland, 2010</xref>). TOC159 has a N-terminal A- (acidic-), a central G- (GTP-binding domain), and a C-terminal M- (membrane) domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bauer et al., 2000</xref>). The A-domain is known to be non-essential for TOC159 function and exquisitely sensitive to protease activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Agne et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Agne et al., 2010</xref>). It was excluded from our DNA constructs and only the TOC159 G- and M-domains (TOC159GM) were used. In addition to a covalent SUMOylation site, TOC159 may also have SIM. To investigate the possibility of SUMO interaction with TOC159GM, we used the GPS-SUMO prediction algorithm (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://sumosp.biocuckoo.org/online.php">http</ext-link><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://sumosp.biocuckoo.org/online.php">://sumosp.biocuckoo.org/online.php</ext-link>) to search for SIM in TOC159GM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Zhao et al., 2014</xref>). Based on the search results, there is a predicted SIM (VKVLP) in the G-domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). To analyze the physical interaction between TOC159GM and SUMO isoforms, we performed yeast two-hybrid assays using TOC159G and TOC159M separately as baits. TOC159G interacted exclusively with SUMO3, but not SUMO1 and SUMO2. None of the SUMO isoforms interacted with TOC159M in the yeast two-hybrid assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).

A high scoring consensus SUMOylation site with a strongly conserved motif (TGVKLED) and containing a potentially SUMOylatable lysine (K1370) was identified within the M-domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref>). The SUMOylation motif as well as K1370 of Arabidopsis are well conserved in other plants species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). To investigate the SUMOylation of TOC159GM, we selected the SUMO3 isoform based on the earlier in vitro study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Elrouby and Coupland, 2010</xref>). We infiltrated <italic>Nicotiana benthamiana</italic> with 35S-GFP-TOC159GM or GFP-TOC159GM-K/R (replacing lysine with a non-sumoylatable arginine residue at position 1370) each together with or without 35S-SUMO3-MYC. To analyze the infiltration experiments identical amounts of total extracts were subjected to immunoprecipitation using anti-GFP-beads followed by western blotting. An anti-GFP antibody was used to indicate total expression of GFP-TOC159GM and GFP-TOC159GM-K/R and resulted in bands of similar intensities in all four experiments. Anti-MYC and anti-SUMO3 were used to analyze conjugation of SUMO3-MYC to GFP-TOC159GM and GFP-TOC159GM-K/R. The western blotting using anti-MYC and anti-SUMO3 antibodies resulted in strong signals for GFP-TOC159GM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>, lane 3) but only very weak ones for GFP-TOC159GM-K/R (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>, lane 4) when co-expressed with SUMO3-MYC. No signals were detected when the GFP-TOC159GM constructs were expressed in the absence of SUMO3-MYC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>, lanes 1 and 2). Note that GFP-TOC159GM co-infiltration with SUMO3 resulted in a much higher molecular mass band when analyzed with anti-MYC or -SUMO3 than the main, strong GFP-TOC159GM band detected with anti-GFP. It therefore appears that upon co-expression with SUMO3-MYC only a small fraction of GFP-TOC159GM was present in the SUMOylated form and that it had a higher molecular mass than GFP-TOC159GM alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). We further checked the SUMOylation assay by co-infiltration of GFP alone (control), GFP-TOC159GM, and GFP-TOC159GM-K/R together with SUMO3 in the <italic>N. benthamiana</italic> system. The co-immunoprecipitation gave strong signals for GFP-TOC159GM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B</xref>, lane 2) but only very weak signals for GFP-TOC159GM-K/R (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B</xref>, lane 3) and no detectable signals for GFP alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B</xref>, lane 1) when using the anti-MYC antibody.

Apart from a covalent SUMOylation motif, the GPS-SUMO algorithm identified a conserved non-covalent SIM (‘VKVLP’) in the G-domain of TOC159. We confirmed this prediction using a yeast two-hybrid assay and co-immunoprecipitation experiment. It also revealed that the G-domain specifically interacted with the SUMO3 isoform and not with SUMO1 and 2. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>).

Expression of non-SUMOylatable GFP-TOC159GM-K/R (containing the K1370R substitution) restored a wild-type green phenotype in the GFP-TOC159GM-K/R:<italic>ppi2</italic> Arabidopsis plants. Note that <italic>ppi2</italic> mutant plants normally have an albino phenotype. Based on the presence of wild-type levels of TOC75 and TOC33, it appeared that the TOC complex assembled normally in the GFP-TOC159GM-K/R:<italic>ppi2</italic> plants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,B</xref>). Confocal laser microscopy localized GFP-TOC159GM-K/R at the envelope of the chloroplast (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). Taken together, these results indicate that outer membrane insertion, TOC complex assembly, as well as chloroplast biogenesis take place normally under standard growth conditions despite the K1370R mutation and disabled SUMOylation.</p><p>In Arabidopsis, SUMOylation is triggered by environmental stimuli including biotic and abiotic stress. Hormone signaling (GA, auxin, brassinosteroids, and ABA) and development (root, seed, embryo, and meristem) are the main biological processes associated with SUMOylation in plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Conti et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Miura et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Ishida et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Augustine et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Orosa-Puente et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kwak et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Srivastava et al., 2020</xref>). While SUMOylation is independent of the ubiquitination pathway, there is the complex crosstalk between these two pathways. SUMOylation can promote the UPS-dependent degradation through SUMO-targeted Ub ligases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Perry et al., 2008</xref>). Contrary to this, SUMOylation may also protect from UPS-dependent degradation by blocking the ubiquitination of lysine residues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Creton and Jentsch, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Jentsch and Psakhye, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Ramachandran et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Rott et al., 2017</xref>). Here, we explored the connection between TOC159 SUMOylation and the UPS-mediated TOC159 degradation under low GA during early developmental stages in seed germination.</p><p>We previously demonstrated that low GA concentrations brought about by PAC promote the DELLA (RGL2)-dependent TOC159 degradation via the UPS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Shanmugabalaji et al., 2018</xref>). Under low GA, GFP-TOC159GM-K/R accumulated to significantly (&lt;50%) lower levels than wild-type GFP-TOC159GM in the respective overexpression lines. In addition, the TOC159-interacting TOC-complex core proteins TOC75 and −33 also accumulated to considerably lower levels in the GFP-TOC159GM-K/R:<italic>ppi2</italic> line under low GA presumably to maintain complex stoichiometry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A,B</xref>). Typically, a small fraction of the SUMO target protein pool undergoes SUMOylation under a specific cellular condition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Johnson, 2004</xref>). The reduced levels under low GA of GFP-TOC159GM-K/R when compared to the wild-type protein were attributed to increased UPS-mediated protein degradation as both proteins recovered to the same protein levels in the presence of the proteasome inhibitor MG132 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D,E</xref>).</p><p>We conclude that SUMOylation partially stabilizes TOC159 against UPS-dependent degradation under specific conditions such as low GA during early development. The photosynthesis-associated proteins are considered the preferred transport cargoes of TOC159 because they fail to accumulate in the <italic>ppi2</italic> mutant lacking TOC159. They tended to accumulate to a lesser degree in GFP-TOC159GM-K/R:<italic>ppi2</italic> plants under low GA in the presence of PAC, but not in statistically significant fashion. The explanation may be that the levels of TOC159 are already low in the GFP-TOC159GM-K/R:ppi2 plants in the absence of PAC and allow only for relatively small changes in the accumulation of photosynthesis-associated proteins in the presence of PAC. Nevertheless, the results suggest that SUMOylation at the M-domain of TOC159 serves to fine tune preprotein import under low GA.</p><p>Based on the results, we propose a hypothetical model for the role of SUMOylation during early developmental stages, when environmental conditions are unfavorable and GA concentrations are low. As previously demonstrated, the chloroplast import receptor TOC159 is ubiquitylated prior to outer membrane insertion by an unknown E3-ligase other than SP1 and degraded via the UPS. In addition, its G-domain interacts with SUMO3, the physiological consequences of which remain unknown but may regulate interaction with DELLA system. The M-domain may be SUMOylated by SUMO3, protecting to some extent against UPS-dependent degradation. When the environmental conditions become more favorable, GA levels increase, and the GA receptor-DELLA complex is degraded by the UPS and TOC159 liberated for outer membrane insertion. The non-ubiquitinated TOC159 is assembled into the TOC complex thus allowing proplastids to differentiate into chloroplasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). In the CHLORAD pathway, cytosolic Cdc48 extracts ubiquitinated TOC proteins from the outer membrane of the chloroplast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Ling et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Shanmugabalaji and Kessler, 2019</xref>). The intriguing connection between the Cdc48 and SUMO pathways in chromatin dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Franz et al., 2016</xref>) suggests that the SUMO pathway might also act on the CHLORAD pathway at specific developmental stage, but we currently do not offer evidence for such a mechanism. Our data specifically implicate SUMOylation and probably SUMO interaction in the control of proplastid to chloroplast transition by regulation of TOC159 levels in early plant development.</p><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Hypothetical model for the SUMOylation-dependent fine-tuning of chloroplast biogenesis at the level of the TOC159 import receptor in early plant development.</title><p>Environmental conditions influence the concentrations of gibberellic acid (GA) that accumulate upon seed imbibition. When active GA levels are reduced by stress (-GA; left-hand panel), DELLA (RGL2) accumulates and sequesters TOC159, which is then degraded via the UPS. In addition, TOC159 interacts and is also covalently SUMOylated by SUMO3. Covalent SUMOylation protects TOC159 against UPS-mediated degradation and supports the accumulation of photosynthesis-associated proteins in the chloroplast. Any unimported preproteins are degraded in the cytosol via the UPS. When GA concentrations increase (+GA, right-hand panel), the GA receptor complex binds to DELLA, which is degraded by the UPS. TOC159 is then free to assemble into the TOC complex. Protein import is thus enabled, allowing proplastids to differentiate into chloroplasts.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image"

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Christian Hardtke as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Danny Schnell (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>As the editors have judged that your manuscript is of interest, but as described below that additional experiments are required before it is published, we would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). First, because many researchers have temporarily lost access to the labs, we will give authors as much time as they need to submit revised manuscripts. We are also offering, if you choose, to post the manuscript to bioRxiv (if it is not already there) along with this decision letter and a formal designation that the manuscript is &quot;in revision at <italic>eLife</italic>&quot;. Please let us know if you would like to pursue this option. (If your work is more suitable for medRxiv, you will need to post the preprint yourself, as the mechanisms for us to do so are still in development.)</p><p>Summary:</p><p>Based on previous results that Toc159 can be modified by SUMOylation by SUMO3, the authors confirm interactions between a truncated version of TOC159 and SUMO3 using Y2H and co-IPs. They find that this interaction is substantially decreased with a K1370-&gt;R mutant that abolishes a high-confidence SUMOylation site, but that this K1370R mutant can complement the <italic>ppi2</italic> (toc159) mutant as efficiently as the wild type version of TOC159. However, under conditions that normally deplete the TOC complex (paclobutrazol-induced low GA conditions during germination), they find that the K1370R mutant is more sensitive to degradation, but ultimately this had no significant effect on chloroplast protein import. The authors propose a model in which under low GA conditions, TOC159 is either SUMOylated and stable or ubiquitinated and degraded, suggesting an important balance between these post-translational modifications. All three reviewers agree that while the findings are interesting, additional experimentation, particularly controls, are required to support the model that the authors present.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Although compelling, the authors' hypothesis would be strengthened if they could demonstrate the impact of SUMOylation on the accumulation of photosynthetic proteins or chloroplast biogenesis. Can the authors test additional photosynthetic proteins to see if they can detect a defect in accumulation? Did the authors consider including stress conditions to test if SUMOylation impacts chloroplast biogenesis or protein accumulation under non-ideal conditions? Alternatively, does the TOC159GM-K/R impact de-etiolation?</p><p>2) The model speculates that SUMOylated TOC159 is not incorporated into the chloroplast membrane or into a functional TOC complex and that &quot;deSUMOylation of TOC159 by a SUMO protease (ULP) assists assembly into the TOC complex&quot;. What is the evidence that SUMO-Toc159 is cytoplasmic and not at the chloroplast envelope? Figure 2D shows all Toc159 at the chloroplast envelope. Is it possible that SUMOylation works downstream of DELLA to stabilize TOC complexes that are assembled at the membrane? Please present these data or revise the model and associated text accordingly.</p><p>3) It is a stretch to call the TOC159GM-K/R mutant &quot;non-SUMOylatable&quot;, since there are there are clear bands on the K/R lanes of Figure 1F. There are several other high confidence SUMOylation sites in TOC159. What was the rationale for selecting only one SUMOylation site on Toc159? Please present a blot with TOC159GM-K/R and SUMO3-Myc alone in Figure 1F so that readers can evaluate the anti-SUMO/anti-MYC signal in this case and revise the text accordingly unless all anti-SUMO signal is abolished in this experiment.</p><p>4) Controls seem to be missing from the co-IPs in Figure 1. Please present a GFP/MYC-only (or even better, SUMO1-MYC) as a negative control.</p><p>5) The authors should switch the vectors of the yeast two-hybrid constructs (Figure 1) to demonstrate that the interaction is not a vector artifact. This is a standard control for this assay.</p><p>6) The authors should quantify the protein bands in Figure 3C. Although they conclude the RGL2 does not change, the levels appear to be lower in the K/R mutant under normal and PAC treatment. Although this is beyond the scope of the current study, it would be interesting to determine if the K/R plants exhibit a germination defect if RGL2 levels are lower.</p><p>7) In Figure 3A to show clear protein stability effects for K/R and WT TOC159 in the during PAC treatment the authors would really need to use cycloheximide treatment to verify the stability of the K/R form to substantiate their claims.</p><p>8) What are the possible effects of using a truncated form of TOC159? This could also explain why they see a knock-on reduction in TOC75 and TOC33. The A-domain is protease sensitive, but could this sensitivity be underpinned by post-translational modifications? Please provide additional experimental evidence or revise the discussion of these results.</p><p>9) The &quot;phylogenetic analysis&quot; to document that K1370 is conserved need to be rigorously conducted and methods need to be reported to give context to the &quot;alignment&quot; presented in Figure 1E.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.60968.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Although compelling, the authors' hypothesis would be strengthened if they could demonstrate the impact of SUMOylation on the accumulation of photosynthetic proteins or chloroplast biogenesis.

Under low GA, TOC159 interacts with RGL2 in the nucleo-cytoplasmic compartment and is degraded prior to the insertion into the chloroplast outer membrane (Shanmugabalaji et al., 2018).

We have previously demonstrated that constructs lacking the A-domain and consisting only of the G- and M-domains (TOC159GM) and a tag at the N-terminus complemented the Toc159 null mutant <italic>ppi2 (</italic>Agne et al., 2009) and were therefore functional. Because the A-domain of TOC159 is unstable (i.e. resulting in multiple TOC159 bands due to fragmentation) it is normally necessary to work with N-terminally tagged TOC159 constructs without the A-domain (this reply is also valid for comment 8).</p><p>We analysed the TOC159GM domain for SUMO sites using the GPS SUMO prediction algorithm with a high threshold (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://sumosp.biocuckoo.org/online.php">http://sumosp.biocuckoo.org/online.php</ext-link>). We found two predicted SUMOylation sites at the M-domain but not in the G-domain (Figure 1—figure supplement 2A). Based on the superior SUMOylation consensus sequence pattern, p-value and score, we selected the site at 1370. The in planta SUMOylation assay demonstrates that the vast majority of SUMOylation of TOC159GM occurs at TOC159GM-K1370. (Figure 1F and new Figure 1—figure supplement 2B). We therefore concluded that any other potential sites are not SUMOylated efficiently or that the observed signals were spurious.</p><p>We didn't include the SUMO3-Myc alone in the experiments. TOC159GM alone (Figure 1F, lane 1) and TOC159GM-K/R alone (Figure 1F, lane 2) did not result in any high molecular weight anti-MYC signals in the Western blot.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Controls seem to be missing from the co-IPs in Figure 1.

(Figure 1—figure supplement 2B). The co-immunoprecipitated GFP with SUMO3-MYC ( lane 1), did not result in any high molecular weight signal with anti-MYC compared with GFP-TOC159GM with SUMO3-MYC sample ( lane 2). The results further confirm the specificity of SUMOylation of GFP-TOC159GM.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The authors should switch the vectors of the yeast two-hybrid constructs (Figure 1) to demonstrate that the interaction is not a vector artifact. This is a standard control for this assay.</p></disp-quote><p>While we have not been able to do this in useful time due to the pandemic (limited lab time), we added a new Figure 1C.

The results revealed no effect of cycloheximide on either TOC159GM-K/R or TOC159GM levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig2">Author response image 2B</xref>).

Please provide additional experimental evidence or revise the discussion of these results.</p></disp-quote><p>See reply to question 3 regarding the use of a truncated form of TOC159 lacking the A-domain. In a previous report we demonstrated that TOC159 A domain cleavage, occurs at a conserved protease cleavage site (Agne et al., 2010) and at a specific ratio of cleaved to uncleaved TOC159 (Zufferey et al., 2017). But how this protease sensitivity is underpinned by post-translational modifications is unknown.</p><p>Regarding the knock-on reduction of TOC75 and TOC33: we previously demonstrated that under low GA, the full length TOC159 protein level is reduced by UPS implicating an unidentified E3-ligase, whereas the reduced levels of TOC75 and TOC33 implicate the outer membrane E3 ligase SP1 (Shanmugabalaji et al., 2018). In this manuscript, we attribute the knock-on reductions of TOC75 and TOC33 protein to the same mechanism.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) The &quot;phylogenetic analysis&quot; to document that K1370 is conserved need to be rigorously conducted and methods need to be reported to give context to the &quot;alignment&quot; presented in Figure 1E.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for pointing out this requirement regarding the &quot;phylogenetic analysis&quot;.
