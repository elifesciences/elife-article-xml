Population-wide restrictions (‘lockdowns’) were imposed in most countries throughout the pandemic closing down schools and workplaces and restricting travel to reduce the transmission of COVID-19 and to limit the potential burden on the healthcare systems. Within the healthcare system, prioritisations and re-organisations were done to ensure sufficient capacity to take care of patients in need of hospitalisation due to COVID-19. The prioritisations within the healthcare system resulted in a temporary halting of the cervical cancer screening programme in most of the world. On the contrary, in Denmark, the cervical cancer screening programmes remained open throughout the pandemic. At the same time, however, at the national televised press conferences, the health authorities asked the Danish population to stay at home if possible, and concurrently, the Danish College of General Practitioners recommended general practitioners to postpone routine cervical smears during a 4 wk period in March/April 2020 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Dansk Selskab for Almen Medicin, 2020</xref>). Nevertheless, the cervical cancer screening programme continued – and invitations and reminders were sent out – throughout the pandemic in Denmark.</p><p>It is estimated that the disruptions to the cervical cancer screening programmes in high-income countries because of the pandemic could potentially increase cervical cancer cases by up to 5–6% and increase the number of cervical cancers detected at a higher stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Smith et al., 2021</xref>). Disruptions to the cervical cancer screening programme may therefore be worrisome. Marked reductions in the number of women screened for cervical cancer during the early phase of the pandemic have been reported in many other countries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Castanon et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cancer Registry of Norway, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Meggetto et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Ivanuš et al., 2021</xref>), whilst the participation in cervical cancer screening during the pandemic in Denmark has not yet been described.</p><p>It is well known that participation in cervical cancer screening is generally reduced among women of lower socio-economic status (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Harder et al., 2018</xref>) and among immigrant women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Hertzum-Larsen et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Badre-Esfahani et al., 2020</xref>). This divergence in participation may have been exacerbated during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, so far no studies have put spotlight on this.</p><p>In this large, population-based nationwide study, we examined the participation in cervical cancer screening during the COVID-19 pandemic in Denmark in comparison with the previous years. Moreover, we examined whether the participation in cervical cancer screening during the pandemic differed across population groups with different socio-economic status.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Setting</title><p>The study was set in Denmark, which has a population of approximately 5.8 million inhabitants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Statistics Denmark, 2021</xref>). Denmark has a tax-funded healthcare system, with universal access to healthcare for all residents including national screening programmes for breast, cervical, and colorectal cancer. The population-based administrative and health registries in Denmark can be linked through the unique personal identifier assigned to all residents at birth or immigration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Schmidt et al., 2014</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Schmidt et al., 2019</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>The cervical cancer screening programme</title><p>In Denmark, all women aged 23–64 y old are invited to participate in cervical cancer screening every 3 y (women aged 23–49 y old) or every 5 y (women aged 50–64 y old; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bonde et al., 2022</xref>). The women receive an invitation letter (electronic letters via secure digital e-mail since 2018; however, women exempted from digital mail still receive ordinary mail) with an invitation to book an appointment with their general practitioner for a cervical screening test. Reminders to participate in cervical cancer screening are sent out to non-participants after 3 mo and again after 6 mo. The obtained samples are analysed for cytology and/or HPV at a pathology department. The outcome of the test is sent to the woman and her general practitioner.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>The COVID-19 pandemic in Denmark</title><p>In Denmark, three main waves of the COVID-19 pandemic have occurred that is, in the spring of 2020, in the winter of 2020/2021, and again in the winter of 2021/2022 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Statens Serum Institut, 2021a</xref>).</p><p>In efforts to minimise the spread of the infection, population-wide restrictions (‘lockdown’) were imposed in Denmark 11 March 2020, and subsequently, large parts of the society were closed down. Within the healthcare system, elective procedures were cancelled or postponed, and resources were reallocated to take care of patients in need of hospitalisation because of COVID-19.</p><p>Extensive testing facilities were set up in Denmark from May 2020, providing COVID-19 tests free-of-charge to the whole population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Pottegård et al., 2020</xref>). In Denmark, laymen were trained to perform COVID-19 tests, which is in contrast to many other countries where healthcare personnel were allocated to perform COVID-19 tests. Vaccination against COVID-19 began in December 2020 in Denmark, and a high vaccination coverage has been achieved, and by March 2022, approximately 81% of the population had received two doses, and more than 61% had received three doses of the vaccine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Statens Serum Institut, 2021b</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Study population</title><p>The study population comprised all women aged 23–64 y old invited to participate in cervical cancer screening from 1 January 2015 to 30 September 2021, as registered in the Cervical Cancer Screening Database (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Rygaard, 2016</xref>), which contain information on all women invited to participate in cervical cancer screening in Denmark since 2009. The Cervical Cancer Screening Database comprises population data from the Civil Registration System (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Schmidt et al., 2014</xref>), including all persons with a permanent address in Denmark; cervical cancer cases are obtained from the Danish Cancer Register (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Gjerstorff, 2011</xref>), cervical cytology samples are obtained from the Danish Pathology Register (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bjerregaard and Larsen, 2011</xref>), and information on invitations and reminders is obtained from the invitation registration system.</p><p>We excluded invitations in women who died within 1 y since invitation (N=110), women who emigrated within 1 y since invitation (N=138), women residing in the Faroe Islands or Greenland (N=762), women with an unknown postal address (N=261), women who unregistered from the screening programme within 1 y since invitation (N=56,920), and invitations in women with missing information on region of residence (N=1742; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Flow-chart of the study population.</title></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-81522-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Exposure of interest</title><p>The exposure of interest was the COVID-19 pandemic in Denmark.

Age was defined at the date of invitation, as registered in the Cervical Cancer Screening Database (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Rygaard, 2016</xref>). From <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Statistics Denmark, 2021</xref>, we obtained information on ethnicity, marital status, educational level, and level of income. Ethnicity was categorised as Danish descent, western immigrant, non-western immigrant, and descendants of immigrants. Cohabitation status was categorised as living alone, co-habiting/co-living, and married (i.e. married or registered partnership) in accordance with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Statistics Denmark, 2021</xref>. Education level was defined in accordance with the International Standard Classification of Education (ISCED) of the United Nations Education, Scientific, and Cultural Organisation (UNESCO) into short (ISCED level 1–2), medium (ISCED level 3–5), and long (ISCED level 6–8; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Statistics Denmark, 2021</xref>). Income was defined as official disposable income depreciated to 2015 level and categorised into five quintiles. To indicate the level of healthcare use by each patient, we counted the total number of contacts (comprising face-to-face, telephone, and e-mail consultations) to general practitioners, private practising medical specialists, physiotherapists, and chiropractors in the year for invitation as registered in the Danish National Health Service Register (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Andersen et al., 2011</xref>), which contain information on visits to primary healthcare (e.g., general practitioners and medical specialists) in Denmark since 1990. We categorised healthcare usage into five quintiles of the data as rare (0–3 visits per year), low (4–6 visits per year), average (7–11 visits per year), high (12–18 visits per year), and frequent (≥19 visits per years).</p><p>Information on cohabitation status was only available from Statistics Denmark until the end of February 2021, whereas all other socio-economic variables were available until end of the study period.</p></sec><sec id="s2-8"><title>Statistical analyses</title><p>We examined characteristics of women invited to participate in cervical cancer screening during the study period. Thereafter, we examined the participation in cervical cancer screening within 90 d, 180 d, and 365 d since invitation among women invited to participate in screening per month and during the different phases of the pandemic overall and stratifying by the explanatory variables. Additionally, we examined time from invitation to participation in median number of d and interquartile interval overall and during the pandemic phases, in women eventually participating in the screening programme.</p><p>Using a generalised linear model with log link for the Poisson family with robust SE, we estimated prevalence ratios (PRs) and 95% CI of participation in cervical cancer screening within 90 d, 180 d, and 365 d, respectively, among women invited to participate in screening during the different phases of the pandemic overall and stratifying by the explanatory variables. Firstly, we calculated unadjusted analyses. Thereafter, the analyses were adjusted for month of invitation to allow for seasonality and year of invitation to take into account the underlying decreasing trend in participation in cervical cancer screening (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Regionernes Kliniske Kvalitetsudviklingsprogram, 2022</xref>). Finally, the analyses were adjusted for age to take into account the effect of age on the other explanatory variables. Furthermore, to take into account the effect of time on each of the socio-economic variables, we performed an interaction test between time and each of the socio-economic variables using a Wald test. These tests for interaction were statistically significant; however, to allow for interpretation of the estimates within each strata of the socio-economic variables, a stratifying approach was used.</p><p>All analyses were conducted using STATA version 17.0.</p></sec><sec id="s2-9"><title>Ethical considerations</title><p>The study is registered at the Central Denmark Region’s register of research projects (journal number 1-16-02-381-20).

The reduction in participation within 365 d was most pronounced among descendants of immigrants, among women with a low educational level, and a low income.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Comparison with previous studies and explanation of findings</title><p>In most countries, population-based screening for cervical cancer was halted at the start of the pandemic. This led to pronounced reductions in the number of women screened for cervical cancer during the early phase of the pandemic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Castanon et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cancer Registry of Norway, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Meggetto et al., 2021</xref>). To our knowledge, no studies have described the long-term participation in cervical cancer screening during the pandemic. We found a marked reduction (42% in pre-lockdown and 24% in first lockdown) in the short term (within 90 d) cervical cancer screening participation at the start of the pandemic compared with the previous years. This reduction in participation could be explained either by a change in health behaviour or could perhaps reflect inconsistent messages from the health authorities at the start of the pandemic. The screening programme was open, and invitations and reminders were sent out; however, at the same time, the health authorities asked the population to stay at home at the national televised press conferences, and simultaneously, the College of General Practitioners recommended general practitioners to postpone routine cervical screening samples during a 4 wk period in March/April 2020 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Dansk Selskab for Almen Medicin, 2020</xref>). The inconsistent health messages could thus have led women to not participate in screening. Congruently, a Danish qualitative study found that inconsistent health communication from the authorities led women to postpone or cancel their screening appointments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Kirkegaard et al., 2021</xref>). With the longer follow-up time, we observed a less reduced participation (11% in pre-lockdown and 8% in first lockdown within 180 d and only 3% in both pre-lockdown and first lockdown within 365 d), which was reflected by the longer time to participation (&gt;120 d versus approximately 89 d) at the early phase of the pandemic. The disruption to the cervical cancer screening programme in Denmark thus appear only to have a temporary effect with most women resuming cervical cancer screening with a longer follow-up period. This is in accordance with findings in a qualitative study showing that women were concerned about visiting healthcare settings during the pandemic but were willing to participate when screening programmes resumed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Wilson et al., 2021</xref>). The marked reduction in participation in screening during pre-lockdown and first lockdown could thus also reflect fear of infection among women at the early phase of the pandemic. During second lockdown, no overall change in participation was seen, indicating that the population had been accustomed to navigating the healthcare system during the pandemic. In the Danish cervical cancer screening programme, reminders are mailed to non-participants after 3 and 6 mo, and this could have prompted women postponing or cancelling their screening appointments at the start of the pandemic to participate at a later time point. Furthermore, the general health communication from the authorities changed throughout the pandemic initially, asking the population to stay at home and then later on reminding the population to seek healthcare when needed.</p><p>The severity of the pandemic and the pandemic response varied across the world with Denmark managing to keep the number of hospitalisations due to COVID-19 at relatively low level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Statens Serum Institut, 2021a</xref>). The pandemic response in Denmark included periodic lockdowns, extensive COVID-19 testing free-of-charge to the whole population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Pottegård et al., 2020</xref>), and a high COVID-19 vaccination coverage. The cervical cancer screening participation may therefore be different in other countries with a different pandemic response and a more severe impact of the pandemic.</p><p>Women of lower socio-economic position (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Harder et al., 2018</xref>) and immigrant women <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Hertzum-Larsen et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Badre-Esfahani et al., 2020</xref> have earlier been shown to have a lower participation in cervical cancer screening. This was evident from our study also in that immigrants, women living alone, and women with a low-income level had the lowest participation in cervical cancer screening throughout the study period. A concern is that the pandemic may have affected socially disadvantaged individuals disproportionally. We found an overall 3% reduction in participation within 365 d; however, among descendants of immigrants and among women with a low income, a 5% reduction was seen, and among women with a low educational level, a 4% reduction was found. It is therefore important to ensure that all women – regardless of socio-economic position – resume participation in cervical cancer screening at the aftermath of the pandemic. To our knowledge, our study is the first to describe cervical cancer screening participation during the pandemic according to socio-economic groups.</p><p>A few previous studies have examined the participation in cervical cancer screening during the pandemic according to age groups. One study found that women aged 30–39 y old (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Ivanuš et al., 2021</xref>) had the lowest participation in screening during the first 6 mo of the pandemic, whilst another study showed that the oldest age groups (50–59 and 60–69 y old; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Walker et al., 2021</xref>) had the lowest cervical cancer screening participation during the first year of the pandemic. Additionally, a study by Castañon et al. estimated that women aged 40–49 y old would have the greatest burden of excess cervical cancer diagnoses due to a delay in screening because of the pandemic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Castanon et al., 2022</xref>). We found that women aged 40–49 y old and 60–64 y old had a lower than usual participation in cervical cancer screening at the start of the pandemic. The pandemic thus appears to affect different age groups differently; however, this finding could also be due to chance. Women aged 60–64 y old may have been hesitant to come into contact with the healthcare system because of fear of infection, possibly explaining the lower participation in this age group. Older individuals and individuals with underlying health conditions have a higher risk of a worse outcome if exposed to COVID-19 and the level of comorbidity increases with age, which could explain the lower participation in the oldest age group because of fear of infection. Surprisingly, this effect lasted even when examining participation within 365 d since invitation. A concern is therefore that some women did not resume screening even with the longest follow-up time. The lower participation among women aged 40–49 y old cannot be easily explained and could thus be due to chance.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Strengths and limitations</title><p>A major strength of the study is the high quality of data covering the entire population of women invited to participate in the cervical screening programme in Denmark. Danish national registers are known to be reliable and to have high completeness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Thygesen et al., 2011</xref>), which also confers to the Cervical Cancer Screening Database (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Rygaard, 2016</xref>). While the quality of the Danish registers is high, some limitations relate to the data, for example, the study did not include data on comorbidities, which may affect participation in screening during the pandemic as individuals with underlying disease where advised to self-isolate at the height of the pandemic. However, as age is strongly associated with the level of comorbidity, the inclusion of age in the statistical model reduces the theoretical impact of comorbidity on the results.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Implications of the findings</title><p>Our findings show that the overall participation in cervical cancer screening was almost at the same level as the previous years when allowing for the longest follow-up time; however, some groups had slightly lower participation (descendants of immigrants, women with a low educational level, and women with a low income), and it is therefore important to ensure that all women re-enter the cervical cancer screening programme at the aftermath of the pandemic. Our results also show that some age groups (women aged 40–49 y old and 60–64 y old) had a lower participation in screening than usual, possibly indicating that the restrictions within a society affects different age groups disproportionally, although this finding may be due to chance. It is thus important to take this information into account when planning a pandemic response and ensure that all women have access to screening.</p><p>Contrasting health messages may have been conveyed by the cervical cancer screening programme being open, the general practitioners recommending a postponement of cervical cancer screening tests, and at the same time, the health authorities recommending people to stay at home. Inconsistent health communication from the authorities may therefore have led some women to refrain from participating in screening. The health communication therefore needs to be precise and consistent.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>The cervical cancer screening programme continued throughout the COVID-19 pandemic in Denmark.

screening participation in the organized screening program of Denmark. Through registry data covering the entire population, the study shows that while short-term (90 days) participation after invitation dropped, long-term (365 days) participation remained stable. These results will be of interest to public health specialists and researchers working on pandemic recovery efforts related to cancer screening worldwide.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="decision-letter" id="sa1"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.81522.sa1</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision letter</article-title></title-group><contrib-group content-type="section"><contrib contrib-type="editor"><name><surname>Malagón</surname><given-names>Talía</given-names></name><role>Reviewing Editor</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/01pxwe438</institution-id><institution>McGill University</institution></institution-wrap><country>Canada</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="reviewer"><name><surname>Leinonen</surname><given-names>Maarit</given-names></name><role>Reviewer</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/03tf0c761</institution-id><institution>Finnish Institute for Health and Welfare</institution></institution-wrap><country>Finland</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><boxed-text id="sa2-box1"><p>Our editorial process produces two outputs: i) <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://sciety.org/articles/activity/10.1101/2022.08.17.22278655">public reviews</ext-link> designed to be posted alongside <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.08.17.22278655v1">the preprint</ext-link> for the benefit of readers; ii) feedback on the manuscript for the authors, including requests for revisions, shown below.

The authors write that the study population comprised all screening-aged women from 1 January 2015 to 30 September 2021. Thus, was data on cervical cytology samples from the Danish Pathology Register extracted up to 30 September 2020? Also, the exposure of interest was the COVID-pandemic is a bit unclear. I assume that exposure is invitation to screening during the pre-pandemic period and COVID-pandemic. If that is the case, authors should make it clear that time periods refer to the time on invitation and not the time of outcome i.e. cervical cancer screening test. Also, the authors write that pre-lockdown and 1st lockdown was the start of the pandemic. There cannot be two starting points unless there are sensitivity analyses in which the onset varies. Thus, define clearly what is the starting point 1st February or 11 March 2020. In supplementary tables 1 to 3 time period for 2nd lockdown varies which is confusing. Please clarify the periods for exposure, outcome, and covariates.</p><p>Authors write that women who unregistered from the screening programme within 1 year since invitation (n=56,920) were excluded. Is there any information on who are these women and what are the reasons for unregistration? If those who are at higher risk of cancer and with lower participation rates unregister themselves, the compliance to screening could be overestimated.</p><p>Authors find that some age groups i.e. women aged 40-49 and those aged 60-64 years had a lower participation rate and conclude that it could indicate that the restrictions within a society affect different age groups disproportionally. The authors do not try to explain the finding and it should be scrutinized to rule out a chance. Comorbidity is strongly associated with age so if this is attributed to self-isolation, there should be a gradient. Why 50-59 years old would be different from 60-64 years? Have e.g. possible interactions between demographic and socioeconomic variables been taken into account in the analyses? The number of average health care visits 7-11 visits per year seems extremely high average for the mainly working-age population which in general is quite healthy. How these categories were decided? A priori or after exploring the data? If former, is there a reference that provides information on the average use of health care services?</p><p>Authors have cited the work by Wilson et al. (Ref # 22) in which only 4.1% of respondents were worried about catching coronavirus if they went for screening. Authors could add some discussion and references concerning fear and overall healthcare utilization during the early phase of the pandemic.</p><p>lines 73-76 authors write that prioritisations and re-organisations were done within the healthcare system to ensure the capacity to take care of patients in need of hospitalization due to COVID-19. While in Denmark laymen were trained for COVID-19 sample taking, in many other countries health care personnel were needed for sample taking and laboratory analytics. Thus, the possible lack of resources in screening programmes was not only due to hospitalized patients.</p><p>lines 204-205: Authors have adjusted for the year of invitation due to decreasing trend in screening uptake. Is there a reference for this? Any explanations for the trend? Could it be, for instance, increasing diversity in the screening population?</p><p>lines: 360-361: Authors write that women should be well-informed when they can safely participate in cervical cancer screening during the pandemic. When it is safe to participate? What is the definition of safe participation? Service providers can of course do risk mitigation interventions but who can guarantee that nobody will ever catch an infection? Consider rephrasing.</p><p>Table 1.

Initially we opted to address the possible effect of interaction by using a stratifying approach. This choice was taken to ease the readability and interpretation for a wide range of readers. However, we do acknowledge that some readers will prefer also to see an explicit statistical test for interaction and we have therefore tested for all interactions between time*socioeconomic variables. These tests are all statistically significant.</p><p>Still, that to ease the readability and interpretation, we argue that we will keep only to report the estimates and confidence intervals for the stratified analyses, as this approach provides interpretable estimates. However, to accommodate the request from the reviewers, we have added in manuscript that we have undertaken these formal interaction test, and that these were statistically significant (page 6, lines 221-225).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Address requests for clarifications in methods by reviewers below.</p></disp-quote><p>We have clarified these requests below.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Consider discussing the role that fear may have played in determining cervical cancer screening participation during the pandemic.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this comment.

We have opted to present the 365-day participation as the main outcome since we consider the long-term participation as the most important outcome of significance for the population. Cervical cancer screening is about prevention and a relatively short postponement of screening participation is assumed not to cause much harm. We therefore present the 90- and 180-day participation as supplementary tables.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>• Please consider including a formal test of the time*socioeconomic variable interaction in the Poisson regression to assess whether there are differences between groups of women in their screening participation over time.

As stated in the Methods section (page 4 lines 117-119) and the Discussion section (page 9 lines 318-321) reminders to participate in cervical cancer screening were mailed as per routine to non-participants after 3 months and again after 6 months. No additional efforts were made at an individual level during the pandemic; however, the general health communication changed during the pandemic reminding the population to continue to seek healthcare.

Please clarify the periods for exposure, outcome, and covariates.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this comment. The time periods stated in the Supplementary Table 1-3 are correct. This is because of the difference in observation periods that is, participation in screening within 90 days (Supplementary Table 1), within 180 days (Supplementary Table 2) and within 365 days (Supplementary Table 3) since invitation. In Supplementary Table 3, the end of the inclusion period is 31 December 2020 to allow for 365 days of observation. We have clarified this in the Methods section (page 5, lines 165-170).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Authors write that women who unregistered from the screening programme within 1 year since invitation (n=56,920) were excluded.

Theoretically we do agree with this point. However, as these 56,920 women only constitutes 2.5% of all invited women, the theoretical bias to the participation rate (compliance to the programme) is minimal. However, as the paper focus on the relationship between the phases of the COVID-19 pandemic and participation rates in cervical cancer screening, for the risk of the number of unregistrations to be troublesome, it has to be associated with the phases of the pandemic. However, the women unregistered throughout both the reference period and the pandemic period, and thus the risk of bias is minimal. So in order to keep our already comprehensive paper as concise and readable as possible, we argue not to provide this to the manuscript as this cannot explain any of our findings.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Authors find that some age groups i.e. women aged 40-49 and those aged 60-64 years had a lower participation rate and conclude that it could indicate that the restrictions within a society affect different age groups disproportionally.

We have elaborated on both age, comorbidity and chance findings in the Discussion section (page 10, line 353-363 and page 11, line 384). As stated in the Methods section, all analyses were adjusted for age to take into account the effect of age on the other explanatory variables (page 6, lines 219-221).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The number of average health care visits 7-11 visits per year seems extremely high average for the mainly working-age population which in general is quite healthy.

As stated in the Methods section (page 6, lines 191-198), the number of healthcare visits comprise the total number of contacts to general practitioners, private practising medical specialists, physiotherapists, and chiropractors. It is understandable that 7-11 visits per year may seem quite high for a non-Danish reader. However, a woman aged 30-64 years in Denmark contacts their general practitioner (primary care physician) just over 8 times per year (reference in Danish: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.sdu.dk/da/sif/ugens_tal/04_2017">https://www.sdu.dk/da/sif/ugens_tal/04_2017</ext-link>). The reason these numbers are high is that healthcare contacts covers both face-to-face, telephone, and e-mail consultations in Denmark. The categories were made using the nearest number of contacts to 20th, 40th, 60th, and 80th percentiles in the data, thus the categories broadly reflects the quintiles. We have clarified this in the Methods section (pages 5-6, lines 191-198).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Authors have cited the work by Wilson et al.

We have added a reference to the annual report from the Cervical Cancer Screening Database in the Methods section (page 6, line 219), which on page 16 shows the decreasing participation in cervical cancer screening in Denmark.
