Although the CRD comprises &lt;10% of LARP4 codons, the mRNA levels vary &gt;20 fold with synonymous CRD substitutions that accommodate tRNA dynamics. Separately, overexpression of the most limiting tRNA increases LARP4 levels and reveals its functional activity, net lengthening of the PATs of heterologous mRNAs with concomitant stabilization, including ribosomal protein (RP) mRNAs. Genetic deletion of cellular LARP4 decreases PAT length and RPmRNA stability. This LARP4 activity requires its PABP-interaction domain and the RNA-binding module which we show is sensitive to poly(A) 3'-termini, consistent with protection from deadenylation. The results indicate that LARP4 is a posttranscriptional regulator of ribosomal protein production in mammalian cells and suggest that this activity can be controlled by tRNA levels.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.28889.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Genes are coded instructions to build proteins and other molecules that make up living organisms. To build a protein, the code within a gene is copied into a molecule called a messenger RNA (or mRNA short). The letters of the genetic code are then read in groups of three, referred to as codons, by a molecular machine called a ribosome. Each codon corresponds to one of the building blocks of all proteins, known as amino acids. However, because there are 64 possible codons but only 20 or so amino acids found in proteins, different codons can encode for the same amino acid.</p><p>In addition to determining the order of amino acids in a protein, the sequence of codons in an mRNA can have other effects too. Some sequences change how the mRNA binds with other molecules, while others affect how long the mRNA will last within the cell before it is broken down. In fact, the stability of an mRNA is an important way to control a gene’s activity and genes that encode unstable mRNAs typically yield less protein.</p><p>Understanding the full information potential of the DNA code is a major goal of many biologists. Much research in this field has focused on single-celled organisms such as yeast, yet the regulation of mRNAs in yeast is generally less complex than it is in humans.</p><p>Mattijssen et al. have now asked how codons within the mRNA for a human protein called LARP4 affect the mRNA’s stability. This protein binds to mRNA molecules, and the experiments uncovered a short segment of codons that made the mRNA of LARP4 very unstable. Replacing specific codons in this segment with other codons for the same amino acid caused the stability of the LARP4 mRNA to increase a lot. This in turn changed how much LARP4 protein was produced.</p><p>Amino acids are brought to their corresponding codons by molecules called transfer RNAs (or tRNAs for short). Mattijssen et al. found that the codons in the short segment of LARP4 mRNA that caused instability were matched by rare tRNAs. Increasing the levels of these low level tRNAs also increased how much LARP4 protein was produced. The elevated levels of LARP4 revealed a new activity for the protein. Almost all mRNAs have a so-called poly-A tail at one end, and the experiments showed that LARP4 binds to a range of mRNAs to help make these tails longer, which in turn makes the molecules more stable. Deleting the gene for LARP4 from mouse cells lead otherwise stable mRNAs to have shorter poly(A) tails and to become less stable. This includes the mRNAs that code for the proteins that make up ribosomes.</p><p>The regulation of the mRNAs that encode ribosomal proteins has been challenging to understand. These new results may reveal a network of signals that connects the amount of tRNAs in a cell to the production of ribosomes. Since ribosome production is central to controlling cell growth and division, these results may have broad implications in research into areas as varied as human development and cancer.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>wobble decoding</kwd><kwd>mouse</kwd><kwd>anticodon</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100009633</institution-id><institution>Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>HD000412-30</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Maraia</surname><given-names>Richard J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The messenger RNA encoding La-related protein-4 (<italic>LARP4</italic>) contains a short region of instability whose codon clusters are sensitive to low abundance tRNAs that when elevated increase LARP4 activity for poly(A) lengthening of ribosomal protein mRNAs and other mRNAs.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>A key control element of the stability and translatability of eukaryotic mRNA is the 3' poly(A) tail (PAT) which can vary from ~25 to 250 nucleotides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Mangus et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Eliseeva et al., 2013</xref>), and accommodate multiple molecules of PABP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baer and Kornberg, 1980</xref>). PAT length is associated with translation efficiency in early development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Subtelny et al., 2014</xref>), and for specific mRNAs in somatic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Park et al., 2016</xref>).

Several of these proteins, among which are key factors involved in mRNA 3' exonucleolytic deadenylation, translation initiation and termination, share a similar peptide sequence termed PAM2 that interacts with the C-terminal domain of PABP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Xie et al., 2014</xref>). Some proteins with a PAM2 sequence including Paips 1 and 2, LARPs 1, 4 and 4B, also harbor other regions that interact with PABP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Yang et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Tcherkezian et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Xie et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fonseca et al., 2015</xref>).

The La module has been highly conserved by a few distinct La-related proteins (LARPs) that arose during eukaryotic evolution but diverged in other features of their structure and function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bousquet-Antonelli and Deragon, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Maraia et al., 2017</xref>). Of these, LARPs 1, 4, 4B and 6 are mostly cytoplasmic and associated with mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Maraia et al., 2017</xref>). Yet, except for vertebrate LARP6 which binds a highly conserved stem-bulge-loop found in the 5' UTRs of three α-collagen mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cai et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Martino et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Zhang and Stefanovic, 2016</xref>), details of RNA binding by the La modules of LARPs 1, 4 and 4B, and how such binding may contribute to their activities are largely unknown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Maraia et al., 2017</xref>). The La module-containing N-terminal domain of LARP4 has been shown to bind homopoly(A) whereas its full length homolog, LARP4B has been shown to bind A-rich, U-containing RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Yang et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Küspert et al., 2015</xref>), consistent with key differences in their La motifs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bayfield et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Maraia et al., 2017</xref>); their regulation also differs since LARP4 but not 4B mRNA is destabilized by TTP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Mattijssen and Maraia, 2015</xref>). LARP1 appears to bind poly(A) and to stabilize mRNAs containing the 5' terminal oligo pyrimidine (5'TOP) motif (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aoki et al., 2013</xref>) which are comprised of mRNAs encoding ribosomal proteins (RP), translation factors, PABP and other proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Meyuhas and Kahan, 2015</xref>). LARP1 is known to have two RNA-binding domains, a La module in its N-terminal half (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Nykamp et al., 2008</xref>) and a C-terminal HEAT motif that directly binds the 5' m7G cap and pyrimidine tract of the 5'TOP motif (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lahr et al., 2017</xref>). LARP1 may regulate a number of transcripts in addition to the 5'TOP mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Blagden et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Tcherkezian et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fonseca et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Mura et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Coding region determinants (CRD) of instability have been found in a small number of mRNAs, including <italic>Fos</italic> and <italic>Myc</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lemm and Ross, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chang et al., 2004</xref>) (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lee and Gorospe, 2011</xref>) and for <italic>Fos</italic> involves interactions with PABP, translating ribosomes, and deadenylation (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chen and Shyu, 2011</xref>). Accumulating evidence indicate that the overall fraction of optimal vs. suboptimal codons in a mRNA is a major determinant of mRNA decay in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Presnyak et al., 2015</xref>). A potential link between mRNA codon use and decay appears more complex in higher eukaryotic cells in which the relatively high content of 3′ UTR-destabilizing elements is a confounding issue (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chen and Shyu, 2017</xref>). Unresolved issues include whether codon optimality plays a role in higher eukaryotes, and if so to what extent and to what degree do cellular tRNA dynamics including relative abundances as well as codon-anticodon restraints such as wobble decoding which slows translation elongation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Stadler and Fire, 2011</xref>) vs. direct Watson:Crick (W:C) decoding, contribute (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chen and Shyu, 2017</xref>).</p><p>We compared expression in HEK293 cells of the open reading frames (ORFs) encoding several proteins and found LARP4 to be uniquely low. Detailed characterization revealed a codon-specific, translation-dependent CRD of mRNA instability that comprises &lt;10% of the LARP4 ORF that is a strong determinant of expression. We analyzed the unusual codon characteristics of this CRD and their matches to cellular tRNA levels which we determined for this study. Synonymous substitutions limited only to the CRD including wobble vs. W:C decoding were analyzed for effects on expression of full length LARP4 and correlations with cellular tRNA levels. The synonymous substitutions led to LARP4 expression levels over a &gt;20 fold range with excellent correlation with tRNA levels and codon-anticodon restraints (R<bold><sup>2</sup></bold> = 0.9). Furthermore, mild to modest overexpression of the most limiting cellular tRNA cognate to CRD codons increased LARP4 levels in a dose-dependent manner. For some CRD constructs, this tRNA led to increased LARP4 production without increasing mRNA levels, while for other, more codon-optimized constructs, it increased LARP4 protein as well as the mRNA levels. Increases in LARP4 levels by either synonymous codon swaps or tRNA overexpression revealed its dose-dependent activity to promote longer PATs on heterologous mRNAs with associated stabilization. These results and poly(A) binding data that indicate 3' end-specific recognition and suggest protection from deadenylation, point to mechanisms by which LARP4 promotes mRNA stability and potential control of RPmRNA by tRNA levels.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Identification of a coding region determinant in <italic>LARP4</italic> mRNA that limits expression</title><p>We cloned cDNAs for LARPs and La from their second codon to their stop codon into expression vector pFlag-CMV2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>) and transfected these into HEK293 cells with a plasmid encoding adenovirus VA1 RNA synthesized by RNA polymerase III as a control.

These data suggested a region within codons 287–358 as inhibitory to expression, which was confirmed by the internal deletion construct, Δ287–358 that was expressed at levels nearly as high as 359–724 and much higher than 1–724 and 1–430 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1g</xref>).

The promoter is turned off upon addition of dox, and RNA is isolated at t = 0 and times thereafter to follow decay. During the 48 hr following transfection until t = 0, mRNAs transcribed at the same rate but with different half-lives accumulate to different levels, each requiring 3 to 4 half-lives to reach steady state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Ross, 1995</xref>). We inserted the LARP4 CRD into the βG-wt reporter in two contexts, in the ORF preceding the stop codon or following it (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1h</xref>). When preceding the stop codon, the CRD led to t = 0 levels that were significantly lower as compared to placement after the stop (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1i</xref> upper panel, lanes 1 and 6).

The βG mRNA with the WT CRD in the CDS was indeed translated into a longer protein than with no insert (not shown). βG-wt with no insert yielded a half-life as expected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fialcowitz et al., 2005</xref>) (not shown), similar to WT CRD in the 3’UTR.</p><p>We examined codon substitutions to the CRD. A synonymous codon-swapped (CS) CRD sequence inserted in the βG CDS increased reporter mRNA levels and half-life relative to the WT CRD in the CDS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1i,j</xref>). To further characterize the CRD and distinguish if destabilization might be due to RNA structure, G+C content, or codon-specificity, we inserted the WT CRD in the βG CDS beginning with a +2 frameshift (+2 FS) which required mutations to convert premature stops to sense codons. This preserved 97% CRD sequence identity but with only ~10% codon sequence identity relative to the WT CRD. Similar to CS, the +2 FS largely reversed the inhibitory effect of the WT CRD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1k</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>LARP4 CRD is recognized as an inhibitory element when transferred to another mRNA</title><p>LARPs 4 and 4B share most amino acid and nucleotide homology in their La modules but less in other regions including the CRD which is only 52% nucleotide identical in this region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>). We replaced the CRD region of LARP4B with the LARP4 WT CRD or a CS CRD and examined LARP4B expression. The WT-CRD decreased LARP4B-CRD-WT levels relative to LARP4B WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>, lanes 5, 4). Importantly, the CS CRD rescued the negative effect of WT-CRD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>, lanes 6, 5); see quantitation in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref>. Thus, the LARP4 CRD is recognized as inhibitory when transferred to a heterologous mRNA.

The long UTR lowered expression as expected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d</xref>, lanes 2, 3; normalized to GFP). However, the CS CRD rescued the negative effect of the WT CRD (lanes 3 and 5, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d</xref>). These effects were reflected by differences in accumulation of the corresponding mRNAs containing the WT CRD and CS CRD in the long UTR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2e</xref>, upper panel, lanes 3 and 5). Quantification of data from duplicate experiments for the long and short mRNAs are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2f</xref>.

The tRNA adaptive index (tAI) is a measure of tRNA use by mRNAs that is derived from tRNA gene copy number and codon-anticodon base-pairing strength including that which distinguishes wobble vs. direct W:C pairing. Unlike in yeast, significant numbers of tRNA genes are variably inactive in different mammalian cell types and/or under different conditions (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Orioli, 2017</xref>). tAI scores are correlated with codon use and gene expression in yeast but not in human cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">dos Reis et al., 2004</xref>). Therefore, for the present study we determined tRNA levels in HEK293 cells by tRNA-HydroSeq (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Arimbasseri et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gogakos et al., 2017</xref>) and the read counts for each tRNA species (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>) were used to derive cellular-tAI (ctAI) values. These values were incorporated into an algorithm that generated ctAI scores for mRNA ORFs relative to their optimal match to the HEK293 tRNA pool. Based on the tRNA read levels and this algorithm, we designed multiple additional CS constructs with synonymous mutations limited to the CRD region of full length LARP4, for comparison to WT and our original CS construct, hereafter designated CS-R. Designations and descriptions of the other CS constructs are as follows: CS-B was predicted to be expressed higher than CS-R, CS-W was predicted to be expressed lower than WT, and CS-I was predicted to be expressed at an intermediate level between WT and CS-R; the pattern of relative protein levels of these were generally as predicted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>) and generally reflective of their mRNA levels (normalized to VA1, also see 28S RNA, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>).

the above set and all were analyzed quantitatively for mRNA expression and correlation with the ctAI scores of their CRD regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c</xref>). The additional constructs differ from those in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref> in a way that attempted to discern effects of wobble decoding which is prominent in the CRD (below). Constructs, CS-W, CS-I, CS-R and CS-B contain a mixture of synonymous codon swaps, some of which require decoding by a different tRNA anticodon than the original codon and some of which must be wobble decoded by the same tRNA anticodon as the original codon. Construct CSc contains synonymous swaps to Thr, Pro and Ile codons relative to WT, that require decoding by different tRNA anticodons. By contrast, constructs CSa, CSb and CS-Tyr contain synonymous swaps limited to U-to-C substitutions at wobble positions of select codons such that the same tRNA anticodon is used for decoding but with a direct anticodon G match to the wobble base C rather than wobble G:U decoding. CSb differs from WT by 14 synonymous codon swaps. Ten of these are weak codons, composed of all-A + U (UUU Phe and UAU Tyr) in the WT CRD. CSa differs from CSb only by five additional U-to-C substitutions at other weak codons in the CRD, at each of the Asn codons (AAU). Construct CS-Tyr differs from CS-B only at the 7 Tyr codons of the CRD; all of which are wobble UAU in CS-B, and in CS-Tyr they are UAC. For the Asn, Phe and Tyr codons, a single tRNA with G34 in the anticodon wobble position must decode both of their codons. Therefore, the U-to-C codon swap provides the only G:C base pair in these otherwise weak codons.

We developed a ctAI tool that calculates and plots a 10 nucleotide sliding window average translation proxy score along the length of an ORF. When applied to the human LARP4 sequence, the CRD appeared as a segment of high density low score clusters which otherwise occur relatively infrequently (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3d</xref>) (apart from a stretch between residues 12–43 which may represent a conserved initial ramp of low codon optimality common to proteins within their first 50 amino acids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Tuller et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Shah et al., 2013</xref>]). Fine mapping revealed that the lowest scoring points of LARP4 which ranged from 0.3 to 0.21 corresponded to two clusters of codons near the beginning of the CRD, denoted by red brackets at the left of the lower part of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3d</xref>.</p><p>We sorted the HEK293 tRNA read counts into four bins (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>), each containing ~25% of the 45 tRNA anticodon species that decode the standard 61 sense codons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Novoa et al., 2012</xref>); bins 1, 2, and 4 contain 11 tRNAs and bin 3 contains 12. This revealed a wide range of tRNA levels; bins 1–4 comprise 5.4%, 11%, 21% and 62% of total read counts, respectively (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). The numbers 1 to 11 above the codons in the lower part of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3d</xref> represent the eleven least abundant tRNAs in the HEK293 cells, all in bin-1 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). The number 1 to 4 four lowest tRNAs, ThrUGU, ProAGG, ThrCGU, and ProCGG, ranged from 6500 to 10,000 reads (bin-1) and the four highest (bin-4) from 160,000 to 340,000 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). To verify a subset of these by another approach, semi-quantitative northern blotting confirmed that tRNAs ThrUGU, ProAGG and PheGAA as well as SerUGA (bin-3) were consistent with tRNA-Seq relative levels whereas TyrGUA appeared lower by northern which our data suggest may be due to base modification-mediated interference with probe hybridization (not shown).</p><p>Examination of the LARP4 CRD revealed multiple types of codon bias; only 33 of the 61 sense codons are found in the 71-codon long CRD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3d</xref>). 42% of all CRD codons must be decoded by bin-1 tRNAs which comprise only 5.4% of total tRNA abundance (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). By contrast, 80% of codons excluded from the CRD are cognate to tRNAs in bins 2–4. Thus, the LARP4 CRD shows bias enrichment for codons cognate to low abundance tRNAs and bias for exclusion of codons cognate to high abundance tRNAs.</p><p>Strikingly, several bin-1 cognate codons are clustered. Moreover, many of these must rely on wobble decoding (red numbers, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3d</xref>), which slows translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Stadler and Fire, 2011</xref>). Some bin-1 clusters are flanked by or include other weak all-A +T codons (Tyr or Asn) that also require wobble decoding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3d</xref>, indicated by γ, λ).</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>The LARP4 CRD is biased in weak wobble codons that are inhibitory to expression</title><p>As alluded to above, the genetic code contains seven sense codons with all-A-or-U nucleotides in the three positions (the other is a stop codon). HEK293 cells contain tRNA anticodon species to decode 4 of these 7 by direct W:C pairing whereas the other 3 must be wobble decoded. For each of these three, Asn AAU, Phe UUU, and Tyr UAU, the corresponding amino acids are encoded by only one other codon, that which ends with C in the wobble position and is W:C decoded by the single tRNA that must decode both codons. The CRD is biased in all 3 of the all-A+U wobble codons, Asn AAU, Phe UUU, and Tyr UAU, relative to their stronger synonymous codons, AAC, UUC and UAC. Specifically, 5 of 7 Tyr codons in the CRD are UAU, all 5 Phe codons are UUU, and all 5 Asn codons are AAU (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3d</xref>), comprising NNU:NNC ratios of 5:2, 5:0, and 5:0 respectively. As the NNU:NNC ratios for these codon pairs range from 0.8:1 to 0.87:1 among all human ORFs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Mauro and Chappell, 2014</xref>), it is clear that the CRD is highly biased in its use of each of these three weak wobble codons.</p><p>The CS constructs that differ from their parent construct only in U-to-C wobble positions CSb and CS-Tyr, have significant effects on ctAI (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>). Therefore, the data show that U wobble codon decoding is suboptimal in the CRD because strengthening these codon:anticodon pairings appear to be functionally relevant. Comparison of the WT and CSb constructs (14 U-to-C wobble substitutions) revealed increase in LARP4 expression by 5-fold and this was further increased by additional Asn AAU codons to AAC in CSa. Separately, conversion of 7 Tyr UAU to UAC codons as reflected by CS-B vs. CS-Tyr, increased expression significantly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c</xref>). We conclude that the LARP4 CRD is highly enriched in weak wobble codons and other codons cognate to very low level tRNAs, likely to slow ribosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Stadler and Fire, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Shah et al., 2013</xref>) (Discussion).</p><p>Comparison of the ctAI plots of translation proxy scores of the synonymous codon swapped CRDs of the LARP4-CS constructs allowed visualization at near-codon resolution of the influence of wobble vs. direct W:C decoding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). For example, higher scores mapped to Asn codons (asterisks, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2b</xref>) in the CSa plot relative to CSb and also to the Tyr codons of the CS-Tyr plot relative to CS-B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2b</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-8"><title>Overexpression of the most limiting CRD-cognate tRNA increases LARP4 expression</title><p>pUC plasmids containing human tRNA genes transfected into HEK293 cells led to 3–6 fold increases in the corresponding tRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3e</xref>, and data not shown). When cotransfected with LARP4-WT and GFP, tRNA<sup>Thr</sup>UGU increased LARP4 and GFP levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3f</xref>) while tRNA<sup>Phe</sup>GAA, tRNA<sup>Pro</sup>AGG and tRNA<sup>Tyr</sup>GUA did not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3f</xref>). Increase in GFP is consistent with a relatively high number of Thr codons in its mRNA and a limiting amount of cellular tRNA<sup>Thr</sup>UGU. Because our data not shown indicated that different tRNA genes compete for expression, confounding the use of combinations thereof, we hereafter focused on overexpression of the single most limiting one, tRNA<sup>Thr</sup>UGU.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3g</xref> shows western blots after transfection of HEK293 cells with increasing amounts of tRNA<sup>Thr</sup>UGU plasmid (0, 2, 4 and 6 ug; empty plasmid, ep = 0 ug) along with LARP4-WT, CS-W, CS-I or CS-B. The basal levels of each LARP4 construct increased with increasing tRNA<sup>Thr</sup>UGU and this also occurred for GFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3g</xref>). An increase in GFP also occurred with LARP4-CS-W which is less active than LARP4-WT suggesting that the tRNA<sup>Thr</sup>UGU effect is independent of LARP4 (corroborated in a later section). These data provide strong evidence that the low level of endogenous tRNA<sup>Thr</sup>UGU is functionally limiting in these cells. Quantification of the response of the LARP4 constructs to tRNA<sup>Thr</sup>UGU are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3h</xref> using the basal levels with empty plasmid set to 1. LARP4-WT exhibited the greatest response, up to a six-fold increase, while CS-W, CS-I and CS-B were less responsive (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3h</xref>). This pattern suggests that WT LARP4 is programmed to be sensitive to limiting tRNA and that this reflects the unique composition of its CRD.</p><p>We also examined the effects of tRNA<sup>Thr</sup>UGU on the LARP4 construct and GFP mRNAs as well as endogenous ribosome protein L32 (Rpl32) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3i</xref>). Remarkably, tRNA<sup>Thr</sup>UGU did not increase LARP4-WT and CS-W mRNA levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3i</xref>, lanes 5–8 and 13–16) despite the increase in their protein products (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3g,h</xref>). This suggests that tRNA<sup>Thr</sup>UGU increased the translational efficiency (protein/mRNA) of LARP4-WT, perhaps similar to that observed for HIS3 constructs with synonymous codons in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Presnyak et al., 2015</xref>). By sharp contrast to LARP4-WT and -CS-W mRNAs, the tRNA<sup>Thr</sup>UGU clearly increased the levels of LARP4-CS-B mRNA in a dose-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3i</xref>, lanes 9–12), and to a lesser degree -CS-I (lanes 17–20). The quantifications are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3j</xref>.</p><p>The data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3g–j</xref> indicate that while overexpression of a single limiting tRNA can increase production of LARP4 protein from LARP4-WT mRNA, it does not lead to increased accumulation of this mRNA. This suggests that overcoming the destabilizing effects of the WT CRD with its intricate codon context (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3d</xref>) may be too complex for resolution by a single limiting tRNA. Yet, LARP4-CS-B mRNA was increasingly stabilized by tRNA<sup>Thr</sup>UGU and this was observed for CS-I although less so than for CS-B. We propose that because CS-I and CS-B CRDs contain more optimal synonymous codons than -WT and -W, they are more receptive to benefit from the accumulation effects of tRNA<sup>Thr</sup>UGU. These analyses indicate that the <italic>LARP4</italic> mRNA CRD can respond to a single limiting cognate tRNA with increased protein production, and moreover, that there may be a separate signal(s) in the CRD, apparently more complex than the Thr codons alone, that controls its instability determinant.</p></sec><sec id="s2-9"><title>Increasing tRNA leads to LARP4-dependent mobility shifts in heterologous mRNAs</title><p>Features in the patterns of GFP and Rpl32 mRNAs in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3i</xref> are noteworthy because as will be shown in the next section they are relevant to LARP4 activity. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3i</xref> revealed reproducible upward mobility shift of GFP mRNA, most readily appreciated by comparing lanes 4 and 5 and 12 and 13. The mobility shift was dependent on cotransfected LARP4 since lanes 1–4 did not show it. In addition, there was gradual but reproducible upward shift in the GFP mRNA band observable in lanes 5–8, 9–12 and 17–20 in response to increasing tRNA<sup>Thr</sup>UGU. This was specific to cotransfected LARP4 because lanes 1–4 did not reveal it. We note that LARP4 CS-W did not reveal the upward shift of GFP mRNA probably because the levels of its LARP4 protein product were too low (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3g</xref>). The GFP mobility shift is not due to electrophoresis or other artefact but as will be documented below results from a specific activity of LARP4.</p><p>The same general pattern observed for GFP was apparent for Rpl32 mRNA although less distinctly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3i</xref>).

Inspection of lanes 12 and 13 reveals the former more widely distributed than the latter, and similar for lane 5 vs. lane 4.

The full length M3 LaM-RRM mutant disabled the shift activity in the low and high expression versions, WT and CS, lanes 9 and 10 respectively, consistent with its documented diminished association with PABP and polysomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Yang et al., 2011</xref>).

Therefore, we examined a β-globin (βG) mRNA reporter with a short half-life, βG-TNFα-ARE containing a destabilizing A+U rich (ARE) element from tumor necrosis factor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fialcowitz et al., 2005</xref>).</p><p>HeLa tet-off cells were cotransfected with βG-TNFα-ARE, GFP, and the test plasmids that are indicated above <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4c</xref>.

The t = 0 data indicated that LARP4-CS increased βG-TNFα-ARE mRNA levels ~1.6 fold relative to LARP4-WT; consistent with this, extrapolation of the decay data suggested that LARP4-CS extended the mRNA half-life by ~1.5 fold relative to LARP4-WT (not shown) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Ross, 1995</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-12"><title>LARP4 increases βG-TNFα-ARE mRNA accumulation in HEK293 cells</title><p>We wanted to analyze βG-TNFα-ARE expression in HEK293 cells in which tRNA dynamics were characterized but these cells do not have the tetracycline transactivator that could be used to shut off the promoter. We therefore cloned the βG-TNFα-ARE into a constitutive CMV expression plasmid and analyzed the reporter mRNA 48 hr after transfection, that is, comparable to t = 0 in the previous experiments. This allowed us to examine effects of LARP4 subregions on accumulation of βG-TNFα-ARE mRNA in these cells. This revealed that full length LARP4 WT and CS produced progressively more mRNA than empty vector consistent with the relative amounts of their protein products (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4f</xref>). It is notable that the distribution of the βG mRNA in the empty vector was shifted upward by LARP4-WT at both its lower and upper edges (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4f</xref>, compare lanes 1 and 2). The ΔPAM2 protein was expressed at higher levels than CS in this experiment and also led to higher βG mRNA levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4f</xref>). By contrast, ΔPBM and ΔPAM2-ΔPBM produced significantly less βG mRNA than ΔPAM2 when expressed at comparable levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4f</xref>); this is consistent with the PAT lengthening activity of the ΔPAM2 protein observed for GFP mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b</xref>). Thus, the PBM would appear to contribute more to PAT-mediated mRNA stability than does PAM2. Finally, the two M3 LaM-RRM mutants accumulated less βG-TNFα-ARE mRNA than their intact-LaM-RRM counterparts including when M3 LaM-RRM CS version was expressed as high as LARP4-CS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4f</xref>, lanes 3 and 8). We also note that the GFP mRNA appears to report more incremental changes in PAT length among different LARP4 constructs than does the βG-TNFα-ARE mRNA which may be due to the poly(A)-destabilizing effect of the ARE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Ford et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lai et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lai et al., 2014</xref>). We also observed LARP4-dependent upward shift of nanoluciferase mRNA, increased mRNA levels and increased nanoluciferase activity (not shown).

The distribution of a given mRNA species in a polysome sedimentation profile is determined in part by its rates of translation initiation, elongation and termination, as well as its overall length and codon length which limits the number of translating ribosomes. Several comparisons of the data collected are noteworthy. First, the polysome profile distributions revealed relatively more LARP4 -CS-Tyr than -WT mRNA in polysome fractions 8–14 than in fractions 3–7 (in the absence of tRNA<sup>Thr</sup>UGU, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6b and d</xref>), consistent with more efficient engagement of ribosomes by LARP4-CS-Tyr than LARP4-WT. The <italic>LARP4</italic> mRNAs in these profiles were comparable in overall levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6b,d</xref>); quantification is shown as the percentage of total mRNA in each fraction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6f</xref>). This revealed that a larger percentage of LARP4-CS-Tyr mRNA is in fractions 8–14 (66%) as compared to LARP4-WT (57%), providing evidence to suggest that CS-Tyr mRNA is occupied more densely by ribosomes than the -WT mRNA. This further suggests that synonymous codon substitutions to the CRD not only increase the levels of the LARP4-CS-Tyr mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c</xref>) but also its translational efficacy (Discussion).</p><p>The next comparison reflects tRNA<sup>Thr</sup>UGU effects on the polysome distributions of LARP4-WT and LARP4-CS-Tyr mRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6b–e</xref>). tRNA<sup>Thr</sup>UGU shifted the LARP4 -WT and -CS-Tyr mRNAs toward heavier polysomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6g,h</xref>). LARP4 contains 46 Thr codons in addition to those in the CRD; the LARP4 -WT and -CS-Tyr were shifted by tRNA<sup>Thr</sup>UGU to different degrees (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6g,h</xref>).</p><p>We note that tRNA<sup>Thr</sup>UGU led to higher polysome levels and higher levels relative to 80S peaks in the OD254 tracings as compared to the control plasmid pUC19 for both LARP4 -WT and -CS-Tyr (top panels <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6c</xref> vs. b and e vs. d). This would not appear to be an artefact of polysome dissociation due to mishandling as reflected by comparable GAPDH mRNA profiles. For the mRNAs examined, the tRNA<sup>Thr</sup>UGU and control blots were incubated with probes, washed and imaged together. Thus, the fractions from the tRNA<sup>Thr</sup>UGU gradients (c and e) appear to contain more RNA than the pUC19 control gradients (b and d) as can be appreciated by comparing the H2A, Rps28, GAPDG and EtBr panels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6b–e</xref>).</p><p>A striking shift of GFP mRNA to heavier polysomes was observed in cells transfected with tRNA<sup>Thr</sup>UGU plasmid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6b–e,i</xref>).

This is consistent with the polysome distribution of GFP mRNA toward heavier polysomes in the presence of tRNA<sup>Thr</sup>UGU (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6b &amp; c and d &amp; e</xref>). Unlike LARP4, the GFP construct is far better codon optimized throughout its length for expression in human cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Haas et al., 1996</xref>). Another consideration is that while the UTRs in the GFP and LARP4 constructs are comparably short, their ORF lengths differ at 240 and 724 codons respectively. Thus, there should be more potential homogeneity of ribosome-containing GFP mRNPs than LARP4 mRNPs. The more dramatic shift of GFP mRNA to heavy polysomes as compared to <italic>LARP4</italic> mRNA with tRNA<sup>Thr</sup>UGU over expression may reflect both parameters, more benefit from codon context and more efficient ribosome occupancy per ORF length. In any case, the data provide evidence to indicate tRNA<sup>Thr</sup>UGU as limiting for translation of newly transcribed mRNA from transfected plasmids in these cells.</p><p>We also probed for endogenous steady state mRNAs, graphically shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6j–l</xref>.

This CRD is centrally located and represents less than 10% of the <italic>LARP4</italic> mRNA ORF. By overcoming the negative influence of the CRD, either by elevating the levels of a very low abundance limiting tRNA<sup>Thr</sup>UGU in HEK293 cells or by synonymous codon substitutions to the CRD, LARP4 levels were increased. This revealed its new cellular activity, to mediate PAT length and associated stabilization of heterologous mRNA. This PAT net lengthening activity was shown for naturally stable RPmRNAs as well as a reporter mRNA with an ARE that is known to mediate deadenylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Ford et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lai et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lai et al., 2014</xref>). This activity requires the intact PABP-interaction motifs of LARP4 and its intact RNA binding La module.

Other data demonstrated that the LARP4 CRD conferred significant instability when transferred to the higher level <italic>LARP4B</italic> mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b,c</xref>). It was recently noted that while much understanding of codon optimality has come from studies of yeast, outstanding issues include whether codon optimality plays a major role in mRNA decay in higher eukaryotic cells whose 3′ UTRs tend to contain a plethora of regulatory elements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chen and Shyu, 2017</xref>). Our data showed that the LARP4 CRD was a significant instability element in the context of the <italic>LARP4</italic> mRNA 4.2 kb 3' UTR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d–f</xref>), which was previously documented to harbor negative regulatory elements responsive to TNFα and TTP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Mattijssen and Maraia, 2015</xref>).</p><p>Results from yeast indicate that codon optimality is a major determinant of mRNA stability as reflected by the overall percentage of optimal versus suboptimal codons of any given mRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Presnyak et al., 2015</xref>).

These findings suggest that codon control of mRNA stability may reside in distinct regions of higher eukaryotic mRNAs. However, the extent to which this may be so and/or the types of subsets of mRNAs involved, if any, may be determined by future studies. The LARP4 CRD system, approaches and tools developed here should be useful toward addressing these issues.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Cellular tRNA levels provide insight into codon effects in higher eukaryotes</title><p>Another outstanding issue in codon optimality is the potential role of the cellular tRNA pool and codon-anticodon dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chen and Shyu, 2017</xref>). This has been challenging in higher eukaryotes because unlike in yeast, tRNA gene copy numbers do not correlate with codon use by efficiently translated mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">dos Reis et al., 2004</xref>). This may reflect that significant numbers of tRNA genes of variable identities are inactive in different mammalian cell types (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Orioli, 2017</xref>). Our data demonstrated that the LARP4 CRD is a determinant of mRNA instability via its codon-specific match to HEK293 cell tRNA levels and their codon-anticodon dynamics.</p><p>We analyzed several full length LARP4 expression constructs that differ only in the synonymous codon composition of the CRD region. It was informative to consider effects of synonymous CRD substitutions on <italic>LARP4</italic> mRNA expression in conjunction with cellular tRNA levels and their codon-anticodon dynamics. This revealed that codons that must be decoded by very low abundance tRNAs are concentrated in the LARP4 CRD along with a heavy bias of weak, all-A+U codons that must be wobble decoded, and clusters of these (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3d</xref>). Two relevant findings are noteworthy. First, the CRD codon composition in conjunction with the HEK293 tRNAs predict that certain synonymous swaps cannot significantly improve optimality because all of the tRNAs for that amino acid are very low abundance. Specifically, all the tRNAs Thr, Pro and Ile for all Thr, Pro and Ile codons, are in bin-1 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). Therefore, the Thr, Pro and Ile codon synonymous swaps to a different tRNA anticodon would have only limited effect toward increasing <italic>LARP4</italic> mRNA levels, as was observed for construct CSc which contains 13 synonymous substitutions and collectively increased levels 2.4-fold.</p><p>The other noteworthy finding resulted from codon swaps of weak, all-A+U wobble codons to their stronger synonymous codons with a C in the third position. In these cases the new codon is decoded by the same tRNA but using a direct match anticodon wobble G34. These data revealed that wobble decoding of weak codons can be a significant determinant of suboptimality (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c</xref>). This latter point was demonstrated by comparing constructs CS-B and CS-Tyr that differ only in the third positions of all seven Tyr codons (UAU vs. UAC) in the CRD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c</xref>), both of which are decoded by tRNA<sup>Tyr</sup>GUA. Also, LARP4-CSb differs from LARP4-WT in 14 U-to-C synonymous codons that are wobble decoded in -WT but decoded by C:G codon:anticodon base pairs in -CSb, and increased expression 5-fold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c</xref>).</p><p>Our analysis revealed that tRNA<sup>Thr</sup>UGU led to increased protein production from LARP4-WT without increasing the mRNA levels, whereas some of the CS CRD constructs responded with tRNA dose-dependent increase in mRNA levels. This suggests that translation dependency and the instability component of the CRD can be uncoupled and that reversing the latter may require more than an increase in the levels of a single tRNA.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>tRNA<sup>Thr</sup>UGU and other tRNAs are limiting in HEK293 cells</title><p>A significant component of this study was quantitative sequencing of HEK293 cell tRNAs and development of ctAIs. This led to the finding that the tRNAs for all Thr, Pro and Ile codons are of very low abundance, in bin-1 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). A striking finding was demonstration that over expression of the lowest abundance, tRNA<sup>Thr</sup>UGU, increased production of LARP4 and GFP from transfected plasmids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3g–h</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5b</xref>). As expected, this was accompanied by a shift of the corresponding mRNAs to heavier polysome fractions, presumably reflective of greater ribosome occupancy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6g–i</xref>). This was a robust activity that was specific since over expression of other low (or high) abundance tRNAs including tRNA<sup>Thr</sup>CGU or tRNA<sup>Tyr</sup>GUA did not increase LARP4 or GFP production (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3e,f</xref> and data not shown). The responsiveness of GFP mRNA to tRNA<sup>Thr</sup>UGU was remarkable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6b–e,i</xref>). We note that 14 of the 15 threonines in the codon-optimized GFP construct (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Haas et al., 1996</xref>) are encoded by ACC codons and that these require wobble decoding because there is no tRNA with a GGU anticodon (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gogakos et al., 2017</xref>).

Although our data on CRD codon composition and cognate tRNA levels would suggest that the mechanism is linked to slow translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Radhakrishnan and Green, 2016</xref>), some points are nonetheless noteworthy. As was evident from our early analysis of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1e–g</xref>, the different LARP4 truncation and deletion construct mRNAs containing or lacking the CRD would appear to have similar apparent translation efficiencies because the relative amounts of the mRNAs more or less match the relative amounts of proteins produced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1e–g</xref>). Moreover, this trend of match between relative amounts of mRNAs and proteins produced was maintained by the synonymous CS constructs analyzed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a–c</xref> (and data not shown). It is also interesting to consider that although LARP4-WT mRNA accumulates to ~12 fold lower levels than LARP4-CS-Tyr mRNA, the LARP4-WT mRNA that does survive appears to exhibit translational efficiency that is only modestly lower than LARP4-CS-Tyr mRNA based on polysome profile distributions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6b–e</xref>). This is not inconsistent with the observations supporting the generally similar apparent translation efficiencies of CS construct mRNAs made above. The data are consistent with some type of quality control mechanism that leads to decay of a large fraction of the LARP4-WT mRNA because it has suboptimal codons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Radhakrishnan and Green, 2016</xref>) (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brule and Grayhack, 2017</xref>).</p><p>To gain insight into mechanism, we performed <italic>in vitro</italic> translation in extracts made from our HEK293 cells programmed with 7<sup>m</sup>G capped and polyadenylated mRNAs synthesized by T7 RNA polymerase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Rakotondrafara and Hentze, 2011</xref>). Using equal amounts of synthetic transcripts corresponding to LARP4 WT and CS-Tyr mRNAs we sought to observe evidence of ribosome stalling in the CDR in the form of transiently arrested nascent polypeptides. After preliminary experiments revealed no difference in production of the polypeptides from the LARP4-WT and -CS-Tyr mRNAs in standard reactions, we performed time courses to more carefully focus on transition through the CRD region, codons 286–358. For these experiments we compared LARP4-WT(1-358) and LARP4-CS-Tyr(1-358) fragments because <italic>in vivo</italic> analysis showed that the WT CRD in the LARP4(1–358) construct was highly active (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1e</xref>) and because this approach facilitated the <italic>in vitro</italic> analysis. However, there was comparably robust translation through the CRD regions of both of the synthetic mRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). Additional attempts to elucidate a difference in the <italic>in vitro</italic> translation of the two mRNAs by decreasing the temperature of the reactions were unsuccessful. Although the polysome distributions of LARP4-WT and LARP4-CS-Tyr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>) were consistent with lower translational efficiency of WT, we do not know the degree to which such a difference might be expected to manifest as a difference in these <italic>in vitro</italic> translation reactions. The <italic>in vitro</italic> translation results suggest among other things the possibility that the mechanism controlling the synonymous codon-specific differential expression/decay of LARP4-WT and -CS-Tyr in cells is coupled to transcription or another nuclear event(s) or process that is not faithfully executed during <italic>in vitro</italic> translation in extract of synthetic mRNAs. Such a possibility would be consistent with a quality control mechanism that is operational <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Proposed mechanism of mRNA PAT 3' protection by LARP4</title><p>Prior to this work, a mechanism by which LARP4 or 4B may function in mRNA metabolism was unknown. We also note that sensitivity of single stranded poly(A) RNA to 3' end binding by LARP4 had remained untested. We used <italic>in vitro</italic> RNA binding to reveal that LARP4 exhibits sensitivity to the 3' end of poly(A) in a manner similar to that of the RNA binding pocket of La protein during RNA 3' end sequestration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Teplova et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kotik-Kogan et al., 2008</xref>). We note that this apparent similarity occurs despite other significant differences in RNA recognition by La and LARP4 including oligo(U) vs. oligo(A) specificity, RNA length requirements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Yang et al., 2011</xref>), and that the molecular and structural bases of these for LARP4 are unknown (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Maraia et al., 2017</xref>). Nonetheless, this 3' end sensitivity is consistent with a proposed mechanism for LARP4 for mRNA PAT 3' end protection from deadenylation. In any case, future experiments toward understanding how the PABP-interaction domains of LARP4 cooperate with its La module will be necessary to better understand its activity for PAT lengthening. In the current working model, the La module of LARP4 would bind poly(A), and its PBM and PAM2 would bind PABP, the latter of which also binds the PAT. Presumably, the LARP4 PAM2 would serve to compete with or displace from PABP, the PAM2-containing deadenylases which function as 3' exonucleases.</p></sec><sec id="s3-6"><title>LARP4 as a general factor for mRNA 3' PAT homeostasis</title><p>MEFs derived from LARP4 gene-deleted KO embryos created for this study were shown to bear RPmRNAs with shorter PAT length and faster decay than in WT MEFs. The mRNA-PAT length maintenance mediated by LARP4 characterized here was mostly for the highly abundant RPmRNAs. However, we wish to emphasize that LARP4 activity to increase PAT length was not limited to these mRNAs. Elevation of cellular LARP4 levels in response to increase in limiting tRNA or other means led to PAT lengthening and stabilization of βG-TNFα-ARE mRNA whose ARE directs deadenylation. Yet LARP4 would appear to differ from other mRNA stabilizing proteins which generally target lower abundance and transiently expressed mRNAs that are relatively unstable in their basal state (as compared to RPmRNAs) and regulated through their 3'UTRs, e.g., via AREs that indirectly modulate PAT metabolism via trans-acting factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chen and Shyu, 2017</xref>). According to the model derived from our data, LARP4 differs because it binds directly to poly(A), the RPmRNAs are abundant and contain relatively very short 3' UTRs that are generally believed to be non-regulatory in the conventional sense. Thus, LARP4 would appear to be a general factor that is more directly involved in PAT length maintenance. The RPmRNAs comprise a substantial fraction of cellular mRNA in proliferating cells, and ﻿are critical and tightly regulated, including under growth control.</p></sec><sec id="s3-7"><title>LARP1 and LARP4B also promote mRNA PAT 3' length stabilization</title><p>Our data demonstrated mRNA PAT net lengthening activity for two other La module proteins, LARP4B and LARP1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4 and 9</xref>), the latter of which is a regulator of ribosome biogenesis and a pro-cancer protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aoki et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Tcherkezian et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fonseca et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lahr et al., 2017</xref>). By contrast, neither over expression of La protein, a significant fraction of which is cytoplasmic, nor LARPs 6 or 7, exhibited this activity even when accumulated at higher levels than LARP4-WT and -CS-R (data not shown). LARP4B contains a PAM2 and a separate PBM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bayfield et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Schäffler et al., 2010</xref>), and recent data identified a PAM2 candidate in LARP1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fonseca et al., 2015</xref>). LARP1 is a central factor in the regulation of translation of RPmRNAs in response to nutrition-related signals by controlling their repression which is mediated by its DM15 domain which binds their 5'TOP motif (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lahr et al., 2017</xref>). However, a recognized part of LARP1 activity in regulation is RPmRNA stabilization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Tcherkezian et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fonseca et al., 2015</xref>) and some data suggested that this may be mediated via binding to the 3′ terminus of the PAT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aoki et al., 2013</xref>). Our data showed that LARP1 stabilized/increased accumulation of βG-TNFα-ARE mRNA with accompanying mobility shift and it similarly shifted GFP mRNA which was shown to result from PAT lengthening (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). As neither of these mRNAs bear a 5'TOP motif, the data suggest that the PAT-mediated mRNA stability may be a separate activity of LARP1. This further suggests that PAT-mediated mRNA stability by LARP1 may be uncoupled from translation repression including when LARP1 is over-expressed as occurs in certain cancers and associates with non-TOP mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Mura et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Stavraka and Blagden, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hopkins et al., 2016</xref>). However, while LARP1 contributes to RPmRNA translation as a central negative regulator, the present work suggests that LARP4 may be more of a constitutive positive factor in the control of RPmRNA homeostasis.</p><p>Finally, an intriguing aspect of this work is that tRNA availability might control or tune LARP4 activity levels.

In some experiments, pCMV2 vectors, containing LARPs were co-transfected. Since LARP6 accumulates to relatively high levels, only half the amount of LARP6 plasmid was transfected compared to LARP4 WT and CS-R (amount adjusted with empty vector). The next day, cells were equally divided into multiple wells. 48 hr post transfection, media was replaced by media containing 2 μg/ml doxycycline (Sigma).

The cells were transfected with 816 ng GFP plasmid plus 10.2 ug pCMV2 plasmid containing either LARP4-WT or -CS-Tyr and 24.5 ug empty pUC19 or pUC19 containing 3 copies of the tRNA<sup>Thr</sup>UGU gene. The day after transfection, the cells from each plate were divided into two 15 cm culture plates (an aliquot was seeded into a 6-well plate for protein isolation the next day). One day later, fresh sucrose solutions (47% and 7%, wt/vol) in 10 mM HEPES, pH 7.3, 150 mM KCl, 20 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 mM DTT were prepared, filter sterilized and used to make the gradients with a Gradient Master (Biocomp). The cell growth medium was replaced 3 hr before addition of cycloheximide (Chx) at a final concentration of 100 μg/ml (from fresh made 10 mg/ml stock in water). After 5 min at 37°C, the cells were moved to ice and washed twice with ice-cold PBS plus 100 μg/ml Chx. Five ml of ice-cold PBS with 100 μg/ml Chx was added per plate, the cells were scraped and added to an ice-cold tube.

The lysate was cleared by centrifugation at 13,000 rpm for 5 min at 4°C. Four hundred microliters of the gradient was removed from the gradient tubes, and the equivalent amount of 10 OD<sub>260</sub> units of each lysate was carefully loaded on top. The gradients were spun in an ultracentrifuge (Beckman SW41 rotor) at 33,000 rpm for 2 hr and 50 min at 4°C.

Briefly, cells were cultured under standard conditions (DMEM with 10% serum, 1X pencillin-strepomycin at 37°C with 5% CO2). Total RNA was isolated from near confluent cells using TriPure reagent (Roche) and resolved on a 6% polyacrylamide-urea-TBE gel. tRNA size (shorter than 5S rRNA were gel purified by incubating the crushed gel pieces in 0.3 M NaCl overnight. The tRNA was precipitated, quantified and 300 ng subjected to partial hydrolysis in 10 mM bicarbonate buffer pH 9.8. The hydrolyzed RNA was dephosphorylated using Calf-Intestine Alkaline Phosphatase (NEB) and the 5’ termini were phosphorylated using γ−<sup>32</sup>P-ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase (NEB). Barcoded pre-adenylated 3’ adapters were ligated to the 3’ ends of the fragments (for sequences of all adapters and primers used see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hafner et al., 2012</xref>). In a parallel control reaction, two <bold><sup>32</sup></bold>P-RNA size markers of 19 and 35 nt were also ligated to the adapters. The ligated fragments were resolved in a 10% polyacrylamide-urea-TBE gel alongside the adapter ligated size markers. tRNA fragments that migrated between the ligated 19 and 35 nt markers were isolated from the gel and subjected to 5’ adapter ligation. The RNA fragments that with both 3’ and 5’ adapters were again size selected and subjected to reverse transcription (Superscript III, Invitrogen) at 42°C with the reverse primer.

The functions of LARP4 include the stabilization of the mRNAs bound to the poly A. However, the stabilization of targeted mRNAs of LARP4 depends on interactions between its mRNA coding region determinant and specific transfer RNAs. The variation of codon sequences of tRNA interaction in the CRD are tested for their ability to vary the stability and subsequent translation of the LARP4 mRNA, that in turn, regulates poly A length of targeted ribosomal protein mRNAs. This is a grand scheme of regulation that is entirely novel, and potentially powerful. The data are strongly supportive of the regulatory model demonstrating that LARP4 is at the center of posttranscriptional coordination of production of the ribosomal proteins in mammalian cells. The authors used many in vitro and in vivo (MEFs knockout of LARP4) approaches and many quantifiable molecular measures to support their conclusions.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The authors have presented a very thorough and detailed series of experiments that strongly support their interpretations of this complex biological system. However, It is challenging for the reader to work through the text, the figure legends, and abundant data. The authors should make an effort to simplify the text as much as possible.</p><p>2) The authors should provide further proof for tRNAThrUGU-dependent temporary ribosome stalling/translation slow down at the CDR segment of LARP4 mRNA. For example, they could perform ribosome profiling. Alternatively, or in addition, ribosome stalling at CDR could be examined by the generation of transiently arrested nascent polypeptides in a cell-free system of translation of Larp4 mRNA.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.28889.020</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The authors have presented a very thorough and detailed series of experiments that strongly support their interpretations of this complex biological system.

This stems from the fact that the paper is complex, bridging two intricate stories, one of which is intrinsically complicated and not yet mainstream, effects of tRNAs and codons, and the other on mRNA poly(A) metabolism. While the terse style was not inappropriate for expert reviewers, it could be much improved toward helping readers better appreciate the paper and thank the reviewers for the opportunity to revise and thereby increase its accessibility. We have made text revisions throughout the manuscript toward this objective. Two types of modifications were made throughout; many text passages/descriptions were decondensed and simplified, and second, we added several new section headings to introduce and highlight, and provide more descriptive and logical flow between transitions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The authors should provide further proof for tRNAThrUGU-dependent temporary ribosome stalling/translation slow down at the CDR segment of LARP4 mRNA.

One is overcoming the background of endogenous LARP4 mRNA sequence reads in the most important region, the CRD. We know from our work that in the experimental system used throughout, LARP4-WT levels from transfected plasmid accumulate at levels similar to endogenous LARP4 (see Yang et al., 2011). While transfected LARP4-WT mRNA can be discerned from endogenous by size/mobility on northern blots, we know from our RNA-seq data (a component of ribosome profiling) that their internal sequence reads cannot be distinguished, yet the endogenous would comprise about 50% of the signal. Also, endogenous LARP4 mRNA is subjected to a level of regulatory instability via its ARE-containing 3' UTR that may or may not confound analysis of the transfected construct. Thus an approach would be to knock down endogenous LARP4 mRNA but this would require separate shRNA plasmid or siRNA transfection preceding transfection of the multiple other plasmids, (LARP4 constructs to be examined, the tRNA plasmid, and control plasmid, GFP). We know that these HEK293 cells become sensitive to complex transfection regimens, and we have not worked out the siRNA or other conditions for such an experiment. Second is our lack of perfected technology; our actual ribosome profiling data have revealed that we have not yet solved the three nucleotide codon phase issue and do not yet provide high resolution mapping data.</p><p>Because we could not expect to resolve these two ribosome profiling issues in a reasonable time frame, we attempted to examine ribosome stalling in the CRD by the alternative approach suggested in essential revisions #2, i.e., hoping to generate paused/arrested nascent polypeptides in a cellfree translation extract programmed with LARP4 mRNA. We had not performed such experiments before, using translation competent extract from cells of interest, the HEK293 cells. We followed the method described by the Hentze lab (Rakotondrafara and Hentze, 2011), in vitro translation in our extract, programmed with 7mG 5' capped and 3' polyadenylated mRNAs synthesized by T7 RNA polymerase. After preliminary experiments revealed no difference between production of the corresponding LARP4-WT and LARP4-CS-Tyr polypeptides in the standard reactions, we examined time courses to focus on the time during which the CRD, codons 286-358, is translated. However, even then, we detected comparably robust translation through the CRDs of both of the synthetic mRNAs. We describe the results in more detail in the Discussion section of the revised manuscript and in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>. We also note that lowering temperature did not reveal differences between LARP4-WT and LARP4-CS-Tyr. We appreciate that we could further try to find conditions such as titrating extract concentration and/or amino acids to show differential slow down in the WT CRD but this would also shift focus of the manuscript and we have not done so. We note in the Discussion: The in vitro translation results suggest among other things the possibility that the mechanism controlling the synonymous codon-specific differential expression of LARP4-WT and – CS-Tyr in cells is coupled to transcription or another nuclear event(s) or process that is not faithfully executed during in vitro translation in extract of synthetic mRNAs. Such a possibility would be consistent with a quality control mechanism. We believe that it is worthwhile to consider the results in the context of the fact that when forced to accumulate comparable amounts of mRNA by adjusting the amounts of transfected plasmid, the LARP4-WT and -CS-Tyr mRNAs produce comparable amounts of protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref> lanes 1 and 3). This is more broadly considered in a new section in the Discussion part of the revised manuscript: <bold>&quot;</bold>Does the CRD operate via a mRNA quality control mechanism?&quot;</p></body></sub-article></article>
