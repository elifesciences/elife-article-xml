Our crystal structure of the mitochondrial Hsp90, TRAP1, revealed an extension of the N-terminal β-strand previously shown to cross between protomers in the closed state. In this study, we address the regulatory function of this extension or ‘strap’ and demonstrate its responsibility for an unusual temperature dependence in ATPase rates. This dependence is a consequence of a thermally sensitive kinetic barrier between the apo ‘open’ and ATP-bound ‘closed’ conformations. The strap stabilizes the closed state through trans-protomer interactions. Displacement of cis-protomer contacts from the apo state is rate-limiting for closure and ATP hydrolysis. Strap release is coupled to rotation of the N-terminal domain and dynamics of the nucleotide binding pocket lid. The strap is conserved in higher eukaryotes but absent from yeast and prokaryotes suggesting its role as a thermal and kinetic regulator, adapting Hsp90s to the demands of unique cellular and organismal environments.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.03487.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.03487.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.03487.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Proteins—which are made of chains of molecules called amino acids—play many important roles in cells. Before a newly made protein can work properly, the amino acid chain has to be folded into the correct three-dimensional shape. Many proteins that have folded incorrectly are harmless, but some can disrupt the cell and cause damage. Although most proteins can fold properly on their own, they are often helped by ‘chaperone’ proteins, which speed up the process and encourage correct folding.</p><p>Many chaperone proteins belong to a family called the heat shock proteins, which are found in almost all species: from bacteria, to plants and animals. High temperatures can severely impair and destabilize proper protein folding, and the heat shock proteins counteract this by helping to prevent, or correct, protein misfolding. Most animals and plants have at least four genes that make different versions of heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90). These versions work in different places in the cell and one—called TRAP1—is found in internal compartments called mitochondria. Along with its role in assisting protein folding, TRAP1 also acts as an indicator of the health of the proteins in the mitochondria.</p><p>One section or ‘domain’ of Hsp90 is able to bind to and break down a molecule called ATP. This releases energy that is used to change the shape of the protein-binding domain—which is responsible for helping other proteins to fold. Recent studies of TRAP1 using a technique called protein crystallography highlighted the presence of a short amino acid tail or ‘strap’ at one end of the protein, but it is not known what role it may play in protein folding.</p><p>In this study, Partridge et al. reveal that the amino acid strap of TRAP1 controls the breakdown of ATP in a way that depends on the surrounding temperature. Similar straps are also present in the Hsp90 proteins that are found in other parts of the cell. However, the strap is absent from the Hsp90 proteins of yeast and bacteria. These experiments used proteins that had been taken from living cells and placed in an artificial setting, so an important next step will be to study the role of the strap in the folding of proteins inside living cells. Also, future work could investigate the potential role of the protein in maintaining healthy mitochondria.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.03487.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.03487.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>chaperone</kwd><kwd>SAXS</kwd><kwd>Trap1</kwd><kwd>Hsp90</kwd><kwd>mitochondria</kwd><kwd>ATPase</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>E. coli</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Partridge</surname><given-names>James R</given-names></name><name><surname>Lavery</surname><given-names>Laura A</given-names></name><name><surname>Agard</surname><given-names>David A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>U01 GM098254</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Partridge</surname><given-names>James R</given-names></name><name><surname>Lavery</surname><given-names>Laura A</given-names></name><name><surname>Agard</surname><given-names>David A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100001167</institution-id><institution>Larry L.

Although molecular chaperones generally promote protein folding and prevent aggregation, Hsp90 is unique in that it interacts with substrate (‘client’) proteins that are already in a semi-folded state to facilitate downstream protein–protein interactions and promote client function in diverse biological pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Jakob et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Taipale et al., 2012</xref>). Hsp90 interacts with nearly 10% of the eukaryotic proteome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Zhao et al., 2005</xref>), and its client proteins vary significantly in sequence, structure, and size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Echeverria et al., 2011</xref>). In most eukaryotes, there are four different Hsp90 homologs: Hsp90α and Hsp90β in the cytoplasm, Grp94 in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), and TRAP1 in mitochondria, with each homolog contributing unique biological functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Chen et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Johnson, 2012</xref>). Deregulation of Hsp90 protein levels and function has been linked to multiple human diseases and for this reason Hsp90 is a target for biochemical characterization, structural studies, and drug discovery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Luo et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Taipale et al., 2010</xref>). Despite such importance, little is known about the biochemical characteristics that regulate client interaction and specificity.</p><p>Hsp90 exists as a homodimer, with each protomer consisting of three major domains. The N-terminal domain (NTD) binds to ATP, the C-terminal domain (CTD) provides a dimerization interface between protomers, and the middle domain (MD) provides a stabilizing γ-phosphate contact to help facilitate ATP hydrolysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Cunningham et al., 2012</xref>). Together with the CTD, the MD has been shown to aid in the formation of client interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Street et al., 2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Genest et al., 2013</xref>). Large, rigid body motions about each of the domain interfaces give rise to an ensemble of remarkably diverse conformational states that dictate the functional Hsp90 cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ali et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Shiau et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Dollins et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Southworth and Agard, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Lavery et al., 2014</xref>) (<xref ref-type="other" rid="media1">Video 1</xref>) and are linked to client maturation in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Panaretou et al., 1998</xref>). Work from numerous labs has demonstrated conservation of the underlying conformational cycle and mechanism; however, each Hsp90 homolog has a distinct conformational equilibrium and catalytic rate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Panaretou et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Richter et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Southworth and Agard, 2008</xref>). Binding of ATP to the NTD nucleotide-binding pocket ultimately leads to stabilization of an NTD-dimerized state. Key steps in this transformation include ATP binding, closure of a mobile structure (lid) over the nucleotide, and a subsequent 90<sup>o</sup> rotation of the NTD relative to the MD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Krukenberg et al., 2011</xref>). Dimer closure is the rate-limiting step for Hsp90 ATPase activity and mutations that either subtly increase or decrease ATPase rates compromise viability in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Nathan and Lindquist, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Hessling et al., 2009</xref>). However, our understanding of the sequence of events that regulate these structural rearrangements is limited.<media content-type="glencoe play-in-place height-250 width-310" id="media1" mime-subtype="mov" mimetype="video" xlink:href="elife-03487-media1.mov"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.03487.003</object-id><label>Video 1.</label><caption><title>Conformational dynamics of the Hsp90 cycle.</title><p>A morph between known conformations throughout the activity cycle of Hsp90 (PDB codes with no order dictated: 2O1V, 2CG9, 2IOP, 2IOQ, 4IPE, 4IVG).</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.03487.003">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.03487.003</ext-link></p></caption></media></p><p>Recently, we solved a series of full-length crystal structures of TRAP1 bound to different ATP analogs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Lavery et al., 2014</xref>), providing new insights into the structure, dynamics, and mechanism of Hsp90. Of particular note was the marked asymmetry between protomers of the homodimer, primarily at the interface between the MD and CTD. This asymmetry was sampled in solution, proved essential for catalytic turnover, and provided a new model for coupling the energy of ATP hydrolysis to client remodeling. A second feature highlighted by the TRAP1 crystal structure was an ordered 14-residue extension (out of 26 total additional residues) of the N-terminal β-strand previously shown to cross over (‘swap’) between protomers in the closed state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ali et al., 2006</xref>). While absent in yeast and bacteria, this extension, or ‘strap,’ is found in most eukaryotic Hsp90 proteins including the cytosolic and organellar forms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Chen et al., 2006</xref>) and can extend for as many as 122 residues as recently found in a splice variant of Hsp90α in higher eukaryotes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Tripathi and Obermann, 2013</xref>). Structure based point mutations and complete removal of the TRAP1 strap (Δstrap) resulted in a sixfold increase in ATPase activity in zebrafish TRAP1 (zTRAP1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Lavery et al., 2014</xref>), evidence that the strap plays a regulatory role. Similarly, deletion of the strap in Grp94 (residues 22-72, referred to as the ‘pre-N domain’) resulted in a fivefold increase in ATPase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Dollins et al., 2007</xref>), indicative of a conserved regulatory role, although the mechanism remains unclear.</p><p>In this study, we explore the conformational cycle of TRAP1 and demonstrate that the strap is responsible for a large thermal barrier between the apo (open) and ATP bound (closed) states. Using negative-stain electron microscopy (EM) and Small-Angle X-ray Scattering (SAXS), we demonstrate that removal of the strap results in a profound reduction in the temperature sensitivity observed in multiple TRAP1 homologs, indicating that the strap is responsible for this unique behavior. Additionally, we develop fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) and continuous-wave EPR (CW-EPR) assays to show that the strap regulates the rate-limiting conformational transitions that precede NTD dimerization, including NTD rotation and lid closure over the ATP-binding pocket. These results indicate that the strap must stabilize both the apo state and the closed state, providing a unique evolutionary strategy for modulating different phases of the kinetic landscape and optimizing in vivo function of diverse Hsp90s.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>A temperature-sensitive kinetic barrier limits the conformational transition from apo to the closed state in TRAP1</title><p>With all previously studied Hsp90s, incubation with slowly- or non-hydrolyzable ATP analogs favors accumulation of a closed, NTD-dimerized state. However, the extent of closed-state accumulated and the rate of closure differentiated the Hsp90s with the individual values positively correlating with the ATP hydrolysis rate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Richter et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Southworth and Agard, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Hessling et al., 2009</xref>). Specifically, we used EM to demonstrate that the large variability in observed ATPase rates of cytosolic bacterial (bHsp90), yeast (yHsp90), and human Hsp90 (hHsp90), directly correlated with the ability of each homolog to reach a closed conformation in the presence of non-hydrolyzable ATP (AMPPNP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Southworth and Agard, 2008</xref>). Here, negative-stain EM was again used to monitor the ability of human TRAP1 (hTRAP1) to transition from the apo conformation to the closed conformation in the presence of AMPPNP. While hTRAP1 has an ATPase rate similar to the <italic>E. coli</italic> Hsp90 (∼0.5 min<sup>−1</sup>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Cunningham et al., 2012</xref>), surprisingly hTRAP1 remained in the open conformation despite incubation with saturating AMPPNP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Noting that the discrepancy might be related to different incubation temperatures between the two experiments, we monitored the ability of hTRAP1:AMPPNP to close as a function of temperature. After 1 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) or overnight (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) incubation at room temperature (RT, ∼23°C) hTRAP1 remained in the open state. However, after a single hour of incubation at increasing temperatures, the closed state was increasingly populated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). These results correlate well with the temperature sensitive steady-state hydrolysis rates of hTRAP1 that increases by nearly 200-fold between 25°C and 55°C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Leskovar et al., 2008</xref>) and are consistent with closure being rate-limiting for hydrolysis. Importantly, the equilibrium reached at each temperature (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) remains fixed after subsequent incubation at RT overnight (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). These data suggest both a large, unusually thermally sensitive kinetic barrier to closure and a highly stable closed state.<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.03487.004</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>A temperature-dependent barrier separates the apo and closed state of TRAP1.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Negative stain electron microscopy (EM) images of hTRAP1 in the presence of AMPPNP at increasing temperatures for 1 hr.

As demonstrated by a shift towards a more compact pair-wise inter-atomic distance distribution, P(r), there was a strong correlation between temperature and dimer closure, (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). By fitting the distributions as a linear combination of open and closed states, the fraction of closed state can be accurately estimated (‘Materials and methods’). After 1 hr at 20°C only 0.4% of the molecules have reached the closed conformation, while at 43°C roughly 84% of the molecules are closed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>).

The ordered strap extension observed in the zTRAP1 structure is also kinetically important, as Δstrap (deletion of zTRAP1 residues 73–100) and a single point mutant aimed at disrupting a conserved, stabilizing salt bridge at the beginning of the strap, accelerated hydrolysis by sixfold and fourfold, respectively. Together, these raised the possibility that the strap might also be responsible for the unusual temperature-regulated energy landscape observed in TRAP1 homologs.</p><p>As a first step, we show that in hTRAP1, strap removal (lacking residues 60–85) has an even more profound impact on ATPase activity (∼30-fold) than on zTRAP1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>). The larger increase in ATPase activity for hTRAP1 correlates with the more significant temperature dependence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>) and thus a higher kinetic barrier for hTRAP1 at the experimental temperature of 30°C. Notably, a smaller truncation lacking residues 60–69, that preserved the conserved His71:Glu142 salt-bridge in hTRAP1, did not have an effect on ATPase activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>).<fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.03487.008</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>NTD-strap regulates ATP hydrolysis rates.</title><p>WT and strap mutants for hTRAP1.

This indicates that beyond a role in stabilizing the closed conformation through trans-protomer interactions, the strap must also be involved in apo interactions that inhibit a transition towards the closed state. These data together with previously solved crystal structures of other Hsp90 N-terminal domains displaying cis-contacts of the initial β-strand suggest that the strap likely makes equivalent contacts with the same NTD (cis) in the apo state that it forms with the trans-NTD in the closed state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Shiau et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Dollins et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Li et al., 2012</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>NTD-strap limits closure rate by regulating NTD rotation and lid dynamics</title><p>The above results predict that the rate of closure should be proportional to temperature. Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET) provides a more convenient method than SAXS to directly measure the rate of closure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Hessling et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Mickler et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Street et al., 2011</xref>). Two FRET constructs were designed to probe distinct aspects of the closure reaction, relying on a Cys-free version of hTRAP1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Lavery et al., 2014</xref>). The first construct modeled from FRET positions previously designed for yHsp90 placed a single Cys residue on each protomer (E140C and E407C, ‘Inter FRET’) so as to give an increase in FRET upon closure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Hessling et al., 2009</xref>). The second construct modeled on previous work with bHsp90 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Street et al., 2012</xref>), adds two Cys residues to a single protomer (S133C and E407C, ‘Intra FRET’), and is designed to track the ∼90<sup>o</sup> NTD rotation (relative to the MD) that occurs upon closure. After forming heterodimers, closure reactions were initiated with AMPPNP over a temperature range mirroring our SAXS experiments and the change in FRET was monitored. Pre- and post-reaction fluorescent scans showed a predicted FRET change indicative of closure for each FRET construct (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). As expected, the rate of closure correlated with increasing temperature (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl3">Table 3</xref>) for both dimer closure and NTD:MD rotation measurements. To measure the contribution of the strap to the kinetics of closure, we truncated the strap region of either one or both protomers in each FRET construct (although the dimeric Δstrap construct used to measure NTD rotation proved too unstable to obtain reliable data). In both cases, a large acceleration of closure was apparent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>) with the largest acceleration (16-fold) observed for the double-strap deletion.<fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.03487.009</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>The NTD-strap regulates closure rate of TRAP1.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Steady-state FRET scans at 23°C for apo and AMPPNP reactions after closure with AMPPNP reached completion illustrating the anti-correlated change in FRET upon closure as measured by ‘dimer closure’ between protomers (left, Inter FRET) and rotation of the NTD from apo to the closed state within one protomer ‘NTD:MD Rotation’ (right, Intra FRET).

At every temperature sampled removing the strap results in an acceleration of closure compared to WT and an overall loss in temperature dependence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). Comparing the fold changes in closure rates (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl3">Table 3</xref>), we see the largest fold change at lower temperatures (23°C: 24-fold, 30°C: 16-fold, 32°C: 12-fold, 36°C: sevenfold, and 42°C: threefold). This increased impact at lower temperatures is readily evident in an Arrhenius plot calculated from the inter FRET experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). The resultant activation energies (E<sub>a</sub>) taken from the slopes of these curves are 48.8 kcal/mol and 29 kcal/mol, for WT and Δstrap respectively. From the difference, the strap appears to be contributing ∼20 kcal/mol towards the E<sub>a</sub> of WT hTRAP1, which we interpret as ∼ 20 kcal/mol of enthalpic stabilization of the open state. Our E<sub>a</sub> for WT hTRAP1 is consistent with that measured previously under slightly different conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Leskovar et al., 2008</xref>), but is considerably higher than that calculated for other Hsp90 homologs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Frey et al., 2007</xref>). As a control, we also measured steady-state ATPase rates on the labeled protein used for the FRET experiments. While these showed differences in absolute ATPase rates between 1.5 and fourfold compared with their unlabeled counterparts (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2 tbl3">Tables 2 and 3</xref>), the relative impact of strap deletion was consistent across experiments. Together, these data support a model in which the N-terminal strap limits closure by inhibiting the rotational movement of the NTD that is necessary to form the catalytically active closed state.</p><p>To probe the underlying mechanism of the NTD-strap in the closure reaction, we sought to examine the relationship of the strap to the dynamics of the NTD lid (zTRAP1 residues 191–217) that closes over the ATP binding pocket; a mechanism conserved in many ATPases. Previous studies with yHsp90 have suggested a correlation between the ‘β-strand swap’ and dynamics of the NTD lid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Richter et al., 2006</xref>). In an open conformation and prior to nucleotide binding, the lid makes contacts with helix 1 (H1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Richter et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Shiau et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Dollins et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Li et al., 2012</xref>), while in the closed state the lid rotates to secure nucleotide via interactions at conserved sidechains (Ser193 and Ser195 in zTRAP1) inside the nucleotide binding pocket (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ali et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Lavery et al., 2014</xref>) (<xref ref-type="other" rid="media2 media3">Videos 2 and 3</xref>).

A cys-free version of zTRAP1 with an Ala201Cys mutation allowed labeling of a fully accessible cysteine residue in the lid with N-(1-oxyl- 2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-4-piperidinyl)maleimide (MSL). We observed a small difference in ATPase activity with the MSL-labeled TRAP1 compared with ATPase rates measured using WT TRAP1 suggesting a minor labeling effect on steady-state catalytic turnover (∼1.3 fold). EPR spectra are sensitive to the rotational mobility of the attached MSL probe making it a useful reporter for changes in local conformational dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Hubbell et al., 2000</xref>). EPR spectra of full-length zTRAP1 were recorded at 23°C and shown to be more mobile in the nucleotide bound state compared to the apo state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). Mobility of the lid as measured with EPR is consistent with apo structures showing low B-factors in this region due to significant contacts with H1 of the cis protomer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Richter et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Shiau et al., 2006</xref>). Conversely, crystal structures of TRAP1 and other Hsp90 homologs bound to ATP analogs in the closed and dimerized conformation show that the lid folds over the nucleotide, has increased B-factors and lacks many of the stabilizing contacts with the N-terminal domain found in the apo state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ali et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Lavery et al., 2014</xref>). This is consistent with the mobile signature in the EPR observed for the closed conformation. Comparing apo state equilibrium measurements for WT and Δstrap shows little change upon strap deletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). Fortunately EPR is sufficiently sensitive and the closure kinetics for TRAP1 are sufficiently slow, that it is possible to directly monitor changes in lid state over time. By plotting the change in normalized peak heights over time (‘Materials and methods’, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>), it is apparent that the amplitude changes for both the mobile and immobile peaks are well fit by a single exponential curve for each sample. From this, it is clear that the rate of change between states as monitored by lid mobility is much faster for the Δstrap sample than for WT. The fold difference between rates is on the order of changes in ATPase rates under conditions used in the EPR experiment (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>). Altogether, these data suggest that the local conformational changes of lid closure and NTD-rotation are part of the rate-limiting barrier to the closed state and are regulated by N-terminal residues of the strand swap and extended strap in TRAP1.<fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.03487.015</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Lid Closure rate is regulated by the NTD-strap.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Continuous Wave (CW) EPR scans of cysteine Free WT (top) and Δstrap zTRAP1 (bottom) labeled with a spin-probe on the NTD-lid (green) in order to observe changes to the lid in the apo and closed states (‘Materials and methods’).

Moreover, it appears to be also responsible for the pronounced temperature-sensitivity. Although the experiments above indicate a strong role in modulating the forward closure rate, the TRAP1 crystal structure would suggest that deleting the strap might also compromise the stability of the closed state, thereby enhancing reopening rate and shifting the equilibrium towards the open state. To measure the re-opening rate, inter FRET-labeled hTRAP1 was pre-closed with AMPPNP. After closure was complete a 20-fold excess ADP was added such that upon re-opening of the NTD dimer interface, ADP would exchange resulting in a decreased FRET signal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Street et al., 2011</xref>). Previous studies found apo state nucleotide on and off-rates to be fast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Leskovar et al., 2008</xref>), thus the above experiment provides a good approximation of the uni-molecular reopening rate.

As closure is rate-limiting, even single-turnover experiments would provide an aggregate rate made up of the closure and hydrolysis steps. During the course of our FRET experiments, we discovered that omitting Mg<sup>2+</sup> from the reaction buffer results in an accumulation of the closed-state in the presence of ATP without ATP hydrolysis. By contrast, in the presence of ATP and Mg<sup>2+</sup>, TRAP1 is predominantly in the apo state as a consequence of hydrolysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B,D</xref>). The latter is consistent with previous observations with yHsp90 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Hessling et al., 2009</xref>) and bHsp90. These observations allowed us to decouple the closure and hydrolysis steps by pre-incubating TRAP1 with excess ATP without Mg<sup>2+</sup>, thereby stalling the reaction in the closed state (illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). Upon addition of Mg<sup>2+</sup>, ATP is hydrolyzed and the equilibrium shifts predominantly to the apo state as seen by the loss of FRET (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). Testing WT and Δstrap in this assay revealed an acceleration of closure with removal of the strap, consistent with experiments using AMPPNP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). Interestingly, the closure rate measured by FRET is significantly faster with ATP than AMPPNP suggesting a significant difference in energetics between the nucleotide analogs (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl3">Table 3</xref>). The use of ATP for FRET-based closure measurements better matches our ATPase measurements and points to a correlation between closure rates and ATPase activity (0.79 min<sup>−1</sup> ATPase vs 0.42 min<sup>−1</sup> FRET Closure, both measurements with Inter FRET probe protein), though we do still observe a difference perhaps representing a small Mg<sup>2+</sup> contribution. Addition of excess Mg<sup>2+</sup> showed the predicted drop in FRET and revealed a minor difference in hydrolysis rate (∼1.4-fold) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl3">Table 3</xref>), suggesting that the strap may also subtly alter lid dynamics in the closed state. The acceleration effects observed for the Δstrap protein are greater at 25°C, where the temperature dependent difference is more pronounced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl3">Table 3</xref>). Notably, our measured closure and hydrolysis rates matched previously reported values for these steps modeled using a global fitting procedure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Leskovar et al., 2008</xref>). However, the closure and hydrolysis rates measured here (0.003 s<sup>−1</sup> and 0.07 s<sup>−1</sup>, respectively) were somewhat arbitrarily assigned to the reverse order in the previously reported model. Since our experiments independently measure both reactions, we can now assign closure to be the slowest and hence rate-limiting step. This model is in good agreement with the other data presented in this study.</p><p>Our combined data better define the kinetic cycle for TRAP1 and support a model where the strap regulates multiple steps with the largest contribution being to the thermal sensitive rate-limiting kinetic barrier between the apo and nucleotide-bound closed states.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The conservation of Hsp90 has been established from bacteria to humans, giving rise to homologs in different species and distinct versions in different cellular compartments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Johnson, 2012</xref>).

Specifically, after ATP is bound, release of cis contacts of the β-strand/strap is coupled to lid closure and NTD rotation, presenting surfaces that form and stabilize an NTD-dimerized state. Due to closure-induced strain this ultimately results in an asymmetric conformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Lavery et al., 2014</xref>). Hydrolysis of one of the two ATPs leads to rearrangement of client binding residues (red) between the MD:CTD thus coupling the first ATP to client remodeling when clients are bound to this region.

In keeping with observations here, biochemical analysis revealed that this extension is a negative regulator of ATPase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Tripathi and Obermann, 2013</xref>).</p><p>In the TRAP1 family, conservation of the strap is strong through the known structured region (His87 in zTRAP1), but decreases towards the N-terminus, and is greatly reduced for TRAP1s from blood fluke, insects, and the sea urchin. Cytosolic Hsp90 has the same drop in conservation and a much shorter strap. By contrast, Grp94 has a very long and very well conserved strap region, with a somewhat variable, but very acidic N-terminus. Despite its long size, deleting the analogous strap region in Grp94 accelerates ATP hydrolysis by only fivefold, although temperature modulation was not investigated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Dollins et al., 2007</xref>). However, its extreme length, the strong conservation, and the modest effect of deletion on ATPase rates, suggest a possible regulatory role that could couple other phenomena beyond temperature to the rate-limiting conformational changes required for ATP hydrolysis.</p><p>The observation that the catalytic efficiency of different Hsp90s vary by ∼15-fold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Richter et al., 2008</xref>) suggest that regulation of the rate-limiting step has been highly tuned through evolution for functional importance. In support of this, yHsp90 mutations that accelerate or decelerate ATPase rates result in significant growth defects and loss of client protein folding in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Nathan and Lindquist, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Prodromou et al., 2000</xref>). The evolution of additional residues at the N-terminus of the Hsp90 gene provides a convenient way to adapt the chaperone's conformational cycle to function with diverse clients encountered by the different homologs or under stressed environmental conditions. Additionally, while the cytosolic Hsp90s are highly regulated by several co-chaperones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Zuehlke and Johnson, 2010</xref>), only one co-chaperone has been identified for the organellar homologs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Liu et al., 2010</xref>). This brings forth the possibility that the more extended strap in these homologs could directly or indirectly perform some of the regulation that co-chaperones provide to Hsp90 in the cytosol.</p><p>The marked temperature sensitivity observed with TRAP1 raises the intriguing possibility that it represents a homeostatic response in mitochondria where heat is generated through uncoupling of the electron transport chain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Rousset et al., 2004</xref>). In keeping with the physiological relevance, we demonstrate that the thermal sensitive kinetic barrier is measurably different between zebrafish and human TRAP1, which have significantly different physiological temperatures and environments. Additionally, added contacts that the strap provides could be a target for post-translation modifications or even provide a novel binding site for ions, metabolites, or other factors that could modulate the regulatory functions of this element. These observations provide an example of how evolved extensions at the Hsp90 N-terminus can be used to fine-tune chaperone activity to match organism-specific environmental conditions or unique subcellular demands required for optimal function.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Protein production and purification</title><p>Full-length and mutant versions of TNF receptor-associated protein 1 (TRAP1) from <italic>Homo sapiens</italic> and <italic>Danio rerio</italic> (hTRAP1 and zTRAP1, respectively) were purified using our previously described protocol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Lavery et al., 2014</xref>).

The WT apo data were chosen as the best representation of apo for two reasons.

Its function is coupled to ATP hydrolysis along with associated large conformational changes. While the key steps of the Hsp90 ATPase cycle are understood, the regulation of these structural rearrangements is still elusive. Previously, the authors solved the crystal structure of mitochondrial Hsp90, TRAP1, bound to AMPPNP.</p><p>They identified a 14-residue extension of the N-terminal beta-strand which crosses over between protomers in the closed state. This 'strap' is found in higher eukaryotes but is absent in yeast and bacteria. The authors also showed that point mutations or the deletion of the strap in TRAP1 (of zebra fish) or endoplasmic Grp94 results in an increase in ATPase activity. In this study, they show that a temperature-dependent kinetic barrier limits the conformational changes from the apo to the closed form of TRAP1. At lower temperature (23°C) TRAP1is predominantly open, even in the presence of AMPPNP. Local conformational changes associated with lid closure are a part of the rate limiting step to the closed state and are regulated by the strap in TRAP1.</p><p>This is an interesting observation adding to our understanding of aspects of the conformational cycle of Hsp90 and species-specific differences.</p><p>However, the biological function of the temperature regulation remains unclear to me, assuming that 37°C may be the resting state of human mitochondria and higher temperature present during energy generation or under thermal stress conditions. Thus the regulation should be active at higher temperatures, such as 42°C. Experiments addressing this issue would be of interest.</p><p>Specific points:</p><p>1) The authors state that the kinetic barrier for closure is large and unusually sensitive to temperature changes. Examples should be included to allow for comparison.</p><p>2) The kinetic data should include fits and resulting rate constants (and also which equation was used) to judge quality of the kinetic model.</p><p>3) If the measured conformational change is indeed rate limiting then its temperature dependence should be the same as that of the ATPase activity measured before. Is this indeed the case? How is the relationship of the shortened variant?</p><p>4) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>: Do other Hsp90 isoforms also show a similar trend over a temperature range or is this special just for TRAP1?</p><p>5) Experiments in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1 fig2">Figure 1 and 2</xref> do not show kinetics, just a shift of equilibria.</p><p>6) EM images for delta strap should be included.</p><p>7) In an Agard publication from 2008 (Southworth &amp; Agard, Cell 2008) EM images of HtpG, yeast and human Hsp90 are shown in the apo state, with AMPPNP, and with ADP. The human Hsp90α is in an open conformation with AMPPNP at 37°C (according to them TRAP1 is fully closed at 37°C).</p><p>8) Figure 2–figure supplement 1: Isn't this the same figure as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref> just without the delta-strap?</p><p>9) Is it known that the trans contacts that strap forms in the closed conformation stabilize the closed conformation?</p><p>10) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>: For the NTD:MD rotation, the FRET probe does not show a significant change in the FRET signal.</p><p>11) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>: Why was saturation not reached for the 42°C sample?</p><p>12) Data for the dimer closure FRET construct should be included and it would be important to see how delta-strap acts in the FRET assay at different temperatures to compare with the SAXS data.</p><p>13) Why was the double strap mutant too unstable for NTD rotation FRET and not for inter-protomer FRET? Isn't it the same construct just with a different Cys label?</p><p>14) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>: The legend says that in the apo state the lid probe is in equilibrium between mobile and immobile states. In the Results section it is stated that the apo form is predominantly immobile.</p><p>15) According to the authors, deleting strap compromises the stability of the closed structure and hence enhances the reopening rate and shifts the equilibrium towards the open state. If deleting strap shifts the equilibrium towards the open state, why is the delta-strap construct predominantly closed?</p><p>In this context, the authors mention that the effect of deleting the strap on the opening of the NTD interface is smaller than the effect on the kinetic barrier corresponding to the release of strap from the apo state. The respective numbers seem to be missing from <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl3">Table 3</xref>.</p><p>16) Are the ATPase activities of the cys-free version of hTRAP1 and zebrafish TRAP1 mutant identical to the respective wild type proteins?</p><p>17) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>. The legend says delta strap is ∼7 fold faster; text says ∼8 fold faster.</p><p>18) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>: a trace showing that in presence of ATP without Mg2+, there is no ATPase activity should be added. Not adding Mg2+ is not necessarily equivalent to not having (ambient) Mg2+ present in the solution. The ATP induced changes in FRET signals should be measured also in the presence of EDTA.</p><p>19) The authors mention that in the absence of Mg2+, ATP and AMPPNP show pronounced differences in kinetics of FRET signal, the difference with/without Mg2+ should be even more pronounced, that is the kinetics of o/c may be substantially faster in the presence of Mg2+. Measuring the FRET kinetics upon addition of Mg-ATP and Mg-AMPPNP is crucial to show that ATP induced closing kinetics in absence of Mg2+ are indeed representative for the ATPase cycle.</p><p>20) How does one know that Mg2+ can actually bind to the closed form; and that a re-open is not necessary for this to happen?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2</italic></p><p>In this study, Partridge and colleagues investigate the role of the N-terminal extension (“strap”) of TRAP1, the mitochondrial Hsp90 isoform, which in the previously solved crystal structure of the TRAP1 dimer wraps around the N-domain of the opposite protomer. They characterized the effects of the strap on the dimer closure kinetics, the rotation of the N-domain relative to the M-domain, the ATP hydrolysis and movement of the ATP lid (N-domain) using negative stain electron microscopy (EM), small angle x-ray scattering (SAXS), fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) measurements. They demonstrate that the strap region is responsible for a temperature-dependent increase in the rate of TRAP1 closure, as well as the increase in the ATPase activity.</p><p>The data presented here is convincing and interesting. The physiological relevance of the observed phenomenon is not so clear since the major effects for human TRAP1 happen at temperatures below 37°C. Nevertheless, the story could be published after the authors addressed the raised issues.</p><p>Major comments</p><p>1) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> shows negative stain EM images of TRAP1 in the presence of AMPPNP pre-incubated at different temperatures. Few representative samples are picked from each grid to show the transition from open to closed conformation with the increase in temperature. The authors should quantify the open and closed structures from a representative square of the electron micrograph.</p><p>2) Using SAXS the authors measured AMPPNP-induced transition of human and zebrafish TRAP1 to the closed conformation between 20 and 36°C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). To determine the physiological relevance of their observations the authors could have measured the AMPPNP induced transition of human TRAP1 at 37 to 42°C. Does human TRAP1 become more active at heat shock temperatures?</p><p>3) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>: The authors investigate AMPPNP-induced changes in TRAP1 conformation using FRET. Control experiments with only the acceptor dye need to be shown especially as the changes in fluorescence for the NTD:MD rotation seems to be very small. The temperature at which the experiment of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4(A)</xref> has been performed should be mentioned in the figure legend.</p><p>4) The dimer closure FRET experiments have been performed only at 30°C. As the paper deals with effect of temperature on ATPase rates of TRAP1, it would be very important to see the change in rate of dimer closure at different temperatures. It would also be interesting whether the rates of NTD-MD-rotation and dimer closure are similar to each other.</p><p>5) In <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref> the authors write that the steady state ATPase rate for human TRAP1 was 0.463 min-1 and in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl3">Table 3</xref> the write that the closing rate for human TRAP1 at 30°C was 0.02 min-1. These values do not fit together and contradict the claims of the authors. The authors should indicate at which temperature the ATPase assays were performed and correlate the closing rate with the ATP hydrolysis rates to substantiate their claims. Maybe the authors will have to measure the closing rate upon addition of ATP instead of AMPPNP. This seems possible since omission of Mg prevents hydrolysis as the authors have shown.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.03487.021</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>The Reviewing editor and the other reviewers have commented positively on your manuscript. Both reviewers have identified one point that needs additional support. This issue concerns the fact that the physiological relevance of the work is not so clear, since the major effects for human TRAP1 happen at temperatures below 37°C. Both reviewers were interested in seeing data recorded at higher temperatures. Please address this important issue in the revised manuscript and as many of the comments in the two reviews as possible</italic>.</p><p>The major question echoed by all was whether the experiments done in this paper could be done at higher temperatures to better reflect how the observed temperature dependent activity of TRAP1 would be beneficial above homeostatic temperatures of the organism for the homologs tested. We have attempted to address these concerns by including new data recorded at temperatures above 37°C. 37°C data were already included in the original manuscript. This includes new electron micrographs of samples incubated at 42°C, SAXS data up to 43°C, and better explanation of previously recorded data demonstrating that the rate of ATPase activity in TRAP1 will continue to increase until 60°C, at which point TRAP1 begins to denature. The new data taken at temperatures above 37°C has been added to already existing figures.</p><p>The new EM data has been incorporated into <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, panel A. The new SAXS data has been incorporated into <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, panels A, B, C, D. <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref> has also been updated to include data above 37°C, reflecting the changes made to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>. We also responded to the reviewer’s requests by including FRET data for both types of probes, intra and now inter FRET (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). The increasing temperature series for both sets of FRET probes behaves similarly and increases as a response to temperature with each assay having a comparable fold increase. Further we added extensive temperature series of closure kinetics measured using the inter FRET probe between 23 and 42°C for the delta strap variant of human TRAP1. Two new panels have been added with this data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D, E</xref>). Importantly this data, together with that previously shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref> allows calculation of an Arrhenius activation energy ±strap. This shows that the strap contributes ∼60% of the activation energy measured for WT TRAP1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> legend and within the main text). Further, we have made every attempt to improve the manuscript as suggested.</p><p>These edits include changes to main text figures, as well as further edits to the text. We have additionally pointed out examples of data recorded at temperatures above 37°C that were included in the original submission, such as the FRET experiment measuring the temperature dependence of NTD rotation. These changes and our responses to individual comments by reviewers are discussed in more detail below.</p><p>Reviewer #1</p><p><italic>Hsp90 is a molecular chaperone found in prokaryotes and in the cytosol as well as organelles of the eukaryotic cell.

Both high temperature datasets agree with the basic observation that a compact or “closed” conformation dominates the population at equilibrium.</p><p>With EM we see that the predominant form is a closed conformation at higher temperatures as demonstrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>. Additionally there continues to be an increase in the % closed population as measured with SAXS, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>. This increase in the % closed population in both species has been tabulated in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>. Looking at both <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref> you can see that the % closed does continue to increase beyond 37 °C, although there is one outlier in all this data and that is WT zTRAP1, which shows a decrease in % closed. Presumably, temperatures above 37° C are physiologically irrelevant for zebrafish. That said, Δstrap zTRAP1 did continue to show an increase in the % closed population. Concerning steady-state ATP hydrolysis measurements at temperatures above 37 °C we also modified the text to make it more obvious that temperature dependence of ATPase had previously been characterized for TRAP1 by Johannes Buchner’s lab in manuscripts referenced in the text.</p><p>Our original submitted manuscript did include some FRET measurements taken at 42°C with WT hTRAP1 showing a dramatic increase in the rate of closure compared with 36°C, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl3">Table 3</xref>.

By collecting a new series of Δstrap temperature data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>), we can now calculate an Arrhenius activation energy for both the WT and Δstrap variants of TRAP1. Arrhenius fits are now included in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref> and with modifications included in the main text. We have also included a quantification of the activation energy for Hsp90 homologs (yHsp90 and Grp94) in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4–figure supplement 2</xref>, utilizing previously reported rates found in Frey et al 2007. Comparing our calculated activation energy as well as a previously reported value (Leskovar et al 2008), we find that the other homologs have significantly lower activation energies. These data clearly show that TRAP1 has unusually large response to temperature changes.</p><p><italic>2) The kinetic data should include fits and resulting rate constants (and also which equation was used) to judge quality of the kinetic model</italic>.</p><p>Agreed. The kinetic data in the manuscript now all include a plot of the fit used to determine the rate constant. The equations are now included in the methods section as well.</p><p><italic>3) If the measured conformational change is indeed rate limiting then its temperature dependence should be the same as that of the ATPase activity measured before</italic>. <italic>Is this indeed the case? How is the relationship of the shortened variant?</italic></p><p>We have better highlighted in the text our observation of the difference in closure rate (measured by FRET) with AMPPNP and ATP, and the steady-state ATPase rates. We find that the closure rate measured with ATP better matches the ATPase rate measured for the fully labelled Inter FRET probe used in experiments shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref> and in the same buffer and temperature conditions (see Methods). Though we have not measured the temperature dependence of closure with ATP at the full range of temperatures as AMPPNP, we do show that the closure rate is slower at 25 °C and that the fold difference in closure rate is greater between WT and Δstrap protein at 25 °C (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl3">Table 3</xref>). The difference between the ATP analogs suggests that the energetics differ which could shift (but not mitigate) the observed temperature dependence of closure depending on the analog used. Importantly, we point out that despite experimental differences that could arise due to cysteine removal, labelling, or usage of varying nucleotide, our observation of the unique temperature dependent closure (also supported by Leskovar et al 2008) and the role of the strap as a structural element responsible for regulating this observation remains constant across all experiments in our manuscript.</p><p>Our proposal that closure is rate limiting is supported by previous studies (Hessling et al 2009 and Leskovar et al 2008) as well as our measurements in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4 fig6">Figures 4 and 6</xref>, which allow us to evaluate the rate of closure, re-opening and hydrolysis in matching conditions for our WT and Δstrap FRET probes. We were able to decouple the closure and hydrolysis steps by removing MgCl2 from the closure reactions in the presence of nucleotide and find that closure is much slower than hydrolysis, with both WT and Δstrap hTRAP1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D and 6E</xref>, expounded upon within our manuscript). These experiments also show that removal of the strap has the greatest impact on the closure rate, a significant but smaller effect on re-opening, and a minor effect on hydrolysis.</p><p>We have additionally included FRET experiments with the Inter FRET probes to monitor the rates of closure ± the strap (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). From this data an Arrhenius plot of both the WT and Δstrap proteins has been added in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>. Calculating the difference in Ea between WT and Δstrap we assign the contribution of the strap to Ea at approximately 60% of the measured Ea for WT hTRAP1 (48.8 kcal/mol Ea for WT; 29 kcal/mol for Δstrap). These data are consistent with the steady-state SAXS and ATPase, and show that removal of the strap region lowers the energy barrier between apo and the closed state.</p><p><italic>4)</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1"><italic>Figure 1</italic></xref><italic>: Do other Hsp90 isoforms also show a similar trend over a temperature range or is this special just for TRAP1?</italic></p><p>This trend is not just specific for TRAP1 and we would like to point the reviewers to Leskovar et al 2008 and Krukenberg et al 2008. The sensitive temperature range and specific rates do vary dramatically among Hsp90 homologs, with TRAP1 displaying particularly heightened sensitivity (also see specific point 1 author response above). Regulation via the strap is the focus of our manuscript and the strap does not exist in the yHsp90 and bHsp90 homologs. In addition to TRAP1 and Grp94, the temperature sensitivity has also been recently reported for an Hsp90α alternative splice variant (Tripathi et al 2013) that importantly is imparted by a long N-terminal extension of ∼122 amino acids. We have made an effort to highlight these points in our discussion section.</p><p><italic>5) Experiments in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1 fig2"><italic>Figure 1 and 2</italic></xref> <italic>do not show kinetics, just a shift of equilibria</italic>.</p><p>We have changed the titles and Figure descriptions to better highlight these experiments as equilibrium experiments.

In this study we sought to bootstrap from our recent TRAP1 crystal structure (none are available for Hsp90α) to gain possible molecular insights into this difference. Cytosolic hHsp90 does not significantly close with AMPPNP at 37 °C suggesting a different energetic landscape and consequently a much lower ATPase activity, as highlighted in Southworth et al. It is important to note that although the energetics are different between Hsp90 homologs (likely due to different physiological environments, specific clients, and different requirements for co-chaperones) the underlying conformational states and mechanism of protein folding are conserved as also highlighted in Southworth et al.</p><p><italic>8) Figure 2–figure supplement 1: Isn't this the same figure as</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2"><italic>Figure 2C</italic></xref> <italic>just without the delta-strap?</italic></p><p>Figure 2–figure supplement 1 (now <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>) is meant to demonstrate that TRAP1 will remain closed even after cooling the sample back to 20°C for two hours. By this observation TRAP1 is kinetically trapped in the closed state after heating and will remain closed even when cooled. These data support a large temperature dependent barrier to the closed state that is overcome upon increasing temperature and a stable closed state once the transition has occurred rather than a pronounced temperature dependence of the equilibrium states.

We do not have a detailed explanation for why removing the strap in combination with the 2 Cys mutations in one protomer with the NTD rotation FRET pair destabilizes the protein. During purification of the Δstrap NTD FRET protein most was lost to cleavage products even when protease inhibitors were included.</p><p>The small amount of full-length protein that was purified did not appear unstable during experimental measurements, but given the unusual behavior during purification we did not have enough confidence in our measurements to report quantitative rates and draw conclusions from these measurements.</p><p><italic>14)</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5"><italic>Figure 5A</italic></xref><italic>: The legend says that in the apo state the lid probe is in equilibrium between mobile and immobile states.

If deleting strap shifts the equilibrium towards the open state, why is the delta-strap construct predominantly closed?</italic></p><p><italic>In this context, the authors mention that the effect of deleting the strap on the opening of the NTD interface is smaller than the effect on the kinetic barrier corresponding to the release of strap from the apo state.

By taking the ratio of the rates, Kclose has a 16-fold difference while Kreopen has an 8-fold difference. This is further described in the main text in the FRET based “Dissecting further regulatory functions of the NTD-strap” section of the Results section in this manuscript. Thus deleting the strap destabilizes the open state more than it destabilizes the closed state. However, the overall equilibrium is still in favor of the open state in the absence of ATP.</p><p><italic>16) Are the ATPase activities of the cys-free version of hTRAP1 and zebrafish TRAP1 mutant identical to the respective wild type proteins?</italic></p><p>No. The cys-free versions of hTRAP1 and zTRAP1 are faster than WT in ATPase rates by 1.5–2 fold. This is presented in our previous manuscript (Lavery et al 2014). The molecular basis for the increased ATPase in the Cysteine Free TRAP1 constructs is unknown; however, all of our measurements are done by comparing WT to mutant (Δstrap, or strap point mutants) in matching conditions. We are interested and drawing conclusions from the fold change between mutant protein and the respective WT protein. As mentioned above we also point out that despite any differences that come about due to cysteine removal, labelling or nucleotide used in the experiments, our observation of the unique temperature dependent closure and the role of the strap as the structural piece responsible for these observation remains constant across all experiments in our manuscript.</p><p><italic>17)</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6"><italic>Figure 6</italic></xref><italic>.

Rather, we measure a FRET signal that is always equivalent to Apo (no change from time zero). This was also seen in FRET studies with yeast Hsp90 (yHsp90) in Hessling et al, 2009. We noted the differences in the manuscript as an observation, however we feel uncovering the molecular reason for variability of rates and affinity between the two ATP analogs is beyond the scope of this manuscript.

We have attempted to address this concern, echoed by both the editor and Reviewer 1, by including new EM and SAXS data recorded above 37°C.

This is also clear from the FRET closure data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>) which shows a significant increase in closure rate at 42°C.

While we have done this in the past (Southworth, 2008), in practice, this is a somewhat painful and laborious procedure to do rigorously and instead here we chose to quantify the %closed state by SAXS. This is a significantly more quantitative assay for measuring equilibrium of states and has previously be used to measure Hsp90 conformational equilibrium by our lab and others (Frey et al, 2007).

As the paper deals with effect of temperature on ATPase rates of TRAP1, it would be very important to see the change in rate of dimer closure at different temperatures. It would also be interesting whether the rates of NTD-MD-rotation and dimer closure are similar to each other</italic>.</p><p>Because NTD-MD rotation is tightly coupled to closure, the closure rates measured by either probe set are similar; we had initially hoped to be able to tease apart these individual steps, but in practice, they seem kinetically inseparable (differences due to probe locations). We have now included the temperature dependent closure experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>) and note that both probe sets are comparable in matching experiments. We chose to do the dimer closure FRET experiment +/- strap at 30 °C with SAXS, EM and ATPase as this is the temperature where we see the largest differences between WT and Δstrap in the temperature range assayed. Additionally, we have now included a temperature dependent closure series for the Δstrap variant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). As predicted, comparing the fold changes of closure rates (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl3">Table 3</xref>) at each temperature we see the largest fold change at lower temperatures (23 °C: 24-fold, 30 °C: 16-fold, 32 °C: 12-fold, 36 °C: 7-fold, and 42 °C: 3-fold).

These values do not fit together and contradict the claims of the authors. The authors should indicate at which temperature the ATPase assays were performed and correlate the closing rate with the ATP hydrolysis rates to substantiate their claims. Maybe the authors will have to measure the closing rate upon addition of ATP instead of AMPPNP. This seems possible since omission of Mg prevents hydrolysis as the authors have shown</italic>.</p><p>We do recognize the significant difference between closure rates determined with AMPPNP and the ATPase measurements taken with ATP. For reference the best comparison should be done with the same protein and buffer conditions used in the FRET experiments with ATP as indicated in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl3">Table 3</xref> (0.79 min-1 ATPase- <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref> vs. 0.42 min-1 closure- <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl3">Table 3</xref>). There is a strong nucleotide dependence on the closure rates, and the closed state never builds up with ATP plus Mg2+ as hydrolysis is faster than closure. However, for this manuscript we would like to focus on a more broadened and molecular aspect of the strap mediating temperature sensitivity to regulate closure and thereby activity of TRAP1 in both zebrafish and human. We have done matched experiments for WT and Δstrap for each assay and have drawn our conclusions from the differences between these matched experiments.</p><p>We show the temperature dependence of the closure reaction and the loss of temperature dependence upon deletion of the strap is robustly observed between multiple biophysical and biochemical of experiments. We ask that the reviewers please excuse our reluctance to dive even further into molecular differences between ATP analogs as we feel this is beyond the scope of our study.</p></body></sub-article></article>
