(H3K27me2/3). Knowledge of the cues that control formation of such repressive Polycomb domains is extremely limited. We exploited natural and engineered chromosomal rearrangements in the fungus <italic>Neurospora crassa</italic> to elucidate the control of H3K27me2/3. Analyses of H3K27me2/3 in strains bearing chromosomal rearrangements revealed both position-dependent and position-independent facultative heterochromatin. We found that proximity to chromosome ends is necessary to maintain, and sufficient to induce, transcriptionally repressive, subtelomeric H3K27me2/3. We ascertained that such telomere-proximal facultative heterochromatin requires native telomere repeats and found that a short array of ectopic telomere repeats, (TTAGGG)<sub>17,</sub> can induce a large domain (~225 kb) of H3K27me2/3. This provides an example of a <italic>cis</italic>-acting sequence that directs H3K27 methylation. Our findings provide new insight into the relationship between genome organization and control of heterochromatin formation.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>H3K27</kwd><kwd>telomere repeats</kwd><kwd>position effect</kwd><kwd>chromosome rearrangements</kwd><kwd>polycomb repressive complex 2</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>N. crassa</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>T32 HD007348</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>McNaught</surname><given-names>Kevin J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Japanese Program to Disseminate Tenure Tracking System</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Honda</surname><given-names>Shinji</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM093061</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Selker</surname><given-names>Eric U</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Vast regions of facultative heterochromatin marked by methylation of lysine 27 on histone H3 depend on their proximity to chromosome ends and can be induced ectopically by insertion of telomere repeats.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Methylation of lysine 27 on histone H3 (H3K27me) has emerged as an important repressive mark of the Polycomb group (PcG) system, which is critical for development in higher organisms. PcG proteins were initially discovered in <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> as repressors of homeotic (<italic>HOX</italic>) genes during early embryogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lewis, 1978</xref>) and play integral roles in the maintenance of cellular identity and differentiation in a variety of eukaryotes. Moreover, dysfunction of the PcG system commonly leads to disease, including cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Piunti and Shilatifard, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Conway et al., 2015</xref>). Biochemical work demonstrated that PcG proteins form two distinct histone-modifying complexes known as Polycomb Repressive Complex 1 and 2 (PRC1 and PRC2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Müller et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Wang et al., 2004</xref>). PRC1 mono-ubiquitinates lysine 119 on histone H2A (H2AK119ub1) with its E3-ubiquitin ligase subunit, Ring1, while PRC2 catalyzes mono-, di-, and trimethylation of histone H3 lysine 27 (H3K27me1/2/3) by its SET-domain component, EZH2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Müller et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Wang et al., 2004</xref>). PRC2, but not PRC1, is widely conserved in eukaryotes, including the filamentous fungus <italic>Neurospora crassa,</italic> but is absent in some simple eukaryotes such as the well-studied yeasts <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> and <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Jamieson et al., 2013</xref>). H3K27me2/3 covers approximately 7% of the <italic>N. crassa</italic> genome, including about 1000 fully-covered genes, all of which are transcriptionally quiescent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Jamieson et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Galazka et al., 2016</xref>). The greater than 200 H3K27me2/3 domains, which range from 0.5 to 107 kb, are widely distributed throughout the genome but are enriched at subtelomeric regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Jamieson et al., 2013</xref>), as also reported for other fungi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Schotanus et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Dumesic et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Studt et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Connolly et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>In <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>, DNA regulatory regions known as Polycomb Response Elements (PREs) recruit PcG proteins to specific chromatin targets to maintain transcriptional silencing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Steffen and Ringrose, 2014</xref>). Recently, similar <italic>cis</italic>-acting elements have been detected in <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Xiao et al., 2017</xref>). In vertebrates and other organisms, however, the mechanism by which PcG proteins are directed to particular loci is elusive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bauer et al., 2016</xref>). We show that the control of H3K27 methylation is fundamentally different from that of epigenetic marks in constitutive heterochromatin. Not only is the genomic distribution of H3K27 methylation much more plastic than that of H3K9 methylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Jamieson et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Mathieu et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Deleris et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lindroth et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Reddington et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hagarman et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Wu et al., 2010</xref>), but also, unlike DNA methylation and methylation of histone H3K9, which are faithfully methylated <italic>de novo</italic> when introduced at arbitrary ectopic genomic sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Miao et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Selker et al., 1987</xref>), we show that H3K27 methylation is often position-dependent. We further demonstrate that telomere repeats underpin the observed position effect on H3K27me by showing that loss of telomerase abolishes subtelomeric H3K27me2/3 and that artificial introduction of telomere repeats at interstitial sites trigger deposition of H3K27me2/3. That is, telomere repeats themselves are both necessary for subtelomeric H3K27me2/3 and sufficient to trigger ectopic H3K27 methylation at internal chromosomal sites.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Analyses of classical chromosome rearrangements suggest that proximity to a chromosome end is key to subtelomeric H3K27 methylation</title><p>To search for <italic>cis-</italic>acting sequences that trigger facultative heterochromatin formation in <italic>N. crassa</italic>, perhaps analogous to PREs in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>, we dissected a 47 kb H3K27me2/3 domain on linkage group (LG) VIL.

We first examined translocations that involved the H3K27me2/3 domain on LG VIL that we had dissected, starting with UK3-41, an insertional translocation strain that has an approximately 1.88 Mb segment of LG VR inserted into a distal position on LG VIL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). The translocation shifted most of LG VIL to a more interior chromosomal position. Interestingly, H3K27me2/3 ChIP-seq of UK3-41 showed an absence of H3K27me2/3 in the region that was displaced from the chromosome end (lost H3K27me2/3; indicated in orange in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). This result is consistent with our finding that transplantation of segments from this region did not induce methylation at <italic>his-3</italic> or <italic>csr-1</italic> and suggests that the normal methylation of this subtelomeric domain is position-dependent.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.31216.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Chromosomal rearrangements are associated with altered H3K27me2/3.</title><p>(<bold>A–F</bold>) Schematics show the movement (magenta curved arrows) of translocated segments and the resulting chromosomal rearrangements for six translocation strains.

To address this possibility, we utilized OY350, a quasiterminal translocation that transfers a distal segment of LG VIL to the end of LG IR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Analysis of OY350 by H3K27me2/3 ChIP-seq showed that the translocated LG VIL domain preserved its normal H3K27me2/3 distribution when placed adjacent to the adoptive telomere. This finding supported the hypothesis that H3K27me2/3 in this domain depends on its proximity to the chromosome end and suggested that this requirement is non-specific; the different chromosome end apparently substituted for the native one. A similar situation was observed on LG VIR in OY320 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>).</p><p>The results described above suggested that proximity to a chromosome end may be sufficient to induce H3K27me. Interestingly, in addition to consistent losses of previously subtelomeric H3K27me2/3 in the examined genomic rearrangements, we identified new H3K27me2/3 domains at novel subtelomeric regions. Striking examples of <italic>de novo</italic> H3K27me2/3 were independently observed in seven genome rearrangements at their new chromosome ends (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B–E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A–C</xref>; marked in green). These novel domains of H3K27me2/3 extended an average of approximately 180 kb into the new subtelomeric regions. The only apparent exception concerns translocation UK2-32 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref>), which involved the left end of LG V with approximately one Mb of tandemly repeated rDNA that is not shown in the <italic>N. crassa</italic> genome assembly. The H3K27me2/3 distribution on all chromosomes unrelated to the genome rearrangements was unaltered (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). Altogether, our survey of chromosomal translocations strongly suggests that chromosome ends promote the deposition of H3K27me on neighboring chromatin.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Identification of position-independent H3K27-methylated domains</title><p>While domains of H3K27me2/3 are enriched near the ends of chromosomes in <italic>N. crassa</italic>, substantial domains are also found elsewhere. To examine the possibility of position-independent H3K27me2/3 residing within LG VIR, we examined the distribution of H3K27me2/3 in two translocations that effectively moved LG VIR to the middle of a chromosome. ALS159 is a reciprocal translocation that shifted wild-type LG VIR approximately 4.5 Mb away from the new telomere (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Although the shifted segment lost the H3K27me2/3 that was previously closest to the chromosome end, the more internal H3K27me2/3 was unaffected by the translocation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Similarly, when LG VIR was inserted in the middle of LG III in OY329 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>), most of the H3K27me2/3 on LG VIR was retained. Again, the H3K27me2/3 that was originally closest to the telomere was lost, however, consistent with the idea that subtelomeric H3K27me2/3 domains depend on their proximity to the chromosome ends.</p><p>To determine if the retention of H3K27me2/3 from LG VIR was unique, we examined the position-dependence of two other H3K27me2/3 domains. In translocation NM149, approximately 600 kb of LG IIL was translocated onto the end of LG VR, effectively shifting the native right arm of LG V about 600 kb away from the chromosome end (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Like the behavior of LG VIR in ALS159 and OY329, losses of H3K27me2/3 occurred in the most distal section of LG VR, but most H3K27me2/3 was retained, even when moved away from the chromosome end.

To examine the possibility that one or more <italic>trans</italic>-acting factors could be responsible for the loss of H3K27me2/3 in OY329, we crossed this strain, which is in an Oak Ridge (OR) background, to a highly polymorphic wild-type strain, Mauriceville (MV), to obtain progeny with a segmental duplication, that is, with the OR translocated LG VIR domain inserted into LG II in a strain that also contained the corresponding region on the native LG VI of MV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>).

However, translocations of large chromosomal segments revealed two distinct classes of transcriptionally repressive H3K27me domains, position-dependent and position-independent. Mechanistic insights from subsequent experiments defined these classes as telomere repeat-dependent and telomere repeat-independent H3K27me. The identification of telomere repeats as potent signals for H3K27 methylation represents a major advance in our understanding of facultative heterochromatin formation in eukaryotes.</p><p>Our study took advantage of a collection of spontaneous and UV-induced chromosome rearrangement strains of <italic>N. crassa</italic> that were primarily collected and characterized by David Perkins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Perkins, 1997</xref>). We surveyed representative rearrangement strains in which chromosomal regions containing domains of H3K27me were translocated to novel genomic positions. Strikingly, ChIP-seq revealed multiple cases in which subtelomeric H3K27me2/3 domains completely lost this modification when moved to an interior chromosomal location. Indeed, no exceptions to this rule were found.

Moreover, new subtelomeric regions gained H3K27me2/3 over sequences that were previously devoid of this mark (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). We conclude that proximity to a chromosome end, per se, somehow induces deposition of H3K27me2/3 in domains that can span hundreds of kilobases. Analyses of polyA+ mRNA from the strains revealed reductions in gene expression associated with the new H3K27me2/3 and increases in gene expression in regions that lost this mark; that is, the changes in H3K27me2/3 were reflected in underlying gene expression levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>).</p><p>Although gene silencing near chromosome ends, sometimes dubbed ‘telomere position effect’ (TPE) has been observed in fungi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kyrion et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Nimmo et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Castaño et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Smith et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Shaaban et al., 2010</xref>), <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Doheny et al., 2008</xref>), <italic>Mus musculus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Pedram et al., 2006</xref>), and human cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Baur et al., 2001</xref>), previous studies did not implicate H3K27me.

Although the phenomenon of TPE has been studied for decades, our findings may reflect the first documented case of H3K27me-mediated TPE.</p><p>The ability of chromosome ends to induce large domains of H3K27me2/3 in chromosomal translocation strains motivated us to investigate the role of telomere sequences in the establishment of facultative heterochromatin. We found that deletion of <italic>tert</italic>, the sole telomerase reverse transcriptase gene, results in a dramatic loss of H3K27me2/3 at subtelomeres, concomitant with loss of (TTAGGG)<sub>n</sub> repeats and chromosome circularization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). To directly test the possibility that telomere repeats can trigger domains of H3K27me2/3, we inserted an array of telomere repeats at two euchromatic, interstitial sites and used ChIP to check induction of H3K27me2/3. We found that, indeed, even a 48 bp array, (TTAGGG)<sub>8</sub>, could induce some local H3K27me2/3 at the <italic>csr-1</italic> locus. The independent induction of local H3K27me2/3 at the <italic>his-3</italic> locus suggests this effect is not position-specific (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). Remarkably, a 102 bp array, (TTAGGG)<sub>17</sub>, induced an H3K27me2/3 domain that covered approximately 225 kb, including 30 genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). These results strongly suggest that wild-type subtelomeric H3K27me2/3 is dependent on telomere repeats. The recruitment of PRC2 to telomere repeats may be a widespread phenomenon, considering that enrichment of H3K27 methylation at telomeres has been observed in fungi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Jamieson et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Schotanus et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Dumesic et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Studt et al., 2016</xref>), plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Baker et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Vaquero-Sedas et al., 2012</xref>) and animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Wirth et al., 2009</xref>).

Curiously, insertion of about 130 telomere repeats in Chinese ovary cells failed to significantly alter local transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kilburn et al., 2001</xref>). It should be interesting to study the effects of terminal and interstitial telomere repeats on heterochromatin formation in a variety of organisms.</p><p>We inferred the existence of position-independent H3K27 methylation from our observation that some H3K27me2/3 domains were unaffected when moved to ectopic chromosomal locations (e.g. see domains on LG IIIR in OY320, LG VR in NM149, and LG VIR in ALS159 and OY329; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). The recapitulation of normal H3K27me2/3 profiles at ectopic chromosomal sites is consistent with the possibility that these chromosomal regions contain <italic>cis</italic>-acting signals that trigger the deposition of H3K27 methylation, perhaps comparable to PREs in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>. It will be of interest to define the presumptive elements responsible for such position-independent H3K27me. While there is no consensus sequence for PREs in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>, they are composed of unique combinations of binding sites for a variety of factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kassis and Brown, 2013</xref>). One DNA-binding factor known to affect PcG silencing in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>, GRH, has an obvious homolog in <italic>N. crassa</italic> and could be a candidate for helping establish or maintain position-independent domains of H3K27me2/3 <italic>via</italic> sequence-specific interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Blastyák et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Nevil et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Paré et al., 2012</xref>). It remains possible that deposition of H3K27 methylation at position-independent domains is not directed by sequence-specific elements. In this context, it is worth noting that inhibition of transcription, caused by either exposure to RNA polymerase II inhibitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Riising et al., 2014</xref>) or deletion of a transcriptional start site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hosogane et al., 2016</xref>) was found to promote the deposition of H3K27me in mammalian cells. Conceivably, the position-independent domains of H3K27me2/3 in <italic>N. crassa</italic> could be directed by blocs of inherently low-expressing genes or by some other feature of the region, such as its location in the nucleus, which may be controlled by yet undefined factors. The fact that only about 10% of H3K27me2/3-marked genes are upregulated when the sole H3K27 methyltransferase is removed supports the notion that transcriptional shut-off may precede PRC2 recruitment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Klocko et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Jamieson et al., 2013</xref>). Still, low transcriptional activity cannot entirely explain the targeting of PRC2 in <italic>N. crassa</italic> since many low-expressed genes are not H3K27 methylated.</p><p>Genome rearrangements are a common occurrence in malignant cells and can drive tumorigenesis through the creation of gene fusions, enhancer hijacking and oncogene amplification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hnisz et al., 2016</xref>). Our findings suggest that genome rearrangements associated with cancer may additionally impact gene expression through effects on facultative heterochromatin. Indeed, there are already some reports of human diseases being driven by position effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Surace et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Guilherme et al., 2016</xref>). A great deal of research has focused on how characteristics of local chromatin influence translocation breakpoint frequencies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hogenbirk et al., 2016</xref>), but the effects of the resulting translocations on chromatin state are still ill-defined. Altogether, our work shows that changes in genome organization can have sweeping effects on both the distribution of an epigenetic mark and gene expression. Thus, chromosome rearrangements may have unappreciated roles in evolution and cancer etiology.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Strains, media and growth conditions</title><p><italic>N. crassa</italic> strains are listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref> and were grown and maintained according to standard procedures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Davis, 2000</xref>).

It seems exceedingly unlikely that another, unrelated enzyme catalyzes H3K27 methylation at the ectopic telomere repeats.</p><p>Our Discussion highlights both the possible involvement of TERRA and telomere-binding proteins in establishing H3K27me2/3 at ectopic TTAGGG repeats. Presuming TERRA is present in Neurospora, and transcribed from the ectopic TTAGGG repeats, it could act in <italic>cis</italic> by directly recruiting PRC2. PRC2 has a high affinity for the G-quadruplex structure that TERRA forms (Wang et al. 2017). Alternatively, PRC2 could be recruited to TTAGGG repeats by DNA binding factors. Recent experiments in Arabidopsis found that the telobox motif is enriched in candidate Polycomb response elements and that this motif can recruit the PRC2-interacting transcription factor, AZF1 (Xiao et al. 2017). Similar DNA binding factors in Neurospora may directly recruit PRC2 to the TTAGGG repeats.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Please show displays of data for the entire genome, not just the regions/chromosomes authors selected.</p></disp-quote><p>We now include this information (see new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>.).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Please address the replicability of the experiments.

Losses and gains of H3K27me2/3, essentially binary results, were confirmed by qPCR in biological triplicate. Some of our sequencing libraries were prepared using pooled triplicates to obtain the suggested minimum quantity of DNA required for our sequencing kit. In every experiment, qPCR results validated ChIP-seq results, giving us confidence in the ChIP-seq results.</p><p>We would like to emphasize that our paper describes dramatic, qualitative and highly specific changes in H3K27me2/3. Vast domains of H3K27me2/3 were lost and gained but only at regions moved from or to the vicinity of chromosome ends, respectively. The reproducibility of H3K27me2/3 distribution in regions unaffected by chromosomal rearrangements (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>) highlights the specificity of the observed H3K27me2/3 changes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) A different targeted integration site (e.g., his3, pan2) would be a necessary control to rule out position effects.</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested, we created an additional independent insertions of telomere repeats at a second locus, <italic>his-3</italic>, and demonstrated via ChIP-qPCR that 21, 22, and 23 telomere repeats also induce H3K27me (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>.).</p></body></sub-article></article>
