phase orchestrated by genetic programs and environmental signals. We have identified a leucine-rich-repeat domain transmembrane protein PAN-1 as a factor required for synaptic rewiring in <italic>C. elegans</italic>. PAN-1 localizes on cell membrane and binds with MYRF, a membrane-bound transcription factor indispensable for promoting synaptic rewiring. Full-length MYRF was known to undergo self-cleavage on ER membrane and release its transcriptional N-terminal fragment in cultured cells. We surprisingly find that MYRF trafficking to cell membrane before cleavage is pivotal for <italic>C. elegans</italic> development and the timing of N-MYRF release coincides with the onset of synaptic rewiring. On cell membrane PAN-1 and MYRF interact with each other via their extracellular regions. Loss of PAN-1 abolishes MYRF cell membrane localization, consequently blocking <italic>myrf</italic>-dependent neuronal rewiring process. Thus, through interactions with a cooperating factor on the cell membrane, MYRF may link cell surface activities to transcriptional cascades required for development.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>synaptic rewiring</kwd><kwd>laval development</kwd><kwd>MYRF</kwd><kwd>pan-1</kwd><kwd>membrane-bound</kwd><kwd>transcription factors</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>C. elegans</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>31571272</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Qi</surname><given-names>Yingchuan B</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>ShanghaiTech University</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Qi</surname><given-names>Yingchuan B</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002855</institution-id><institution>Ministry of Science and Technology of the People's Republic of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Dong</surname><given-names>Meng-Qiu</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>32061143020</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Dong</surname><given-names>Meng-Qiu</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100009592</institution-id><institution>Beijing Municipal Science and Technology Commission</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Dong</surname><given-names>Meng-Qiu</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Identified as a binding factor of transcription factor MYRF, the LRR-TM protein PAN-1 promotes the cell-membrane localization and nuclear translocation of MYRF, which drives synaptic rewiring in <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>During development, neurons enter a plastic phase, during which synapses can be added or pruned until mature circuits are formed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Purves and Lichtman, 1980</xref>). It is known that the plastic process is coordinated by genetic programs and environmental signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Espinosa and Stryker, 2012</xref>), but the underlying mechanisms are not fully understood. A striking and informative example of circuit plasticity occurs during the development of the <italic>C. elegans</italic> nervous system, in which six GABAergic motor neurons, known as dorsal D (DD) neurons, reverse their axonal and dendritic domains at the end of larval stage 1 (L1), with no overt changes in morphology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Hallam and Jin, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">White et al., 1978</xref>). After completion of the synaptic rewiring (or remodeling), DD neurons acquire new connectivity within the motor circuit. This unique event provides an attractive system for identifying the molecular requirements of circuit remodeling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Jin and Qi, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kurup and Jin, 2016</xref>).</p><p>Synaptic rewiring of DD neurons is driven by <italic>myrf</italic>, <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> ortholog of mammalian <italic>Myrf</italic> (<italic>M</italic><underline>y</underline>elin <italic>r</italic>egulatory <italic>f</italic>actor) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Meng et al., 2017</xref>). <italic>Myrf</italic> family consists of conserved, membrane-associated transcription factors. Evidence from studies in model organisms (including humans) collectively indicates an essential role for <italic>Myrf</italic> in animal development. In mice, germline deletion of <italic>Myrf</italic> led to early embryonic lethality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bujalka et al., 2013</xref>), and oligodendrocyte-specific deletion of <italic>Myrf</italic> blocked myelin formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Emery et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Koenning et al., 2012</xref>). Deletion of <italic>mrfA</italic>, the ortholog of <italic>Myrf</italic> in <italic>Dictyostelium</italic>, caused delayed multicellular development and deficient pre-stalk cell differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Senoo et al., 2012</xref>). The null mutation of <italic>C. elegans myrf-1</italic> resulted in developmental arrest at the end of L1, and a partial loss of function mutant of <italic>myrf-1</italic> displayed an extra L4-adult molt, indicating that <italic>myrf-1</italic> is involved in multi-stage development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Meng et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Russel et al., 2011</xref>). Over several years, more than 30 human genetic variants of <italic>MYRF</italic> have been identified in patients as causes of developmental anomalies in a range of tissues, including heart, lungs, diaphragm, genitourinary tract, and eyes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Qi et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Rossetti et al., 2019</xref>). In these cases, human <italic>MYRF</italic> appeared to be haploinsufficient. Despite its essential roles, how <italic>Myrf</italic> regulates animal development is largely uncharacterized.</p><p>The founding member of the <italic>Myrf</italic> family, mouse <italic>Myrf</italic>, transcriptionally regulates expression of myelinogenesis-related genes in oligodendrocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bujalka et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Li et al., 2013</xref>). The transcriptional activity is conferred by an N-terminal fragment of MYRF (N-MYRF), which harbors an <italic>I</italic>mmuno<underline>g</underline>lobulin (Ig)-fold like DNA-binding domain (DBD) homologous to the DBD of Ndt80, a pleiotropic transcription factor in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bujalka et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Chen et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Li et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Zhen et al., 2017</xref>). At least in cultured cells, full-length MYRF is localized on ER membrane by its single-pass transmembrane domain and undergoes self-catalyzed proteolysis to release N-MYRF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bujalka et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kim et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Li et al., 2013</xref>). Cleavage is mediated by an intramolecular chaperone of endosialidase (ICE) domain, located carboxyl to the cleavage point (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Schwarzer et al., 2007</xref>). The ICE domain was initially found in a tailspike protein (endosialidase) of bacteriophages. Assembly of an ICE domain homotrimer catalyzes cleavage, releasing the endosialidase activity region, which in turn breaks down bacterial cell wall (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Schulz et al., 2010</xref>). MYRF is the only eukaryotic protein known to contain the ICE domain, and in MYRF the domain appears to have adopted its ancestral role—to mediate MYRF trimerization and catalyze cleavage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kim et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Li et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Meng et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Senoo et al., 2013</xref>). Cleavage of MYRF on the ER-membrane appears to be constitutive in cultured cells, for which the MYRF ICE domain has been renamed as an intramolecular chaperone auto-cleavage (ICA) domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Li et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Liberating active form of transcription factors from membrane is of exquisite cellular importance, as the process provides a direct portal for cells to respond to internal or environmental cues by changing gene expression programs. Examples are the processing events that govern sterol regulation, Notch signaling, and the unfolded protein response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hoppe et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Seo et al., 2008</xref>). Transmembrane motifs are well conserved among MYRF family proteins, implying that MYRF’s membrane association confers important function; yet the cleavage of mammalian MYRF appears to occur constitutively, which is unusual because for all other known membrane-bound transcription factors, their release from membranes are regulated by inductive signals. It thus remains unclear why MYRF must go onto the ER membrane, and if the release of N-MYRF from ER is regulated <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p><p>Synaptic rewiring in <italic>C. elegans</italic> is also dependent on the cleavage and nuclear function of MYRF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Meng et al., 2017</xref>), suggesting that the molecular activity of MYRF is conserved. Curiously, while over-expression of N-MYRF-1 drives precocious synaptic rewiring, over-expression of full-length MYRF-1 does not. When MYRF was over-expressed in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, even by modest quantities, MYRF protein accumulated in a cytoplasmic structure (likely ER) without increasing in the nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Meng et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Russel et al., 2011</xref>), suggesting that MYRF nuclear localization does not automatically occur. In addition, when expressed in human cell lines, <italic>Ce</italic> MYRF is localized to the ER but cannot be cleaved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Meng et al., 2017</xref>). These observations together suggest that cleavage of <italic>Ce</italic> MYRF is not constitutive, but instead controlled by putative additional factors or dependent on specific conditions.</p><p>Because MYRF-1 and its paralog MYRF-2 are together indispensable for driving the synaptic rewiring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Meng et al., 2017</xref>), unraveling the regulation of MYRF activity is key to understanding this plastic process. We herein identify a leucine-rich repeat transmembrane (LRR-TM) protein PAN-1 as an essential factor in promoting synaptic remodeling. PAN-1 is a type I transmembrane protein with extracellular leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domains. PAN-1 was previously found to be a component of P-granule (an RNA granule in germline), expressed broadly in somatic tissues, and required for larval development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Gao et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Gissendanner and Kelley, 2013</xref>). We find that PAN-1 localizes on cell membrane and interacts with MYRF. PAN-1 is required for MYRF’s cell membrane localization and nuclear translocation. Our findings reveal undescribed activities of MYRF on cell membrane, which enact critical developmental regulation of synaptic rewiring.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>The LRR-TM protein PAN-1 is a binding factor of MYRF</title><p>To identify factors that potentially interact with MYRF and regulate MYRF’s activity, we performed mass-spectrometry analysis of co-immunoprecipitation (IP-MS) of GFP::MYRF-1 as well as GFP::MYRF-2 from extracts of transgenic animals expressing <italic>GFP::myrf</italic> driven by endogenous <italic>myrf</italic> promoters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Meng et al., 2017</xref>).

We analyzed the synaptic remodeling in <italic>pan-1(gk142)</italic>, a null deletion allele (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Gao et al., 2012</xref>). Synaptic remodeling of DD neurons normally occurs at late L1 when new synapses form in the dorsal processes of DD neurons, which is marked by the dorsal appearance of clusters of synaptic vesicles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C–E</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Hallam and Jin, 1998</xref>). By late L1, few synapses had formed in the dorsal processes of DDs in <italic>pan-1(gk142)</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D,E</xref>), indicating that the synaptic remodeling was defective in <italic>pan-1</italic> mutants. Axon morphology of DDs in <italic>pan-1(gk142)</italic> was no different from control animals; if anything, the GFP intensity of dorsal processes in <italic>pan-1(gk142)</italic> appeared to be weaker (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>).

The presence of juvenile DD synapses in <italic>pan-1</italic> mutants suggests that the loss of <italic>pan-1</italic> does not generally affect synaptogenesis in DDs. Because <italic>pan-1</italic> mutants are the first generation from heterozygous parent, it remains possible that maternal PAN-1 may contribute to embryonic and early L1 development of <italic>pan-1</italic> mutants.

Because the span of the missing segments closely corresponded with the position of dorsal neurites of individual DD neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), the lack of dorsal clusters was likely due to failed synaptic remodeling in corresponding DD neurons. For those DD neurons that displayed failed synaptic remodeling, the deficiency persisted into L4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref>) and adult animals.

PAN-1 is a Type-I transmembrane protein with an ER-targeting SP. The region that contains the LRR domains, is predicted to be non-cytoplasmic, that is in the ER-lumen or extracellular. There is also a short cytoplasmic region in PAN-1. MYRF is inserted in membrane by its single transmembrane domain, and 1–482 region of MYRF (responsible for transcriptional activation) is cytoplasmic, while 680–931 region of MYRF (of unknown function) is lumenal or extracellular. When PAN-1 and MYRF were co-expressed in HEK293T cells, both proteins were primarily detected in the ER (data not shown). PAN-1 binding was observed with the C-terminal region of MYRF, but not with the N-terminal region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>).

When compared the signal patterns of MYRF-1<sup>1-700 GFP</sup> and MYRF-1<sup>1-790 GFP</sup>, we indeed noticed the difference in at least two aspects. The first was that MYRF-1<sup>1-700 GFP</sup> signals were consistently brighter than MYRF-1<sup>1-790 GFP</sup> signals although they were both predominantly cytoplasmic (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8G</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1</xref>). A more striking feature was that the MYRF-1<sup>1-700 GFP</sup> signals were observed in nuclei of many cells, which is especially evident in big nuclei such as those for seam cells, epidermal cells, and intestinal cells. In contrast, similar nuclear GFP signals were not observed in <italic>myrf-1<sup>1-790 GFP</sup></italic> mutants. These observations were supported by analyzing the GFP intensity distribution along a line across a single seam cell or ventral cord neuron (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8G</xref>). We found that MYRF-1<sup>1-700 GFP</sup> signals exhibited an elevation of intensity in nuclear regions, even though the pattern across a population of animals lacked regularity. In contrast, MYRF-1<sup>1-790 GFP</sup> signals displayed uniformly saddle-shaped pattern suggesting the absence of nuclear signals. The relatively weak, yet detectable nuclear signals of MYRF-1<sup>1-700 GFP</sup> suggested that it could be processed on ER to release the N-MYRF-1<sup>GFP</sup>(1-482); however, the process was incomplete because prominent GFP signals remained in cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8F,G</xref>). Since the nuclear signals of MYRF-1<sup>1-700 GFP</sup> were observed at stages earlier than late L1, for example 10 post-hatch hours, we deduced that the cleavage of MYRF-1<sup>1-700 GFP</sup> on ER was constitutively active.

PAN-1 interacts with MYRF on the cell membrane, and the interaction is required for MYRF’s cell membrane localization and nuclear translocation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13">Figure 13</xref>). We find that MYRF needs to be trafficked onto the cell membrane in order for its N-terminal region to be cleaved and released.

Previous characterization of MYRF by immunostaining transfected cells or optic nerves of adult mice (for oligodendrocytes) concluded that the full-length MYRF resides on ER before undergoing constitutive self-cleavage; but none of the studies has described if MYRF could be detected on the cell membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bujalka et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Emery et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Li et al., 2013</xref>).

One possibility is PAN-1 is constitutively permissive for MYRF function, for example PAN-1 stabilizes the extracellular domain of MYRF; however, aberrant processing and function of MYRF<sup>1-700 GFP</sup> indicate that the ectodomain of MYRF is indispensable, further suggesting a regulatory role for PAN-1. The extracellular domain of PAN-1 is highly homologous to the ectodomain of human Toll-like receptor 5 (TLR5), a member of the toll-like receptor (TLR) family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Dolan et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Gissendanner and Kelley, 2013</xref>). TLR5 is known to recognize bacterial flagellin to initiate an intracellular signaling cascade in innate immunity response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Hayashi et al., 2001</xref>). Although PAN-1 lacks the intracellular motifs of TLR5, its extracellular LRR domains may serve as a receptor for an unidentified ligand. Because MYRF cleavage is dependent on trimerization via its ICE region, MYRF interaction with PAN-1 may alter the state of MYRF trimerization, which affects cleavage.</p><p>The extent of regulation of MYRF activity on the membrane remains unknown.

These findings support the functional importance of the MYRF C-tail region and corroborate with our observation that the MYRF extracellular domain is essential for MYRF’s activity.</p><p>We previously determined that overexpressing N-MYRF-1<sup>1-482</sup> in DDs sufficiently accelerated the synaptic rewiring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Meng et al., 2017</xref>). However, in present study, endogenous expression of N-MYRF (as in <italic>myrf-1<sup>1-482 GFP</sup></italic>, <italic>myrf-1<sup>1-656 GFP</sup></italic>) appeared to be deficient in MYRF function, even though N-MYRF-1 in all cases concentrated in the nucleus. We reasoned that overexpressed transgene N-MYRF-1 could sufficiently form trimers, a prerequisite for its full transcriptional activity, whereas endogenously expressed N-MYRF-1 could not. To test the hypothesis, we generated two single-copy transgene lines, expressing full-length MYRF-1 and N-MYRF-1, respectively. We found that the full-length MYRF-1 could rescue the defective synaptic rewiring in <italic>myrf-1; myrf-2</italic> double mutants, while N-MYRF-1 could not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12s2">Figure 12—figure supplement 2</xref>). This result was consistent with the defective synaptic rewiring in <italic>myrf-1<sup>1-482 GFP</sup></italic> mutants. It remains to be experimentally determined if N-MYRF in <italic>myrf-1<sup>1-482 GFP</sup></italic>, <italic>myrf-1<sup>1-656 GFP</sup></italic> indeed fail to form trimer efficiently. It is conceivable that membrane localization may improve thermodynamic conditions for MYRF oligomerization, even though our analysis of MYRF<sup>1-700 GFP</sup> indicate that merely situating on ER membrane (without MYRF’s ectodomain) is insufficient for MYRF’s cleavage.</p><p>In cultured cells, human MYRF is found to carry post-translational modifications, for example glycosylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Li et al., 2013</xref>). Membrane association may be required for proper modification of MYRF, and the modifications may facilitate nucleation of N-MYRF transcriptional complexes on target promoters. Indeed, sumoylation of MYRF’s activator domain promotes its transcriptional activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Choi et al., 2018</xref>). It is also possible that specific factors are co-transported with N-MYRF from the cell membrane into the nucleus, thus affecting MYRF’s transcription activity. These yet-to-be-defined features may enable essential MYRF function in regulating animal development.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Experimental model and subject details</title><sec id="s4-1-1"><title>Animals</title><p>Wild-type <italic>C. elegans</italic> were Bristol N2 strain.

For transient transfection, adherent cells of 0.5–2 × 10<sup>5</sup> per well were seeded in 500 μl antibiotic-free medium on the day before transfection. The cells were let grown to 90–95% confluence by the time of transfection. Discard the old medium before transfection. Prepare transfection mix following the recipe: For each well, dilute plasmid DNA (2.5 μg) in 150 μl DMEM serum-free medium and mix gently. The following was an example of set up: (1) Plasmid A(1.25 μg)+Control plasmid(1.25 μg); (2) Plasmid B(1.25 μg)+Control plasmid(1.25 μg); (3) Plasmid A(1.25 μg)+Plasmid B(1.25 μg). Gently shake Lipofectamine-2000(Thermo Fisher) well before use. Take an appropriate amount of Lipofectamine-2000 (6 μl) and dilute it in 150 μl DMEM medium. Incubate at room temperature for 5 min. Mix the DNA and Lipofectamine-2000 to make the total volume 300 μl, gently mix and leave at room temperature for 20 min. Add 300 μl of transfection solution to each well of cells and shake gently. The cells were returned to 37°C, and the medium was changed after 4–6 hr of transfection.</p><p>The transfected cells were incubated at 37°C for 24 hr. The cells were lysed in 1 mL of cell lysis buffer (50 mM Tris PH7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 1% NP40, 0.25% Sodium taurodeoxycholate hydrate, 1 mM EDTA, protease inhibitor cocktail). The lysate was incubated on ice for 30 min and centrifuged at 14,000Xg for 30 min at 4°C. The supernatant was collected and incubated with addition of primary antibodies, including anti-HA (ab9110, Abcam, 1:1000) and rabbit IgG (2729, Cell Signaling) controls at the same molar concentration as primary antibodies, respectively, at 4°C for overnight. The next day, Dynabeads protein A (10002D, invitrogen) were added to the reactions and incubated at 4°C for 1 hr to precipitate the IgGs. Beads were washed and treated in SDS sample loading buffer. The samples were denatured at 95°C for 10 min and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and western blot. The antibodies used in western blot included: mouse anti-V5 (ab27671, Abcam, 1:5000); mouse anti-HA (ab18181, Abcam, 1:5000); Rabbit Anti-Actin (ab179467, 1:5000); Mouse Anti-Mouse IgG Polyclonal Antibody, HRP Conjugated (Genscript,1:20000), Mouse Anti-Rabbit IgG Polyclonal Antibody, HRP Conjugated (Genscript,1:20000).</p></sec><sec id="s4-2-13"><title>Immunoprecipitation followed by mass spectrometry analysis</title><p>Worms expressing the GFP-tagged proteins were cultured to the indicated stage, collected, and washed three times with M9 buffer. The volumes of the worm pellets obtained after centrifugation and sedimentation on ice was recorded before the worm pellets were frozen in liquid nitrogen. The frozen worm pellets were cryo-milled using Mixer Mill MM 400 (Retsch) at 30 Hz for 60 s each time for a total of four times. The resulting powder for each sample was transferred to a new tube, mixed with an equal volume of 2 × pre cool lysis buffer containing 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 300 mM NaCl, 1% Triton-X100, 10% glycerol, 1 mM PMSF, 2 × Roche cOmplete EDTA-free Protease Inhibitor Cocktail, 10 mM NaF, and let rotate at 4°C for 30 min. The lysate was then centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 30 min at 4°C and the supernatant was incubated with homemade anti-GFP beads for one hour at 4°C before the beads were washed three times with cold lysis buffer. The anti-GFP immunoprecipitates were eluted with chilled elution buffer (100 mM glycine-HCl pH 2.5) and precipitated with 25% TCA. After cold acetone wash and drying in air, the immunoprecipitated proteins were dissolved in 100 mM Tris, pH 8.5, 8 M urea, reduced with 5 mM TCEP, alkylated with 10 mM iodoacetamide, and digested with trypsin overnight at 37°C.</p><p>LC-MS/MS analysis of the resulting peptides was conducted on a Q Exactive mass spectrometer (ThermoFisher Scientific) interfaced with an Easy-nLC1000 liquid chromatography system (ThermoFisher Scientific). Peptides were loaded on a pre-column (75 μm ID, 6 cm long, packed with ODS-AQ 120 Å −10 μm beads from YMC Co., Ltd.) and separated on an analytical column (75 μm ID, 13 cm long, packed with Luna C18 1.8 μm 100 Å resin from Welch Materials) using an 0–30% (v/v) acetonitrile gradient over 78 min at a flow rate of 200 nl/min, with 0.1% (v/v) formic acid added to the mobile phase throughout. The top 15 most intense precursor ions from each full scan (resolution 70,000) were isolated for HCD MS2 (resolution 17,500; NCE 27), with a dynamic exclusion time of 30 s. Precursors with unassigned charge states or charge states of 1+, 7+, or &gt; 7+ were excluded. Each sample was analyzed in technical duplicates.</p><p>Peptides and proteins were identified from the MS data using the database searching engine pFind 3.1 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://pfind.ict.ac.cn/">http://pfind.ict.ac.cn/</ext-link>) against the UniProt <italic>C. elegans</italic> protein database (WS235). The filtering criteria were: 1% FDR at both the peptide level and the protein level; precursor mass tolerance, 20 ppm; fragment mass tolerance, 20 ppm; the peptide length, 6–100 aa. To identify high-confidence candidate interacting proteins, The WD-Scores of proteins identified in each IP-MS sample were calculated against the identification results of 71 unrelated IP-MS samples, according to the formulas from the CompPASS tutorial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Sowa et al., 2009</xref>).</p></sec></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>Some strains were provided by the CGC, which is funded by NIH Office of Research Infrastructure Programs (P40 OD010440).

What follows is the decision letter after the first round of review.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your work entitled &quot;The LRR-TM protein PAN-1 interacts with MYRF to promote its nuclear translocation in synaptic remodeling&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>Our decision has been reached after consultation between the reviewers and editors. Based on these discussions and the individual reviews below, we regret to inform you that your work can not be considered for publication in <italic>eLife</italic> in its present form but are open to reconsideration if you are able to address the comments raised.</p><p>All reviewers very much appreciated the very interesting biological problem (DD neuronal rewiring) and were intrigued by the implication of a novel protein in the control of the very unusual MYRF transcription factor. The reviewers and editors also appreciated the many advances that you made, as well as the very solid nature of some the reagents that you used (particularly the CRISPR-generated alleles). However, all reviewers identified a substantial list of shortcomings. All these shortcomings are relatively straight-forward to address, but do amount to a substantial body of work. We will therefore need to reject the manuscript in its present form. However, should you be willing to engage with these specific requests, we may want to consider a substantially revised version of this manuscript sometime in the future.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>In this manuscript, the authors show molecular events underpinning rewiring of DD neurons in <italic>C. elegans</italic>. A previous study (Meng et al. 2017) showed that animals lacking the very unusual, but conserved transcription factor MYRF-1 show defects in DD rewiring at the late L1 stage. The present study finds that an LRR-containing transmembrane protein, PAN-1, interacts with the membrane bound MYRF-1. Both proteins localize to the cell membrane, and their interaction seems to be required for DD-rewiring. pan-1 mutants also show defects in DD-rewiring, and loss of PAN-1 affects MYRF-1 localization. The interaction between these two proteins occurs through their extracellular domains, and the extracellular portion of MYRF-1 is required for its activity.</p><p>I find this to be a very interesting paper that takes us a step further in understand how this very unusual activation mechanisms for a membrane bound (!) transcription factor works. However, some conclusions should be supported by more data and/or better data presentation. Moreover, some results are poorly described and there is general lack of detail throughout the manuscript. Specific points are listed below:</p><p>1. The manuscript shows that PAN-1 and MYRF-1 interact, and that mutants of each gene result in DD-rewiring defects (myrf-1 phenotype described previously in Meng et al. 2017). However, it does not adequately show that several perturbations leading to changes in PAN-1 and MYRF-1 localization result in DD-rewiring defects, the relevant paradigm of the study. For example, the authors make several truncations in PAN-1 and MYRF-1 to test their interaction using Co-IP (Figure 5), summarizing that their &quot;results provide the first direct evidence that the non-cytoplasmic part of MYRF protein is indispensable for its function&quot;. However, they do not show what happens to DD-specific dorsal synapses in animals with truncations in MYRF-1 (Figures 5A and 6A).</p><p>2. The presentation of data for DD-rewiring defects in pan-1 mutants in Figures 1D, 1E and 5B is not convincing. Representative images in Figure 1C (middle) and 1F (bottom-right) clearly show that synapses are present, albeit much dimmer or with gaps, but this is not reflected in the quantification. Perhaps providing several representative images of pan-1 animals (and of pan-1a and pan-1c rescue in pan-1 mutants), like those shown in Figures 1F and S1A, would allow the reader to better interpret the DD-rewiring phenotype. Representative images should also be provided for PAN-1 variant animals quantified in Figure 5B.</p><p>3. Throughout the manuscript, the authors show changes in subcellular localization using seam cells as an example. These images are great and clearly convey the point, but serve as controls at best. Since the manuscript is framed around DD-rewiring, it is critical to show similar spatiotemporal changes in MYRF-1 localization in WT (Figure 3C) and pan-1 mutants (Figure 4E) in DD neurons. This region, with existing reporters, may not look as clear-cut, but an overall distribution of signal in cell-membrane / cytoplasm / nucleus may be evident using a confocal microscope and would allow the reader to better assess the results.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>The paper by Li et al. makes some intriguing findings about the mechanisms underlying DD synaptic remodeling in <italic>C. elegans</italic>. They find that PAN-1, a TM-LRR protein, can interact <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> with MYRF-1/2, a transmembrane-tethered DNA-binding protein previously shown to be required for DD remodeling. They present an interesting model in which PAN-1 localizes MYRF-1/2 to the plasma membrane (a novel finding) and that regulated nuclear entry of the MYRF-1/2 N-terminal fragment is important for its function. However, there are some gaps and over-interpretations that, for me, undermine confidence in the model.</p><p>1. For a few reasons, I have concerns about the specificity of the pan-1 phenotype. They don't show us whether overall DD anatomy is normal in pan-1 mutants. The DD/VD-specific rescue is nice, but isn't it possible that pan-1 expression in VDs (which are born during L1) has a role in DD rewiring? (This general concern applies to all of the experiments that use a promoter expressed in both neuron types.) Similarly, it's great to see the use of a pan-1 conditional allele, but its phenotype is really weak compared to the null, raising concern that some of the mutant defects could arise from pleiotropic functions (perhaps related to developmental delay/L2 arrest).</p><p>2. Along these lines, there's some confusion about what's meant by pan-1 and myrf-1 &quot;activity.&quot; Because they're both expressed broadly, it's possible that they have different functions in different tissues and/or at different times. But the model doesn't consider this, and all phenotypes (whether in DDs, hypodermal cells, or larval arrest) are interpreted in terms of the same molecular model. Many of the key conclusions about what's going on in DD remodeling are drawn from looking in other cell types or at larval arrest (e.g. when the myrf-1 N-terminal fragment is overexpressed). This makes me less confident that we really understand what's going on in DDs themselves.</p><p>3. According to the simplest model, expression of the myrf-1 N-terminal fragment should cause premature DD remodeling. Unexpectedly, it causes early (L1) larval arrest, a gain-of-function phenotype, since the null arrests during L2. This is consistent with the idea that transient membrane localization of MYRF-1 is necessary, but it could also be that it's simply that temporally regulated production/activity of the N-terminal fragment is important. In either case, it seems important to know whether premature DD remodeling has occurred in the arrested L1s.</p><p>4. In the final set of experiments, the MYRF-1 extracellular region is overexpressed, which blocks synaptic remodeling. Authors conclude that this demonstrates that the MYRF-1-PAN-1 interaction is essential.

What follows is the authors’ response to the first round of review.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>All reviewers very much appreciated the very interesting biological problem (DD neuronal rewiring) and were intrigued by the implication of a novel protein in the control of the very unusual MYRF transcription factor. The reviewers and editors also appreciated the many advances that you made, as well as the very solid nature of some the reagents that you used (particularly the CRISPR-generated alleles). However, all reviewers identified a substantial list of shortcomings. All these shortcomings are relatively straight-forward to address, but do amount to a substantial body of work. We will therefore need to reject the manuscript in its present form. However, should you be willing to engage with these specific requests, we may want to consider a substantially revised version of this manuscript sometime in the future.</p></disp-quote><p>Common key points:</p><p>1. While all new myrf-1 truncation alleles exhibit larval arrest, there is a lack of characterization of DD rewiring phenotype in those mutants.</p><p>We have now added the analysis of DD synaptic rewiring for all new myrf-1 truncation alleles, and corresponding myrf-1(truncation); myrf-2(null) double mutants. All new myrf-1 alleles, except for myrf-1(syb1313), behave similarly to previously characterized myrf-1 loss of function mutants, i.e., they exhibit blocked synaptic rewiring in myrf-2 null background. The exception is myrf-1(syb1313)<sup>1-700 GFP</sup>, in which the whole extracellular region of MYRF-1 is deleted. myrf1(syb1313) exhibits precocious yet discordant DD rewiring. We have also observed that MYRF-1<sup>1-700 GFP</sup>(syb1313) can be partially processed in ER to produce N-MYRF while the majority of MYRF-1<sup>1-700 GFP</sup>(syb1313) protein appears to be in ER. MYRF-1<sup>1-700 GFP</sup>(syb1313) signals remained strong in pan-1(0) mutants, while the signals of MYRF-1<sup>1-790 GFP</sup>(syb1333), in which part of extracellular region was removed, were undetectable in pan-1(0), resembling wild type MYRF in pan-1(0). Thus, from an unexpected angle, these new results support that the extracellular region of MYRF is indispensable for MYRF’s processing, and the cleavage of wild type MYRF is under developmental regulation. See Figure 6; 8, 9; Figure S5-16.</p><p>2. There is a lack of localization analysis for truncated MYRF-1<sup>GFP</sup> in DD neurons.</p><p>MYRF-1-GFP signals are very weak, e.g., they cannot be detected by conventional confocal. Fortunately, we were able to image them under Zeiss Airyscan. For certain imaging experiments, myrf-1 alleles were crossed into glo-1 mutant background to reduce gut auto fluorescence. We have added new sets of images to display signal patterns of MYRF-1 variants. We have also added images of colabeling MYRF-1<sup>GFP</sup> variants with DD-specifically expressed mCherry::Rab-3. Rab-3 signals are localized to presynaptic vesicles, but also often in cytoplasm, presumably labeling a subset of ER, Golgi, or endosomes. With contrastive localization of MYRF-1<sup>GFP</sup> variants and mCherry::Rab-3, one can appreciate the differential localization of MYRF-1<sup>GFP</sup> variants on cell membrane, cytoplasm, and nucleus. Because DDs are small in size (3<sub>µ</sub>m in diameter), further colocalization analysis using specific organelle markers are often unproductive due to the resolution limitation. See Figure 3D, 4F, 5G, 8F, 12G.</p><p>3. The choice of flp-13 and unc-25 promoters</p><p>unc-25 encodes Glutamic Acid Decarboxylase, and the particular unc-25 promoter that we use labels 4 RMEs (head neurons that form neuromuscular junctions with head muscles to control foraging) and 6 DDs in L1 larvae. The unc-25 promoter also labels 13 VDs, which are born at late L1. flp-13 encodes a FMRF-Like Peptide, and is expressed in 6 DDs not in VDs among ventral cord motor neurons; however, flp-13 is expressed in many other head neurons. We even observed that the flp-13 promoter-driven marker was expressed in intestine, and such expression is particularly strong during early-mid L1, which can obscure the DD signals. flp-13pro is often weak in DD5 and very weak in DD6. flp-13<sub>pro</sub> driven synaptic marker also label an unidentified head neuron that extend its axon to the anterior half of ventral cord, which only becomes clear until L3-L4. Together, unc-25 and flp-13 have its pro and con as synaptic marker for DDs.</p><p>When it comes to experiments of cell-autonomy test, unc-25 is overall a more restricted promoter than flp-13, since flp-13 is expressed much more broadly than unc-25. Take an example of pan-1 rescue experiments, we found that many flp-13<sub>pro</sub>-pan-1 worms were thin and pale, and difficult to form lines, while unc25<sub>pro</sub>-pan-1 worms did not show any signs of sickness. We reasoned that the overexpression of pan-1 caused defects because flp-13<sub>pro</sub> was expressed in vital tissues.</p><p>Even though the birth of VDs coincides with DD rewiring in timing, VDs are not critical for DD rewiring, because lineage mutants that do not generate VDs exhibits normal DD rewiring (Hallam and Jin, 1998).</p><p>We have added analysis for DD rewiring phenotype of pan-1(0) using flp-13<sub>pro</sub> marker. We have added pan-1 rescue experiments use flp-13<sub>pro</sub> driven pan-1. The results were consistent with the conclusion based on unc-25<sub>pro</sub>. See Figure S1A.</p><p>We used flp-13<sub>pro</sub> synpatic marker for analyses of DD rewiring in all myrf-1 truncation alleles. See Figure 6; Figure S5-16.</p><p>4. Phenotypic discrepancy between N-MYRF-1<sup>1-482</sup> exchromosomal array transgene and myrf-1<sup>1-482</sup>(syb1491) allele</p><p>Previously, MYRF-1<sup>1-482</sup> was overexpressed in multi-copy exchromosomal arrays, and it caused early DD rewiring (Meng, 2017). In contrast, the present myrf-1<sup>1-482</sup>(syb1491) allele exhibit deficient DD rewiring.</p><p>One notable difference between the two experiments was that the expression level driven by exchromosomal array was much higher than endogenous level, considering that the transgene GFP::MYRF-1<sup>1-482</sup> can be readily detected in nucleus (e.g., by 10x objective lens), while MYRF-1<sup>1-482</sup>(syb1491) was very weak (e.g., by 60x oil objective lens and prolonged camera exposure).</p><p>We have performed new experiment in which we generated single copy insertion transgene to express full length MYRF-1 and MYRF-1<sup>1-482</sup>. We found that full length MYRF-1 rescued the rewiring defects in myrf-1(0); myrf-2(0) double mutants, while MYRF-1<sup>1-482</sup> did not. This results support the hypothesis that the low expression of N-MYRF is insufficient for DD rewiring.</p><p>Studies of mammalian MYRF show that monomer N-MYRF does not function as efficiently as trimer N-MYRF. When full length MYRF is trimerized and cleaved, the N-MYRF is released as form of trimer. The C-tail of N-MYRF is required for N-MYRF maintain trimer form (Kim D. 2017 Nucleic Acids Res).</p><p>It is conceivable that the membrane localization is necessary for MYRF (of endogenous level) to oligomerize, because the 2-dimension greatly increases the probability of interaction between protomers.</p><p>MYRF-1<sup>1-700</sup>(syb1313) (with no extracellular domain) can indeed generate N-MYRF that are sufficient for early rewiring in a subset of DDs, even though the cleavage process is inefficient. Comparing to MYRF-1<sup>1-700</sup>(syb1313), MYRF-1<sup>1656</sup>(syb1468) is only short of TMD. MYRF-1<sup>1-656</sup>(syb1468) produced plenty of NMYRF-1 (which is likely as monomer) but the rewiring is deficient. This support that membrane association greatly facilitates the cleavage of MYRF.</p><p>We have included the data as Figure S21, and discussed the results. See page 28, line 569.</p><p>5. DD rewiring defects show incomplete penetrance in pan-1<sup>loxp</sup>; unc-25<sub>pro</sub>-Cre.</p><p>We added an illustration of DD anatomy in Figure 1C. There are processes from six DDs tiled along ventral and dorsal cords. If only one or two DDs are defective in rewiring, one or two segments of synapses would appear absent in the dorsal cord.</p><p>We consider that the rewiring defect in pan-1<sup>loxp</sup>; unc-25<sub>pro</sub>-Cre is comparable to pan-1(0) mutants. We observed a sustained rewiring block by L4 (in Figure S1C) in these animals, which indicates the defect is not secondary to developmental arrest.</p><p>The incomplete penetrance in DD rewiring was likely because the effects of Cre was not penetrant among individual DDs. Cre is driven by unc-25 promoter, and unc-25 is reported to be expressed during late embryogenesis. Signals of DD rewiring can be detected as early as 16 post-hatch hours. This concludes that the time window between Cre transcription and DD rewiring is about 18 hours. The duration may not be long enough to allow Cre to excise the target with high penetrance. See page 11, line 209.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>In this manuscript, the authors show molecular events underpinning rewiring of DD neurons in <italic>C. elegans</italic>. A previous study (Meng et al. 2017) showed that animals lacking the very unusual, but conserved transcription factor MYRF-1 show defects in DD rewiring at the late L1 stage. The present study finds that an LRR-containing transmembrane protein, PAN-1, interacts with the membrane bound MYRF-1. Both proteins localize to the cell membrane, and their interaction seems to be required for DD-rewiring. pan-1 mutants also show defects in DD-rewiring, and loss of PAN-1 affects MYRF-1 localization. The interaction between these two proteins occurs through their extracellular domains, and the extracellular portion of MYRF-1 is required for its activity.</p><p>I find this to be a very interesting paper that takes us a step further in understand how this very unusual activation mechanisms for a membrane bound (!) transcription factor works. However, some conclusions should be supported by more data and/or better data presentation. Moreover, some results are poorly described and there is general lack of detail throughout the manuscript. Specific points are listed below:</p><p>1. The manuscript shows that PAN-1 and MYRF-1 interact, and that mutants of each gene result in DD-rewiring defects (myrf-1 phenotype described previously in Meng et al. 2017). However, it does not adequately show that several perturbations leading to changes in PAN-1 and MYRF-1 localization result in DD-rewiring defects, the relevant paradigm of the study. For example, the authors make several truncations in PAN-1 and MYRF-1 to test their interaction using Co-IP (Figure 5), summarizing that their &quot;results provide the first direct evidence that the non-cytoplasmic part of MYRF protein is indispensable for its function&quot;. However, they do not show what happens to DD-specific dorsal synapses in animals with truncations in MYRF-1 (Figures 5A and 6A).</p></disp-quote><p>See our response to Common Key Point #1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. The presentation of data for DD-rewiring defects in pan-1 mutants in Figures 1D, 1E and 5B is not convincing. Representative images in Figure 1C (middle) and 1F (bottom-right) clearly show that synapses are present, albeit much dimmer or with gaps, but this is not reflected in the quantification. Perhaps providing several representative images of pan-1 animals (and of pan-1a and pan-1c rescue in pan-1 mutants), like those shown in Figures 1F and S1A, would allow the reader to better interpret the DD-rewiring phenotype. Representative images should also be provided for PAN-1 variant animals quantified in Figure 5B.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added new figures, in which multiple ventral, dorsal cords images were vertically tiled. To represent the true synaptic pattern of the animals, the display contrast of ventral and dorsal cord images was adjusted to the same parameters for comparison. The counting of synapse was performed using Find Peaks, a plug-in program in ImageJ. The parameters were set in a way to faithfully detect all clearly visible synapses in wild type.</p><p>We agree that there were dim, small, puncta present in the dorsal cords of the mutants. It is of our interest to further characterize those structures. We consider that the synaptic rewiring occurs in multiple steps, and plan to analyze how myrf and pan-1 may be involved in specific steps.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. Throughout the manuscript, the authors show changes in subcellular localization using seam cells as an example. These images are great and clearly convey the point, but serve as controls at best. Since the manuscript is framed around DD-rewiring, it is critical to show similar spatiotemporal changes in MYRF-1 localization in WT (Figure 3C) and pan-1 mutants (Figure 4E) in DD neurons. This region, with existing reporters, may not look as clear-cut, but an overall distribution of signal in cell-membrane / cytoplasm / nucleus may be evident using a confocal microscope and would allow the reader to better assess the results.</p></disp-quote><p>See our response to Common Key Point #2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>The paper by Li et al. makes some intriguing findings about the mechanisms underlying DD synaptic remodeling in <italic>C. elegans</italic>.
