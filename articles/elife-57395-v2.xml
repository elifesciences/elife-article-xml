Channelrhodopsin-based optogenetics shows the feasibility of stimulating neural repair but does not pin down specific signaling cascades. Here, we utilized optogenetic systems, optoRaf and optoAKT, to delineate the contribution of the ERK and AKT signaling pathways to neuroregeneration in live <italic>Drosophila</italic> larvae. We showed that optoRaf or optoAKT activation not only enhanced axon regeneration in both regeneration-competent and -incompetent sensory neurons in the peripheral nervous system but also allowed temporal tuning and proper guidance of axon regrowth. Furthermore, optoRaf and optoAKT differ in their signaling kinetics during regeneration, showing a gated versus graded response, respectively. Importantly in the central nervous system, their activation promotes axon regrowth and functional recovery of the thermonociceptive behavior. We conclude that non-neuronal optogenetics targets damaged neurons and signaling subcircuits, providing a novel strategy in the intervention of neural damage with improved precision.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Most cells have a built-in regeneration signaling program that allows them to divide and repair. But, in the cells of the central nervous system, which are called neurons, this program is ineffective. This is why accidents and illnesses affecting the brain and spinal cord can cause permanent damage. Reactivating regeneration in neurons could help them repair, but it is not easy. Certain small molecules can switch repair signaling programs back on. Unfortunately, these molecules diffuse easily through tissues, spreading around the body and making it hard to target individual damaged cells. This both hampers research into neuronal repair and makes treatments directed at healing damage to the nervous system more likely to have side-effects. It is unclear whether reactivating regeneration signaling in individual neurons is possible.</p><p>One way to address this question is to use optogenetics. This technique uses genetic engineering to fuse proteins that are light-sensitive to proteins responsible for relaying signals in the cell. When specific wavelengths of light hit the light-sensitive proteins, the fused signaling proteins switch on, leading to the activation of any proteins they control, for example, those involved in regeneration.</p><p>Wang et al. used optogenetic tools to determine if light can help repair neurons in fruit fly larvae. First, a strong laser light was used to damage an individual neuron in a fruit fly larva that had been genetically modified so that blue light would activate the regeneration program in its neurons. Then, Wang et al. illuminated the cell with dim blue light, switching on the regeneration program. Not only did this allow the neuron to repair itself, it also allowed the light to guide its regeneration. By focusing the blue light on the damaged end of the neuron, it was possible to guide the direction of the cell's growth as it regenerated.</p><p>Regeneration programs in flies and mammals involve similar signaling proteins, but blue light does not penetrate well into mammalian tissues. This means that further research into LEDs that can be implanted may be necessary before neuronal repair experiments can be performed in mammals. In any case, the ability to focus treatment on individual neurons paves the way for future work into the regeneration of the nervous system, and the combination of light and genetics could reveal more about how repair signals work.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>optogenetics</kwd><kwd>axon regeneration</kwd><kwd><italic>Drosophila</italic></kwd><kwd>dendritic arborization</kwd><kwd>sensory neurons</kwd><kwd>thermonociception</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01GM132438</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Fan</surname><given-names>Huaxun</given-names></name><name><surname>Skeeters</surname><given-names>Savanna S</given-names></name><name><surname>Krishnamurthy</surname><given-names>Vishnu V</given-names></name><name><surname>Zhang</surname><given-names>Kai</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1R01NS107392</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Qin</given-names></name><name><surname>Li</surname><given-names>Feng</given-names></name><name><surname>Song</surname><given-names>Yuanquan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Precise spatiotemporal optogenetic activation of ERK and AKT signaling pathways reveals neural repair mechanisms of the peripheral and central nervous systems in live <italic>Drosophila</italic> larvae.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Inadequate neuroregeneration remains a major roadblock toward functional recovery after nervous system damage such as stroke, spinal cord injury (SCI), and multiple sclerosis. Extracellular factors from oligodendrocyte, astroglial, and fibroblastic sources restrict axon regrowth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Liu et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Yiu and He, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Liu et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Lu et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Schwab and Strittmatter, 2014</xref>) but eliminating these molecules only allows limited sprouting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Sun and He, 2010</xref>), suggesting a down-regulation of the intrinsic regenerative program in injured neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Sun and He, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">He and Jin, 2016</xref>). The neurotrophic signaling pathway, which regulates neurogenesis during embryonic development, represents an important intrinsic regenerative machinery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Ramer et al., 2000</xref>). For instance, elimination of the PTEN phosphatase, an endogenous brake for neurotrophic signaling, yields axonal regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Park et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>An important feature of the neurotrophin signaling pathway is that the functional outcome depends on signaling kinetics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Marshall, 1995</xref>) and subcellular localization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Watson et al., 2001</xref>). Indeed, neural regeneration from damaged neurons is synergistically regulated by multiple signaling circuits in space and time. However, pharmacological and genetic approaches do not provide sufficient spatial and temporal resolutions in the modulation of signaling outcomes in terminally differentiated neurons in vivo. Thus, the functional link between signaling kinetics and functional recovery of damaged neurons remains unclear. The emerging non-neuronal optogenetic technology uses light to control protein-protein interaction and enables light-mediated signaling modulation in live cells and multicellular organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Zhang and Cui, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Khamo et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Johnson and Toettcher, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Leopold et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dagliyan and Hahn, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Goglia and Toettcher, 2019</xref>). By engineering signaling components with photoactivatable proteins, one can use light to control a number of cellular processes, such as gene transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Motta-Mena et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Wang et al., 2017</xref>), phase transition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Shin et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dine et al., 2018</xref>), cell motility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Wu et al., 2009</xref>) and differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Khamo et al., 2019</xref>), ion flow across membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kyung et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Ma et al., 2018</xref>), and metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Zhao et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Zhao et al., 2019</xref>), to name a few. We have previously developed optogenetic systems named optoRaf (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Zhang et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Krishnamurthy et al., 2016</xref>) and optoAKT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Ong et al., 2016</xref>), which allow for precise control of the Raf/MEK/ERK and AKT signaling pathways, respectively. We demonstrated that timed activation of optoRaf enables functional delineation of ERK activity in mesodermal cell fate determination during <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic> embryonic development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Krishnamurthy et al., 2016</xref>). However, it remains unclear if spatially localized, optogenetic activation of ERK and AKT activity allows for subcellular control of cellular outcomes.</p><p>In this study, we used optoRaf and optoAKT to specifically activate the Raf/MEK/ERK and AKT signaling subcircuits, respectively. We found that both optoRaf and optoAKT activity enhanced axon regeneration in the regeneration-potent class IV da (C4da) and the regeneration-incompetent class III da (C3da) sensory neurons in <italic>Drosophila</italic> larvae, although optoRaf but not optoAKT enhanced dendritic branching. Temporally programmed and spatially restricted light stimulation showed that optoRaf and optoAKT differ in their signaling kinetics during regeneration and that both allow spatially guided axon regrowth. Furthermore, using a thermonociception-based behavioral recovery assay, we found that optoRaf and optoAKT activation led to effective axon regeneration as well as functional recovery after central nervous system (CNS) injury. We note that most of the previous optogenetic control of neural repair studies were based on channelrhodopsion in <italic>C. elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Sun et al., 2014</xref>), mouse DRG culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Park et al., 2015a</xref>) or motor neuron-schwann cell co-culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hyung et al., 2019</xref>). Another study used blue-light activatable adenylyl cyclase bPAC to stimulate neural repair in mouse refractory axons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Xiao et al., 2015</xref>). These work highlighted the feasibility of using optogenetics to study neural repair but did not pin down the exact downstream signaling cascade mediating neuronal repair. Additionally, most studies focused on peripheral neurons that are endogenously regenerative. Here, we specifically activated the ERK and AKT signaling pathways and performed a comprehensive study of neural regeneration in both the peripheral nervous system (PNS) and CNS neurons in live <italic>Drosophila</italic>. We envision that features provided by non-neuronal optogenetics, including reversibility, functional delineation, and spatiotemporal control, will lead to a better understanding of the link between signaling kinetics and functional outcome of neurotrophic signaling pathways during neuroregeneration.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Light enables reversible activation of the Raf/MEK/ERK and AKT signaling pathways</title><p>To reversibly control the Raf/MEK/ERK and AKT signaling pathways, we constructed a single-transcript optogenetic system using the p2A bicistronic construct that co-expresses fusion-proteins with the N-terminus of cryptochrome-interacting basic-helix-loop-helix (CIBN) and the photolyase homology region of cryptochrome 2 (CRY2PHR, abbreviated as CRY2 in this work). Following a similar design of the optimized optoRaf (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Krishnamurthy et al., 2016</xref>), we improved the previous optogenetic AKT system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Ong et al., 2016</xref>) with two tandom CIBNs (referred to as optoAKT in this work) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>).

On the other hand, continuous light illumination maintained a sustained activation of pCRY2-mCh-AKT within an onset of 10 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). The inactivation kinetics of pAKT was 30 min, similar to that of pERK (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F and G</xref>).

Delineation of signaling outcomes of individual subcircuits remains difficult with pharmacological assays given the unpredictable off-targets of small-molecule drugs. We hypothesized that optoRaf and optoAKT could delineate signaling outcomes because they bypass ligand binding and activate the intracellular signaling pathway. To test this hypothesis, we probed phosphorylated proteins, including pERK and pAKT with WB analysis in response to light-mediated activation of optoRaf and optoAKT. Results show that optoRaf activation does not increase endogenous pAKT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H and I</xref>). Similarly, optoAKT activation does not increase pERK or endogenous pAKT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H and I</xref>). Thus, at the level of ERK and AKT, optoRaf and optoAKT do not show crosstalk activity in mammalian cells.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Activation of optoRaf and optoAKT requires upstream signaling molecules</title><p>Although activation of both optoRaf and optoAKT bypasses ligand-receptor binding, it remains unclear if other upstream signaling molecules are required to activate optoRaf and optoAKT. Endogenous Raf1 activation requires its membrane translocation mediated by the GTP-bound form of Ras, followed by phosphorylation at several residues, including Ser338, which is located in the junction region between the regulator domain and the kinase domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Mason et al., 1999</xref>).

Note that phosphorylation of Ser338 itself does not activate Raf but is a prerequisite regulatory event for Raf activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Diaz et al., 1997</xref>), likely leading to Raf dimerization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Takahashi et al., 2017</xref>). To determine if Ser338 phosphorylation is involved in optoRaf activation, we probed the phosphorylation state of CRY2-mCh-Raf upon blue light stimulation and found that indeed Ser338 is significantly phosphorylated upon blue light stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E</xref>, top panel, lane 5–8). We then constructed the S338A mutant for optoRaf and confirmed that no phosphorylation occurs on S338 in optoRaf S338A. Importantly, optoRafS338A mutant significantly reduced the blue-light-mediated pERK activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E</xref>, third panel). This result suggests that optoRaf activation through membrane translocation requires upstream kinases.</p><p>Similarly, for optoAKT, it remains unclear if its activation requires upstream PI3K signaling. Full activation of AKT requires phosphorylation on both T308 in the activation loop of the catalytic protein kinase core and S473 in a C-terminal hydrophobic motif (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Manning and Toker, 2017</xref>). PH-domain-containing kinases such as PDK1 are essential for AKT activation by phosphorylating AKT on T308, whereas the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) complex 2 (mTORC2) phosphorylates AKT on S473. In addition to verifying that phosphorylation of S473 occurs during optoAKT activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1F</xref>), we probed pT308 for optoAKT upon blue light stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1F</xref>).

The larval body walls were then dissected and immunostained with the pERK1/2 antibody, as a readout of the Raf/MEK/ERK pathway activation. We found that 5 min light stimulation was sufficient to significantly increase the pERK signal in the cell body of C4da neurons in optoRaf-expressing larvae, while 15 min illumination enhanced pERK activation and induced ERK translocation into the nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A and B</xref>).

The pERK (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>) and pAKT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>) activity started to decrease as the light was shut off, although the decay rate of pERK decays appears slower than pAKT.

We reason that intermittent light stimulation may provide insights into the signaling kinetics in vivo and finetune axon regeneration dynamics. Therefore, instead of constant blue light illumination, we delivered two sets of programmed light patterns to injured larvae, 15 min on-15 min off or 15 min on-45 min off per cycle for 48 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). We found that, for optoRaf-expressing C4da neurons, when the off-time was 15 min, the intermittent light stimulation was sufficient to accelerate axon regrowth, with the regeneration index (0.6352 ± 0.09627) significantly increased compared with larvae incubated in the dark (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E and F</xref>). However, when the off-time was 45 min, the intermittent light failed to promote axon regeneration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E and F</xref>). Considering that pERK activity remains slightly higher than the basal level after 45 min dark incubation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>), the regeneration failure at 45 off-time suggests that optoRaf regulates C4da axon regeneration in a threshold-gated manner. On the other hand, C4da neurons expressing optoAKT displayed a graded response: a moderate increase of regeneration index (0.6278 ± 0.09801) in response to the 15 min on-15 min off light and a smaller uptick (0.5312 ± 0.06963) to the 15 min on-45 min off light; both were less effective than the constant light stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E and F</xref>). These results suggest that although the higher frequency of light stimulation generally resulted in stronger regeneration potential in the transgenic flies, constant light was not always required for maximum axon regeneration. Moreover, optoRaf and optoAKT differ in their signaling kinetics during regeneration, showing a gated versus graded response, respectively.</p><p>We next determined whether optoRaf or optoAKT activation would trigger regeneration in C3da neurons, which are normally incapable of regrowth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Song et al., 2012</xref>). C3da neurons were labeled with <italic>19–12-Gal4, UAS-CD4tdGFP, repo-Gal80</italic> and injured using the same paradigm as C4da neurons. Compared with WT, which exhibited poor axon regeneration ability demonstrated by the low regeneration percentage and the negative regeneration index (−0.03201 ± 0.02752) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G–I</xref>), light stimulation significantly increased the regeneration index in optoRaf- or optoAKT-expressing larvae to 0.1298 ± 0.04637 or 0.1354 ± 0.06161, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G–I</xref>). Similar to C4da neurons, activation of both Raf/MEK/ERK and AKT pathways failed to further enhance axon regrowth compared to optoRaf or optoAKT activation alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). This result confirms that the actions of optoRaf and optoAKT are not additive in promoting axon regeneration, suggesting that these two subcircuits may share the same downstream components in neuroregeneration (see Discussion). Altogether, these data indicate that optoRaf and optoAKT activation not only accelerates axon regeneration but also converts regeneration cell-type specificity.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>Spatial activation of optoRaf or optoAKT improves pathfinding of regenerating axons</title><p>While C4da neurons are known to possess the regenerative potential, it is unclear whether the regenerating axons navigate correctly. To address this question, we focused on v'ada – the lateral C4da neurons. Uninjured v'ada axons grow ventrally, showing a typical turn and then join the axon bundle with the ventral C4da neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>).

In the majority cases in WT, the ventral branch, which extends toward the correct trajectory, regenerated less frequently than the dorsal branch, with 15% v'ada containing only the ventral branch (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A and B</xref> black bars). One possibility is that the ventral branch encounters the injury site, which may retard its elongation. As a result, only a minority of regenerating axons are capable of finding the correct path. The poor pathfinding of regenerating axons was similar among WT and the transgenic larvae, regardless of whether incubated with whole-field light or in the dark (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>).

To specifically enhance the regrowth of the ventral branch, we used a confocal microscope to focus the blue light (delivered by the 488 nm argon-ion laser) on the ventral branch for 5 min at 24 hr AI. The lengths of both the ventral and dorsal branches were measured at 24 hr AI and 48 hr AI. We subtracted the increased dorsal branch length (Δdorsal) from the increased ventral branch length (Δventral), then divided that by the total increased length of these two branches (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). This value was defined as the relative regeneration ratio. If the dorsal branch exhibits more regenerative potential, the ratio would be negative; otherwise, it would be positive.

Motivated by the capacity of optoRaf and optoAKT to accelerate axon regeneration in the PNS, we went on to determine whether they also show efficacy after CNS injury. We focused on the axons of C4da neurons, which project into the ventral nerve cord (VNC) and form a ladder-like structure. Each pair of axon bundles correspond to one body segment in an anterior-posterior pattern (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Li et al., 2020</xref>).

We defined a commissure segment as regenerated only when at least one axon extended beyond the midline of the commissure region or joined into other intact bundles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>).

In brief, we injured the A7 and A8 C4da neuron axon bundles in the VNC, which correspond to the A7 and A8 body segments in the periphery. We then assessed the nociceptive behavior in these larvae in response to a 47°C heat probe applied at the A7 or A8 segments at 24 and 48 hr AI. Since C4da neurons are essential for thermonociception, injuring A7 and A8 axon bundles in the VNC would lead to an impaired nociceptive response to the heat probe specifically at body segments A7 and A8. Indeed, all the injured larvae exhibited diminished response at 24 hr AI, while the total score is approaching three in uninjured WT larvae (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>).

Here, we used optogenetic systems to achieve specific and reversible activation of the neurotrophin subcircuits, including the Raf/MEK/ERK (via optoRaf) and AKT (via optoAKT) signaling pathways. We further verified that optoRaf and optoAKT did not show crosstalk at the level of phosphorylated ERK and AKT proteins, and activation of optoRaf but not optoAKT promoted PC12 cell differentiation.</p><p>Note that in the canonical growth factor signaling pathways, crosstalk actually occurs between the ERK and AKT signaling pathways, particularly at the upstream signaling node such as Ras. Indeed, the binding of growth factors to their receptors activates the transmembrane receptor tyrosine kinase, which recruits adaptor protein such as Grb2 (growth factor receptor-bound protein) and Sos (son of sevenless), a guanine exchange factor (GEF) for Ras. Sos then transforms the inactive, GDP-bound Ras to an active, GTP-bound Ras, which then recruits multiple proteins, including Raf and PI3K, an upstream kinase for AKT, to the plasma membrane. Thus, Ras serves as a common signaling node and therefore creates possible signaling crosstalk between the PI3K-AKT and Raf-MEK-ERK pathway. Another possible signaling crosstalk arises from the PI3K-mediated production of phospholipids, which could recruit a number of signaling molecules containing the lipid-binding domain (e.g., PH domain) including Sos, which then affects Ras/Raf activation. Our observation that optoRaf and optoAKT do not crosstalk (i.e. optoRaf does not activate the AKT downstream effector p70<sup>S6K</sup>; optoAKT does not activate pERK) may arise from the fact that both optoRaf and optoAKT bypass the ligand-binding, receptor activation, Ras activation, and phospholipid production signaling steps. Activation of optoRaf and optoAKT does require upstream signaling molecules (e.g. kinases).</p><p>However, there could be common downstream signaling molecules (such as transcription factors) that mediate the effects of neural regeneration by optoRaf and optoAKT. While ongoing efforts aim to elucidate these common signaling effectors, evidence from previous literature (some from other cell types) implies several possible candidates such as CREB (cAMP response element-binding protein) and FOXO (forkhead box transcription factors). Activation of Raf leads to phosphorylation of CREB, a family of transcription factors that regulate cell survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ginty et al., 1994</xref>). Evidence also suggests that CREB is a regulatory target for AKT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Du and Montminy, 1998</xref>). Besides the positive regulation of CREB by ERK and AKT signaling, their activity could also negatively regulate the function of FOXO transcription factors. FOXO is a family of transcription factors that can directly be phosphorylated by AKT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Brunet et al., 1999</xref>). Phosphorylated FOXO transcription factors translocate out of the nucleus, and their transcriptional program is attenuated. Interestingly, phosphorylated ERK can downregulate FOXO activity by directly interacting with and phosphorylates FOXO3a at Ser 294, Ser 344, and Ser 425, which leads to FOXO3a degradation via an MDM2-mediated ubiquitin-proteasome pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Yang et al., 2008</xref>). Additional evidence supporting this idea is that inhibition of PI3K/AKT and MEK/ERK pathways both enhance the activation of FOXO transcription factors in pancreatic cancer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Roy et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>After spinal cord injury, the synthesis of neurotrophins is elevated to support axon regrowth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cho et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hayashi et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fukuoka et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fang et al., 2017</xref>). AKT signaling, which functions downstream of Trk receptors, was reported to accelerate axon regeneration in mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Guo et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Miao et al., 2016</xref>). While NGF family members of neurotrophic factors have only been identified in vertebrates, the AKT pathway has also been shown to promote axon regrowth in flies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Song et al., 2012</xref>). However, the role of Raf/MEK/ERK signaling during nerve repair is controversial. Although some studies revealed that ERK is involved in axon extension, others suggested that ERK activation impedes axon regeneration and functional recovery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Markus et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Huang et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cervellini et al., 2018</xref>). To specifically evaluate the efficacy of Raf/MEK/ERK and AKT signaling in promoting axon regeneration, we generated fly strains with tissue-specific expression of optoRaf or optoAKT and found that light stimulation was sufficient to activate the corresponding downstream components in fly larvae in vivo. Consistent with previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">He and Jin, 2016</xref>), we found that AKT activation resulted in significantly increased axon regeneration in C4da neurons as well as the regeneration-incompetent C3da neurons. Interestingly, we found that C4da and C3da neurons expressing optoRaf also exhibited greater regeneration potential in response to light stimulation. This result also corroborates with a previous finding that activated B-RAF signaling enables axon regeneration in the mammalian CNS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">O'Donovan et al., 2014</xref>). We speculate that the differential outcomes of ERK activation on axon regeneration may be due to the different injury models used, and the strength and cell type origin of ERK signaling.</p><p>The regenerative capacity varies significantly among different neuronal subtypes, as well as the PNS and CNS. Although the administration of neurotrophins enhances axon regeneration in peripheral neurons, its capacity to promote functional regeneration in the CNS is limited, in part due to the inaccessibility of neurotrophins to reach injured axons (physical barrier) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Silver and Miller, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Yiu and He, 2006</xref>) and innate inactivation of the regenerating program in CNS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Lu et al., 2014</xref>). OptoRaf and optoAKT could be used to address both issues by direct delivery of light (rather than ligand) to reactivate the regenerating program and thereby significantly increase neural regeneration in the CNS as well. We further showed that activation of the Raf/MEK/ERK or AKT subcircuit was capable of improving behavioral performance in fly larvae, suggesting that it may promote synapse regeneration leading to functional recovery.</p><p>Ineffective functional recovery at least partially results from the inappropriate pathfinding of the regenerative neurons. As shown in this study, the majority of regenerating C4da neuron axons preferentially grew away from their original trajectory. We surprisingly found that delivering a 5 min light stimulation to the ventral branch, which extended toward the correct direction, was sufficient to convey guidance instructions and increase the preferential elongation of the ventral branch against the dorsal branch. Correct guidance cannot be achieved by whole-body administration of pharmacological reagents. Similarly, when casting blue light on the whole transgenic larvae, light stimulation must be given at a high frequency to promote axon regrowth (there is a threshold for the light off-time), and the dorsal branch extension was also dominant in this case. This result highlights the importance and necessity of restricted activation of neurotrophic signaling. Indeed, the strength and location of Raf/MEK/ERK and AKT activation during axon regeneration may be important to the functional consequences. Notably, although the transient restricted stimulation likely affects the decision-making of the growth cone at the branching point, constant light is still required to increase overall axon regeneration.</p><p>Neurotrophins are engaged in a variety of important cellular processes, and their physiological concentration is essential for the normal function of both neurons and non-neuronal cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Rose et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Xiao et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Pöyhönen et al., 2019</xref>). Despite exhibiting substantial efficacy for enhancing nerve regeneration, neurotrophin-based therapeutic applications have been confronted with a number of obstacles such as their nociceptive side effects and lack of strategy for localized signaling activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aloe et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Mitre et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Mahar and Cavalli, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Sung et al., 2019</xref>). OptoRaf and optoAKT aim to improve neurotrophin signaling outcomes by preferentially activating the neuroregenerative program and enabling spatiotemporal control. Our systems offer insights into the ERK and AKT subcircuits and delineate their differential roles downstream of neurotrophin activation, as evidenced by the distinct functional outcomes of Raf/MEK/ERK and AKT signaling in several aspects. First, ERK signaling promoted PC12 cell neuritogenesis, which was not induced by AKT activation. Second, elevated ERK activity significantly increased dendritic complexity, while on the contrary, AKT activation led to decreased dendrite branching. Third, optoRaf and optoAKT displayed different sensitivity in response to light illumination when expressed in <italic>Drosophila</italic> C4da neurons. Correspondingly, neurons expressing optoRaf and optoAKT responded differently to intermitted light stimulation after injury, suggesting that the strength and activation duration of optoRaf and optoAKT is differentially gauged during axon regeneration. These collectively suggest that, since Raf could be activated by membrane translocation as well as dimerization, CRY2 oligomerization could further lead to a more potent Raf. This multimodal activation mechanism may render that a threshold of optoRaf can be reached so that a saturated ERK activation could be achieved. On the other hand, AKT activation does not depend on dimerization and may display a graded response. As a result, optoAKT activates the AKT pathway in a dose-dependent manner and may not recapitulate the maximum activation of AKT. This work provides a proof-of-concept to use optogenetics to accelerate and navigate axon regeneration in mammalian injury models. Besides spatiotemporal control of the neurotrophic signaling, optoRaf and optoAKT allow for finetuning of the signaling activity with programmed light pattern during axon regeneration. Follow-up studies are warranted to determine how Raf/MEK/ERK and AKT subcircuits are involved in each process of nerve repair, including lesioned axon degeneration, regenerating axon initiation and extension, and the formation of new synapses and remyelination in mammals. Understanding the machinery will, in turn, allow better utilization and development of the optogenetic systems. Recently, Harris et al. succeeded in directing axon outgrowth with optogenetic tools in zebrafish embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Harris et al., 2020</xref>). Although intact optogenetics in larger mammals is limited by the poor penetration depth of blue light (less than 1 mm), we are excited to witness the rapid progress in implantable, wireless µLED devices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Jeong et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Park et al., 2015b</xref>) and the integration of optogenetics with long-wavelength-responsive nanomaterials such as the upconversion nanoparticles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">He et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Wu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chen et al., 2018</xref>), both of which would facilitate precise delivery of light stimulation.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type <break/>(species) or <break/>resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or <break/>reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Gene (<italic>Homo sapiens</italic>)</td><td><italic>Raf1</italic></td><td>PMID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24667437">24667437</ext-link></td><td>NCBI Gene ID: 207</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Gene (<italic>Homo sapiens</italic>)</td><td><italic>AKT</italic></td><td>PMID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27082641">27082641</ext-link></td><td>NCBI Gene ID: 5894</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Strain, strain background (<italic>D. melanogaster</italic>)</td><td><italic>19–12-</italic>Gal4</td><td>PMID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21068723">21068723</ext-link></td><td>FLYB: FBti0148308</td><td>FlyBase symbol: P{GAL4}19–12</td></tr><tr><td>Strain, strain background (<italic>D. melanogaster</italic>)</td><td><italic>repo-Gal80</italic></td><td>PMID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19091965">19091965</ext-link></td><td>FLYB: FBtp0067904</td><td>Flybase symbol: P{repo-GAL80.L}</td></tr><tr><td>Strain, strain background (<italic>D. melanogaster</italic>)</td><td><italic>ppk-CD4-tdGFP</italic></td><td>PMID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21606367">21606367</ext-link></td><td>BDSC: 35842 <break/>FLYB: FBti0143429 <break/>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/BDSC_35842">BDSC_35842</ext-link></td><td>Flybase symbol: P{ppk-CD4-tdGFP}1b</td></tr><tr><td>Strain, strain background (<italic>D. melanogaster</italic>)</td><td><italic>ppk-Gal4</italic></td><td>PMID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21606367">21606367</ext-link></td><td>BDSC: 32079 <break/>FLYB: FBti0131208 <break/>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/BDSC_32079">BDSC_32079</ext-link></td><td>Flybase symbol: P{ppk-GAL4.G}3</td></tr><tr><td>Strain, strain background (<italic>D. melanogaster</italic>)</td><td><italic>UAS-optoRaf</italic></td><td>This paper</td><td/><td>Transgenic fly with inducible expression of optoRaf, Dr. Yuanquan Song</td></tr><tr><td>Strain, strain background (<italic>D. melanogaster</italic>)</td><td><italic>UAS-optoAKT</italic></td><td>This paper</td><td/><td>Transgenic fly with inducible expression of optoAKT, Dr. Yuanquan Song</td></tr><tr><td>Cell line (<italic>Homo sapiens</italic>)</td><td>HEK293T</td><td>PMID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32277988">32277988</ext-link></td><td/><td>Dr. Lin-Feng Chen</td></tr><tr><td>Cell line (<italic>Rattus norvegicus</italic>)</td><td>PC12</td><td>PMID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22206868">22206868</ext-link></td><td/><td>Dr. Tobias Meyer</td></tr><tr><td>Cell line (<italic>Mesocricetus auratus</italic>)</td><td>BHK-21</td><td>PMID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26080442">26080442</ext-link></td><td/><td>Dr. Steven Chu</td></tr><tr><td>Transfected construct (<italic>Homo sapiens</italic>)</td><td>pEGFP N1 CRY2-mCh-Raf1-P2A-CIBNx2-EGFP-CAAX</td><td>This paper</td><td/><td>OptoRaf, CIBN-CRY2 based Raf membrane translocation system.

Neurite outgrowth of PC12 cells was imaged using an epi-illumination fluorescence microscope (Leica DMI8) equipped with 10× (PLAN 10×/0.25) and 40× (HCXPL FL L 40×/0.6) objectives. Fluorescence from GFP was detected using the GFP filter cube (Leica, excitation filter 472/30, dichroic mirror 495, and emission filter 520/35); fluorescence from mCherry was detected using the Texas Red filter cube (Leica, excitation filter 560/40, dichroic mirror 595, and emission filter 645/75).</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Western blot</title><p>Cells were washed once with 1 mL cold DPBS and lysed with 100 µL cold lysis buffer (RIPA + protease/phosphatase cocktail). Lysates were centrifuged at 17,000 RCF, 4°C for 10 min to pellet cell debris. Purified lysates were normalized using Bradford reagent. Normalized samples were mixed with LDS buffer and loaded onto 10% or 12% polyacrylamide gels. SDS-PAGE was performed at room temperature with a cold water bath. Samples were transferred to PVDF membranes at 30 V 4°C overnight or 80 V for 90 min. Membranes were blocked in 5% BSA/TBST for 1 hr at room temperature and probed with the primary and secondary antibodies according to company guidelines. Membranes were incubated with ECL substrate and imaged using a Bio-Rad ChemiDoc XRS chemiluminescence detector. Signal intensity analysis was performed by ImageJ. Antibodies used were listed in the Key Resources Table.</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>No statistical methods were used to pre-determine sample sizes but our sample sizes are similar to those reported in previous publications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Song et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Song et al., 2015</xref>), and the statistical analyses were done afterward without interim data analysis. Data distribution was assumed to be normal but this was not formally tested. All data were collected and processed randomly. Each experiment was successfully reproduced at least three times and was performed on different days. The values of ‘<italic>N</italic>’ (sample size) are provided in the figure legends. Data are expressed as mean ± SEM in bar graphs, if not mentioned otherwise. No data points were excluded. Two-tailed unpaired Student's t-test was performed for comparison between two groups of samples. One-way ANOVA followed by multiple comparison test was performed for comparisons among three or more groups of samples. Two-way ANOVA followed by multiple comparison test was performed for comparisons between two or more curves. Fisher's exact test was used to compare the percentage. Statistical significance was assigned, *p&lt;0.05, **p&lt;0.01, ***p&lt;0.001.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This work was supported by NIH grants

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Jonathan Cooper as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Philip JS Stork (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>As the editors have judged that your manuscript is of interest, but as described below that additional experiments are required before it is published, we would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). First, because many researchers have temporarily lost access to the labs, we will give authors as much time as they need to submit revised manuscripts. We are also offering, if you choose, to post the manuscript to bioRxiv (if it is not already there) along with this decision letter and a formal designation that the manuscript is &quot;in revision at <italic>eLife</italic>&quot;. Please let us know if you would like to pursue this option. (If your work is more suitable for medRxiv, you will need to post the preprint yourself, as the mechanisms for us to do so are still in development.)</p><p>This study uses ontogenetic probes to activate the Raf and Akt pathways. This approach represents a powerful system to dissect signaling outcomes of these pivotal enzymes. Light-controlled activation of these two relevant signals is used to assess their ability to mediate axonal pathfinding, branching, and regeneration. The optogenetic tools allow for an examination of the sufficiency of either Akt or ERK pathway activation in these processes, in both PNS and CNS neurons. The result that both pathways play significant yet distinct roles in these processes is important and is of wide interest.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>Several major and minor reservations were brought up by the reviewers. The major issues are to define more fully the upstream events that activate Raf-1 and Akt and the need for additional controls for the optogenetic probes. The kinetics of activation, as well as cell localization, requires attention. Another request is to examine if there is convergence in the two pathways. The major concerns are described below--</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) This study assumes that the tools trigger signaling pathways independently of upstream (neurotropic) signaling. However, whether these tools require some upstream signaling remain incompletely addressed. For example, activation of Raf1 requires upstream activation by kinases phosphorylating the N-terminal region (Y341 and S338). The phosphorylation of S338 is a commonly used read-out for Raf-1 activation (and mutants at this position show no activation). It would be very informative to examine the status of pS338 in optoRaf and to compare the optoRaf to a mutant S338A version, at least in Hek293 cells. Because these phosphorylations are linked to Raf dimerization, these studies would provide insight into whether Raf dimerization is required or possible in this context.</p><p>2) It would be also helpful to include more specificity controls for Raf vs. Akt signaling in <italic>Drosophila</italic> neurons to ensure the signals directly go to cells where the functional assessments are being conducted.</p><p>3) The kinetic experiments are interesting but somewhat incomplete, and it is unclear what the takeaway from these experiments should be. Importantly, it is not known how different pulsed light patterns translate temporally to signaling. It seems that from the data in Figure 1, it is possible that in neurons patterns may maintain a constant activation of the pathway. Additional controls looking at the extent of signaling in neurons with these paradigms would be really helpful.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.57395.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) This study assumes that the tools trigger signaling pathways independently of upstream (neurotropic) signaling.

As suggested, we have performed Western blot in HEK293T cells using an antibody against phosphor-S338 of Raf1 under the optogenetic stimulation conditions. As a positive control, we used serum stimulation. As expected, in cells transfected with the optoRaf S338A mutant, optoRaf S338A cannot be phosphorylated at this site regardless of serum and light stimulation (Figure 1—figure supplement 1E, top panel). Importantly, unlike wild-type optoRaf, optoRaf S338A significantly abolished the light-dependent activation of ERK (Figure 1—figure supplement 1E, third panel). This result indicates that activation of optoRaf should require the upstream activation machinery. Furthermore, as suggested by the reviewer, it is very likely that Raf dimerization is involved in the activation of optoRaf.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) It would be also helpful to include more specificity controls for Raf vs. Akt signaling in <italic>Drosophila</italic> neurons to ensure the signals directly go to cells where the functional assessments are being conducted.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for the suggestion. To make sure that light-mediated enhancement of Raf and AKT signaling occurs specifically in the target cell, we used DAPI staining to identify da neurons with or without the corresponding optogenetic systems. As shown in Figure 2—figure supplement 2, within the field of view, only C4da neurons marked by ppk-CD4tdGFP express optoRaf or optoAKT, which is under the control of ppk-Gal4, an enhancer driver for C4da neurons. In these cells, blue light-stimulation significantly enhances the level of phospho-ERK or phospho-p70 ribosomal S6 kinase (phospho-p70<sup>S6K</sup>) compared with the neighboring cells, which do not express optoRaf or optoAKT (DAPI only, no GFP). This result confirms that blue light specifically triggers Raf/MEK/ERK or AKT signaling in optoRaf/AKT expressing C4da neurons.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The kinetic experiments are interesting but somewhat incomplete, and it is unclear what the takeaway from these experiments should be.

As suggested, we carried out a kinetic study in C4da neurons to determine if intermittent light pattern leads to intermittent signaling activity. The level of ERK and AKT signaling activities was probed by immunostaining of phospho-ERK and phospho-p70<sup>S6K</sup>, respectively. Consistent with the results from mammalian cell culture, 5-10 min of light stimulation was sufficient to activate optoRaf and optoAKT (Figure 2—figure supplement 1). After the light was off, the level of phospho-ERK and phospho-p70<sup>S6K</sup> decreases monotonically. We observed that optoAKT inactivates faster than optoRaf, i.e., level of phospho-p70<sup>S6K</sup> decreases to the basal level within 15 min, whereas phospho-ERK decreases slower (Figure 2). This difference in decay kinetics may arise from distinct signaling threshold, signaling capacity of Raf and AKT, or both.</p></body></sub-article></article>
