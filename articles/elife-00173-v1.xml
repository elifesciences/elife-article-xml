We discovered membrane immersion allows substrates to be identified in a fundamentally-different way, based initially upon exposing ‘masked’ conformational dynamics of transmembrane segments rather than sequence-specific binding. EPR and CD spectroscopy revealed that the membrane restrains rhomboid gate and substrate conformation to limit proteolysis. True substrates evolved intrinsically-unstable transmembrane helices that both become unstructured when not supported by the membrane, and facilitate partitioning into the hydrophilic, active-site environment. Accordingly, manipulating substrate and gate dynamics in living cells shifted cleavage sites in a manner incompatible with extended sequence binding, but correlated with a membrane-and-helix-exit propensity scale. Moreover, cleavage of diverse non-substrates was provoked by single-residue changes that destabilize transmembrane helices. Membrane immersion thus bestows rhomboid proteases with the ability to identify substrates primarily based on reading their intrinsic transmembrane dynamics.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.00173.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.00173.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.00173.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Proteases are enzymes that break the peptide bonds that hold proteins together, and have a central role in many physiological processes, including digestion, blood clotting and programmed cell death. An important characteristic of proteases is that they are highly selective, only cutting proteins that contain well-defined sequences of amino acids in accessible regions. Proteases that are soluble in water have been studied for over a century and are now well understood, as are proteases that need to be tethered to the membrane of a cell to work properly.</p><p>In 1997 researchers discovered a protease that was immersed in the cell membrane, and it soon became clear that these intramembrane proteases were widespread and involved in a wide range of processes in cells. Examples of intramembrane proteases include γ-secretase, which is implicated in Alzheimer's disease, and various site-2 proteases that regulate pathogenic circuits in bacteria.</p><p>There are many similarities between soluble and intramembrane proteases. However, given that intramembrane proteases evolved within the hydrophobic environment of the membrane, whereas soluble proteases evolved in an aqueous environment, there should there should also be significant differences between them. The best understood intramembrane proteases in terms of their biochemistry are probably the rhomboid proteases. However, most studies of their function have been performed in detergent systems rather than in real membranes.</p><p>Moin and Urban now report that the main strategy used by rhomboid proteases to identity the proteins that they selectively cut is completely different from that used by soluble proteases. Through a combination of biochemical and spectroscopic methods, they have discovered that rhomboid proteases identify the proteins they act on mainly by detecting changes in dynamic behavior: only those proteins that lose a stable helical structure when they exit the lipid phase to interact with the rhomboid protease will be cut by the rhomboid protease. Soluble proteases, on the other hand, achieve specificity by looking for proteins with a particular sequence of amino acids. The novel strategy used by rhomboid proteases allows them to patrol the membrane for unstable helices and selectively cut them. This discovery provides the first explanation of why these complicated enzymes evolved to have active sites immersed within the cell membrane.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.00173.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.00173.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>intramembrane proteolysis</kwd><kwd>rhomboid protease</kwd><kwd>pathogen</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd><kwd><italic>E. coli</italic></kwd><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>002137</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Moin</surname><given-names>Syed M</given-names></name><name><surname>Urban</surname><given-names>Sinisa</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AI066025</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Moin</surname><given-names>Syed M</given-names></name><name><surname>Urban</surname><given-names>Sinisa</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Packard Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2007-31766</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Moin</surname><given-names>Syed M</given-names></name><name><surname>Urban</surname><given-names>Sinisa</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Intramembrane proteases identify target proteins in a different way from other proteases.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Signaling networks rely on the specificity of individual components for their targets, avoiding unwanted crosstalk and driving emergent properties of the system. Proteases are ubiquitous in all life, and are particularly well-adapted for serving as regulatory nodes in networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">López–Otín and Bond, 2008</xref>). These enzymes achieve their exquisite specificity by recognizing a short binding motif surrounding the scissile bond to align the substrate along the elongated active site cleft of the protease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Schechter, 2005</xref>). Residues flanking the scissile bond are designated P1 and P1′ on the amino and carboxy sides, respectively, and numbered moving outwards, while the accommodating protease subsites are correspondingly termed S1 and onwards. This geometric pairing confers high target specificity as the number of residues in the interaction increases, and results in a single and invariant substrate cleavage site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Schechter, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Ng et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>While soluble proteases have been attractive topics for study for over a century and are now understood at a sophisticated level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">López–Otín and Bond, 2008</xref>), the more-recent discovery of intramembrane proteases uncovered a fundamentally separate path of protease evolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brown et al., 2000</xref>). These polytopic membrane proteins assemble a protease active site within the membrane using catalytic residues contributed by different transmembrane (TM) segments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Erez et al., 2009</xref>). Even more remarkable is the broad array of cellular networks that intramembrane proteases have come to regulate. Intensively studied is γ-secretase, an aspartyl intramembrane protease that releases signaling domains from the membrane, including the intracellular domains of the Notch receptor and the amyloid-β precursor protein (APP) implicated in Alzheimer's disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">De Strooper et al., 1998</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Wolfe et al., 1999</xref>). Homologous signal peptide peptidases function in immunity by liberating signaling domains of TNFα and FasL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fluhrer et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Friedmann et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kirkin et al., 2007</xref>). Site-2 proteases are metalloenzymes that release transcription factors from the membrane to regulate membrane biogenesis and stress responses in diverse organisms from bacterial pathogens to man (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Rawson et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Makinoshima and Glickman, 2005</xref>). Lastly, rhomboid proteases act as prime regulators of signaling in insects by activating EGF signals through proteolytic shedding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Urban et al., 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">2002</xref>), and play prominent functions in diverse pathogen signaling and adhesion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Urban, 2009</xref>).</p><p>The presence of intramembrane proteases in all forms of life indicates that they possess a particularly useful property as regulatory enzymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kinch et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Lemberg and Freeman, 2007</xref>). However, comparative approaches have been instructive only in highlighting convergent similarities in catalytic chemistry with soluble serine proteases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Vinothkumar et al., 2010</xref>); other properties of intramembrane proteases remain unexplored (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Erez et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Urban, 2010</xref>). Since these membrane-immersed proteases evolved within the hydrophobic milieu of the membrane, a fundamentally different environment compared to soluble proteases, could this novel environment confer different enzymatic properties? Particularly important is target specificity, because intramembrane cleavage is usually the signal-generating step that alone is sufficient for pathway activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brown et al., 2000</xref>).</p><p>With over a dozen crystal structures and well-developed reconstitution systems for their study, arguably the best understood biochemically are rhomboid proteases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Urban, 2010</xref>). Mutational analyses have identified some sequence determinants in rhomboid substrates, most notably small P1/P1′ residues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Urban and Freeman, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Akiyama and Maegawa, 2007</xref>) and large, hydrophobic residues at P4 and P2′ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Strisovsky et al., 2009</xref>). However, despite the recent wealth of biochemical and structural information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bondar et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Urban, 2010</xref>), particularly on the <italic>E. coli</italic> rhomboid GlpG, most current studies have been confined to detergent systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lemberg et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Strisovsky et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>Achieving a true understanding of rhomboid function can only be realized by defining its properties in the natural context of the membrane. We therefore used biochemical and spectroscopic methods to determine the contribution of the membrane to proteolysis. These approaches revealed rhomboid proteases rely upon constraints imposed by the membrane on TM segment conformational dynamics to achieve high proteolytic specificity. Further interrogation of proteolysis directly in living cells suggest that rhomboid proteases expose the propensity of TM helices to exit the membrane and unwind as a substrate-discrimination mechanism, rather than relying on recognition-sequence binding like all other known specific proteases.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>The membrane imparts site-specificity and substrate selectivity</title><p>In order to identify any specific contributions of the cell membrane to proteolysis, we compared catalysis in living cells to catalysis in detergent micelles that support high levels of rhomboid activity. Mass spectrometry revealed that rhomboid proteolysis is notably site-specific, in contrast to other intramembrane proteases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fraering et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fluhrer et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Friedmann et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Sato et al., 2006</xref>).

However, when we examined proteolysis in detergent micelles, we found that the cleavage site in Spitz also shifted +3 residues deeper into the TM segment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). The shift was even more dramatic with APP + Spi7, an engineered substrate that harbors seven TM residues of Spitz within the C-terminal 99 residues of human APP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Urban and Wolfe, 2005</xref>). In fact, some rhomboid enzymes abandoned the natural AS entirely in favor of cleavage +3 and/or +5 residues deeper (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, also see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Without exception analyzing both N- and C-terminal cleavage products revealed that each substrate is cut only once in vitro without successive trimming, but the cut site is free to shift in position (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, also see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Notably, small residues flanking the cleavage site (P1/P1′) were strongly preferred.</p><p>We found that the membrane itself is the basis for the discrepancy in site-specificity in cells vs in detergent micelles; reconstituting pure rhomboid and substrate in vitro from detergent into defined proteoliposomes restored cleavage to the natural site in Spitz, and even in APP + Spi7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Reconstitution into proteoliposomes comprised of a wide variety of lipids all restored site-specificity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>), revealing that the composition of the membrane affects the efficiency of proteolysis, but not its site-specificity. Therefore, the uncompromising site-specificity of rhomboid proteases is not an inherent property of the enzyme itself, but rather results from the membrane somehow directing the position of cleavage.</p><p>Reconstituting rhomboid and substrate into proteoliposomes from detergent micelles also revealed a second role for the membrane in substrate discrimination. Distal GA residues are a hallmark requirement for Spitz cleavage in cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Urban and Freeman, 2003</xref>), and these residues were also important for cleavage in vitro when both rhomboid and substrate were reconstituted into proteoliposomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). In contrast, cleavage of a GA mutant substrate was rescued to nearly wildtype levels in detergent micelles, suggesting that the membrane plays a direct role in restricting substrate specificity in addition to specifying the cleavage site.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>The membrane restrains rhomboid gate dynamics</title><p>Since proteolysis in detergent was notably plastic, we investigated the protein dynamics of both the protease and substrates, neither of which have yet been studied for any intramembrane protease. We functionally identified TM5 of GlpG as part of the lateral gate for substrate access to the active site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Baker et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Urban and Baker, 2008</xref>), although other models have also been proposed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ha, 2009</xref>). Since cleavage sites shifted only deeper into the TM segment, we examined gate dynamics. We introduced a nitroxide spin label onto TM5 at W236, a position we previously identified to be key for gating, and onto the overlying extramembraneous Cap loop at M247 as a control. The particular W236 and M247 sites were also attractive because neither contribute to GlpG's structural stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baker and Urban, 2012</xref>). We then monitored dynamics directly at these sites using electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy. As expected, we observed two spectral components: a dynamic form (α in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>) and an immobilized form (β in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). These are consistent with the gate-open and gate-closed conformations, respectively, observed by X-ray crystallography (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Urban, 2010</xref>). Interestingly, the relative proportion of these two forms changed when GlpG was in different environments. Both TM5 and Cap sites were readily observed in the highly-dynamic form when GlpG was in the detergent-solubilized state. However, while the Cap site retained a high proportion in the mobile form when GlpG was reconstituted into proteoliposomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>), the TM5 position shifted almost completely to the strongly restrained form (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). This is consistent with conversion to a predominantly gate-closed form, indicating that the membrane confers site-specificity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>) by restricting gate dynamics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>).<fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.00173.006</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>The membrane restrains rhomboid gate dynamics.</title><p>Side-view of GlpG (left) showing positions (in spheres) of nitroxide spin probes.

TatA was 31% less helical, and APP + Spi7 over threefold less helical, in DDM micelles compared to being reconstituted into proteoliposomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). This observation explains the relaxed need for helix-destabilizing residues for cleavage in detergent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>), because these TM segments are already partly unwound. Moreover, we found that this instability is a defining feature of rhomboid substrates relative to non-substrates; analysis in detergent micelles revealed that the APP + Spi7 peptide was a remarkable 36% less helical than the non-substrate APP, while TatA was 46% less helical than its uncleavable GSP-VVL mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>).</p><p>Spectroscopic interrogation revealed for the first time that rhomboid substrates are unable to maintain a stable helix without the membrane, raising the possibility that differences in intrinsic TM dynamics first and foremost is the property that defines substrates, rather than serving a secondary role in exposing the substrate backbone for hydrolysis as currently thought (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ha, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Strisovsky et al., 2009</xref>). This dynamic nature could allow substrates, but not non-substrates, to enter the catalytic center for proteolysis to ensue. While this model explains our biophysical observations, it's based entirely on in vitro measurements. We therefore sought to test the physiological, as well as functional, relevance of our model in living cells by examining its central predictions.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>TM dynamics, not sequence binding, position substrates in the active site</title><p>The distinguishing prediction of our model is that substrate position in the active site is dictated primarily by protein dynamics caused by residues of the TM segment that, when not supported by the membrane, disrupt helical stability and promote entry into the hydrophilic active site. Substrate position should therefore be predictably shifted by moving, enhancing, or limiting intrinsic substrate dynamics. In contrast, if rhomboid achieves specificity by regimented binding of a recognition motif like soluble proteases, then the site of cleavage must necessarily be fixed, while altering TM dynamics should only change the efficiency of cleavage. We tested this prediction with <italic>Drosophila</italic> rhomboid-1 (DmRho1), the natural Spitz protease, and <italic>E. coli</italic> GlpG, the best understood rhomboid protease, under physiological conditions. To reveal substrate position in the active site at the time of catalysis we mapped substrate cleavage sites generated in living cells, since a protease:substrate complex structure has never been achieved.</p><p>First, we reasoned that we could increase substrate TM dynamics but leave unperturbed all residues thought to be important for Spitz ‘binding’ (P4–P2′) by mutating two residues near the middle of the Spitz TM segment (at P8′ and P9′) to glycine. Circular dichroism spectroscopy revealed that the two glycines dramatically decreased helical stability by &gt;60% relative to wildtype Spitz (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Next, we tested Spitz + GG cleavage and found it to be cleaved more efficiently than wildtype Spitz in <italic>Drosophila</italic> cells, but the cleavage site shifted +3 residues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). The cleavage site also shifted in living <italic>E. coli</italic> cells by GlpG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>). This effect was not limited to glycine, since changing a distal cysteine (at P8′) to a helix-destabilizing serine also resulted in very efficient cleavage, but again induced a +3 residue shift in cleavage site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>). These shifts are particularly instructive because the natural sequence containing any possible binding motif is completely unperturbed, yet is abandoned for an ‘impermissible’ sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Strisovsky et al., 2009</xref>) with alanine and glycine at P4 and P2′, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>).

Strikingly, the cleavage site of Spitz by gate-open GlpG in vivo shifted completely −3 residues when helix-destabilizing S142 alone was replaced by alanine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). Moreover, a partial −3 shift also occurred when we replaced G143 with leucine, and almost fully to the outer AS when both GA residues were replaced with leucine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). A shift also occurred with <italic>Drosophila</italic> rhomboid-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>).

To evaluate further what physical property is most likely responsible for the effects on proteolysis, we searched for a correlation between cleavage site shifts in living cells vs changes that our mutants made in residue properties using several independently generated physical scales. We found the strongest correlation with a ‘TM turn propensity’ scale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Monné et al., 1999a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">1999b</xref>). This scale had been derived by placing guest residues into the center of a long TM segment and measuring whether the residue prefers to stay in the middle of the membrane in the TM helix, or moves outside the membrane in a turn that breaks the long TM helix into two shorter TM helices (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). The quantified propensity scale displayed a correlation coefficient of 0.86 with the direction and degree of cleavage site shifts that we observed with 12 mutant substrates cleaved by rhomboid proteases in cellular membranes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>).</p><p>Taken together, these observations, conducted in living cells, reveal that gate and TM dynamics, rather than binding of a specific sequence within Spitz, play the predominant yet completely overlooked role in positioning substrates into the active site. The new cleavage sites further revealed dramatic re-alignments of the substrate in the rhomboid active site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>), even when the natural putative recognition was unperturbed, such that stereotypical binding of a complementary recognition sequence between rhomboid and substrates is unlikely to be the main driving force for protease specificity. But to evaluate this further, we examined the ability of the proposed P4–P2′ recognition binding region of TatA, the most efficient bacterial substrate, to inhibit proteolysis competitively by a panel of bacterial rhomboid enzymes in vitro both in detergent micelles and reconstituted into proteoliposomes. Even at millimolar concentration (∼1000× the substrate concentration), the peptide did not block rhomboid proteolysis of TatA or APP + Spi7 substrates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>), independently suggesting that sequence-specific binding is not the main feature of rhomboid specificity.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Increasing TM dynamics converts non-substrates into rhomboid substrates</title><p>Discovering rhomboid specificity is driven by exposing intrinsic TM dynamics raised an independent prediction: non-substrates of various sequence should be converted into substrates simply by increasing their intrinsic TM dynamics. APP, Delta and TGFα have been characterized genetically, cell biologically, and in vitro with pure proteins as non-substrates for rhomboid enzymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Peschon et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Urban and Freeman, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lemberg et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Urban and Wolfe, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adrain et al., 2011</xref>).

Coupling this information with examining proteolysis in living cells suggests that the main factor keeping many type I TM segments from becoming rhomboid substrates is their ability to maintain a stable TM helix. Differences between substrate and non-substrate TM helices are minimal while they reside in the membrane. However, a defining property of rhomboid substrates is a meta-stable TM helix that actually relies on the membrane for stability, and unravels without it. Mutations that stabilize TM helices compromise proteolysis, while simply introducing helical instability into non-substrate TMs, as measured directly by CD, converted three of three unrelated type I membrane proteins into substrates for seven different rhomboid proteases despite diversity in the cleaved sequences.</p><p>It is worth emphasizing that mutational analysis has played an important role in our study of rhomboid proteolysis, and while this is a proven strategy for elucidating enzyme mechanisms, all of our mutants that change helicity also necessarily change sequence. To limit this inherent drawback, we were careful, whenever possible, to make conservative mutations, measure effects on helicity directly by CD, and ultimately base our analysis on &gt;30 mutations. Nevertheless, we further evaluated what underlying physical property drives the cleavage site shifts and ultimately found the strongest correlation with a ‘turn propensity’ scale. The informative feature of this novel scale is that it integrates both the helical propensity of a residue, as well as its preference to be inside the membrane versus seeking a more hydrophilic environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Monné et al., 1999a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">1999b</xref>). As such, the intrinsic dynamics in rhomboid substrate TMs thus likely derives from a combination of residues that destabilize the TM helix structure directly, as well as those of limited hydrophobicity that increase the likelihood of this polypeptide region escaping the helix-inducing environment of the membrane (in favor of the hydrophilic active site of rhomboid, see below). This observation independently suggests that the key differences in TM dynamics are evaluated in a different, non-membranous environment. This may explain why alanines are known to be important for rhomboid proteolysis yet themselves are not helix-destabilizing directly, and require mutation to large hydrophobic residues to compromise proteolysis.</p><p>The strong correlation with the turn propensity scale could also have predictive value for finding new rhomboid substrates by sequence analysis. However, it should be noted that our analysis had the benefit of quantifying ‘changes’ in turn propensity (‘∆ turn propensity’ in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>) between two sequences that differ at only one or two residues. In practice, the turn propensity of a residue has been shown to be altered in non-linear ways by differences in TM segment length, the local sequence context, and the exact position of the residue within the TM segment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Monné et al., 1999b</xref>). If these confounding parameters also apply to rhomboid proteolysis, accurately predicting absolute propensities of natural TM segments from sequence alone may present challenges. Nevertheless, cautious optimism is warranted, since these challenges could be overcome by additional scale refinement with rhomboid proteases directly.</p><p>While our analyses consistently indicate TM dynamic state is the defining feature of rhomboid substrates, they do not neglect that sequence also contributes a secondary role. The shifts that we observed reveal sequence requirements for proteolysis with positive data, because they mark substrate position in the active site at the time that catalysis was proceeding efficiently. Preference for cleavage to shift to between small residues re-affirmed prior studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Urban and Freeman, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Akiyama and Maegawa, 2007</xref>). However, little appears to be essential for cleavage beyond small P1/P1′ residues, since we found a great diversity of residues at other positions allowed efficient proteolysis to proceed by multiple rhomboid proteases. This is particularly informative, because prior analyses necessarily focused on mutations that block cleavage, but could not rule out the possibility that they interfere with proteolysis indirectly, for example, by promoting TM oligomerization (which is required for TatA function).</p><p>By incorporating a single proline at various positions we were able to convert three unrelated proteins into rhomboid substrates. Nevertheless it is important to note that this too does not mean that any TM sequence can become a rhomboid substrate. Rather, it highlights that the natural sequence diversity in many TM segments provides ample opportunities for finding acceptable cleavage sites. True substrates would nevertheless be expected to have further sequence optimization that would be specific to a particular rhomboid protease, because greater proteolytic efficiency would be favored as substrate and protease co-evolve. One current example might be TatA proteolysis, because TatA cleavage is thought to proceed rapidly and automatically for quorum sensing to operate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Stevenson et al., 2007</xref>). However, this is unlikely to be representative of most rhomboid functions. Even so, a peptide comprised of all P4–P2′ residues requires millimolar concentrations to affect proteolysis of TatA by AarA, indicating that even in this context recognition sequence binding is not the main determinant for specificity.</p><p>Considered together, our observations suggest a new working model in which canonical rhomboid proteases patrol the membrane for meta-stable TM helices for cleavage. A gate-open rhomboid may be sufficient to provide a microenvironment in which ‘intrinsic’ TM segment differences can be unmasked, and recent molecular dynamics simulations and biophysical measurements indicate that this is a stable rhomboid conformation in the membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baker and Urban, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Zhou et al., 2012</xref>). Because of both helix-destabilizing residues and limited hydrophobicity, substrates are poised to exit from the membrane and partition into the hydrophilic rhomboid active site. Proteolysis then ensues because such extended TMs are susceptible to proteolysis, and/or are able to ‘reach’ the internal catalytic apparatus. Such substrate ‘partitioning’ is consistent with a strong correlation with a ‘turn propensity scale’, and may further explain the unexpected observation that scanning a single proline along the TM segment moves the cleavage site deeper, at times positioning it at unacceptable residues. Importantly, the central yet overlooked component of this specificity system is the membrane itself, which limits proteolysis both by inducing TMs to form helices and restricting gate-opening (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>).</p><p>Ultimately our analyses have both coalesced into a general framework for how rhomboid intramembrane proteolysis functions, and emphasize that further work is required to define the specific details of how this complex system operates. Differences between substrates and non-substrates in the membrane beyond the resolution of our experimental approaches are possible, although direct evidence suggests that the most dramatic difference occurs when TMs leave the influence of the membrane. Moreover, structural analysis of the rhomboid-substrate complex is required to define the fine-detail interactions that mediate proteolysis, although this might prove particularly challenging if true substrates are indeed intrinsically dynamic. Finally, the precise order of events, and what triggers each step in the cleavage reaction, also remain unclear.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Concluding perspective</title><p>It's well recognized that proteolytic release of factors from the membrane regulates many signaling networks. Yet dozens of examples reveal that simply anchoring a protease domain to the membrane through a TM segment satisfies these needs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Blobel et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Antalis et al., 2010</xref>). So why did complicated, membrane-immersed enzymes evolve and become so wide-spread across all forms of life? Our analyses indicate that rhomboid proteases achieve substrate specificity first through reading TM dynamics, which endows them with different properties relative to soluble proteases. Intramembrane proteases might therefore be a distinct group of enzymes in the cell, not because they are proteases that release proteins from the membrane, but because they are membrane-immersed; they live in a world with different rules, giving the cell a set of enzymes with unique properties that it can harness for evolving new functions.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>In vitro proteolysis assays</title><p>Rhomboid proteases and substrates were expressed in <italic>E. coli,</italic> purified, and cleavage reactions were conducted at 37°C for 1–2 hr in 50 mM Tris–HCl pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, and either reconstituted into proteoliposomes or in 0.1% DDM as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Urban and Wolfe, 2005</xref>).

Your article has been evaluated by a Senior Editor and 2 reviewers, one of whom is a member of <italic>eLife</italic>'s Board of Reviewing Editors (Christopher T Walsh).</p><p>The Reviewing Editor and the other reviewer discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing Editor has assembled the following comments based on the reviewers' reports.</p><p>There are no substantive issues other than the request for further discussion of the turn propensity algorithm noted below. The manuscript by Moin and Urban evaluates the basis of specificity of the transmembrane proteases of the rhomboid family, and comes to the conclusion that protein/peptide substrates, with helical regions that can undergo cleavage, have intrinsically destabilized helical regions that can sample unfolded conformations and partition from the membrane phase into the active site of the rhomboid protease.</p><p>Key findings include: cleavage site specificity is shifted in detergent micelles vs proteoliposomes (the membrane directs the position of cleavage and restricts substrate specificity); and the membrane confers site-specificity by restricting gate dynamics; transmembrane dynamics, not sequence binding, position substrate in active site (in fact increasing TM dynamics converts non-substrate into substrate for rhomboid protease). The bottom line is that the membrane provides rhomboid proteases with the ability to identify substrates based primarily on their intrinsic TM dynamics.</p><p>The argument for selectivity then is less about how a peptide substrate fits into the protease active site but rather dynamic sampling of an unfolded conformation that can partition into the enzyme. Clear cut results on change of cleavage sites, on different amounts of helices by CD, on distinct states between micelles and proteoliposomes and form helix-breaking proline mutations support the conclusion for this class of TM proteases.</p><p>The authors argue that a “turn propensity scale” is predictive. It would be helpful to have expanded discussion of that algorithm.</p><p>Overall the manuscript is well written; the findings are intriguing and have broad scientific interest.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.00173.018</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>As requested, we have expanded our discussion of the predictive nature of the turn propensity scale (4th paragraph of the revised Discussion and a dedicated section in the Materials &amp; Methods). This is an exciting topic for further study, and we have been careful to present a balanced description. On the one hand, we describe how we calculated the values (in the Materials &amp; Methods) and point out, as noted by the Reviewers, that with such a high correlation it is likely to have predictive value as a tool for finding new rhomboid protease substrates. On the other hand, we caution that our correlation is based on a difference calculated between two substrates that are identical except at only 1 or 2 positions. As such, the relative <italic>changes</italic> in ‘turn propensity’ are highly controlled. A challenge described by the ‘turn propensity’ authors is that the propensity of the same residue differs when it is placed in transmembrane segments of different length, of differing sequence context, and depending on precisely where the residue is placed. As such, using the ‘turn propensity’ scale as an <italic>absolute</italic> value to predict rhomboid substrates from natural transmembrane sequences could prove to be challenging. Nevertheless, experimental refinement of the scale with rhomboid proteases directly is likely to improve its predictive accuracy even further.</p></body></sub-article></article>
