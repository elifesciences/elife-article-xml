Currently, there is no treatment for NPC. Transcription factor EB (TFEB), a member of the microphthalmia transcription factors (MiTF), has emerged as a master regulator of lysosomal function and promoted the clearance of substrates stored in cells. However, it is not known whether TFEB plays a role in cholesterol clearance in NPC disease. Here, we show that transgenic overexpression of TFEB, but not TFE3 (another member of MiTF family) facilitates cholesterol clearance in various NPC1 cell models. Pharmacological activation of TFEB by sulforaphane (SFN), a previously identified natural small-molecule TFEB agonist by us, can dramatically ameliorate cholesterol accumulation in human and mouse NPC1 cell models. In NPC1 cells, SFN induces TFEB nuclear translocation via a ROS-Ca<sup>2+</sup>-calcineurin-dependent but MTOR-independent pathway and upregulates the expression of TFEB-downstream genes, promoting lysosomal exocytosis and biogenesis. While genetic inhibition of TFEB abolishes the cholesterol clearance and exocytosis effect by SFN. In the NPC1 mouse model, SFN dephosphorylates/activates TFEB in the brain and exhibits potent efficacy of rescuing the loss of Purkinje cells and body weight. Hence, pharmacological upregulating lysosome machinery via targeting TFEB represents a promising approach to treat NPC and related lysosomal storage diseases, and provides the possibility of TFEB agonists, that is, SFN as potential NPC therapeutic candidates.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>TFEB agonists</kwd><kwd>cholesterol accumulation</kwd><kwd>NPC1</kwd><kwd>lysosome</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>31600823</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Li</surname><given-names>Dan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Calygene Biotechnology Inc</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>XT [2016]008@</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Li</surname><given-names>Dan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Lysoway Therapeutics, Inc</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>KYY-HX-20210129</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Li</surname><given-names>Dan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Small-molecule agonists of transcription factor EB alleviate Niemann–Pick disease type C via promoting lysosomal function.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Lysosomes are essential organelles for the degradation and recycle of damaged complex substrates and organelles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Xu and Ren, 2015</xref>).

We have previously identified a natural TFEB agonist sulforaphane (SFN), which is also an activator of cellular antioxidant NFE2L2/Nrf2 pathway, dramatically mitigating oxidative stress commonly associated with metabolic and age-related diseases, including NPC diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Corssac et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Li et al., 2021</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Liu et al., 2021</xref>). Based on our previous data that SFN (10–15 μM, 3–24 h) potently activates TFEB in various cell lines, promoting lysosomal function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Li et al., 2021</xref>), thus, in this study, we set SFN treatment dose to 15 μM and treatment time to 4–24 h according to individual experiment. We hypothesize that SFN may contribute to cholesterol clearance in NPC disease. To evaluate this hypothesis, we first examined the effect of SFN on cellular cholesterol levels in HeLa NPC1 cell model using filipin staining. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C and D</xref>, U18666A treatment significantly increased filipin signals in bright perinuclear granules, which were well co-localized with lysosomal marker LAMP1, but not with ER marker calnexin in HeLa cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>), suggesting that U18666A-induced cholesterol accumulation presents in the late endosome/lysosome compartment, but not in ER. Moreover, when HeLa NPC1 cells were further challenged with SFN (15 μM, 12–24 h), a dramatic reduction of cholesterol accumulation (filipin intensity) by more than 30% was observed in lysosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C–E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). These results confirmed that U18666A interferes with the egress of free cholesterol from endosomes/lysosomes as previously reported by others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Lange and Steck, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Davis et al., 2021</xref>) and SFN reduces lysosomal cholesterol in NPC1 cells.</p><p>In our previous study, we identified that SFN activates TFEB via a ROS-Ca<sup>2+</sup>- calcineurin-mediated but MTOR (mechanistic target of rapamycin kinase)-independent mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Li et al., 2021</xref>). Thus, we further validated this mechanism of SFN in HeLa NPC1 cell model by performing immunofluorescence experiments. In HeLa NPC1 cells, SFN (15 μM, 24 h) induced robust TFEB translocation from the cytosol to the nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F and G</xref>). SFN treatment (15 μM, 24 h) also resulted in an increase in the mRNA levels of TFEB downstream genes, including genes required for autophagy (<italic>ULK1</italic>, <italic>SQSTM1,</italic> and <italic>ATG5</italic>) and lysosome biogenesis-<italic>LAMP1</italic>, using quantitative real-time PCR (Q-PCR) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>). Consistent with previous findings, BAPTA-AM (a membrane-permeable Ca<sup>2+</sup> chelator), FK506 and cyclosporin A (CsA) (calcineurin inhibitors), and N-acetylcysteine (NAC, a ROS scavenger) can robustly block SFN-induced TFEB nuclear translocation in HeLa NPC1 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>), suggesting that in NPC1 cells SFN induces TFEB nuclear translocation via a ROS-Ca<sup>2+</sup>-calcineurin-dependent mechanism A key mechanism of TFEB activation is Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent dephosphorylation of TFEB by protein phosphatases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Napolitano et al., 2018</xref>). We next investigated the specific phosphorylated site on TFEB by SFN in NPC1 cells. Following 24 h exposure to SFN, S211, and S142-TFEB phosphorylation were significantly decreased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I and J</xref>), while S122 phosphorylation was not affected. These results indicate that TFEB is dephosphorylated at S211 and S142 residues by SFN in HeLa NPC1 model. TFEB nuclear shuffling is regulated by the activity of MTOR, which is regulated by its phosphorylation status (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Martina et al., 2012</xref>). SFN reportedly activates TFEB in a mTOR-independent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Li et al., 2021</xref>). Consistently, no significant inhibition of phosphorylated MTOR (p-MTOR) or RPS6KB1 (p-RPS6KB1) can be observed in HeLa NPC1 cells treated with SFN (15 μM, 24 h) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>). Therefore, in HeLa NPC1 cells SFN-induced TFEB activation is unlikely to be mediated by MTOR inhibition. We also examined the possibility of the direct effect of SFN on NPC1 by western blotting. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5</xref>, SFN (15 μM, 24 h) treatment did not affect NPC1 expression in human NPC1-patient fibroblasts. Given the well-known role of SFN as an NFE2/Nrf2 inducer, we also validated whether SFN can induce Nrf2 activation in NPC cells. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s6">Figure 1—figure supplement 6</xref>, SFN (15 μM, 24 h) induced robust Nrf2 nuclear translocation from the cytosol to the nucleus in HeLa NPC1 and NPC primary mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF) cells.</p><p>Next, we verified the effect of SFN in another NPC1 cell model by knockdown (KD) <italic>NPC1</italic> with specific siRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Liao et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Höglinger et al., 2019</xref>).

Thus, lysosomal pH was more accurately determined using a ratiometric dye pHrodo Green Dextran. When the fluorescence ratios (pHrodo Green Dextran/CF555) were calibrated to pH values, we found that SFN treatment induced significant lysosomal hyperacidity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4I and J</xref>).

Pharmacological activation of TFEB by SFN, a previously identified TFEB agonist (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Li et al., 2021</xref>), significantly promoted cholesterol clearance in human and mouse NPC cells, while genetic inhibition (KO) of TFEB blocked SFN-induced cholesterol clearance. This clearance effect exerted by SFN was associated with upregulated lysosomal exocytosis and biogenesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). Notably, SFN is reportedly BBB-permeable, assuring a good candidate for efficient delivery to the brain, which is essential for targeting neurodegenerative phenotypes in neurological diseases including NPC. In the NPC mouse models, SFN exhibits in vivo efficacy of suppressing the loss of Purkinje cells and maintaining body weight. Hence, genetically or pharmacologically targeting TFEB may represent a promising approach to treat NPC and manipulating lysosome function with small-molecule TFEB agonists may have broad therapeutic potentials.</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>A working scheme to illustrate that small-molecule TFEB agonist promotes cholesterol clearance in the NPC model via TFEB-upregulated lysosomal exocytosis and biogenesis.</title><p>Pharmacological or genetic activation/overexpression of TFEB dramatically ameliorates cholesterol accumulation in NPC1 cells.

Many of the mechanistic insights into MiT regulation have been focused on TFEB and TFE3, which shares some overlapping functions, Surprisingly, in this study we found that overexpression of TFEB, but not TFE3, alleviated lysosomal cholesterol accumulation in NPC cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and B</xref> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Moreover, studies reported that only TFEB overexpression, but not other MiT members, upregulates lysosomal gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Sardiello et al., 2009</xref>). Thus, these results suggest that the functions exerted by TFEB and TFE3 in NPC may appear to be specialized.</p><p>As a proof of the role of TFEB activation in NPC, pharmacological activation of TFEB by SFN, a natural small-molecule TFEB agonist, promotes a dramatic lysosomal cholesterol-lowering effect in several genetic and pharmacological NPC cell models (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5C</xref>). The concentration of SFN used in this study has no cytotoxicity toward the cell lines we used (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4</xref>). SFN-induced lysosomal exocytosis and the increased population of lysosomes ready to fuse with the PM contribute to the cholesterol clearance by SFN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A–G</xref>). Previously we have shown that SFN can mitigate oxidative stress via a ROS-Ca<sup>2+</sup>-calcineurin-TFEB-mediated lysosomal function and autophagy flux (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Li et al., 2021</xref>). SFN, an electrophilic compound enriched in cruciferous vegetables such as broccoli, is a known potent inducer of NFE2L2/NRF2 in various cell types including NPC cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s6">Figure 1—figure supplement 6</xref>), a transcriptional factor that controls the expression of multiple detoxifying enzymes through antioxidant response elements (AREs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Yamamoto et al., 2018</xref>). Notably, the promoter region of the <italic>Nfe2l2</italic> gene harbors a CLEAR site, and TFEB activation can upregulate the expression of <italic>Nfe2l2</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Mansueto et al., 2017</xref>). Hence, TFEB, together with NFE2L2, functions as a key regulator of cellular redox. Oxidative stress is a major feature of NPC and has been attributed to neuronal damage, leading to the pathogenesis and progression of NPC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Vázquez et al., 2012</xref>). Elevated oxidative stress has been observed in the brain of NPC patient and mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Smith et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Zampieri et al., 2009</xref>). NPC patients also show decreased antioxidant capacity (expressed as Trolox equivalents) and diminished activity of different antioxidant enzymes, which indicates a decrease in antioxidant defenses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Fu et al., 2010</xref>). Hence, the protective effect of SFN against NPC could be attributed to a combination with antioxidant activity and cholesterol clearance via the lysosome-dependent, TFEB-mediated regulation. Therefore, pharmacological activation of TFEB may serve as a potential therapeutic strategy for NPC.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Mammalian cell culture</title><p>HeLa cells were cultured in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle’s Medium (DMEM; Thermo Fisher Scientific, 11195-065) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Thermo Fisher Scientific, 10091148).

The amount of cholesterol was calculated by standard curve and normalized with cellular protein content.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Cell viability assay</title><p>Cell viability was assessed by MTT assay (Merck, M2128-5G). A modified MTT assay was applied to measure the cell viability. Briefly, approximately 10<sup>4</sup> cells were seeded in 96-well plates and exposed to SFN as required. Cells were then incubated in fresh medium containing 0.2 mg/ml MTT solution for 4 h. The supernatant was removed, and 100 μl of acidified DMSO (0.04 M HCl/DMSO) was added to dissolve the precipitation at 37°C for 10 min. The absorbance of dissolved solution was measured at 490 nm with Flexstation 3 (Molecular Devices). Cell mortality (%) was calculated by (OD<sup>Control</sup>-OD<sup>Sample</sup>)/OD<sup>Control</sup> × 100.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Animals</title><p><italic>Npc1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice (BALB/cNctr-Npc1 m1N/J, also known as NPC1<sup>NIH</sup>) were purchased from The Jackson Laboratory (USA). All the experimental procedures were conducted in accordance with the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals in the Zhejiang University of Technology (Hangzhou, China) and conformed to the National Institutes of Health Guide for Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. Unless stated otherwise, mice were fed with free access to water and standard diet under specific pathogen-free conditions. Genotypes were identified using a PCR-based screening (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Amigo et al., 2002</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>Histological analysis</title><p>Mice perfusion was performed with PBS. Then, mice cerebellums were post-fixed overnight at 4°C and then placed in serial dilutions of sucrose (10–30%) in PBS at 4°C overnight, respectively. Then cerebellums were cut in 5-μM-thick sagittal sections by cryostat at (Leika) at –20°C. Permeabilized slices with 0.1% Triton X-100 were blocked in 1% BSA in PBS for 1 h. Slices were incubated with anti-calbindin (Abcam, 108404) overnight at 4°C, followed by incubation with the secondary antibody conjugated with Alexa Fluor 488 for 2 h. The slices were then washed with PBS three times and incubated with DAPI in the dark for 10 min. All the images were captured with an Olympus or Zeiss confocal microscope.</p></sec><sec id="s4-15"><title>Isolation of primary MEF and macrophage cells</title><p>MEF cells were prepared from neonatal mice, which were euthanized by CO<sub>2</sub>. Skin of neonatal mice was cut with scissors and gently clipped and added to 0.25% trypsin-EDTA in a 37°C incubator for 20 min. The cell suspension was then transferred to a 50 ml tube, and 10 ml of DMEM media was added to inactivate the trypsin reaction for 5 min. The supernatant was transferred to a 60 mm dish and kept in the incubator at 37°C for 3 h, then the medium was replaced by DMEM with 10% FBS, 1% penicillin/streptomycin until confluency (2–4 days). Primary macrophages were established from hindlimb femurs and tibias of newborn mice. The marrow cells were flushed from the bones with PBS and centrifuged. Cells were then resuspended in RPMI 1640 medium (Gibco, B122656) supplemented with 20% FBS. Cells were then seeded in culture dishes coated with 2% gelatin and allowed to adhere for 2 h at 37℃.</p></sec><sec id="s4-16"><title>Reagents</title><p>The chemicals used in this study include SFN (Sigma-Aldrich, S4441), DMSO (Sigma-Aldrich, D2660), filipin III (Cayman Chemical, 70440), U18666A (MedChemExpress, HY-107433), Triton X-100 (MCE, HY-Y1883A), NAC (Sigma-Aldrich, A7250), FK506 (Sigma-Aldrich, F4679), CsA (Solarbio, C8780), and BAPTA-AM (Thermo Scientific, 1824047).</p></sec><sec id="s4-17"><title>Data analysis</title><p>Data are presented as mean ± s.e.m. from at least three independent experiments.

To address these concerns, mostly we performed new experiments. The most important changes are highlighted in the summary paragraphs.</p><p>First, in response to Reviewer 1’s suggestions, we have conducted the SFN experiments systematically, e.g., we further confirmed the mechanism of SFN-activated TFEB in HeLa NPC1 cells with new experiments including: the effect of BAPTA-AM (a calcium chelator), FK506+CsA (calcineurin inhibitors) and NAC (ROS scavenger) on SFN-induced TFEB-nuclear translocation in HeLa NPC1 cells (New Fig. S3). The effect of SFN on NPC1 expression (New Fig. S5). Particularly, we examined the colocalization of DiO (a PM marker) staining and surface LAMP1 staining in HeLa NPC1 cells under SFN treatment to confirm the PM exocytosis. In main text and figure legends, accuracy of sentence is thoroughly checked and defined. Hence, we have significantly improved the presentation and clarity in the revision.</p><p>Second, in response to Reviewer 2’s suggestions, we have performed additional experiments to demonstrate that the role of TFEB in SFN-evoked the lysosomal exocytosis by using TFEB-KO cells (New Fig. S7B). In TFEB KO cells, this increase of surface LAMP1 signal by SFN treatment was significantly reduced, suggestive of SFN-induced exocytosis in a TFEB-dependent manner. We also investigated the effect of U18666A on CF555-dextran endocytosis. By examining the localization of CF-dex and Lamp1, we found that CF555 is present in the lysosome with U18666A treatment (Fig for reviewers only A,B), suggesting that NPC1 deficiency/U18666A treatment has no effect on CF-dex endocytosis.</p><p>Third, in response to Reviewer 3’s suggestions, we have performed experiments in addition to response to other reviewers’ suggestion ie. the cytotoxicity of the concentration of SFN used in this study in various cell lines (New Fig.S10).</p><p>In addition, according to the reviewers’ suggestions, we made clarifications and corrections wherever appropriate in the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>The authors are trying to determine if SFN treatment results in dephosphorylation of TFEB, subsequent activation of autophagy-related genes, exocytosis of lysosomes, and reduction in lysosomal cholesterol levels in models of NPC disease.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>(1) Clear evidence that SFN results in translocation of TFEB to the nucleus.</p><p>(2) In vivo data demonstrating that SFN can rescue Purkinje neuron number and weight in NPC1<sup>-/-</sup> animals.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the support!</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>(1) Lack of molecular details regarding how SFN results in dephosphorylation of TFEB leading to activation of the aforementioned pathways.

The reviewer is right that in this manuscript we did not talk too much about the molecular mechanism of SFN-evoked TFEB activation. Because in our previous study (Li, Shao et al. 2021), we explored the mechanism of SFN-induced TFEB activation. We show that SFN-evoked TFEB activation via a ROS-Ca<sup>2+</sup>-calcineurin dependent but MTOR -independent pathway (Li, Shao et al. 2021). In the current manuscript, we cited this paper, but did not talk the details of the mechanism, which obviously confused the reviewers. Therefore, in the revision manuscript we added more details of the molecular mechanism of SFN-activated TFEB. Also, we further confirmed this mechanism in HeLa NPC1 cells with new experiments including: the effect of BAPTA-AM (a calcium chelator), FK506+CsA (calcineurin inhibitors) and NAC (ROS scavenger) on SFN-induced TFEB-nuclear translocation in NPC cells (New Fig.S3).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) Based on the manuscript narrative, discussion, and data it is unclear exactly how steady-state cholesterol would change in models of NPC disease following SFN treatment. Yes, there is good evidence that lysosomal flux to (and presumably across) the plasma membrane increases with SFN. However, lysosomal biogenesis genes also seem to be increasing. Given that NPC inhibition, NPC1 knockout, or NPC1 disease mutations are constitutively present and the cell models of NPC disease contain lysosomes (even with SFN) how could a simple increase in lysosomal flux decrease cholesterol levels? It would seem important to quantify the number of lysosomes per cell in each condition to begin to disentangle differences in steady state number of lysosomes, number of new lysosomes, and number of lysosomes being exocytosed.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this constructive comment. From our data, in NPC1 cells SFN reduced the cholesterol levels by inducing lysosomal exocytosis and increasing lysosomal biogenesis. We understand the reviewer’s point that it would be really helpful to differentiate the exact three states of original number of lysosomes, number of new lysosomes, and number of lysosomes being exocytosis. Unfortunately, due to the technique limitation, so far seems there is no appropriate method that could clearly differentiate the lysosomes exactly come from which state. In the future, hopefully we will have technique to explore this mechanism.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) Lack of evidence supporting the authors' premise that &quot;SFN could be a good therapeutic candidate for neuropathology in NPC disease&quot;.</p></disp-quote><p>Suggestion was taken!

We examined the effect of two doses of SFN30 and 50mg/kg on NPC mice. As shown in Fig.6, SFN (50mg/kg), but not 30mg/kg prevents a degree of Purkinje cell loss in the lobule IV/V of cerebellum, suggesting a dose-correlated preventive effect of SFN. In the future study, we will continue optimizing the dosage form and amount of SFN and do a dose-responsive analysis.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) Additional data supporting the activation of TFEB by SFN for cholesterol clearance in vivo would strengthen the overall impact of the study.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank the reviewer for this constructive comment. We have detected a significant decrease of pS211-TFEB protein in brain tissues of NPC mice upon SFN treatment compared to vehicle, suggesting that SFN activates TFEB in brain tissue for the first time. It is worth to further examine the lysosomal cholesterol levels in brain tissues to show the direct effect of SFN. However, in our hands and in the literatures Filipin seems not suitable for detecting lysosomal cholesterol accumulation in brain tissue. So far there isn’t a good method to directly measure lysosomal cholesterol in tissue.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(6) In Figure 4, the authors demonstrate increased lysosomal exocytosis and biogenesis by SFN in NPC cells. Including a TFEB-KO/KD in this assay would provide additional validation of whether these effects are TFEB-dependent.</p></disp-quote><p>Great suggestion! We investigated the role of TFEB in SFN-evoked the lysosomal exocytosis by using TFEB-KO cells. As shown in New Suppl. Fig. 7B, in TFEB KO cells, this increase of surface LAMP1 signal by SFN (15 μM, 12 h) treatment was significantly reduced, suggestive of SFN induced exocytosis in a TFEB-dependent manner.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(7) For lysosomal pH measurement, the combination of pHrodo-dex and CF-dex enables ratiometric pH measurement. However, the pKa of pHrodo red-dex (according to Invitrogen) is ~6.8, while lysosomal pH is typically around 4.7. This discrepancy may account for the lack of observed lysosomal pH changes between WT and U18666A-treated cells. Notably, previous studies (PMID: 28742019) have reported an increase in lysosomal pH in U18666A-treated cells.</p></disp-quote><p>We understand the reviewer’s point. But as stated in the methods and main text, we used pHrodo Green-Dextran (P35368, Invitrogen), rather than pHrodo Red-dextran. According to the product information from Invitrogen, pHrodo Green-dex conjugates are non-fluorescent at neural pH, but fluorescence bright green at acidic pH around 4, such as those in endosomes and lysosomes. Therefore, pHrodo Green-dex is suitable to monitor the acidity of lysosome (Hu, Li et al. 2022). We also used LysoTracker Red DND-99 (Thermo Scien fic, L7528) to measure lysosomal pH (Fig. 4G, H), which is consistent with results from pHrodo Green/CF measurement.</p><p>The reviewer mentioned that previous studies have reported an increase in lysosomal pH in U18666Atreated cells. We understood this concern. But in our hands, from our data with two lysosomal pH sensors, we have not detected lysosomal pH change in U18666A-treated NPC1 cell models.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(7) The authors are also encouraged to perform colocalization studies between CF-dex and a lysosomal marker, as some researchers may be concerned that NPC1 deficiency could reduce or block the trafficking of dextran along endocytosis.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for raising this important point and suggestion was taken! We investigated the effect of NPC1 deficiency on CF555-dextran trafficking into lysosome by examining the localization of CF-dex and Lamp1. To clearly define whether CF555-dex is present in the lysosome, we first used apilimod to enlarge lysosomes and then examined the relative posi on of CF555-dex and lamp1. As shown in Author response image 1A,B, in HeLa cells treated with U18666A, CF555 signals (red) clearly present inside lysosome (LAMP1 labelled lysosomal membrane, green signal), suggesting that CF555dex endocytosis is not affected by NPC1 deficiency (U18666A treatment).</p><fig id="sa2fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>The effect of NPC1 deficiency on CF555 endocytosis.</title><p>HeLa cells were transiently transfected with LAMP1-GFP plasmid for 24 h.

The reviewer is right that not all the mCherry alone cells with the same level of filipin signal and not all mCherry-TFEBS211 transfected cells show completely no filipin signal. The statistical results were from randomly selected cells from 3 independent experiments. To avoid the confusion, we have included more cells in the statistical analysis to cover all the conditions as shown in the new Fig. 1B. Hopefully this helps to clarify the confusion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(13) Figure 1C is impressive for the upregulation of filipin with U18666A treatment. However, SFN is used at 15 microM. This must be hitting multiple pathways. Vauzour et al (PMID: 20166144) use SFN at 10 nM to 1microM. Other manuscripts use it in the low microM range. The authors should repeat at least some key experiments using SFN at a range of concentrations from perhaps 100 nM to 5 microM. The use of 15 microM throughout is an overall concern.</p></disp-quote><p>The reason that we use this concentration of SFN is based on our previous study (Li, Shao et al. 2021). We had shown that SFN (10–15 μM, 2–9 h) induces robust TFEB nuclear translocation in a dose- and time-dependent manner in HeLa cells as well as in other human cell lines without cytotoxicity (Li, Shao et al. 2021). Also, tissue concentrations of SFN can reach 3–30 μM upon broccoli consumption (Hu, Khor et al. 2006), so we used low micromolar concentrations of SFN (15 μM) in our study. Moreover, we further confirmed that SFN (15 μM) induces TFEB nuclear translocation in HeLa NPC1 cells (Fig. 1F, G Fig. 2B, G) and this concentration of SFN has no cytotoxicity (New Fig.S10).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Recommendations for the authors:</bold></p><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p><p>The following comments are designed to improve and focus the authors' work.</p><p>(14) Related to data in Figure 1. The mechanism through which TFEB can reduce Filipin in U18 conditions is unclear. Inhibi on of NPC1 results in hyperactivation of mTOR through cholesterol transport at ER-Lysosome contacts (see Zoncu group publications). If mTORC is hyperac ve in NPC disease models, TFEB would be expected to remain cytoplasmic and not enter the nucleus as the representative image in Figure 1A demonstrates.</p></disp-quote><p>In our previous study (Li, Shao et al. 2021), we have shown that SFN induces TFEB nuclear translocation in a mTOR-independent manner (Li, Shao et al. 2021). Consistent with this result, in this study we confirmed that SFN-induced TFEB nuclear translocation is mTor-independent in NPC1 cells (Now Fig. S4A, B). Thus, SFN induced TFEB nuclear translocation in various NPC cells (Fig. 1F, G, Fig. 2B, G). Please also see the discussion about the mechanism of SFN in response to point #1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(15) Therefore, how does overexpression of TFEB, which remains in the cytoplasm, result in a decreased filipin signal? Similar ques ons relate to Figure 1C-H.</p></disp-quote><p>Medina et. al (Medina, Fraldi et al. 2011) show that TFEB overexpression (not activation, so overexpressed TFEB is in the cytoplasm) increases the pool of lysosomes in the proximity of the plasma membrane and promotes their fusion with PM by raising intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels through lysosomal Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel MCOLN1, leading to increased lysosomal exocytosis. Hence, TFEB overexpression only (TFEB is not activated) could reduce filipin signal via increasing lysosomal exocytosis. And with TFEB agonist treatment such as TFEB could further boost this increase.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(16) It would seem appropriate to measure the NPC1 and NPC2 proteins using western blot to ensure that SFN-dependent clearance of cholesterol is not due to enhanced expression of the native protein in U18-treated cells or enhanced folding of the protein in patient fibroblasts.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this constructive comment! Because NPC1 gene mutation takes about 95% of NPC cases and NPC2 mutation takes about 5% of NPC cases. And in this study we focused on NPC1 deficiency cases. Thus, we measured the effect of SFN on the expression of NPC1 in human NPC1-patient fibroblasts. Western blot analysis showed that SFN (15 μM, 24 h) treatment did not affect NPC1 expression in human NPC1-patient fibroblasts (new Fig. S5).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(17) Related to data in Figures 1C-E.

We have supplemented the control- SFN only in new Fig. 1C-E.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(18) The mechanism that links SFN to TFEB-dependent translocation is suggested to involve calcineur independent dephosphorylation of TFEB. However, no data is provided. It would seem important to iden fy the mechanism(s) through which SFN positively regulates TFEB location. This would shift the manuscript and its model from correlations to causation. Experiments involving calcineurin inhibitors, or agonists of TRPML1 that have been reported as being a key source of Ca<sup>2+</sup> for calcineurin activation, may provide molecular insight.</p></disp-quote><p>Please see the paragraph in response to point #1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(19) Related to Figure 4. Using a plasma membrane counterstain to quantify plasma membrane LAMP1 would increase the rigor of the analysis.</p></disp-quote><p>Great idea! We examined the colocalization of DiO (a PM marker) staining and LAMP1 staining in HeLa NPC1 cells under SFN treatment. As shown in new Fig.4A, surface LAMP1 signal(red) colocalized with DiO (green), a PM marker.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(20) Related to Figure 5. How do the authors explain the kinetic disparity between SFN treatment for 24 vs 72 hrs? IF TFEB is activated and promoting lysosomal biogenesis and increased lysosomal flux across the PM, why does cholesterol accumulation lag? Perhaps related to this point. Are other cholesterol metabolizing enzymes that may have altered activity in NPC sensitive to SFN? A similar comment applies to the Sterol regulatory element binding protein pathway, which has been shown to be activated in models of NPC disease.</p></disp-quote><p>We understand the reviewer’s point. As shown in Fig. 5C, D, in NPC1<sup>-/-</sup> MEF cells, SFN treatment for 24 h showed relative weaker cholesterol clearance compared to the effects in human cells (Fig.1C, D, Fig.2.E, I). Thus, we explored a longer treatment of SFN for 72 h (fresh SFN in medium was added every 24 h), and 72h treatment of SFN exhibited substantial cholesterol reduction (Fig. 5C, D). This different effect could be attributed to the continuous action of SFN, which could prolong the exocytosis, leading to more effective cholesterol clearance. As shown in the DMSO-treated MEF cells, the cholesterol levels are similar in both 24 and 72 h, thus 24 h U18666A treatment has reached the upper limit of the accumulated cholesterol, longer treatment me would not change the cholesterol levels. Thus, cholesterol accumulation has no lag.</p><p>We did not investigate whether SFN regulates other cholesterol metabolizing enzymes or sterol regulatory element binding proteins although we cannot rule out this possibility. In this study we mainly focus on the cholesterol clearance effect by SFN via TFEB-mediated pathways. From our data, TFEB KO could significantly diminish SFN-evoked cholesterol clearance. Hence, the effect of other cholesterol metabolizing enzymes or sterol regulatory element binding proteins maybe not as important as TFEB, thus out of scope of this study. In the future, we may explore the involvement of possible other pathways on SFN’s effects.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(21) Related to Figure 7.

Furthermore, we used TFEB knockout cells constructed by CRISPR/Cas9 to further examine the role of TFEB in SFN-induced cholesterol clearance (Fig. 3D). Consistently with the results in the siTFEB-transfected HeLa NPC1 cells (Fig. 3B, C), SFN failed to diminish cholesterol in HeLa TFEB KO cells. The result from TFEB KO cells is even convincing than siRNA experiment. We also performed a functional rescue of re-expressing TFEB in TFEB KO cells, in which SFN-induced cholesterol clearance was restored (Fig. 3E, F). Collectively, these data indicate that TFEB is required for lysosomal cholesterol reduction upon SFN treatment. Thus, we did not repeat this rescue experiment in the siTFEB-transfected HeLa NPC1 cells.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(27) The label for 3D is missing.</p></disp-quote><p>Corrected!
