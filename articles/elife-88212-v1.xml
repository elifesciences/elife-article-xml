The nature of the pools and trafficking between them is not well understood, but pools that are slow to mobilize when synapses are active are often assumed to feed pools that are mobilized more quickly, in a series. However, electrophysiological studies of synaptic transmission have suggested instead a parallel organization where vesicles within slowly and quickly mobilized reserve pools would separately feed independent reluctant- and fast-releasing subdivisions of the readily releasable pool. Here, we use FM-dyes to confirm the existence of multiple reserve pools at hippocampal synapses and a parallel organization that prevents intermixing between the pools, even when stimulation is intense enough to drive exocytosis at the maximum rate. The experiments additionally demonstrate extensive heterogeneity among synapses in the relative sizes of the slowly and quickly mobilized reserve pools, which suggests equivalent heterogeneity in the numbers of reluctant and fast-releasing readily releasable vesicles that may be relevant for understanding information processing and storage.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>synapse</kwd><kwd>synaptic vesicle</kwd><kwd>pool</kwd><kwd>reserve</kwd><kwd>presynaptic</kwd><kwd>readily releasable pool</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003359</institution-id><institution>Generalitat Valenciana</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CIPROM2022/8</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Perez-Otano</surname><given-names>Isabel</given-names></name><name><surname>Wesseling</surname><given-names>John F</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100011033</institution-id><institution>Agencia Estatal de Investigación</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PID2019-111131GB-100</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wesseling</surname><given-names>John F</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100011033</institution-id><institution>Agencia Estatal de Investigación</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BFU2016-80918-R</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wesseling</surname><given-names>John F</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100011033</institution-id><institution>Agencia Estatal de Investigación</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SAF2013-48983R</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Perez-Otano</surname><given-names>Isabel</given-names></name><name><surname>Wesseling</surname><given-names>John F</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Reevaluation of reserve synaptic vesicle pools supports a new model of presynaptic function.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Chemical synapses exhibit striking dynamic changes in connection strength during repetitive use. The changes are termed <italic>short-term plasticity</italic> or <italic>frequency dynamics</italic> and are thought to play an important role in how information is processed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Tsodyks and Markram, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abbott and Regehr, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Buonomano and Maass, 2009</xref>). Multiple presynaptic vesicle trafficking mechanisms are involved, but the identity of the mechanisms, how they interact, and the implications for biological computation are not understood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Neher, 2015</xref>).</p><p>Most attempts at a detailed understanding begin with the premise that vesicles are segregated into multiple <italic>pools</italic>, including at least one readily releasable pool and one reserve pool. Readily releasable vesicles are thought to be docked to <italic>release sites</italic> embedded within the active zone of the plasma membrane of synaptic terminals, whereas reserves reside in the interior. Nevertheless, pools are typically not defined by morphological criteria but instead by the timing of <italic>mobilization</italic>, which is a general term for the full sequence of events that must occur before vesicles undergo exocytosis; for reserve vesicles, mobilization would include docking to release sites, biochemical priming, and catalysis of exocytosis.</p><p>Based on timing criteria, the readily releasable pool has been divided into <italic>fast-</italic> and <italic>slow-releasing</italic> subdivisions at a wide variety of synapse types; slow-releasing readily releasable vesicles are often termed <italic>reluctant</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Wu and Borst, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Sakaba and Neher, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Moulder and Mennerick, 2005</xref>). Reserve pools are less studied, but have likewise been divided into quickly and slowly mobilized pools at some synapse types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Neves and Lagnado, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Rizzoli and Betz, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Denker et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>A widespread premise has been that the pools are connected in a series where vesicles are transferred from slowly to quickly mobilized pools as diagrammed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Pieribone et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hilfiker et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Denker and Rizzoli, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Rothman et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Miki et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Doussau et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Milovanovic et al., 2018</xref>). If so, reluctant vesicles might be docked to the same type of release site as fast-releasing vesicles, but in an immature priming state that could then transition to the mature, fast-releasing state. We refer to models with this premise as <italic>homogeneous release site</italic> models (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lin et al., 2022</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Three possible organizations for synaptic vesicle pools.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The predominant view currently seems to be that all pools are connected in series as depicted; <italic>RRP</italic> signifies readily releasable pool. (<bold>B</bold> and <bold>C</bold>) However, recent evidence indicates that vesicles within reluctant and fast-releasing subdivisions of the RRP can be released in parallel. (<bold>D</bold>) And, a separate line of evidence suggested that each vesicle within any subdivision of the RRP is associated with an autonomous reserve, implying that slowly and quickly mobilized reserves may also be processed in parallel, as depicted in Panel <bold>C</bold>.</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-88212-fig1-v1.tif"/></fig><p>However, a growing body of evidence suggests that reluctant vesicles are not immature but are instead fully primed at release sites that are inherently inefficient at catalyzing exocytosis. First, to our knowledge, none of the homogeneous release site models proposed so far can account for a series of electrophysiological experiments at calyx of Held synapses where: (1) the reluctant subdivision was only minimally depleted during moderate stimulation that exhausted the fast-releasing subdivision; and (2) abruptly increasing the stimulation intensity then drove exocytosis of the remaining reluctant vesicles directly, without first transitioning to a fast-releasing state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Mahfooz et al., 2016</xref> and Figure 5—figure supplement 1 of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Raja et al., 2019</xref>). And second, recent optical imaging and molecular studies have confirmed substantial differences between release sites within the same active zone at a wide variety of synapse types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hu et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Müller et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Böhme et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Akbergenova et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Maschi and Klyachko, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Li et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Karlocai et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gou et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p>To account for the observations, one of the starting premises of our working model is that fast-releasing and reluctant subdivisions of the readily releasable pool operate in parallel, which could be as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> if based solely on the studies referenced so far. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> depicts a different possibility, tested here, where quickly and slowly mobilized reserve pools are likewise arranged in parallel, and independently supply vesicles to corresponding fast-releasing and reluctant subdivisions of the readily releasable pool.</p><p>No such fully parallel arrangement has been proposed previously, at least not explicitly. However, an additional premise of our working model - based on separate studies, not related to distinctions between subdivisions of the readily releasable pool - is that each readily releasable vesicle is physically tethered to a short chain of reserve vesicles, which serve as replacements after the readily releasable vesicle undergoes exocytosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gabriel et al., 2011</xref>; see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Wesseling et al., 2019</xref> for supporting ultrastructural evidence).</p><p>If so, reserve vesicles chained to reluctant readily releasable vesicles would advance to the release site more slowly during continuous stimulation than reserve vesicles chained to fast-releasing vesicles because the reluctant vesicles would undergo exocytosis less frequently. As a direct consequence, reserves chained to reluctant vesicles would be mobilized more slowly and would behave as if constituting a slowly mobilized pool. Reserves chained to fast-releasing vesicles would be mobilized more quickly, and would be processed in parallel. In sum, the combination of two unrelated evidence-based premises of our working model predict the fully parallel arrangement outlined in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>.</p><p>Key for testing this idea: Distinctions between reserve pools would only emerge when the frequency of stimulation is low enough that individual reluctant vesicles remain within the readily releasable pool for extended periods of time before undergoing exocytosis. The reasoning is described in the Results section where needed to explain the design of key experiments.</p><p>Here, we begin by confirming that reserve vesicles at hippocampal synapses are segregated into multiple pools that can be distinguished by the timing of mobilization during low frequency stimulation. We then show that quickly and slowly mobilized reserves do not intermix, even when the frequency of stimulation is high, confirming that the two types are processed in parallel. The result provides a simplifying new constraint on the dynamics of vesicle recycling within presynaptic terminals.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>We originally developed our working model to account for results from both primary cell culture and ex vivo slices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Stevens and Wesseling, 1999b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Garcia-Perez et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gabriel et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Mahfooz et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Raja et al., 2019</xref>). We chose to use cell cultures for testing the prediction that quickly and slowly mobilized reserve pools are processed in parallel because cultures are better suited for staining and destaining synaptic vesicles with FM-dyes, which can be used to distinguish between reserve pools as shown below.</p><p>In a first set of experiments, diagrammed atop <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, we began by staining vesicles within presynaptic terminals with 60 s of 20 Hz electrical stimulation (1200 pulses) during extracellular bath application of FM4-64.

Electrical stimulation was bipolar (0.5 ms at - 30 V then 0.5 ms at + 30 V) via two platinum electrodes built into the chamber. Neurotransmitter receptors were blocked with (in μM): picrotoxin (50); DNQX (10); and DL-APV (50). Other solutes were (in mM): NaCl (118); KCl (2); CaCl<sub>2</sub> (2.6); MgCl<sub>2</sub> (1.3); Glucose (30); and HEPES (25). FM4-64 and FM1-43 were used at 15 μM, and FM2-10 at 100 μM. Advasep-7 and Captisol were purchased from Cydex Pharmaceuticals or graciously provided as samples and used at 1 mM during the destaining phase of FM-dye experiments and throughout experiments using vGlut1-synaptopHluorin.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Processing</title><p>Time lapse images were aligned and Regions of Interest (ROIs) identified automatically as described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Raja et al., 2019</xref> (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>), except for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> where they were detected manually.

However, the original results only specified parameters that are rate-limiting for neurotransmitter release during intense stimulation, and there were a variety of additional parameters - relevant to vesicle trafficking, but not rate-limiting for release - that were relevant to FM-dye destaining, especially during low frequency stimulation.</p><p>The most relevant additional parameters pertained to the release sites and included: (1) the number of types of release sites; (2) the probability with which each type catalyzes exocytosis after single action potentials (i.e., <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf20"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:msub><mml:mi>p</mml:mi><mml:mrow class="MJX-TeXAtom-ORD"><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mi>s</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula> for <italic>probability of release</italic> for the <italic>release site</italic> when occupied by a readily releasable vesicle, which is equivalent to <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf21"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:msub><mml:mi>p</mml:mi><mml:mrow class="MJX-TeXAtom-ORD"><mml:mi>v</mml:mi><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mi>h</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf22"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:msub><mml:mi>p</mml:mi><mml:mrow class="MJX-TeXAtom-ORD"><mml:mi>v</mml:mi><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mi>l</mml:mi><mml:mi>o</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula> in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Mahfooz et al., 2016</xref>, except with the possibility for more than two types of release sites); and, (3) the relative amount of each type.</p><p>In addition, we fixed the number of non-docked tethering units that can exchange with each docked unit at 1, meaning that each release site would process vesicles from two tethering units (8 vesicles). The value was chosen because depletion of the readily releasable pool destained synapses by slightly more than 1/8 (0.15 ± 0.01 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). This implies that a typical synapse with 7 release sites would contain 7X 8 = 56 recycling vesicles, which is in-line with results in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Ryan et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Harata et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Schikorski and Stevens, 2001</xref>.</p><p>Next, for fitting destaining during 20 Hz stimulation, it was necessary to allow &gt; 5-fold facilitation, at least for the release sites with the lowest values for <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf23"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:msub><mml:mi>p</mml:mi><mml:mrow class="MJX-TeXAtom-ORD"><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mi>s</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula>, because otherwise 20 Hz stimulation would not exhaust the readily releasable pool: exhaustion during 20 Hz stimulation is verified experimentally in Figure 2 of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Garcia-Perez et al., 2008</xref>; and &gt; 5-fold facilitation is verified in Figure 2 of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Stevens and Wesseling, 1999a</xref>. We had facilitation increase with a single exponential with rate parameter of 30 action potentials to maintain consistency with Figure 2 of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Stevens and Wesseling, 1999a</xref>, but the precise timing was not a key factor because of the flexibility provided by the three release site parameters.</p><p>Finally, we reasoned that previously docked tethering units would need to have the capacity to re-dock to the same release site. Otherwise: Either a large number of dye-stained vesicles would be trapped within synaptic terminals during long trains of low frequency stimulation; or quickly and slowly mobilized reserves would mix on the time course of minutes. A large number of trapped vesicles is ruled out in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> and elsewhere, and mixing is ruled out in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>, and elsewhere.</p><p>FM-dye destaining curves (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig1">Appendix 1—figure 1</xref>) could be well fit by including as few as two types of release sites, but at least three types were required to match additionally the short-term depression seen in synaptic strength during 20 Hz stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig2">Appendix 1—figure 2</xref>).</p><p>The Matlab code for simulating the model for a single release site was:</p><p><code xml:space="preserve">function [DestainTimeCourse, SynapticStrengthTimeCourse] = ...

We do not see how this inevitably leaves viable alternative interpretations, but the concern is difficult to evaluate without knowing what the alternatives might be. That is, to our knowledge, the reviewers did not delineate any specific alternatives that are consistent with the full set of results. We can say that the FM-dye technique has been thought to have good resolution at the level of distinguishing between individual synapses since at least Murthy et al. (2001). For our part, we are confident that our analysis in Figure 3 combined with the results in Figures 4-11 shows that many individual presynaptic terminals contain multiple reserve pools that are processed in parallel. We did not use electron microscopy to confirm that all of the punctae analyzed in Figure 3 were indeed single synapses, but the reviewers did not recommend this, and we believe there is already enough published about the spatial distribution of synapses in cell culture to be confident that many of the punctae that are smaller than 1.5 µm were indeed individuals.</p><p>Overall, we have attempted to address all of the individual concerns raised by reviewers, and these concerns and our responses are below. Our understanding is that the reviewers were not convinced on every point, but the nature of the concerns was not clear to us.

In fact, we chose the image in Figure 3 for an example in part because of the lower left region replicated in Figure 3-figure supplement 2 demonstrating extensive heterogeneity along what appears to be a single axon. We are not the first to notice the heterogeneity (see Waters and Smith, 2002), but we do provide a new possible explanation which, if correct, might be important for understanding biological computation (see our Discussion). At the same time, we believe that our evidence for multiple reserve pools with heterogenous properties within individual synapses is compelling. We see no contradiction, and indeed, our conclusion that the ratio of slowly to quickly mobilized varies extensively between synapses can only be correct if individual synapses contain multiple types. We hope that people who are interested in our conclusions will evaluate the evidence and reasoning presented in our report.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Bulk imaging of FM de-staining does not really measure the fraction of non-stained vesicles, which changes dynamically during stimulation, so that the situation calls for an independent readout of stained and non-stained vesicles.

This scenario is consistent with the results in Figures 2 and 4-7, and initially seems plausible because previous studies have shown that many vesicles are not mobilized, and therefore are not stained, during our standard loading protocol of 100 s at 20 Hz (Harata et al., 2001). However, liberation of this &quot;deep reserve&quot; as an explanation for the decrease in fractional destaining is not compatible with the results in Figures 10-11 that rule out mixing. For example, liberation of the deep reserve would cause fractional destaining to appear equally depressed during subsequent 20 Hz stimulation, and Figure 10 shows that this is not the case. The scenario cannot be rescued by postulating that the subsequent 20 Hz stimulation caused the deep reserve to quickly recapture the liberated vesicles because Figure 11D-E shows that fractional de-staining continues to be depressed at the very beginning of a second 1 Hz train that follows the 20 Hz stimulation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) The authors’ latest round of responses did not alleviate most of my major previous concerns.

Our criteria for accepting experiments for further analysis was ≤ 1.5 % spontaneous rundown/minute. This is a better way to judge health than we have seen elsewhere because it eliminates subjective decisions, and would be equally applicable for microscopes and imaging software of any quality. For our part, we used a 25X objective with a low numerical aperture and low intensity illumination that allowed us to completely avoid photobleaching. The images will look worse to some compared to when acquired with a higher quality microscope, but the absence of photobleaching is an important benefit because it allowed us to avoid complicated corrections.</p><p>(2) Stained areas larger than 1.5 µm across - such as the ones noted by the reviewer - were expressly excluded from our study because they could have been clusters of multiple synapses. The size criteria are detailed in the Legend of Figure 3. Punctae and larger areas that were excluded are the ones that are not occluded by yellow squares in the 2nd image from the left in the &quot;Author resonse image 1&quot;, above; at least two of the largest were likely clusters of synapses that were out of focus. Nevertheless, despite being excluded, it is unlikely that the stained areas larger than 1.5 µm in the image in Figure 3 were characteristic of unhealthy synapses because these areas did not de-stain spontaneously, but instead de-stained in response to 1 and 20 Hz electrical stimulation much like the small punctae that were included in the analysis.</p><p>(3) Electron microscopy results have shown that individual synapses vary &gt;10-fold in size, so a large range of brightness is expected (Murthy et al., 2001). The large range would either make the brighter punctae and clusters appear to be overexposed in a printed image, or render the dimmer punctae invisible. We have opted to present an image with overall brightness adjusted so that the dimmest punctae are visible. This is appropriate because one of the concerns was that analyzing the dimmest punctae would reveal underlying populations where the rate of fractional destaining was constant. In the end, no evidence for underlying populations emerged, which supports the conclusion that the decreases in fractional destaining occur at individual synapses. Note that adjusting brightness for example images was unavoidable; we used the camera in a range that was far below saturation and, because of this, images presented without adjusting brightness would appear to be completely black.</p><p>(4) Primary cell cultures are non-physiological by definition, so the concept of health is intrinsically arbitrary, and relevance to synapses in brains is questioned routinely (quite reasonably, in our opinion). However, the new findings in the present report are that: (1) individual hippocampal synapses contain multiple reserve pools; (2) the reserves remain separate but are not distinguishable by the timing of mobilization when the frequency of stimulation is high; and (3) the reserves are nevertheless processed in parallel even when the frequency of stimulation is high. Of these, finding (1) has been reported previously for other synapse types, but findings (2) and (3) are both without precedent, and finding (3) is not compatible with current concepts. Nevertheless, all three findings were predicted by a model that was developed to explain orthogonal results from studies of intact synapses in ex vivo slices that did not fit with current concepts either, as referenced in the Introduction. Because of this, we think that the parallel processing of quickly and slowly mobilized reserve vesicles likely occurs in individual Schaffer collateral presynaptic terminals in vivo, and is not a cell culture artifact; the alternative would be too much of an unlikely coincidence.</p><p>References</p><p>Harata N, Pyle JL, Aravanis AM, Mozhayeva M, Kavalali ET &amp; Tsien RW (2001).

The major finding is that the FM destaining time course deviates from a mono-exponential function during 1 Hz, but not 20 Hz stimulation. The deviation from a mono-exponential function was also seen during a second stimulus train applied after recovery periods of several minutes, or after depletion of the readily-releasable vesicle pool. Furthermore, this &quot;decreased fractional destaining&quot; was unlikely due to long-term synaptic depression, or incomplete dye clearance. Fractional destaining was enhanced when the dye was loaded with 1 Hz compared with 20 Hz stimulation, suggesting that vesicles recycled during 1 Hz stimulation are predominantly sorted into a rapidly mobilized pool. Finally, they show that20 Hz stimulation does not affect the decrease in fractional destaining induced and recorded during 1 Hz stimulation. Based on these observations, they put forward a model in which slowly and quickly resupplied synaptic vesicles are mobilized in parallel.</p></disp-quote><p>The demonstration that FM destaining time courses deviate from single exponentials during 1 Hz stimulation (Figs 2-3) is a starting point used to rule out simple models where vesicles intermix freely and to introduce a mathematical technique for quantifying the extent of the deviations that is essential for the analysis of later experiments, where curve fitting could not be used. We then:</p><p>1. show that the deviation from simple models is not caused by depletion of the readily releasable pool, as noted by the reviewer;</p><p>2. rule out a number of explanations for the deviation that do not involve reserve pools at all, again as noted;</p><p>3. provide affirmative evidence for the presence of multiple reserve pools by labeling them with distinct colors;</p><p>4. show that the vesicles within the distinct reserve pools do not intermix even when activity is intense enough to drive destaining with single exponential kinetics.</p><p>We believe that the 4th point - documented in Figs 10-11 - is a key element.</p><p>Beyond that, we note that our working model arose from previous studies, as referenced in the Introduction, not from the present results. The model did predict the parallel processing of quickly and slowly mobilized reserves, and the present study was designed to test this prediction. In that sense, the evidence in the current study supports our working model, not the other way around.</p><p>In any case, most readers in the near term will be more interested in the serial versus parallel question, and less in precisely what the present results mean for evaluating our working model. Because of this, we emphasize that evidence for parallel processing of separate reserve pools depends solely on experimental results within the study, and not on modeling. As a consequence, the evidence will continue to be equally strong even if problems with our working model arise later on (lines 382-386).</p><p>We do have additional unpublished evidence for the working model that does not bear directly on the parallel versus serial question. Some of this was removed from an earlier version of the manuscript and some has been newly gathered since the original submission. We will publish the additional evidence at a later point. We decided not to include it in the present manuscript expressly to avoid confusion about the relationship between modeling and the evidence for parallel processing in general.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The paper addresses an interesting question - the relationship between the resupply and release of synaptic vesicles. The study is based on a lot of data of high quality. Most data are solid. However, some of the major conclusions are not well supported by the data. Moreover, it remains unclear how speci1c the findings are to the experimental design.</p><p>The following points should be addressed:</p><p>1. Most traces display a decrease in fluorescence intensity before stimulation. Data with a decrease in baseline fluorescence intensity of up to 1.5 % were considered for the analysis (Fig 2-supplement 2). I may have missed it, but were the data corrected for the observed decrease in baseline fluorescence intensity? (In the model shown in Appendix 1 Figure 1, they correct for &quot;rundown&quot;). For instance, are the residuals shown in Fig 2D, E based on corrected data? In case the data would not be corrected for a decrease in baseline fluorescence, would the decay kinetics also deviate from a single exponential after correction?</p></disp-quote><p>We did not correct for rundown - as now noted on lines 96-97 - except in the figure in the Appendix, noted by the reviewer, where the uncorrected and corrected time courses are plotted side by side for easy comparison. However, our study includes an analysis showing that correcting for rundown during 1 Hz stimulation would increase - not decrease - the deviation from a single exponential (2 bars in rightmost panel in Fig 2C, and lines 113-116 of Results), so the absence of a correction does not weaken our conclusions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. The analysis of &quot;fractional destaining&quot; is not clear to me. How many intervals of which length were chosen and why? For instance, the intervals often differ in length, number and do not cover the complete decay (e.g., Fig 2B).</p></disp-quote><p>We calculated fractional destaining from longer intervals at later times because the overall amount of stain was less, meaning signal/noise was less, and scatter was more. We did this because increased scatter at later times could be counteracted by estimating the slope of destaining from longer intervals. An additional benefit is that elongating the later intervals allowed us to plot only 6 bars for 25 min of 1 Hz destaining, which works better visually than 17.</p><p>Increasing the interval length for later times is mathematically sound because the key factor causing distortions related to deviations from linearity is not the length of the interval per se but, instead, the fractional destaining over the interval. The fractional destaining is greater at the start of 1Hz stimulation, thus requiring shorter intervals.</p><p>It would be possible to choose inappropriately long intervals that would distort estimates of the change in fractional destaining. However, we now include Fig 2-supplement 5 – which includes all 17 1.5 min intervals - to confirm that any distortions after the first interval were minimal. The Appendix predicts a biologically important distortion for the first interval, which would be buried in the noise - we are following this up - but this would underestimate the true deviation from quickly mixing pools, so would not be problematic for the present conclusions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Sometimes, only the interval right after stimulation onset was considered (e.g., Fig 7, 8).</p></disp-quote><p>Figs 7, 8 in the previous version are now Figs 8, 9.</p><p>This is appropriate because the goal was to estimate the fractional destaining at the very start, before the quickly mobilized fraction has destained.</p><p>How quickly fractional destaining is expected to revert to the lowest value seen after 15 min of 1Hz stimulation in Fig 2 (and elsewhere) depends very much on assumptions - such as the number of reserve pools, etc. We sought to avoid this kind of additional analysis because we are keen to avoid the impression that our main conclusions depend on the specifics of modeling.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>How sensitive are the changes in fractional destaining to the choice of the intervals?</p></disp-quote><p>Minimally. This can be seen by eye because the magenta lines in Fig 2B fit the data well, but see Fig 2-supplement 5 for a quantitative comparison.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>For instance, would fractional destaining be increased if later intervals would have been chosen for the second 20 Hz stimulus in the experiment shown in Fig 9B?</p></disp-quote><p>Previous Fig 9B is now Fig 10B.</p><p>We cannot be certain, but think it probably would not be different. Neither an increase nor a decrease would be problematic for our conclusions.</p><p>More detail: There is not enough data to evaluate this specifically for Fig 10B because the total amount of stain remaining at later intervals is little, meaning signal/noise is low, which causes extensive experimental scatter. However, synapses were even more extensively destained prior to time course c of Figure2-supplement 2C, which nevertheless matches time courses a, b, and d.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>I propose fitting all baseline-corrected data with a single and a double-exponential function (as well as single exponential plus line?) and reporting the corresponding time constants (slopes) and amplitudes.</p></disp-quote><p>As noted above, we purposefully do not baseline correct data in a way that would make this possible. However, we do include exponential fits when appropriate, in Fig 2D-E, Fig 2- supplement 1, Fig 2-supplement-7, Fig 2-supplement-8, and Fig 12B.</p><p>Indeed, the absence of any change in the weighting parameter despite substantial changes for both time constants seen after raising the temperature to 35C (Fig 2-supplement-8 vs Fig 12B) is notable because it suggests that the contents of the reserve pools are not altered by changing temperature, even though vesicle trafficking is accelerated. Fig 2-figure supplement 8 is a supplementary figure because the result is outside the scope of the main point, not because the quality is lower than for other figures.</p><p>Beyond that, exponential fits would not be adequate for most of the study because many experiments - including the core experiments in Figs 10-11 - require discontinuous stimulation, such as when we stop stimulating at 1 Hz, rest for minutes, and then start up again at 1 or 20 Hz. And, although widely used, exponentials are non-linear equations after all. Even when they can be used to quantify time courses, the fractional destaining measurement is almost always more informative, in the technical sense, because it avoids complications when estimating the importance of deviations occurring at the two extremes versus deviations in the middle of the time course.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. Along the same lines, is the average slow time constant indeed around 40 min? (Are the data shown in Fig 2 S7 based on an average?) If this would be the case, I suggest conducting a control experiment with a recording time &gt; 40 min. Would fitting an exponential or a line to baseline data (without stimulation) also give a similar slow component?</p></disp-quote><p>Fig 2-figure supplement 7 in the previous version is now Fig 2-figure supplement 8.</p><p>First, yes, the time course shown in Fig 2-figure supplement 8 is the mean across preparations. The time courses of the individual preparations were quanti1ed as the median value of the individual ROIs before averaging.</p><p>Second, no, fitting baseline data would give an approximately 3-fold greater time constant (i.e., 120 min) because fractional destaining decreases by about 3-fold when we stop stimulating after 25 min of 1 Hz stimulation (i.e., Fig 2C, 3B, and many others).</p><p>The key point is that fractional destaining decreases greatly over long trains of 1 Hz stimulation.</p><p>For Fig 2, we saw a 2.7+/-0.1-fold decrease before accounting for baseline destaining (lines 106-110), which increased to a 4.4-fold decrease when we did account for baseline destaining (lines 113-116). Overall, the 2.7-fold value is simultaneously a safe minimum boundary, and much greater than the value of 1.0 expected from models where vesicles mix freely.</p><p>Note that future studies will show that even the 4.4-fold value is probably an underestimate because 1 Hz stimulation misses a fast component at the very beginning of the time courses, as predicted in the Appendix.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. How speci1c are the findings to 1 Hz (and 20 Hz) stimulation? From which frequency onward can a decrease in fractional destaining be no longer observed?</p></disp-quote><p>Our logic depends only on the premise that we are able to find some frequency where fractional destaining no longer decreases. We knew that 20 Hz was a good place to start because of previous electrophysiological experiments - frequency jumps (Fig 1 of Wesseling and Lo, 2002 and Fig 2C of Garcia-Perez and Wesseling, 2008), and trains of action potentials followed by osmotic shocks (Fig 2A of Garcia-Perez et al., 2008) - showing that 20 Hz stimulation is enough to nearly completely exhaust the readily releasable pool. This is noted in lines 202-203, and Box 2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>would previous stimulation with frequencies &lt;20 Hz interfere with fractional destaining? These control experiments would help assessing how general/speci1c the findings are.</p></disp-quote><p>Yes (Figs 4 and 11A at 1 Hz). Also, we have done experiments at 0.1 Hz, which will be published later; some of these were actually removed from an earlier version of the manuscript because the results are primarily relevant to deciding between particular parallel models, and are not relevant to the conclusion of the present study that quickly and slowly mobilized reserves are processed in parallel.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Similarly, a major conclusion of the paper - the parallel mobilization of two vesicle pools - is largely based on these two stimulation frequencies. Can they exclude that mixing between the two pools occurs at other frequencies?</p></disp-quote><p>We cannot exclude the possibility of breakdown at a higher frequency, but this would not undercut our conclusions. We do not have plans to try this experiment because: (1) a positive result would be open to concerns about non-physiologically heavy stimulation; and (2) a negative result would be difficult to interpret because of the possibility that the axons cannot follow at higher frequencies.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1.

The major strength of the study is the use of a quantitative model, which can be readily testable by experiments: in the course of the study, the authors propose the best vesicle pool model, which fits the experimental data &quot;averaged over synapses&quot; nicely. On the other hand, the weak point of the study comes from the optical method and the data: bulk imaging of vesicle dynamics monitored at each synapse is noisy and the signals vary considerably among synapses. Therefore, the average signals over many synapses may not reflect the vesicle dynamics of two reserve pools within a synapse, but something else, such as the different kinetics of release from multiple synapses with different release probability. Nevertheless, a new framework of two reserve pools offers a testable hypothesis of vesicle dynamics, and the use of single vesicle tracking and EM may allow one to give a de1nitive answer in the future studies Therefore, the study may be of interest to the community of synaptic neurobiology.</p></disp-quote><p>1. The current version includes a new figure (Fig 3) showing that the deviations from single pool models seen in populations are caused by deviations occurring at the level of single synapses. The heterogeneity between synapses actually causes population statistics to underestimate - not overestimate - the mean and median size of the deviations at individuals.</p><p>We think the new evidence in Fig 3 and supplements is conclusive without follow-on EM of the same punctae, given the substantial body of already published EM on similar cultures. Essentially, the only way to explain the results without invoking multiple reserve pools in individual synapses would be to say that individual synapses ALWAYS come in clumps containing multiple types and are NEVER separated from neighbors by more than 1.5 microns - even when the clumps are separated from each other by 5 microns. There is already clear evidence against this.</p><p>1. No new model is proposed here, see the first response to the first reviewer.</p><p>2. We are not aware of alternative hypotheses that could account for our results, so cannot evaluate if single vesicle tracking and EM could add meaningful additional support.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. The existence of non-stained vesicles complicates the interpretation of the data. Because the release by 20 Hz and 1 Hz stimulation do not entirely reflect the release from fast and slow vesicle pools. the estimation of non-stained vesicles using synaptopHluorin (+ba1lomycin) and EPSCs would be helpful to examine fraction of non-stained / stained vesicles over time (with stimulation, the ratio may change dynamically, which may bring complications).</p></disp-quote><p>Non-stained vesicles are not a complication, but instead a key element of our logic which is included in the diagrams in Boxes 1 and 2 and Figure 9. That is, quickly and slowly mobilized reserves can be distinguished at 1 Hz precisely because 1 Hz is not intense enough to exhaust the readily releasable pool (Box 2). The corollary is that stained vesicles must be replaced by non-stained vesicles, because otherwise 1 Hz stimulation would exhaust the readily releasable pool. And this is why FM-dyes (plus a beta-cyclodextrin during washing) are ideal for the current questions whereas other techniques, such as electrophysiology or synaptopHluorin imaging are obviously indispensable for other questions, but could not replace the FM-dyes in the current study. This is now noted on lines 86-89.</p><p>We are aware that synaptopHluorin + bafilomycin could, in principle, accomplish some of the same goals. However, bafilomycin ended up being toxic when applied for tens of minutes, as it would have to be in our experiments. And, we do not see what critical question is not already answered with strong evidence using FM dyes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. Individual synapses show marked differences in the time course of de-staining, suggesting differences in release probability. The averaging of the whole data may reflect &quot;average&quot; behavior of synapses, but for example, bi-exponential time course may reflect high Pr and low Pr synapses, rather than vesicle recruitment.</p></disp-quote><p>The authors may comment on this issue.</p><p>See newly added Fig 3, and responses above.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. Some differences are very small (Fig 10, the same amplitude as bleaching time course), and I am not certain if the observed differences are meaningful, given low signal to noise ratio in each synapse.</p></disp-quote><p>Fig 10 in the previous version is Fig 11 in the current version.</p><p>Even if correct, this would not be problematic because 20 Hz stimulation clearly did not cause fractional destaining to return to the initial value when stimulation was resumed at 1 Hz (compare d and f in Fig 11E). In any case, Figs 2C, 3B, 5B, 7B, and Fig 10-supplement 2A all show that the minimum fractional destaining value during 1 Hz stimulation is about 3-fold greater than during subsequent rest intervals, which is not a small difference. Also, note that Fig 2-supplement 3 shows that photobleaching likely did not play a role.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer 3</bold></p><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations For The Authors):</p><p>This study attempts to conceptualize the long-standing question of vesicle pool organization in presynaptic terminals. Authors used classical FM dye release experiments to support a hypothesis that rapidly and slowly releasing vesicles are mobilized in parallel without intermixing. This modular model is also supported indirectly by the authors’ recent findings of molecular links that connect a subset of vesicles in linear chains (published elsewhere).</p></disp-quote><p>Our study should be seen as a test of the hypothesis that quickly and slowly mobilized reserves are processed in parallel. The evidence is independent of any modeling, and would continue to be equally strong if our working model turns out to be incorrect (lines 382-386).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The scope of the original model was limited by a number of caveats. The main concerns included a limited data set measured in bulk from a highly heterogeneous synapse population, and a complex interrelationship between vesicle mobilization and the bulk FM dye de-staining kinetics. The second major limitation was measurements being performed at room temperature, which inhibits or alters a number of critical synaptic processes that are being modeled. This includes the efficiency of exo/endocytosis coupling, vesicle mobility and release site refractory period, which are stimulus- and temperature-dependent, but were not accounted for in the original model.</p></disp-quote><p>The present study contains experiments at body temperature (Fig 12 and Fig 12-supplement 1 in the current version) and analyses of individual synapses (especially Fig 3 in the current version). To our knowledge all results are consistent with everything that is known about the efficiency of exo/endocytosis coupling, vesicle mobility and release site refractory periods.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors made strong efforts to address previous concerns. However, the main conceptual point, i.e. linking the bulk FM dye de-staining kinetics with precise arrangement of vesicle pools, is not well supported and is generally highly problematic because it ignores many additional processes and confounding factors.</p><p>For example, vesicle exchange between neighboring synapses constitutes from 15% to over 50% of total recycling vesicle population, and therefore is a major contributing factor to FM dye loss/redistribution, but is not considered in this study. Additionally, this vesicle exchange process undergoes calcium/activity-dependent changes, contributing to difficulty in interpreting the current experiments comparing FM de-staining at different stimulation frequencies.</p></disp-quote><p>We do not see how exchange of vesicles between synapses could be a problem for our logic, so cannot evaluate this without a more detailed description of the concern. Instead, our results rule out random inter-synaptic exchange between quickly and slowly mobilized reserve pools because this would show up in our assays as mixing, which does not occur. We think there are three remaining possibilities:</p><p>1. vesicles are exchanged primarily between quickly mobilized reserve pools</p><p>2. vesicles are exchanged primarily between slowly mobilized reserve pools</p><p>3. vesicles in quickly mobilized reserve pools are targeted to quickly mobilized reserve pools in other synapses and vesicles in slowly mobilized reserve pools are targeted to slowly mobilized reserve pools in other synapses.</p><p>It would be interesting to know which of these is correct, but this is outside the scope of thecurrent study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Moreover, other forms of release, such as asynchronous release, contribute a large fraction of released vesicles, but are not factored in. Asynchronous release varies widely in synapse population from 0.1 to &gt;0.4 of synchronous release, but is entirely ignored. Spontaneous release may also contribute to FM dye loss over extended 25min recordings used.</p></disp-quote><p>Spontaneous release and asynchronous release are not caveats.</p><p>First, spontaneous: We suspect that spontaneous release contributes to the background destaining rate, but this is 3-fold slower than the minimum during 1 Hz stimulation on average (Figs 2C, 3C, 5B etc), so we know that the slowly mobilized reserve is mobilized by low frequency trains of action potentials (lines 410-412). Note that a different outcome - where the rate of destaining decreased to a very low level during long trains of 1 Hz stimulation - would not have been consistent with the idea that slowly mobilized vesicles are only released spontaneously because the remaining fluorescence can always be destained rapidly by increasing the stimulation intensity to 20 Hz (e.g., see examples in Fig 3).</p><p>Second, asynchronous: We know that slowly mobilized reserves must be released synchronously at 35C because the asynchronous component is eliminated at this temperature (Huson et al., 2019), without altering the quantity of slowly mobilized reserves that are mobilized by 1 Hz stimulation (lines 350-360 of Results, and 445-452 of Discussion; we can confirm from our own unpublished experiments that the disappearance of asynchronous release at 35C is a robust phenomenon in these cell cultures). Asynchronous release of slowly mobilized vesicles might occur at room temperature, but this would not argue against the conclusion that slowly mobilized vesicles are processed in parallel with quickly mobilized.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Speci1c comments:</p><p>Points 1-4 are already addressed above.</p><p>1. The notion of the chained vesicles is somewhat confusing: how does the &quot;first&quot; vesicle located at the plasma membrane/release site get released if it is attached to the chain? Wouldn’t this &quot;first&quot; vesicle be non-immediately releasable since it must first be liberated? Since all vesicles shown in the Figure 1 have chains attached to them, what vesicle population then give rise to sub-millisecond release?</p></disp-quote><p>This is not a concern that is relevant to the present study because none of the conclusions rely on the model in any way (see Introduction, and lines 382-386 of the Discussion). Beyond that: We previously published clear evidence that docked vesicles are tethered to non-docked vesicles (Figure 8 of Wesseling et al., 2019). We see no reason to suspect that a tether to an internal vesicle would prevent the docked vesicle from priming for release.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. Model: For fitting de-staining during 20 Hz stimulation, authors state that it was necessary to allow &gt;5-fold Facilitation. This seems to be non-physiologically relevant, since previous studies found only very mild facilitation at room temperature (typically below a factor of 1.5-2.0) and the authors themselves state that, at most, a 1.3 fold facilitation was found.</p></disp-quote><p>If the 1.3-fold facilitation estimate comes from us, it must have been in a different context.</p><p>Most estimates of facilitation that are published are heavily convolved with simultaneous depression, and there is additionally a saturation mechanism for readily releasable vesicles with high release probability that is not widely known (Garcia-Perez and Wesseling, 2008). The standard method for eliminating the depression is to lower the probability of release by lowering extracellular [Ca2+], which additionally relieves occlusion by the saturation mechanism. And, lowering [Ca2+] uncovers an enormous amount facilitation at synapses in hippocampal cell culture. For example, see Figure 2B of Stevens and Wesseling (1999), which shows a 7-fold enhancement during 9 Hz stimulation, and Figure 3 of the same study, which shows a linear relationship with frequency. Taken together these two results suggest 15-fold enhancement during 20 Hz stimulation, which far exceeds the 5-fold value needed at inefficient release sites to make our working model 1t the FM-dye destaining results.</p><p>References</p><p>Garcia-Perez E, Lo DC &amp; Wesseling JF (2008).
