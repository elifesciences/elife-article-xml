PTBP2 was found to maintain embryonic splicing patterns of many synaptic and cytoskeletal proteins during differentiation of neuronal progenitor cells (NPCs) into early neurons. However, the role of the earlier PTBP1 program in embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and NPCs was not clear. We show that PTBP1 controls a program of neuronal gene expression that includes the transcription factor Pbx1. We identify exons specifically regulated by PTBP1 and not PTBP2 as mouse ESCs differentiate into NPCs. We find that PTBP1 represses Pbx1 exon 7 and the expression of the neuronal Pbx1a isoform in ESCs. Using CRISPR-Cas9 to delete regulatory elements for exon 7, we induce Pbx1a expression in ESCs, finding that this activates transcription of neuronal genes. Thus, PTBP1 controls the activity of Pbx1 to suppress its neuronal transcriptional program prior to induction of NPC development.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.09268.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.09268.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.09268.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>The neurons that transmit information around the nervous system develop in several stages. Embryonic stem cells specialize to form neuronal progenitor cells, which then develop into neurons. These cell types have different characteristics, in part because they make different proteins or different versions of the same proteins.</p><p>To make a protein, the DNA sequence of a gene is used to build a molecule of ribonucleic acid (RNA) that acts as a template for the protein. However, not all of this sequence codes for the protein. The non-coding regions must be removed from the RNA, and the remaining “exons” joined together to form the final “mRNA” template. Not all of the exons are necessarily included in the final mRNA molecule. By joining together different combinations of exons, several different versions of a protein can be produced from a single gene. This process is known as alternative splicing.</p><p>One way that alternative splicing is controlled is through proteins that bind to RNA and determine which exons are included or excluded from the final mRNA molecule. PTBP1 is an RNA-binding protein that controls alternative splicing in embryonic stem cells and neuronal progenitor cells. Embryonic stem cells have the ability to develop into all the cells of the body. In contrast, neuronal progenitor cells are restricted in their development and only give rise to specialized cells of the nervous system. The role of PTBP1 in these properties was not clear.</p><p>Linares et al. have now used a range of techniques to study the RNA molecules produced in these two cell types and how these RNAs change when PTBP1 is removed. This identified many RNAs whose splicing is regulated by PTBP1, including mRNAs of the gene that produces a protein called Pbx1, which is an important regulator of neuronal development.</p><p>Further investigation revealed that PTBP1 prevents a particular exon being included in the mRNA template for Pbx1. This creates an embryonic stem cell form of Pbx1 that does not affect neuronal genes. Removal of PTBP1 allows splicing of the Pbx1 exon and produces a version of Pbx1 that is found in neuronal progenitor cells and which turns on neuronal genes. Thus, through its action on Pbx1, one role of PTBP1 is to enable stem cells to maintain their non-neuronal properties and prevent their premature development into neuronal progenitor cells.</p><p>The gene for Pbx1 is only one of many genes controlled by PTBP1 at the level of splicing. One challenge for the future will be to understand how these genes work together in a common program that determines the properties of stem cells. Another question regards how the different Pbx1 proteins in stem cells and in neuronal progenitors can exert different effects in the cells where they are made.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.09268.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.09268.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>alternative splicing</kwd><kwd>RNA binding protein</kwd><kwd>embryonic stem cells</kwd><kwd>posttranscriptional regulation</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Black</surname><given-names>Douglas L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 GM49662</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Black</surname><given-names>Douglas L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NS072804</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Novitch</surname><given-names>Bennett G</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>California Institute for Regenerative Medicine</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RB1-01367; RB2-01502</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Novitch</surname><given-names>Bennett G</given-names></name><name><surname>Black</surname><given-names>Douglas L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>UCLA Broad Center for Regenerative Medicine and Stem Cell Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Novitch</surname><given-names>Bennett G</given-names></name><name><surname>Black</surname><given-names>Douglas L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM00785</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Adams</surname><given-names>Katrina L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NS048004</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Linares</surname><given-names>Anthony J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-8"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NS07449</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Linares</surname><given-names>Anthony J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The RNA binding protein PTBP1 controls an extensive program of alternative splicing in embryonic stem cells, one function of which is to repress neuronal transcriptional programs.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Alternative splicing is an important form of gene regulation during tissue development. In the mammalian nervous system, large scale changes in splice site choice produce many new mRNAs encoding protein isoforms with different structures and functions that are specific to neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Li et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Licatalosi and Darnell, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Norris and Calarco, 2012a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Raj and Blencowe, 2015a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Yap and Makeyev, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Zheng and Black, 2013</xref>). These splicing patterns are regulated in a temporal and cell-specific manner by the expression of specialized pre-mRNA binding proteins (RBPs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Black, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Braunschweig et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fu and Ares, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lee and Rio, 2015</xref>). Several RBPs have been shown to control the expression of isoforms essential for neuronal development and maturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Charizanis et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gehman et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gehman et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Li et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Licatalosi et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Yano et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Jensen et al., 2000a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Iijima et al., 2011a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Ince-Dunn et al., 2012b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Quesnel-Vallières et al., 2015b</xref>). However, the complex programs of splicing affecting neuronal development are only beginning to be characterized, and the cellular functions of the regulated isoforms are often poorly understood.</p><p>The polypyrimidine tract binding (PTB) proteins, PTBP1 and PTBP2, regulate a large set of splicing events during neuronal differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Keppetipola et al., 2012</xref>). PTBP1 is expressed in neuronal progenitor cells and many non-neuronal cells. Upon neuronal differentiation, PTBP1 expression is repressed allowing the induction of PTBP2 and the initiation of a neuronal splicing program that is essential for neuronal maturation and survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Boutz et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Li et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Licatalosi et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Makeyev et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Tang et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Zheng et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gueroussov et al., 2015c</xref>). In addition to splicing, the PTB proteins affect other aspects of posttranscriptional regulation in neurons, including miRNA targeting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Xue et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Yap et al., 2012</xref>). It has been shown that depletion of PTBP1 from fibroblasts is sufficient to drive cells towards a neuronal phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Xue et al., 2013</xref>). As neurons mature, PTBP2 expression is eventually reduced, giving rise to an adult neuronal splicing program (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Li et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Licatalosi et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Tang et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Zheng et al., 2012</xref>). Together, these transitions in PTBP1 and PTBP2 expression define three phases of neuronal maturation each with different splicing programs.</p><p>PTBP1 and PTBP2 are encoded on separate genes and have very similar sequences and RNA-binding properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Markovtsov et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Oberstrass et al., 2005</xref>). These proteins target overlapping but not identical sets of splicing events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Boutz et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Li et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Llorian et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Tang et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Zheng et al., 2012</xref>). Some exons are responsive to both proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Boutz et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Li et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Spellman et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Zheng et al., 2012</xref>). In these cases, PTBP1 and PTBP2 serve to repress adult splicing patterns during neuronal maturation, yielding isoforms that are expressed only after PTBP2 levels have declined. In other cases, exons are more sensitive to PTBP1 and shift their splicing when PTBP1 is shut off early in neuronal differentiation even though PTBP2 is present (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Boutz et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Makeyev et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Markovtsov et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Tang et al., 2011</xref>). PTBP1 is known to regulate splicing in a wide variety of cell-types, and much of the work on PTBP1 targeting has used non-neuronal cell lines such as HeLa cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Llorian et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Spellman et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Xue et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Xue et al., 2013</xref>). The role of the PTBP1-specific splicing program in early progression along the lineage to neuronal progenitor cells has not been examined.</p><p>Directed differentiation of embryonic stem cells (ESCs) provides a versatile model for the study of neuronal commitment, differentiation, and maturation. These systems have illuminated a wide range of genetic contributors to neuronal phenotype including epigenetic modifiers, transcription factors, miRNAs, and signaling molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Temple, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Louvi and Artavanis-Tsakonas, 2006a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kosik, 2006b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hirabayashi and Gotoh, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Ronan et al., 2013a</xref>). Here we use mouse ESC culture to characterize the PTBP1 splicing program during early neuronal differentiation. We identify a diverse set of splicing events regulated by PTBP1, including an alternative exon in the homeodomain transcription factor Pbx1, whose switch in splicing induces a neuronal transcriptional program early in neuronal development.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>The transition in PTB protein expression occurs during in vitro neuronal differentiation</title><p>To examine PTBP1 and PTBP2 expression in anin vitro model of neuronal development, we differentiated mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs) into motor neurons (MNs).

By immunofluorescence, Day 2 MNs express the progenitor marker Nestin, whereas Day 5 GFP+ cells express the postmitotic MN marker HB9 and the neuronal marker TuJ1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A and B</xref>, and data not shown). The presence of PTBP2 in GFP+ cells was also seen by immunofluorescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). To monitor PTBP1 and PTBP2 protein specifically in the differentiated neurons, we used fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) to isolate GFP+ cells at Days 5 and 8. By western blot, these GFP positive cells express low amounts of PTBP1 and high levels of PTBP2 at Day 5. At Day 8 only trace amounts of PTBP1 are found, while PTBP2 expression remains high (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>). We did not observe the late decline in PTBP2 expression that occurs during neuronal maturationin vivo. This decline in PTBP2 expression may take place with longer culture times, or cells may not fully mature in this system. These results show that the switch from PTBP1 to PTBP2 expression occurs during MN differentiation, similar to earlier observations in the developing cortex.</p><p>We previously observed high levels of PTBP1 and low levels of PTBP2 in neuronal progenitor cells (NPCs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Boutz et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Li et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Licatalosi et al., 2012</xref>). Nestin+ NPCs are observed early in EB cultures, but these cells could not be isolated in pure populations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). To examine NPCs in more detail, ESCs were grown in N2B27 media and expanded in the presence of EGF and FGF, to yield cultures where greater than 80% of the cells were Nestin+ and with very few TuJ1+ neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Conti et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Ying et al., 2003</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E and F</xref>). We examined both the Hb9-GFP line and the 46C ESC line used in the original monolayer NPC protocol, finding minimal differences in marker staining (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Ying et al., 2003</xref>). By western blot, we found that both PTBP1 and PTBP2 proteins were expressed in these NPC cultures. As these NPCs were differentiated into neurons with retinoic acid, PTBP1 protein expression was lost while PTBP2 protein was induced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1G and H</xref>). The EB and monolayer culture systems likely give rise to different neuronal populations with differences in gene expression attributable to different neuronal types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gaspard et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Wichterle et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lee et al., 2000b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Murashov et al., 2005a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Su et al., 2006c</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Salero and Hatten, 2007</xref>). Nevertheless, the transition in PTBP1-PTBP2 protein expression is common to both models of in vitro neuronal development, as well as embryonic brain.</p><p>We next examined alternative splicing patterns under different states of PTBP1 and PTBP2 expression. Poly-A plus RNA was isolated from undifferentiated ESCs (high PTBP1 and low PTBP2), Nestin+ progenitor cells (intermediate PTBP1 and PTBP2), and post-mitotic HB9-GFP+ MNs (low PTBP1 and high PTBP2). Strand specific libraries for each cell type were subjected to 100 nt paired-end sequencing to generate 200 to 250 million mapped reads per sample. Alternative splicing events were quantified using SpliceTrap to identify cassette exons, 5’ and 3’ splice sites, and retained introns that differ between all sample pairs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Wu et al., 2011</xref>). PSI values for the HB9 and 46C cell lines were highly correlated (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.92 and 0.90 in ESCs and NPCs respectively), indicating that the two cell lines are similar in splicing phenotype (data not shown). Differentially spliced events were filtered for p-value below 0.05 and ranked by the change in percent spliced in value (ΔPSI). Using a ΔPSI cutoff of 15%, we identified a large set of alternative splicing events that change across neuronal differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A and B</xref>). With these filters 1201 differential splicing events were identified between ESCs and MNs, 1218 differential events between NPCs and MNs, and 750 differential events between ESC and NPC (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>). To identify enriched functional categories, transcripts exhibiting differential splicing were compared to the total expressed transcript set by Gene Ontology analyses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Huang et al., 2009a</xref>). Differential splicing events between NPCs and MNs were enriched (FDR&lt;0.05) in biological processes and cellular compartments relevant to neuronal differentiation such as cell projection organization, axonogenesis, and cell morphogenesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C and D</xref>). It is expected that a subset of these splicing changes are the result of changes in PTBP1 and PTBP2 expression.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>PTBP1 regulates a large set of neuronal exons in ESCs and NPCs</title><p>To identify neuronal splicing events controlled by the PTB proteins and in particular PTBP1, RNAi knockdowns were performed with two independent sets of control, PTBP1, and PTBP2 siRNAs. PTBP1 siRNA treatment depleted the protein by 80% (n=3) and 85% (n=2) in ESCs and NPCs respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A and B</xref>).

To assess the effect of PTBP2, we performed PTBP1/2 double knockdowns to remove 84% and 93% PTBP2 in ESCs and NPCs respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A and B</xref>). 50 nt paired-end RNA sequencing was performed on the control and knockdown samples, and the splicing was analyzed with SpliceTrap.

This number was only slightly increased by double PTBP1/2 depletion, with similar changes in PSI when compared with the single knockdown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref>). The splicing changes between the single and double knockdowns showed a strong correlation (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.91, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1E</xref>), indicating that these events are more strongly affected by PTBP1. A majority of the exons altered by PTB protein depletion also change in the same direction during ESC to MN differentiation (exons in the upper right and lower left quadrants of the plots in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Applying a ΔPSI cutoff of 15% for both data sets, 30% of neuronal exons are regulated by PTBP1, including 97 neuronally activated exons that are PTBP1 repressed, and 56 neuronally skipped exons that are PTBP1 activated (indicated by red and blue data points respectively in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, left panel; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3-data">Figure 2—source data 2</xref>). 31% of neuronal exons were PTBP1/2 repressed (101) and activated (55) following PTBP1/2 double knockdown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, right panel). As expected, many exons that change during neuronal differentiation are not affected by PTB protein depletion, indicating likely regulation by other proteins (grey data points along the y-axes of the plots in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>).</p><p>PTBP1 depletion from NPCs altered 325 splicing events (264 cassette exons, 44 alternative 5’ or 3’ splice sites, and 17 retained introns, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4-data">Figure 2—source data 3</xref>). Comparing this list to the splicing changes between NPCs and Day 5 GFP+ MNs identified 16% of neuronal exons regulated by PTBP1 (66 PTBP1-repressed exons increased with differentiation; 23 PTBP1-activated exons decreased with differentiation; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>, left panel; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5-data">Figure 2—source data 4</xref>). Interestingly, PTBP1/2 double knockdown increased the number of regulated neuronal exons to 30% (116 PTBP1/2-repressed exons increased with differentiation; 45 PTBP1/2-activated exons decreased with differentiation; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>, middle panel). These changes in splicing after double PTBP1/2 knockdown in NPCs also tended to be larger than PTBP1 knockdown alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D</xref>), yielding a lower correlation than seen in ESC (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.69, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1F</xref>). Knockdown of PTBP2 alone in NPCs had only a small effect on the splicing of neuronal exons, indicating that PTBP2 largely regulates a subset of PTBP1 targets, with relatively few targets of its own (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A and D</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>, right panel). This is in agreement with previous results that a large set of exons in the developing mouse brain is regulated by both PTBP1 and PTBP2. These include Dlg4 (Psd-95) exon 18 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Boutz et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Li et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Zheng et al., 2012</xref>). In these new data, PTBP1 and PTBP2 single knockdown each only moderately increased Dlg4 exon 18 splicing (ΔPSI = 8% and 13% respectively), whereas PTBP1/2 double knockdown increased exon 18 splicing by 42%. Other exons where PTBP2 can compensate for the loss of PTBP1 are found in the Magi1, Ap2a1, and Tnrc6a transcripts (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6-data">Figure 2—source data 5</xref>). Thus, PTBP1 and PTBP1/2 depletion from NPCs identifies exons that are coregulated by both proteins. Whereas, depletion from ESCs identifies exons affected largely by PTBP1.</p><p>The PTBP target transcripts in ESCs and NPCs include both unique and overlapping splicing events (80 shared, 73 unique to ESCs, 81 unique to NPCs). To examine possible common functions of the PTBP1/2 regulatory programs, Gene Ontology analyses were performed relative to the transcripts expressed in each cell type (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Huang et al., 2009</xref>). These yielded fewer enriched terms compared to total set of neuronally regulated exons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2C and D</xref>). Neuronal exons regulated by PTBP1 in ESCs showed significant enrichment (FDR = 0.04) in the cellular compartment ontology term, cell junction. Neuronal exons regulated by PTBP1/2 in NPCs were enriched (FDR = 0.01) in the cellular compartment ontology term, cytoskeleton. The total set of neuronal exons identified during ESC and NPC differentiation were also enriched for these terms among others (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 2C and D</xref>). The relative lack of enriched terms might reflect a broad number of functions for PTBP targets, but this will require further analysis to assess. Enrichment for cytoskeletal functions is in agreement with previous analyses of PTBP2 function in mice, and with the dramatic cytoskeletal changes during the transition from PTBP1 to PTBP2 during early neuron differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Li et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Licatalosi et al., 2012</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>PTBP1 iCLIP-seq identifies direct PTBP1 splicing targets during neuronal differentiation</title><p>To identify direct binding of PTBP1 to transcripts in these cells, we performed crosslinking-immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing (iCLIP-seq) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">König et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">König et al., 2011</xref>).

We measured the frequency of all pentamer motifs within these binding sites, relative to randomly chosen intervals from the same introns. As expected, PTBP1 binding sites in both ESC and NPC were highly enriched for CU-rich pentamers. The top 20 motifs included pentamers comprised of only C and U nucleotides, as well as some with G nucleotides, in agreement with the described binding specificity of PTBP1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Amir-Ahmady et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Han et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Licatalosi et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Llorian et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Oberstrass et al., 2005</xref>).

Many other exons are expected to be direct targets but were excluded due to failure to fulfill a cutoff value in one dataset. The exons in this minimal set affect a wide range of cellular processes including GTPase signaling (Dock7), synaptic function (Gabbr1), and transcriptional regulation (Tcf20) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A–D</xref>). For example, Gabbr1 is a subunit of a metabotropic gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptor. PTBP1 induced skipping of Gabbr1 exon 15 leads to premature translation termination in exon 16 and predicted nonsense mediated decay of the Gabbr1 mRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Makeyev et al., 2007</xref>). We observe PTBP1 binding within exon 15 and upstream, consistent with the increased exon 15 splicing observed during neuronal differentiation and after PTBP1 depletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). This gene is similar to Dlg4, where PTBP1 regulates its overall expression during development rather than the production of a neuronal isoform. However unlike Dlg4, Gabbr1 is more sensitive to PTBP1 than PTBP2, allowing its expression to be induced earlier.<fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.09268.014</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Examples of neuronally spliced cassette exons that are PTBP1 repressed.</title><p>(<bold>A-D</bold>) Genome Browser tracks show aligned RNA-seq reads from ESCs (red), NPCs (blue), and GFP+ MNs (yellow).

PTBP1 target transcripts influence an array of important cellular functions, and understanding how splicing alters each target’s activity in differentiating cells will be a challenge. We were particularly interested in how the early PTBP1 program affects gene regulation. We identified a number of transcriptional regulators whose splicing is controlled by PTBP1 during ESC differentiation into NPCs, including Tcf20, Med23, Gatad2a, and Pbx1. These early changes in the structure of transcriptional regulators have the potential to broadly alter gene expression programs during neuronal development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gabut et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Raj et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Demir and Dickson, 2005b</xref>).</p><p>We focused on the homeodomain transcription factor Pbx1 because of its known interactions with the Hox family of developmental regulators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Piper et al., 1999a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">LaRonde-LeBlanc, 2003a</xref>).

Exon 7 in the Pbx1 transcript is conserved across mammals and its inclusion leads to production of the Pbx1a isoform. Skipping exon 7 shifts the translational reading frame to introduce a new termination codon (PTC) in exon 8 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). This translation stop does not result in NMD but instead generates the shorter isoform, Pbx1b, which retains the DNA binding homeodomain but lacks the 83 amino acids at the C-terminus of Pbx1a. During development, early embryonic tissues predominantly express Pbx1b, whereas Pbx1a is found in neural tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Redmond et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Schnabel et al., 2001b</xref>). We found a similar isoform switch in cultured cells, where ESCs express low levels of Pbx1b. As ESCs differentiate into NPCs and HB9+ MNs, both overall Pbx1 expression and exon 7 splicing are induced, such that MNs predominantly express the Pbx1a isoform (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B and C</xref>). Previous work indicates that the Pbx1a and Pbx1b isoforms have different transcriptional activities and cellular functions. The proteins differ in their ability to activate or repress reporter gene expression, their interactions with the transcriptional corepressors NCoR1 and NCoR2, and their activity for cell transformation when fused to E2A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kamps et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Di Rocco et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Asahara et al., 1999b</xref>).

A variety of RNA binding proteins alter splicing patterns during development and in the adult brain, including members of the PTBP, Rbfox, Nova, CELF, SRRM and other protein families (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Zheng and Black, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Norris and Calarco, 2012a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Raj and Blencowe, 2015a</xref>). The changes in isoform expression controlled by these factors determine the activity of many essential neuronal genes. However, these regulatory programs are incompletely characterized and the cellular roles of their alternatively spliced products are often not understood.</p><p>The polypyrimidine tract binding proteins, PTBP1 and PTBP2, influence neuronal differentiation through programs of posttranscriptional gene regulation. In previous work, we found that the transition from PTBP1 to PTBP2 expression during neuronal differentiation causes a large scale reprogramming of splicing patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Boutz et al., 2007</xref>). More recently, we identified a second transition late in neuronal maturation, where PTBP2 levels decline allowing for the expression of many adult-specific spliced isoforms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Li et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Licatalosi et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Zheng et al., 2012</xref>). Like many splicing regulators, the PTB proteins also affect other aspects of mRNA metabolism. The depletion of PTBP1 from mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) was shown to induce the trans-differentiation of these cells into neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Xue et al., 2013</xref>). This was linked to PTBP1 bound in 3’ UTRs altering miRNA targeting of transcripts driving neuronal differentiation, including the REST transcriptional repressor. In contrast, alterations in neuronal differentiation were not observed in mice carrying a conditional <italic>Ptbp1</italic> knockout mutation in nestin-positive NPCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Shibasaki et al., 2013</xref>). Similarly, we have not found that PTBP1 depletion is sufficient to induce neuronal differentiation of ESCs. This could reflect a difference between ESCs and NPCs compared to MEFs, or differences in culture conditions. Notably, we find here that, like its 3’ UTR targets, the PTBP1 splicing program also includes targets that enhance neuronal development, such as Pbx1.</p><p>Earlier studies demonstrated that while PTBP1 and PTBP2 share many targets, exons can have different sensitivities to the two proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Keppetipola et al., 2012</xref>). This raised questions about the mechanisms of their differential targeting and the biological roles of the early and late neuronal splicing programs. The late program was illuminated in the PTBP2 knockout mouse where many exons that are repressed by both proteins were identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Li et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Licatalosi et al., 2012</xref>). However, the early program composed of exons primarily targeted by PTBP1 was harder to define in the developing brain. By examining the PTBP1 splicing program in ESC culture, we now identify a large set of targets primarily responsive to PTBP1 regulation. Interestingly in ESCs, exons that are sensitive PTBP1 depletion are largely not responsive to the concomitant PTBP2 induction. This contrasts with NPCs where exons whose splicing shifts with PTBP1 depletion are often more strongly affected by PTBP1/2 co-depletion. We previously found that in mice heterozygous for the PTBP2 knockout mutation, certain exons were spliced at 50% the level seen in the homozygous null, indicating a strong effect of PTBP2 concentration. Similarly, we find here that certain exons, such as Gabbr1 exon 15, are very sensitive to moderate changes in PTBP1 expression, such as the reduction seen when ESCs differentiate into NPCs. Like PTBP2, the PTBP1 targets display a range of responsiveness to PTBP1 concentration, and the ESC system gives us a new tool for examining this earlier PTBP1 dependent program.</p><p>Alternative exons are usually regulated by ensembles of splicing factors acting to repress or activate their splicing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fu and Ares, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lee and Rio, 2015</xref>). A question of interest is how targeting by the PTB proteins is affected by other neuronal splicing factors. Two known PTBP1 cofactors that may also affect PTBP2 are Matrin3 and Raver1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Coelho et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Rideau et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Huttelmaier, et al., 2001d</xref>). Both these proteins are likely to affect the activity of PTBP1 and PTBP2 on certain targets. We find that both proteins are well expressed in ES cells, and Matrin3 is strongly upregulated with differentiation into NPCs and neurons. We recently identified several potential cofactors that alter the splicing of the PTBP1/2 target exon in Dlg4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Zheng et al., 2013</xref>). These will also be interesting to examine in relation to additional PTBP targets, and whether they more strongly affect exons controlled by PTBP1, PTBP2 or both proteins. A protein that can counteract PTBP repression is nSR100/SRRM4, which is induced with neuronal differentiation and whose targets include some PTBP1/2 targets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Calarco et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Raj et al., 2014</xref>). SRRM4 expression coincides with PTBP2, and its role may be to specifically antagonize the effects of PTBP2 on certain exons in immature neurons. It will be also interesting to identify the SRRM4 target exons during NPC differentiation and to assess their sensitivity to PTBP2 compared to PTBP1.</p><p>The intent of this study was to define a set of targets that are primarily responsive to PTBP1, and thus may affect early neuronal lineage commitment and differentiation. We identify a diverse group of transcripts that are sensitive to PTBP1 depletion from ESCs and which change their splicing when ESCs differentiate into NPCs and then into early neurons, as PTBP1 is reduced. Among these targets, we focused on Pbx1, which contains an alternative exon 7 that is highly responsive to PTBP1 concentration and is implicated in neuronal transcriptional regulation.</p><p>Using Cas9 genome editing, we created Pbx1 alleles that eliminate PTBP1 repression of exon 7, causing its premature splicing during development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Doudna and Charpentier, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cong and Zhang, 2015e</xref>). This early switch in Pbx1 isoforms was sufficient to induce a variety of transcripts, including multiple mRNAs implicated in neuronal lineage commitment. Thus, one function of PTBP1 is to repress the neuronal form of Pbx1 and prevent its action at target genes early in development. It will be interesting to further examine how different interactions of the two Pbx1 isoforms might lead to their different activities. Pbx1b lacks 83 amino acids at the C-terminus of Pbx1a but retains domains that facilitate interactions with the Hox, Prep, and Meis transcription factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Longobardi et al., 2013</xref>). An earlier study found that Pbx1a and Pbx1b differ in their interactions with the transcriptional corepressors NCoR1 and NCoR2 and their ability to repress reporter gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Asahara et al., 1999b</xref>). Our data indicates that Pbx1a may enhance Meis1 binding at the Hoxc5 locus to activate its expression. Thus, the changes in Pbx1 structure likely influence enhancer complex assembly at specific genes.</p><p>A splicing factor will often regulate a large network of targets that may overlap with the targets of other factors. The complexity of these regulatory programs is a challenge for understanding their biological roles. Mouse mutations in splicing regulators often exhibit lethal or highly pleiotropic phenotypes. Among the many affected transcripts, few isoforms are usually sufficiently analyzed to understand their altered activity. Cas9 genome editing offers an tool for examining differential isoform activity in the developing nervous system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gueroussov et al., 2015c</xref>). Combining genome editing with stem cell differentiation allows the characterization of isoform activity in specific cells at specific times in development, and provides means for investigating the function of other PTB targets within the larger programs of neurogenesis.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Tissue culture</title><p>HB9-GFP and 46C mouse ESCs were gifts of H.

Your submission has been overall favorably evaluated by James Manley (Senior Editor) and three reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>In this manuscript Linares et al. investigate the contributions of the splicing regulators PTBP1 and PTBP2 to alternative splicing programs during differentiation of embryonic stem cells (ESCs) into motor neurons (MNs). They characterize the expression dynamics and contributions of these factors to splicing regulation during different stages of differentiation. They then investigate the function of a conserved PTBP1/2-regulated target, exon 7 of the homeodomain transcription factor Pbx1. Derepression by PTBP1 results in increased inclusion of exon 7 and expression of the Pbx1a isoform during differentiation. By utilizing the CRISPR/Cas9 system, the authors delete a PTBP1 intronic splicing repressor element proximal to exon 7. Using RNA-Seq analysis, the authors show that this results in earlier activation of the Pbx1a isoform, and activation of Pbx1 target genes, during MN differentiation.</p><p>Overall, this is an interesting manuscript that provides detailed insight into the splicing programs regulated by PTBP1/2 during MN development, as well as information on the function of a specific exon target in this program that is thought to affect the activity of Pbx1. Alternative splicing regulators typically control large numbers of target exons and introns during development, yet the functions of the vast majority of these targets events are not known. Characterizing the contributions of individual regulated splicing events to differentiation programs is therefore of considerable interest. The reviewers have the following recommendations for revisions.</p><p>Major:</p><p>Much of the first half of the manuscript (i.e., <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref>) presents results that essentially recapitulate those already published by Dr. Black and his colleagues (and by others) in other neural developmental systems.

It is of course well known from work of multiple labs that loss of PTBP1 induces PTBP2 expression during neuronal development. The program of splicing controlled by PTBP2 has been characterized in the mouse by ourselves and Licatalosi et al. However, the program controlled by PTBP1 has been difficult to define in mice due to embryonic lethality, and the other systems where PTBP1 has specifically been examined are not of clear relevance to actual neuronal development. There are studies of PTBP dependent exons in cell lines such as Hela, usually defined as responsive to double PTBP1/PTBP2 knockdown. There are the very interesting results from the Fu lab showing transdifferentiation of MEF and other cell lines into neuronal-like cells in response to PTBP1 knockdown. It is difficult to relate these results to normal neuronal development because MEFs do not express the same gene set as true pluripotent progenitor cells, and it is not clear whether their transdifferentiation goes through an NPC-like intermediate. The intent of our study was to define the targets of PTBP1 regulation within a well-characterized pathway of differentiation into actual neuronal progenitor cells and then into a defined neuronal cell type, motor neurons. Targets defined in this system can then be assessed relative to neuronal development in the animal. Indeed, we find that ESC do not simply differentiate into neurons upon loss of PTBP1, as was seen in MEFs. However, neuronal gene expression programs are clearly upregulated under these conditions. Since our last submission, Benjamin Blencowe has also published data examining PTBP1 expression in differentiating ESC. This paper (Gueroussov et al. 2015) shows a very nice profile of PTBP1 expression across differentiation, and then goes on to focus on activity differences between PTBP1 isoforms during neuronal differentiation rather than differences between PTBP1 and PTBP2. By comparing ESC cells to NPC, we have identified a set of exons that are more responsive to PTBP1 than PTBP2. These were difficult to identify in cell lines and in the mouse, and using these data we can now begin to examine how the PTBP1 and PTBP2 regulatory programs might differ. These exons are also a resource for those of us interested in mechanistic questions of how differential targeting by related splicing factors is achieved. Thus, these results provide an essential foundation not available from the prior work, both for the subsequent experiments in the paper that begin to analyze the PTBP1 program, and for many future studies.</p><p>We have rewritten the Abstract and added text in multiple places to make clearer how these studies address new questions regarding PTBP regulation.</p><p><italic>In this regard, the authors are requested to address the following: a) The RNA-Seq data generated for the splicing analysis can also be used to look at steady-state mRNA levels during the different stages of differentiation. Do the genes induced by Pbx1a expression listed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref> also show increased expression?</italic> </p><p>We should have discussed this before. The CuffDiff tables of expression as ESCs differentiate into NPCs and GFP+ MNs are now presented as <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD10-data">Figure 6—source data 2</xref>. As we now discuss in subsection “The early expression of Pbx1a promotes neuronal gene expression”, the genes most strongly induced by shifting splicing to Pbx1a are also upregulated during differentiation of ESC to NPC and MNs. These include many genes with well established roles in neuronal development such as Hoxc5.</p><p> <italic>b) The authors cite previous ChIP-Seq data indicating that some of the genes affected by modulation Pbx1 exon 7 are direct Pbx1 targets, but these experiments were performed in a different context. It would strengthen the manuscript to show that Pbx1 binds directly to these targets during MN differentiation. This could be achieved by performing ChIP-qPCR assays, although ChIP-Seq would be preferable. Moreover by performing a ChIP analysis at Day 2 in their CRISPR-Cas9 edited lines the authors could assess differences in DNA binding between the isoforms. c) Related to (b), it would be informative to assess whether the two Pbx1 isofoms differ in their ability to bind partner proteins. Time permitting, the authors could perform ChIP-qPCR assays on known Pbx1 co-factors at target genes to test whether the isoforms differ in their ability to recruit known binding partners.</italic></p><p>We performed a series of ChIP-qPCR experiments to examine Pbx1 and cofactor binding. As suggested, these were performed at Day 2 of differentiation in the WT and I6+/- cells. Briefly, we demonstrate binding of Pbx1 on 6 target genes whose expression goes up with Pbx1a. We do not observe differences in DNA binding by Pbx1 between the mutant and wild type cells. This may not be surprising given that the DNA binding domain of the protein is not altered by the splicing change. We went on to perform ChIP-qPCR of the Meis1 and Prep1 co-factors for Pbx1. These are also seen to bind the target genes. In one case we see an increase in binding of the Meis1 cofactor on the target gene Hoxc5, when expression is shifted to the Pbx1a isoform. These data are now presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>, and discussed in the Results and Discussion sections.</p></body></sub-article></article>
