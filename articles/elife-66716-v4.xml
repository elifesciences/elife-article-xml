gases such as the gasotransmitters H<sub>2</sub>S, CO, and NO affect cell metabolism and function. To evaluate effects of dissolved gases on processes in tissue, we developed a fluidics system that controls dissolved gases while simultaneously measuring parameters of electron transport, metabolism, and secretory function. We use pancreatic islets, retina, and liver from rodents to highlight its ability to assess effects of O<sub>2</sub> and H<sub>2</sub>S. Protocols aimed at emulating hypoxia–reperfusion conditions resolved a previously unrecognized transient spike in O<sub>2</sub> consumption rate (OCR) following replenishment of O<sub>2</sub>, and tissue-specific recovery of OCR following hypoxia. The system revealed both inhibitory and stimulatory effects of H<sub>2</sub>S on insulin secretion rate from isolated islets. The unique ability of this new system to quantify metabolic state and cell function in response to precise changes in dissolved gases provides a powerful platform for cell physiologists to study a wide range of disease states.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>hydrogen sulfide</kwd><kwd>oxygen</kwd><kwd>hypoxia</kwd><kwd>insulin secretion</kwd><kwd>calcium</kwd><kwd>fluidics</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd><kwd>Rat</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1853066</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Robbings</surname><given-names>Brian M</given-names></name><name><surname>Hurley</surname><given-names>James B</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000062</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DK17047</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sweet</surname><given-names>Ian R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000053</institution-id><institution>National Eye Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>EY006641</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hurley</surname><given-names>James B</given-names></name><name><surname>Sweet</surname><given-names>Ian R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection, and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The ability to resolve previously unrecognized affects of O2 and H2S by a novel fluidics system foretell a far-reaching impact of the technology on the study of effects of dissolved gases on tissue function.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><sec id="s1-1"><title>A critical need for instrumentation to study the effect of dissolved gases</title><p>Oxygen (O<sub>2</sub>) is a fundamental determinant of cell survival and function in mammalian tissues. In most cells, the majority of ATP is generated by oxidative phosphorylation, driven by a series of redox reactions in which O<sub>2</sub> is the ultimate electron acceptor. Hypoxia is linked to many diseases including stroke, cancer, and diabetic complications. In addition to O<sub>2</sub>, trace gases produced by cells (H<sub>2</sub>S, NO, and CO) act as signals to regulate cellular and mitochondrial function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Prabhakar and Semenza, 2012</xref>). Ischemia–reperfusion injury is a condition common to many disease states and it is thought that during reoxygenation a burst of reactive O<sub>2</sub> species (ROS) occurs that can damage proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Chouchani et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Zweier et al., 1987</xref>). Yet despite the scientific and clinical importance of dissolved gases, quantitative methods to measure the real-time effects of dissolved gases on intact tissue are not available. Investigators who have studied trace gases and who are characterizing drugs to attain the same benefits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chen et al., 2020</xref>) almost exclusively use aqueous based surrogates/donors of gas. The equivalence of these drugs to the gases they are supposed to mimic has not been tested (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chen et al., 2020</xref>). Some investigators have bubbled gas directly into media, but this precludes adding essential protein to the media due to foaming. In addition, the study of dissolved gases is hampered by the volatility of dissolved gases under conditions where the headspace is not supplied with equilibrium levels of the gas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">DeLeon et al., 2012</xref>). Thus, there is a strong need to develop technology that enables the study of both abundant and trace dissolved gases. The system we describe here does these analyses both quantitatively and reproducibly.</p></sec><sec id="s1-2"><title>A flow culture/assessment system that exposes tissues to precise levels and durations of dissolved gases</title><p>We developed a flow culture system according to three fundamental and essential specifications needed to assess effect of gases on tissue: (1) maintain tissue function and viability under continuous flow culture conditions; (2) continuously monitor parameters that reflect intracellular changes in metabolism in real time; (3) precisely control the aqueous and gas-phase composition of the media bathing the tissue. Although there are many systems readily available that have some components needed to investigate effects of dissolved gas, none incorporate all three. Commercially available hypoxia chambers (for instance Baker Ruskinn Cell Culture Workstations) control steady-state levels of dissolved gas and have been effectively and most commonly used for hypoxia studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Jaakkola et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Epstein et al., 2001</xref>). Microfluidics systems have been developed for establishing cell and tissue models where the three-dimensional structure and cell-to-cell interactions of native tissue can be recreated, which can be used under steady-state gas compositions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Ren et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Manafi et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kimura et al., 2018</xref>). In addition, some investigators have used the Oroboros machine to characterize the effects of O<sub>2</sub> levels on metabolic processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Stepanova et al., 2019</xref>). However, none of these methods are designed for implementing, and assessing real-time effects of, rapid changes in dissolved gas concentrations. The Seahorse flux analyzer measures OCR and extracellular acidification rate (mostly from glycolysis and the TCA cycle) on cell monolayers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Wu et al., 2007</xref>) and has been extensively utilized across many fields. However, it is not designed to maintain tissue in physiological buffers or to control dissolved gas levels.</p><p>In previous reports, we described an earlier version of our flow culture system and demonstrated its ability to maintain a range of tissues (including islets, retina, liver, and brain) over hours and days (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Neal et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Neal et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Sweet et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gilbert et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Weydt et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bisbach et al., 2020</xref>) while continuously assessing metabolic and functional effects of test compounds. This report highlights the incorporation of technology to precisely control both abundant gases (such as O<sub>2</sub>, CO<sub>2</sub>, and N<sub>2</sub>), by using a countercurrent flow device that promotes equilibration between inflow media and premixed gas, and also trace gases, by novel application of permeation tubes. Permeation tubes are commonly used devices for calibration of safety equipment that detect toxic gases such as CO and H<sub>2</sub>S. They consist of liquified gas housed under pressure in a metal jacket, where the gas continuously leaks through a membrane at a steady and accurately calibrated rate. We present in detail the components and operation of the system in the Methods section, and then illustrate the utility of the system to measure the effects of hypoxia followed by reoxygenation on two tissues, pancreatic islets and retina. We also demonstrate how this instrument can be used to quantify the effects of H<sub>2</sub>S on islet function and liver energetics.</p></sec><sec id="s1-3"><title>Assessment of O<sub>2</sub>-sensitive processes: OCR, reductive state of cytochromes, and rate of lactate and pyruvate production</title><p>The most direct endpoints with which to assess the acute effects of O<sub>2</sub> are components of the electron transport chain (ETC), first and foremost OCR. However, measurements of OCR alone cannot identify the mechanisms that are mediating changes in OCR. Under physiological conditions, OCR can increase in response to changes in substrate supply (increased supply of electrons generated from metabolism) and/or demand (as stimulated by ADP <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chance and Williams, 1956b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Wilson et al., 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Metabolism of fuels is reflected by a proportional change in cytochrome reduction and OCR: as the number of electrons bound to cytochromes increase, OCR increases by mass action (a ‘push’ system). In contrast, increased ATP usage by energy-utilizing cell functions (importantly ion flux and biosynthesis) with a corresponding increase in ADP leads to increased OCR, but without increased cytochrome c reduction (a ‘pull’ system) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brown, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Sweet and Gilbert, 2006</xref>). In this way, OCR changes mediated by substrate supply vs. ATP usage can be distinguished, and these fingerprints are informative in understanding mechanisms mediating changes in the ETC induced by H<sub>2</sub>S and O<sub>2</sub>.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Direct control of O<sub>2</sub> consumption rate (OCR): energy supply vs. energy demand vs. O<sub>2</sub>.</title><p><italic>Schematic depicting three mechanisms mediating OCR</italic>. (1) The supply of reduced electrons generated by metabolism of fuel. (2) The usage of ATP by energy-utilizing cellular function yielding ADP (a major regulator of OCR). (3) The concentration of dissolved O<sub>2</sub>. The concomitant measurement of reduced cytochromes and O<sub>2</sub> allows for the distinction between the three mechanisms mediating observed changes in OCR. The vertical arrows depict the changes that are acutely affected by changes in O<sub>2</sub>. Low O<sub>2</sub> leads to increased reductive state of cytochrome c and cytochrome c oxidase, decreased OCR. In some tissue types, the decrease in ATP production by oxidative phosphorylation is compensated by increased ATP generation from glycolysis (the Pasteur effect).</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-66716-fig1-v4.tif"/></fig><p>In addition to regulating ETC activity, O<sub>2</sub> can also influence glycolysis (known as the Pasteur effect <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Krebs, 1972</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Lactate and pyruvate accumulation and release are determined by relative rates of glycolysis, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), pyruvate dehydrogenase, mitochondrial and plasma membrane transporters, and the redox state of the cytosol. Due to the equilibrium status of LDH, [lactate]/[pyruvate] ratio is proportional to the cytosolic redox state ([NADH]/[NAD]) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Williamson et al., 1967</xref>), so by measuring both lactate and pyruvate, changes in the rate of lactate production rate due to alterations in glycolytic flux vs. cytosolic redox state can be distinguished. The concomitant measurement of O<sub>2</sub>, OCR, cytochrome c, cytochrome c oxidase, lactate, and pyruvate production provides a comprehensive dataset to assess the multitude of biochemical and functional effects of O<sub>2</sub> and other gases.</p></sec><sec id="s1-4"><title>Assessment of H<sub>2</sub>S effects on insulin secretion rate (ISR) from isolated pancreatic islets</title><p>Like O<sub>2</sub>, H<sub>2</sub>S also interacts directly with the ETC, where it can be both stimulatory and inhibitory. H<sub>2</sub>S can inhibit cytochrome c oxidase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Khan et al., 1990</xref>) and it also can donate electrons to cytochrome c (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Vitvitsky et al., 2018</xref>). However, with respect to pancreatic islets, all previous reports have described only inhibition of ISR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ali et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Niki and Kaneko, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Wu et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Yang et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bełtowski et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Tang et al., 2013</xref>). Based on the ability of H<sub>2</sub>S to both increase and decrease ETC activity, we chose to demonstrate the technical caliber of our system by testing the hypothesis that H<sub>2</sub>S would both stimulate and inhibit ISR depending on its concentration. Flow culture systems are well suited to measure changes in ISR in response to changes in perifusate composition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lacy et al., 1972</xref>). Secretogogs that affect ISR by isolated islets including glucose, arginine, amino and fatty acids, acetylcholine, GLP-1 as well as sulfonylureas and GLP-1 analogs, also manifest their effects in vivo. Therefore, isolated islets are a validated and highly relevant model with which to test our flow culture system. To evaluate the commonly asserted assumption that donors of H<sub>2</sub>S yield the same effects as direct exposure to H<sub>2</sub>S, we also compared the effects of NaHS, a commonly used donor of H<sub>2</sub>S to direct exposure to dissolved H<sub>2</sub>S.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Measurement of OCR, reduced cytochrome c, and ISR by pancreatic islets in the face of changing inflow O<sub>2</sub></title><p>Ischemia–reperfusion is a stress to tissues that occurs under a range of pathophysiologic conditions, and it is recognized that damage from hypoxia can occur both from the period of decreased energy production and at the time when O<sub>2</sub> is replenished. Accordingly, we evaluated the ability of our system to measure the recovery of metabolism and function following a period of decreased O<sub>2</sub> levels. Isolated rat islets were placed into the perifusion chamber and perifused for 90 min with Krebs–Ringer bicarbonate buffer containing 3 mM glucose and equilibrated with 21% O<sub>2</sub>/5% CO<sub>2</sub>/balance N<sub>2</sub>. Changes in OCR, cytochrome c reduction state, and ISR were measured in response to increased glucose (20 mM), decreased O<sub>2</sub> (by switching to a gas tank supplying the gas equilibration system that contained 3% for 2 hr), and the return of O<sub>2</sub> to 21% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). To measure OCR, both the inflow and outflow O<sub>2</sub> concentrations were measured (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>), and the data were then processed by convolution techniques described in the Methods section. After transformation of the inflow O<sub>2</sub> using <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ7">Equation 4</xref> and the transfer function generated with data obtained in the presence of potassium cyanide (KCN) to account for the delay and dispersion of the perifusion chamber, OCR was calculated from <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ8">Equation 5</xref>. As expected, OCR increased with increased glucose concentration, and decreased with lower O<sub>2</sub> tension (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Notably, there was a transient spike of OCR when O<sub>2</sub> in the media was restored. OCR then approached a steady state that was about 55% of the prehypoxic level of OCR. One limitation of the system arises when defining the O<sub>2</sub> levels that tissue is exposed to, when in fact there is a gradient from the inflow to the outflow. This uncertainty can be minimized by increasing flow rate thereby decreasing the difference between inflow and outflow concentrations; however, as the difference gets smaller, the resolution of the method decreases.</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Effect of glucose and low O<sub>2</sub> on transient and steady-state electron transport chain (ETC), and insulin secretion rate (ISR) and intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> in pancreatic islets.</title><p>Islets (900/channel) were handpicked with a P200 pipet and after mixing with Cytodex beads (1 μl/10 islets) loaded into the perifusion chamber, and the flow rate was set to 150 μl/min with Krebs–Ringer bicarbonate buffer containing 3 mM glucose for 90 min. At time = 0, glucose concentration was raised to 20 mM for 45 min; subsequently, O<sub>2</sub> was decreased to 3% for 2 hr, and then returned to 21%. (<bold>A</bold>) The protocol generated inflow and outflow O<sub>2</sub> profiles such as shown. Following the completion of the protocol, 12 μg/ml antimycin A (aA) was added for 25 min, and then 3 mM potassium cyanide (KCN), and the hypoxia protocol was repeated while islet respiration was suppressed in order to characterize delay and dispersion due to the separation in space of inflow and outflow sensors.

Consistent with these scenarios, glucose provided more reducing power to drive cytochrome c to its reduced state (in parallel with OCR), whereas hypoxia favored the reduced state of cytochrome c by slowing its oxidation. Following the return to 21% O<sub>2</sub>, cytochrome c reduction reached a steady state of 42% of the prehypoxic levels, consistent with incomplete recovery of OCR. A particularly powerful feature of the systems approach is realized when tissue function can be measured concomitantly with measures of ETC. Fractions were collected during the protocol that were later assayed for insulin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Stimulation of ISR by glucose in the presence of 21% O<sub>2</sub> was suppressed in low O<sub>2</sub>, and ISR recovered to 44% of its original level of stimulation after reoxygenation.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Measurement of calcium (Ca<sup>2+</sup>) in response to decreased O<sub>2</sub> by islets</title><p>As fluorescence imaging is a powerful and widely used modality to assess many intracellular signals including but not limited to Ca<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Rountree et al., 2014</xref>), NADH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bennett et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Pedersen et al., 2013</xref>), mitochondrial membrane potential (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Pertusa et al., 2002</xref>), ATP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hodson et al., 2014</xref>), and ROS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Neal et al., 2016</xref>) in islets, we demonstrated the control of dissolved gas for this modality.

As expected, intraislet Ca<sup>2+</sup> increased in response to the increase in glucose.

INS-1 cells were used instead of islets because most of the pyruvate made in islets is transported into mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">MacDonald, 1990</xref>) since they do not have significant capacity for plasma membrane transport of lactate or pyruvate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Ishihara and Wollheim, 2000</xref>). Oxamate, an inhibitor of LDH, rapidly and completely suppressed lactate release from cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>), showing the tight relation between production of lactate from LDH and appearance of lactate in the outflow. Glucose-stimulated OCR obtained with INS-1 cells was similar to the values obtained previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Jesinkey et al., 2019</xref>) and about half of what was measured using a Seahorse with metabolite-rich media (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Dover et al., 2018</xref>). The rate of INS-1 OCR is about 1/4th of islet OCR on a per cell basis, probably reflecting loss of lactate in INS-1 cells that does not occur in islets, in addition to lower rates of synthesis and secretion of insulin. Somewhat surprisingly, pyruvate did not increase. However, OCR increased suggesting that the decrease in flux from pyruvate to lactate was counterbalanced by an increase in flux of pyruvate into the mitochondria. Blocking transport of pyruvate into mitochondria with [zaprinast a blocker of the mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (MPC; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Du et al., 2013</xref>)] led to a rapid increase in pyruvate release from cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>) and diminished OCR. Why lactate production decreased is not clear from the data but could be explained by a decrease in the cytosolic redox state (NADH/NAD) by the increased activity of the malate/aspartate shuttle. Thus, the rapidity of the changes in lactate and pyruvate production in response to changes in LDH and MPC indicates that membrane transport is fast, and at least in this cell line, extracellular lactate and pyruvate will reflect changes in intracellular events controlling lactate and pyruvate with a time delay of no more than a few minutes. To ensure that this is the case, these experiments would have to be done in whatever tissue is being investigated.</p><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Effect of glucose and inhibitors of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (MPC) on O<sub>2</sub> consumption rate (OCR), lactate, and pyruvate production rate by INS-1 832/13 cells.</title><p>(A) The effects of glucose and then oxamate (50 mM, an inhibitor of LDH) on OCR, lactate production rate, and pyruvate production rate at the times indicated in the figure were measured.

Similar to the measurement in islets, the inflow and outflow O<sub>2</sub> were measured (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>), and OCR was calculated after convolution of the inflow data. OCR decreased at low O<sub>2</sub>, and then manifested a transient spike in response to reoxygenation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). However, in contrast to islets, OCR by retina then approached a much higher recovery (a steady state of 83% of the prehypoxic rate). Reduced cytochrome c increased to maximal levels during 1% O<sub>2</sub> and stayed at this level throughout the 2 hr of low O<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>).

The levels of O<sub>2</sub> in the outflow are dependent upon the inflow O<sub>2</sub>, the flow rate, and the OCR of the tissue in the chamber. In order to match the levels of O<sub>2</sub> that each tissue was exposed to, the supply gas tanks used for the hypoxia phase of the experiments were selected to generate similar outflow O<sub>2</sub> levels for the retina (1% yielded an outflow of 6.5 mm Hg) vs. islets (3% yielded 5.5 mm Hg).</p><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Effect of low O<sub>2</sub> on transient electron transport chain (ETC), and lactate/pyruvate in isolated retina.</title><p>(A) Four retinas (16 pieces) per chamber were loaded into the flow chamber, where each group of 4 retinal pieces were separated by a 3 μl layer of Cytodex beads.

However, as H<sub>2</sub>S has both stimulatory and inhibitory effects on the ETC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Khan et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Vitvitsky et al., 2018</xref>), we predicted that precise titration of the exposure of islets to H<sub>2</sub>S would reveal stimulatory effects of H<sub>2</sub>S on ISR. To simplify the analysis and interpretation, we ramped up the H<sub>2</sub>S concentration in the gas equilibration system (while the inflow and outflow gas ports were clamped) to accumulate H<sub>2</sub>S until the desired concentration was reached, and then clamped the permeation tube inlet port to maintain that H<sub>2</sub>S concentration for the indicated times. When H<sub>2</sub>S was increased until a steady state of 240 μM was reached, ISR from pancreatic islets increased by 35% relative to ISR at 20 mM glucose (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). The increased ISR was sustained for 3 hr. The effect of H<sub>2</sub>S was reversible. After purging it from the system, ISR rapidly returned to levels that occurred prior to H<sub>2</sub>S exposure. In the presence of 3 mM glucose, H<sub>2</sub>S had no effect on ISR (data not shown), supporting the idea that this reflects a physiologic response of ISR to H<sub>2</sub>S. To demonstrate the ability of the flow system to more fully characterize the time- and concentration dependency of ISR on H<sub>2</sub>S, we measured ISR at steady-state concentrations of H<sub>2</sub>S from 80 to 780 μM. Notably, between 180 and 780 μM H<sub>2</sub>S (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>), the initial period of stimulation of ISR (peaking between 1 and 1.5 hr after the start of the ramp of H<sub>2</sub>S) was insensitive to the concentration of H<sub>2</sub>S. In contrast, the effect of higher levels of H<sub>2</sub>S inhibited the ISR rate only between 1.5 and 4 hr following the start of the H<sub>2</sub>S exposure. The initial upslope of ISR occurred with a delay of about 30 min, and both the stimulation and inhibition of ISR were rapidly reversible following the washout of H<sub>2</sub>S (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). The ability of the system to resolve the time lag for H<sub>2</sub>S to activate ISR is limited by the rate of the increase of H<sub>2</sub>S in the gas equilibration system accomplished by the permeation tube. In order to increase the temporal resolution, the permeation tube leak rate can be increased, or the volume of the gas equilibration system must be decreased. Additional concentrations of H<sub>2</sub>S were tested and the observed peak of ISR, and the steady-state level between 3 and 4 hr were plotted as a function of the concentration of H<sub>2</sub>S (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>), clearly showing the ability of the system to resolve both the time courses and concentration dependency of the effects of a relatively small range of [H<sub>2</sub>S]. In order to demonstrate the ability of the system to investigate mechanisms mediating the effects of H<sub>2</sub>S on ISR, we subsequently measured intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> in response to H<sub>2</sub>S at a concentration that increased ISR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). Consistent with a stimulatory effect of H<sub>2</sub>S on ISR, intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> increased dramatically upon exposure to H<sub>2</sub>S, and returned to near pre-H<sub>2</sub>S levels within a few minutes of washing out the H<sub>2</sub>S.</p><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Effect of H<sub>2</sub>S on insulin secretion rate (ISR) by islets.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Rat islets (50/channel) were perifused (flow rate = 200 μl/min), and ISR was measured in response to glucose and exposure to dissolved H<sub>2</sub>S in the concentrations shown (data are average ± standard error [SE], <italic>n</italic> = 3 [H<sub>2</sub>S], <italic>n</italic> = 2 [no H<sub>2</sub>S], p &lt; 0.05 as indicated).

In contrast to dissolved gaseous H<sub>2</sub>S, low levels of NaHS had no effect, and higher concentrations (&gt;1 μM) inhibited ISR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig1">Appendix 1—figure 1A, B</xref>) – consistent with findings of all previous studies that used NaHS as an H<sub>2</sub>S surrogate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Niki and Kaneko, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Wu et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Yang et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bełtowski et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Tang et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Lu et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Patel and Shah, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Yang et al., 2007</xref>). Similarly, NaHS did not increase Ca<sup>2+</sup>, and slightly decreased it by amounts that were relatively insensitive to the concentration of NaHS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig1">Appendix 1—figure 1C</xref>). The inhibitory effects of HS<sup>−</sup>, which is present at about double the concentration of dissolved H<sub>2</sub>S, may in part account for the complex concentration dependency seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B, C</xref>. The likely explanation of the difference between effects of H<sub>2</sub>S and NaHS is that the H<sub>2</sub>S generated by NaHS diffuses out of solution and into the gas phase when the media is in contact with a headspace that does not contain gaseous H<sub>2</sub>S. To test this, 10 ml of KRB were placed in a sealed 125 ml bottle, and measured H<sub>2</sub>S in the KRB and the headspace as a function of time after either injecting NaHS into the solution or permeating gaseous H<sub>2</sub>S into the headspace (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig2">Appendix 1—figure 2A, B</xref>). The H<sub>2</sub>S in solution emanating from the headspace was higher than that achieved from NaHS, but notably it declined when the headspace was purged. Although the amount in the headspace was close to the detection limit of the H<sub>2</sub>S measurement method, it was clear from the sharp decline in H<sub>2</sub>S after unsealing the bottle, that H<sub>2</sub>S from the NaHS had indeed transferred into the headspace. Thus, these data support a scenario where differences in effects of H<sub>2</sub>S and NaHS occur due to the absence of H<sub>2</sub>S in solution containing NaHS and HS<sup>−</sup> is inhibitory for both ISR and Ca<sup>2+</sup>.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Measurement of OCR, cytochrome c, lactate, and pyruvate by perifused liver slices</title><p>We also explored the ability of our flow system to measure effects of H<sub>2</sub>S on liver by measuring OCR, cytochromes, and lactate/pyruvate release by liver slices in the absence and presence of a mitochondrial fuel (succinate). The responses were complex, changed directions in time- and concentration-dependent fashion, and will ultimately require more experiments to interpret the data mechanistically. Therefore, these data were placed in the appendix (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig3">Appendix 1—figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig4">4</xref>). Nonetheless the waveforms of the responses were clearly resolved, confirmed the capabilities of the multiparametric detection system, and so were included in this report. The salient features of the data can be summarized by: (1) In the absence of the mitochondrial fuel succinate, H<sub>2</sub>S changed OCR and reduced cytochromes in proportion to each other, consistent with donation of electrons from H<sub>2</sub>S to cytochrome c (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Vitvitsky et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig3">Appendix 1—figure 3</xref>); (2) In the presence of a TCA cycle intermediate (succinate), H<sub>2</sub>S (200–300 μM) increased the reductive state of cytochrome c oxidase while decreasing OCR. This is consistent with inhibition of cytochrome c oxidase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Khan et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig4">Appendix 1—figure 4</xref>), which occurred at concentration similar to typical estimates of plasma concentration which range from 30 to 300 μM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Olson, 2009</xref>). At low levels, H<sub>2</sub>S caused irreversible inhibition of ETC activity upstream of cytochrome c but did not inhibit flow of electrons from succinate. Thus, both reported mechanisms of action of H<sub>2</sub>S on the ETC were resolved by the system, as well as uncovering additional effects of H<sub>2</sub>S that had not previously been reported.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><sec id="s3-1"><title>General features of the flow system</title><p>Flow systems have important advantages over static systems for assessment of cell function. Viability and functions of cells and tissues are better and closer to physiological, culture media composition can be changed, and real-time production or uptake rates can be quantified from differences between inflow and outflow.

This report focuses on technical modifications to a previously developed flow culture/assessment system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Sweet et al., 2004</xref>) that enables real-time measurements of responses of tissues to physiologically important dissolved gases. We achieved this by incorporating a unique gas equilibration system that controls abundant (blood) gases including O<sub>2</sub>, CO<sub>2</sub>, and N<sub>2</sub>, and by using permeation tubes to introduce and control endogenously-produced gases such as H<sub>2</sub>S, NO, and CO.

In the illustration carried out in this study, retina recovered to 83% after hypoxia, whereas islets recovered to only 55% of prehypoxic levels of OCR, corresponding to the two tissue’s known sensitivity to oxidative stress. The second endpoint, the burst of OCR occurring when O<sub>2</sub> floods back into the cell, is one that has been hypothesized, but has not previously been measured due to the difficulty of measuring OCR in the face of changing O<sub>2</sub> levels. Our method has enabled the measurement of transient responses to reoxygenation and revealed a two-phase waveform in OCR in both islets and retina. The ability to resolve this waveform was dependent on rigorous convolution analysis to remove the delay and dispersion of the O<sub>2</sub> signal due to the flow system, combined with ultra-stable and ultra-sensitive O<sub>2</sub> sensors. It has been long recognized that ROS is generated rapidly by cells when O<sub>2</sub> becomes plentiful after undergoing hypoxic conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Chouchani et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Zweier et al., 1987</xref>). The transient spike of OCR is consistent with a scenario where O<sub>2</sub> is the source of oxygen atoms for the ROS. This is also consistent with the buildup of metabolites such as succinate during ischemia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Beach et al., 2020</xref>), which could fuel increased oxidation rate. The detailed relationship between OCR and generation of ROS will be the topic of future applications with this system. For instance, the method can be used to test whether slowed reintroduction of O<sub>2</sub> or candidate therapeutics including H<sub>2</sub>S, prevent or reduce the transient spike in OCR while at the same time preventing the decreased recovery following the hypoxic period (as has been hypothesized; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Clark and Gewertz, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Zhang, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Citi et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Du et al., 2017</xref>). Other applications could include: testing whether there are differences in transient OCR response for different tissues or metabolic states; determining the relation of the spike to the response of ROS and recovery/survival of tissue; and testing drugs designed to prevent both the transient spike and/or the decrease in posthypoxic OCR. The ability to objectively quantify recovery of OCR positions the system to be used to test tissue sensitivity to a wide range of stresses (including ER and oxidative stress, immunological stress [exposure to cytokines], lipotoxicity as well as hypoxia), and to test drugs and treatments designed to increase or decrease recovery from experimentally induced stresses.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Control and effects of a trace gas: stimulation of ISR and Ca<sup>2+</sup> by H<sub>2</sub>S in islets</title><p>Gas signaling molecules (CO, NO, and H<sub>2</sub>S) are generated in most tissues and have wide-ranging effects on function, metabolism, and protection from hypoxia (for reviews <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ahmad et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Beltowski, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cheng and Rong, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Krylatov et al., 2021</xref>). However, due to the difficulty in quantitatively and reproducibly introducing dissolved trace gases into culture media, the majority of studies on these gases have utilized aqueous chemical donors such as NaHS instead of H<sub>2</sub>S. These surrogates provide only imprecise and uncertain concentrations and timing of tissue exposure to dissolved H<sub>2</sub>S. Due to the extremely accurate calibration of the rate of release of gases, permeation tubes can introduce trace gases into the carrier gas (the mixture of CO<sub>2</sub>–O<sub>2</sub>–N<sub>2</sub>) present in a gas equilibration system of our perifusion apparatus at exact times and concentrations. Producers of permeation tubes can provide them with a selection of over 500 gases, including H<sub>2</sub>S, NO, CO, and ammonia. Thus, the method of incorporating permeation tubes into the gas equilibration system is particularly versatile and can be used for a wide range of applications.</p><p>To illustrate the unique advantages of being able to expose tissue to precise levels of dissolved H<sub>2</sub>S, we selected islets as a test tissue since the inhibitory effects of H<sub>2</sub>S on glucose-stimulated ISR and cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> by islets have been described. However, those reports were based on use of the H<sub>2</sub>S donors NaHS and Na<sub>2</sub>S (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Niki and Kaneko, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Wu et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Yang et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bełtowski et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Tang et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Lu et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Patel and Shah, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Yang et al., 2007</xref>) and the interpretation that H<sub>2</sub>S gas is actually delivered to the tissue and at levels low enough to avoid its toxic effects. Moreover, we took note of other studies that suggested that H<sub>2</sub>S can donate electrons directly to cytochrome c (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Vitvitsky et al., 2018</xref>) and there is evidence that the reduction of cytochrome c may be a key regulatory step in activating ISR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Rountree et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Jung et al., 2011</xref>). Our system bore out this prediction revealing stimulatory effects of H<sub>2</sub>S on ISR that had not been apparent when exposing islets to a donor of H<sub>2</sub>S (NaHS). H<sub>2</sub>S at concentrations (between 140 and 280 μM) enhanced glucose-stimulated ISR, which remained elevated for at least 4 hr. The concentration- and time dependency were complex however. At higher concentrations of H<sub>2</sub>S the stimulation of ISR for 90 min still occurs, but at later times ISR was inversely proportional to the H<sub>2</sub>S ranging from a 35% increase to a 40% decrease. The U-shaped concentration dependency may also reflect the effects of both H<sub>2</sub>S and inhibitory effects of HS<sup>−</sup>. At low concentrations NaHS had little effect on ISR or cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup>, however as its concentration approached 1 μM and above, both endpoints were inhibited. The range of effects occurred over a relatively small range of H<sub>2</sub>S concentrations, highlighting the need for the very precise control of dissolved H<sub>2</sub>S afforded by the use of permeation tubes to investigate this phenomenon. H<sub>2</sub>S had no effect on ISR at 3 mM glucose, supporting a physiologic mechanism mediating H<sub>2</sub>S’s effect that may be integrated with glucose sensing and secretory response to fuels by the islet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Prentki et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Campbell and Newgard, 2021</xref>).</p><p>The stimulatory effects of H<sub>2</sub>S on ISR and Ca<sup>2+</sup> directly refute the well accepted conclusions that H<sub>2</sub>S decreases ISR and Ca<sup>2+</sup> by opening K<sub>ATP</sub> channels as has been widely reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ali et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Yang et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Lu et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Shoji et al., 2019</xref>). Although it is typically assumed when using NaHS as a source of H<sub>2</sub>S that NaHS and H<sub>2</sub>S equilibrate in solution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Olson, 2009</xref>), our measurements show that in the absence of H<sub>2</sub>S in the headspace above the media, dissolved H<sub>2</sub>S quickly disappears into the headspace, a phenomenon analogous to the behavior of CO<sub>2</sub>-based buffers. Thus, measurements of effects of NaHS on tissue in open systems such as typical static and perifusion methods contain little H<sub>2</sub>S. Thus, our method offers a novel and uniquely capable approach for investigating the direct effects of the protonated form of H<sub>2</sub>S in equilibrium with HS<sup>−</sup>.</p><p>H<sub>2</sub>S is generated in islets by the action of three intracellular enzymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kimura, 2010</xref>) but is also a component of blood albeit at levels that are not well established (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Whiteman et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Karunya et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Whitfield et al., 2008</xref>). It is notable that the range of concentrations that induced changes in ISR, and above which caused inhibition of OCR in liver are in the range of typical estimates of plasma concentration which range from 30 to 300 μM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Olson, 2009</xref>). Therefore, it suggests that intracellular effects of H<sub>2</sub>S could be mediated by H<sub>2</sub>S derived from the blood as well as H<sub>2</sub>S endogenously produced by cells. The ability to detect differences between responses to H<sub>2</sub>S and donor molecules, will be useful to the increasing numbers of investigators developing H<sub>2</sub>S donor molecules as pharmaceutics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Citi et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Testai et al., 2020</xref>). The increase in ISR in response to H<sub>2</sub>S has physiological, methodological, and clinical implications and the lack of similar stimulatory effects by a donor molecule has broad implications in a field where studies of NO, H<sub>2</sub>S, and CO are mostly based on the use of donor molecules.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Lactate and pyruvate: relation to cytosolic events</title><p>The assayed values of lactate and pyruvate reflect a number of important specific and global parameters. The rate of release of lactate and pyruvate is an integration of the rate of glycolysis less the amount of pyruvate flux into the mitochondria and traversing gluconeogenesis. Thus, both compounds generally increase in response to glycolytic fuels. Importantly for the study of hypoxia, both metabolites rise in cells when O<sub>2</sub> is decreased (the Pasteur effect). In addition, the ratio of cytosolic lactate/pyruvate mirrors the cytosolic NADH/NAD ratio due to the equilibrium status of the LDH reaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Newsholme and Start, 1973</xref>). One could envision that freeze clamping cells and measuring intracellular lactate and pyruvate to directly compare them to the extracellular values could be a way to validate the use of extracellular data. However, in practice, the measurement of intracellular compounds is difficult and also limited by the kinetic resolution of freeze clamping. Instead, we evaluated the responses of the extracellular levels of lactate to a blocker of LDH (oxamate), of pyruvate to a blocker of mitochondrial transport (zaprinast), and both compounds in response to hypoxia. The rapid changes in extracellular lactate and pyruvate support the rapid redistribution between intra- and extracellular compartments, and that real-time measurement of extracellular lactate and pyruvate reflect intracellular events governing intracellular lactate and pyruvate. Retina responded to hypoxia with a classical Pasteur effect: low O<sub>2</sub> increased lactate, pyruvate, and lactate/pyruvate ratio. We envision that the measurement would be especially informative when examining the shift from oxidative to glycolytic metabolism such as seen in tumorigenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">de Groof et al., 2009</xref>) or stem cell differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Zhou et al., 2012</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Incorporation of O<sub>2</sub> control into a real-time fluorescent imaging system</title><p>Real-time fluorescent imaging is a powerful modality that is commonly used to quantify a wide variety of intracellular compounds and factors while perfusing the optical chamber housing the cells or tissue. Molecular probes provide intracellular dyes for over 100 separate compounds, so this method is versatile and wide ranging. Thus, incorporating the gas equilibration system to a flow system providing buffer to a chamber that images of single islets. We observed and quantified clear increases in intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> in response to hypoxia as metabolic rate decreased. Unexpectedly, the loss of energy and ISR following islet exposure to hypoxia were not accompanied by a loss of glucose-stimulated Ca<sup>2+</sup>, suggesting the mechanism mediating loss of ISR is independent of Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling. These data are consistent with previous findings that loss of secretory function is more closely associated with bioenergetics than Ca<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Rountree et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Rountree et al., 2013</xref>).

Although we illustrated the method using rodent tissue, it will have particular utility when maintaining and assessing human tissue. The novel resolution of OCR transients attests to the high kinetic resolution of the system. Moreover, stimulatory effects of H<sub>2</sub>S on ISR and Ca<sup>2+</sup> not seen in response to donor molecules, attests to the ability of the technology to reveal behavior that provides new insight. Given the wide use of donor molecules in studying gasotransmitters this has broad and significant implications. In addition to enabling users to evaluate direct effects of gases, the method is also suitable for testing conditions or agents that diminish loss of OCR in response to hypoxia- or other stress-induced effects. The use of methods to study the effects of dissolved gas on tissue will impact many areas of fundamental research as well as research of diseases including but not limited to diabetic wound healing, stroke (ischemia/reperfusion injury), and cancer.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Chemicals</title><p>Krebs–Ringer bicarbonate buffer was used for all perifusions prepared as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Neal et al., 2015</xref>).

From these spectral data, absorption, first and second derivatives were calculated as described below.

Due to the low signal to noise and baseline shift during the experiments, direct measurement of absorption was not stable. To better resolve changes in the reduced state of cytochromes the second derivative of the absorbance spectra with respect to wavelength was calculated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cavinato et al., 1990</xref>). Like absorption, this parameter reflects the number of electrons bound to the cytochrome as well as the amount of protein. However, the second derivative is unaffected by shifts in baseline allowing resolution of real-time changes in absorbance. At the conclusion of each experiment, calibration spectra for fully oxidized and reduced cytochromes were acquired in the presence of blockers of the ETC – namely 12 μg/ml antimycin to stop the flow of electrons to cytochromes, followed by 3 mM KCN to facilitate the maximal accumulation of electrons bound to cytochromes.</p><sec id="s4-6-1"><title>Spectral data processing</title><p>The second derivative of absorbance with respect to wavelength (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cavinato et al., 1990</xref>) at 550 and 605 nm was calculated (corresponding to cytochrome c and cytochrome c oxidase, respectively) as,<disp-formula id="equ9"><label>(6)</label><mml:math id="m9"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>A</mml:mi><mml:mi>b</mml:mi><mml:msup><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:mo>″</mml:mo></mml:msup><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">Δ</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mo>⟮</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">Δ</mml:mi><mml:mi>A</mml:mi><mml:mi>B</mml:mi><mml:mi>S</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">Δ</mml:mi><mml:mi>V</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac><mml:mo>⟯</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">Δ</mml:mi><mml:mi>V</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac></mml:mrow></mml:math></disp-formula></p><p>where Abs = log (intensity − intensity<sub>bkg</sub>)/(intensity<sub>ref</sub> − intensity<sub>bkg</sub>), <italic>v</italic> = wavelength in nanometers, and ∆ = change in the variable over the integration interval.

No effect was seen at concentration below 1 μM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig1">Appendix 1—figure 1A</xref>), a range where dissolved H<sub>2</sub>S had both stimulatory and inhibitory effects on insulin secretion rate (ISR). At higher concentrations, NaHS inhibited ISR where the IC<sub>50</sub> was about 30 μM and each concentration change reached a new steady state within 10–15 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig1">Appendix 1—figure 1B</xref>). The effect of NaHS on glucose-stimulated cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> was measured by incrementally increasing the concentration of dissolved H<sub>2</sub>S in the inflow (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig1">Appendix 1—figure 1C</xref>). The response did not reach steady state in between increases in H<sub>2</sub>S, so the concentration dependency was not fully resolved. But in contrast to the brisk increase in cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> observed in response to H<sub>2</sub>S, at all concentrations of NaHS tested Ca<sup>2+</sup> was decreased.</p><p>The question arises as to why the response to NaHS did not recapitulate the effects seen by H<sub>2</sub>S as would be expected if NaHS and H<sub>2</sub>S immediately equilibrated. However, as has been pointed out, H<sub>2</sub>S is very volatile and the release of dissolved H<sub>2</sub>S into the headspace is recognized to be an obstacle to its study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">DeLeon et al., 2012</xref>). We predicted that volatility of H<sub>2</sub>S explains the difference between effects of H<sub>2</sub>S and NaHS. To test this, H<sub>2</sub>S was measured in 10 ml of KRB contained in a sealed 125 ml bottle, while simultaneously measuring the H<sub>2</sub>S in the headspace above the solution. This was done two ways: with NaHS added to the solution at a concentration of 800 μM (where at pH = 7.2 equilibrium concentration of H<sub>2</sub>S is 300 μM), and in another sealed bottle when H<sub>2</sub>S was permeated into the headspace until it reached 14 μg/ml (a concentration that results in dissolved concentration of 788 μM H<sub>2</sub>S from <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ4">Equation 1</xref> in the main text). Using H<sub>2</sub>S permeation tubes to increase the concentration of H<sub>2</sub>S in the headspace, the H<sub>2</sub>S measured (as lifetime of the dye emission) in the solution of the bottle increased, whereas the increase in response to NaHS was barely detectable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig2">Appendix 1—figure 2A</xref>). Because the solubility of H<sub>2</sub>S in KRB is about a hundred times that of O<sub>2</sub>, the sensitivity of the lifetime of the dye emission is very high in solution. The sensitivity of the lifetime to H<sub>2</sub>S signal in gas was much lower and the time-dependent increase in H<sub>2</sub>S into the headspace was near the detection limit. Nonetheless, upon purging the bottle, the signals from H<sub>2</sub>S generated from both the H<sub>2</sub>S permeation tube and NaHS in solution clearly decreased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig2">Appendix 1—figure 2B</xref>), confirming transfer of H<sub>2</sub>S from the NaHS in solution.</p></sec><sec id="s9-2" sec-type="appendix"><title>Effect of H<sub>2</sub>S on liver in the presence and absence of a mitochondrial fuel (succinate)</title><p>To test the ability of our system to measure the effects of H<sub>2</sub>S, rat liver pieces were placed into the perfusion chambers and exposed to steadily increasing concentrations of dissolved H<sub>2</sub>S. The first effects observed in response to changes in H<sub>2</sub>S were the increased production rates of lactate and pyruvate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig3">Appendix 1—figure 3</xref>). About 30 min following the start of the ramp increase in H<sub>2</sub>S, OCR, reduced cytochrome c, and cytochrome c oxidase all decreased very precipitously for about 20 min, followed by a sudden increase until H<sub>2</sub>S was purged from the system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig3">Appendix 1—figure 3</xref>). During the post-H<sub>2</sub>S phase, all three of these parameters remained low. After a second introduction of H<sub>2</sub>S, OCR, reduced cytochrome c, and cytochrome c oxidase all increased about 30 min following the start of the ramp. These waveforms suggest multiple points of action by H<sub>2</sub>S and is consistent with a scenario where H<sub>2</sub>S can irreversibly inhibit complex one or a step upstream from complex 1 (consistent with decreased cytochromes and OCR), but also can supply electrons directly to cytochrome c when the level of H<sub>2</sub>S reaches higher concentrations.</p><p>In the presence of a fuel that enters at complex 2 (succinate), OCR, reduced cytochrome c, and reduced cytochrome c oxidase all increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig4">Appendix 1—figure 4</xref>). Under these conditions, H<sub>2</sub>S decreased OCR and cytochrome c reduction, but increased cytochrome c oxidase reduction, suggesting that H<sub>2</sub>S was inhibiting both at complexes 1 and 4. In contrast to the experiments done in the absence of succinate, post-H<sub>2</sub>S metabolism was only slightly different than pre-H<sub>2</sub>S energy state reflecting the continued supply of electrons to the ETC when complex one is still inhibited, while complex four inhibition by H<sub>2</sub>S seemed to be reversible. Following washout of both H<sub>2</sub>S and succinate, reducing power in the mitochondria fell to near 0, as would be expected in the absence of complex one activity.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s10" sec-type="appendix"><title>Appendix discussion</title><sec id="s10-1" sec-type="appendix"><title>Contrasting effect of H<sub>2</sub>S and NaHS on ISR and Ca<sup>2+</sup></title><p>The assumption made in most studies of H<sub>2</sub>S, is that NaHS or Na<sub>2</sub>S would rapidly equilibrate with the protonated form of the acid. Whether NaHS or H<sub>2</sub>S is added to the solution, the same amount of H<sub>2</sub>S would be present in solution after a short equilibration time. Our studies showed that NaHS does not recapitulate the effects of H<sub>2</sub>S and that this is caused by rapid depletion of H<sub>2</sub>S from the solution via transference to the headspace. The amount of dissolved H<sub>2</sub>S in a ml of aqueous solution is about 0.35% of that in equilibria with 1 ml of headspace. This means that unless the volume of the headspace is on the order of 1/100th of the volume of the solution, then the headspace will act as an infinite sink for H<sub>2</sub>S in the solution and NaHS will not result in a significant increase in dissolved H<sub>2</sub>S. This is the case in static or perifusion systems that are commonly used to perform ISR assays. The data support the guidance that when investigating the physiological effects of H<sub>2</sub>S in equilibrium with HS<sup>−</sup>, H<sub>2</sub>S should be supplied via the headspace and calls into question the use of H<sub>2</sub>S donor molecules where the effects of HS<sup>−</sup> but not H<sub>2</sub>S will be observed.</p><p>Having shown that H<sub>2</sub>S in solution generated from NaHS is depleted as a result of transfer into the headspace, we considered two scenarios to interpret the effects of NaHS. Either protonation of HS<sup>−</sup> is rapid relative to the diffusion of dissolved H<sub>2</sub>S into the headspace and HS<sup>−</sup> and H<sub>2</sub>S reach equilibrium. Alternatively, diffusion of dissolved H<sub>2</sub>S into the headspace is fast, and HS<sup>−</sup> generated from NaHS exists in solution in the presence of very low levels of H<sub>2</sub>S. If the equilibrium between HS<sup>−</sup> and H<sub>2</sub>S was reached however, then the effect of NaHS would be the same as the effect of H<sub>2</sub>S, except that the concentration dependency would be right-shifted relative to when H<sub>2</sub>S from the headspace is the source of sulfide. However, no concentration of NaHS resulted in an increase of either ISR or Ca<sup>2+</sup>. Thus, it appears that consistent with the low solubility of gases in aqueous solution, and the relatively slow rate of protonation and deprotonation for weak acids, NaHS generates only HS<sup>−</sup> when the headspace is similar or larger than the solution, and that HS<sup>−</sup> is inhibitory for both ISR and Ca<sup>2+</sup>.</p></sec><sec id="s10-2" sec-type="appendix"><title>Control and effects of H<sub>2</sub>S on liver</title><p>To illustrate its use, we exposed liver to H<sub>2</sub>S, an established cell signal with multiple effects and mechanisms of action. Both reported mechanisms of action of H<sub>2</sub>S in the ETC were observed in this study: inhibition of cytochrome c oxidase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Khan et al., 1990</xref>) and direct transfer of electrons to cytochrome c (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Vitvitsky et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>As the concentration of dissolved H<sub>2</sub>S increased, reduced cytochrome c, reduced cytochrome c oxidase, and OCR all decreased reflecting indicating inhibition of step(s) upstream of complex 1 (which appeared irreversible), and subsequently all three parameters increased consistent with donation of electrons directly from H<sub>2</sub>S. In the presence of a mitochondrial fuel entering at complex 2 (succinate), H<sub>2</sub>S caused a decrease in reduced cytochrome c and OCR, while increasing reduced cytochrome c oxidase consistent with the simultaneous inhibition of complexes 1 and 4. This analysis highlights the benefit of measuring reductive states of cytochromes concomitantly with OCR: interpreting observed changes in OCR in terms of the mechanisms mediating the changes is not possible with OCR measurements alone. The factors mediating the changes in OCR are distinguished by concomitant measurement of both electron pool sizes in the ETC (cytochromes) and flux of electrons (OCR). Overall, the method was able to characterize complex and multiple effects of H<sub>2</sub>S on the ETC.</p></sec></sec></app></app-group></back><sub-article article-type="editor-report" id="sa0"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.66716.sa0</article-id><title-group><article-title>Editor's evaluation</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Marletta</surname><given-names>Michael A</given-names></name><role specific-use="editor">Reviewing Editor</role><aff><institution>University of California, Berkeley</institution><country>United States</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>This paper presents a flow method for measuring the effects of dissolved gases on tissues while having control over tissue concentration.

As shown below in the response to Review #2, the permeabilization was small for all three models and it did not increase during the perifusion experiments.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. The reviewers have seen our discussion about NaHS vs. H2S. We would like to see the data your referred to included in the revised paper.</p></disp-quote><p>We have presented a method that accurately measures the response of insulin secretion and intracellular calcium to dissolved H<sub>2</sub>S. Since this data differs from results that are obtained when using aqueous NaHS with standard methods, we agree that it makes sense to demonstrate why there is a difference between the protonated and deprotonated form of H<sub>2</sub>S. To do this we developed a method to measure dissolved and gaseous H<sub>2</sub>S and used the method to assess the exchange of H<sub>2</sub>S between the two phases. Our results indicate that dissolved H<sub>2</sub>S quickly depletes when the gas headspace in contact with the media does not contain equilibrium levels of gaseous H<sub>2</sub>S. This data has been added as Figure 2A and B in the appendix. Thus, by supplying the H<sub>2</sub>S in the headspace surrounding the inflow media, the effects of an equilibrium ratio of both dissolved H<sub>2</sub>S and HS<sup>-</sup> are observed. Dissolved H<sub>2</sub>S produced by aqueous NaHS rapidly diffuses into headspaces not supplied with H<sub>2</sub>S and is therefore not a reliable method for investigating the effects of H<sub>2</sub>S. Kenneth Olson previously published an article demonstrating the problems associated with volatility of H<sub>2</sub>S (DeLeon, E.R., Stoy, G.F. and Olson, K.R. Passive loss of hydrogen sulfide in biological experiments. Anal Biochem 421, 203-207 (2012)). We have now appropriately cited this article in the paper. Interestingly H<sub>2</sub>S was observed to be stimulatory for ISR and ca<sup>2+</sup>, where HS<sup>-</sup> appears to be inert at low levels, and inhibitory at higher levels.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. Much has been done on hypoxia and the novelty of the tool here would be better appreciated if the focus was on hydrogen sulfide as opposed to oxygen.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that the ability to measure the effect of H<sub>2</sub>S is novel and accurate characterization of the effects of H<sub>2</sub>S and other trace gases will transform the understanding of their role in physiology and pathophysiology. We have now added additional data showing the stimulatory effects of H<sub>2</sub>S on intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> in islets to further demonstrate the utility of the method (Figure 5D) as well as data demonstrating the inhibitory effects of NaHS (Figure 1C in the APPENDIX). As with insulin secretion, H<sub>2</sub>S had the opposite effect on calcium as was observed with NaHS, and resulted in dramatic increases in ca<sup>2+</sup>. This data further supports the conclusion that H<sub>2</sub>S does not operate via the accepted mechanism of opening KATP channels that was established using NaHS. The data showing the transfer of H<sub>2</sub>S from solution to headspace (Figure 2 in the APPENDIX) also confirms the interpretation of the distinct responses to H<sub>2</sub>S vs NaHS.</p><p>Nonetheless, we feel that the utility of the methodology to the study of O<sub>2</sub> should not be de-emphasized. The role of O<sub>2</sub> in cell and tissue function and pathology is ubiquitous and far reaching, and the many investigators studying the effects of O<sub>2</sub> will greatly benefit from these methods. It also made sense to us to introduce the method of controlling gas composition first by demonstrating the functionality of our gas equilibration system for controlling abundant gases, followed by the use of permeation tubes incorporated into the gas equilibration system to control trace gases. In summary, we further developed the use of system for the study of a trace gas H<sub>2</sub>S but we did not remove the experiments involving measurement of O<sub>2</sub> consumption and hypoxia.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>The authors may like to reference the work of Roger Springett in their introduction.

Additionally, I have included a comparison to islet OCR. There are about 2000 cells/islets, and glucose stimulated OCR is about 0.8 nmol/min/100 islets or 4 nmol/min/10^6 islet cells. OCR by INS<sup>-1</sup> cells is about 1 nmol/min/10^6 INS<sup>-1</sup> cells about ¼ of the rate in islets. This is partially explained by the leakage of lactate out of the cell and also decreased rate of biosynthesis and secretion of insulin.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>A few contractions ('don't' etc) are in the text.</p></disp-quote><p>Isn’t and Don’t have been removed.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In a few figures u is used rather than μ.

We have further developed the investigation of the effects of H<sub>2</sub>S on insulin secretion by carrying out measurements of intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> in islets. Since H<sub>2</sub>S caused an increase in insulin secretion, in contrast to NaHS which inhibited insulin secretion and decreased intracellular ca<sup>2+</sup>, we predicted that H<sub>2</sub>S would increase intracellular ca<sup>2+</sup>. This turned out to be the case, and we have added data showing an increase in intracellular ca<sup>2+</sup>in response to H<sub>2</sub>S as Figure 5D in the paper. In addition, we have added data showing a decrease in ca<sup>2+</sup>in response to NaHS as Figure 1C in the appendix. By presenting both insulin secretion and ca<sup>2+</sup>, we provide more complete evidence that the currently accepted mechanism that the inhibitory effect of H<sub>2</sub>S on insulin secretion involves opening of KATP channels and inhibition of Ca<sup>2+</sup>uptake is incorrect. That mechanism was proposed based on experiments that used NaHS instead of H<sub>2</sub>S. In addition, adding data demonstrating that administering NaHS only delivers HS<sup>-</sup> without significant H<sub>2</sub>S allows the effects of H<sub>2</sub>S to be assigned to H<sub>2</sub>S vs. HS<sup>-</sup></p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The utility of the technique would be more clear if head-to-head comparisons were made with existing technology (Extracellular flux analysis, Oxygraph-2K).</p></disp-quote><p>See the response to the Public Review.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Controls need to be added to ensure that the tissue is indeed 'intact' and not permeabilized.</p></disp-quote><p>See the response to the Public Review.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Can similar experiments be performed in isolated mitochondria? The impact and novelty of the work could be strengthened by detailing the impacts of H2S on mitochondrial bioenergetics across tissues.</p></disp-quote><p>This is a great suggestion, and there certainly is a demand for making the measurements in isolated mitochondria. However, we do not know how to keep the mitochondria immobilized within the flow system so that they would not flow out of the system.
