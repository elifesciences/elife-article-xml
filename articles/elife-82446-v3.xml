chemical reaction between amino acids and sugars, is exploited to produce flavorful food ubiquitously, from the baking industry to our everyday lives. However, the Maillard reaction also occurs in all cells, from prokaryotes to eukaryotes, forming advanced glycation end-products (AGEs). AGEs are a heterogeneous group of compounds resulting from the irreversible reaction between biomolecules and Î±-dicarbonyls (Î±-DCs), including methylglyoxal (MGO), an unavoidable byproduct of anaerobic glycolysis and lipid peroxidation. We previously demonstrated that <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> mutants lacking the <italic>glod-4</italic> glyoxalase enzyme displayed enhanced accumulation of Î±-DCs, reduced lifespan, increased neuronal damage, and touch hypersensitivity. Here, we demonstrate that <italic>glod-4</italic> mutation increased food intake and identify that MGO-derived hydroimidazolone, MG-H1, is a mediator of the observed increase in food intake. RNAseq analysis in <italic>glod-4</italic> knockdown worms identified upregulation of several neurotransmitters and feeding genes. Suppressor screening of the overfeeding phenotype identified the <italic>tdc-1</italic>-tyramine-<italic>tyra-2/ser-2</italic> signaling as an essential pathway mediating AGE (MG-H1)-induced feeding in <italic>glod-4</italic> mutants. We also identified the <italic>elt-3</italic> GATA transcription factor as an essential upstream regulator for increased feeding upon accumulation of AGEs by partially controlling the expression of <italic>tdc-1</italic> gene. Furthermore, the lack of either <italic>tdc-1</italic> or <italic>tyra-2/ser-2</italic> receptors suppresses the reduced lifespan and rescues neuronal damage observed in <italic>glod-4</italic> mutants. Thus, in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, we identified an <italic>elt-3</italic> regulated tyramine-dependent pathway mediating the toxic effects of MG-H1 AGE. Understanding this signaling pathway may help understand hedonistic overfeeding behavior observed due to modern AGE-rich diets.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>feeding</kwd><kwd>advanced glycation end-products</kwd><kwd>glod-4</kwd><kwd>elt-3</kwd><kwd>tyramine</kwd><kwd>pharyngeal pumping</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>C. elegans</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01AG061165</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kapahi</surname><given-names>Pankaj</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01AG068288</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kapahi</surname><given-names>Pankaj</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100001167</institution-id><institution>Larry L.

In 1912, a French Chemist, L.C. Maillard, reported a reaction between glucose and glycine upon heating, resulting in the formation of brown pigments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Maillard, 1912</xref>). Later, the covalent bonds formed between carbohydrates and proteins during heating in a non-enzymatic browning reaction was named the Maillard reaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Jaeger et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Liu et al., 2020</xref>). Glycation is a part of the Maillard reaction, or browning of food, during cooking which enhances the taste, color, and aroma of the food to make it more palatable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Maillard, 1912</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lima, 2013</xref>). The Maillard reaction has revolutionized the food industry by playing an important role in food chemistry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Machiels and Istasse, 2022</xref>); however, this reaction also results in the formation of adverse AGEs as well as toxic byproducts including acrylamide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Luca et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Mottram et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Stadler et al., 2002</xref>).</p><p>In addition to food sources, AGEs are also endogenously produced in cells when Î±-dicarbonyl compounds (Î±-DCs) (such as glyoxal [GO], methylglyoxal [MGO], and 3-deoxyglucosone [3DG]) non-enzymatically react with biomolecules. Î±-DCs are unavoidable byproducts of cellular metabolisms, such as glycolysis and lipid peroxidation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). AGEs include GO derivatives such as carboxymethyl lysine (CML) and glyoxal lysine dimer (GOLD). AGEs derived from MGO include hydroimidazolone (MG-H1), carboxyethyl lysine (CEL), and methylglyoxal lysine dimer (MOLD), and 3DG derivatives include 3-deoxyglucosone-derived imidazolium cross-link (DOGDIC), pyrraline, etc. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chaudhuri et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Allaman et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chen et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Vistoli et al., 2013</xref>). The glyoxalase system utilizes enzymes Glo1 and Glo2 and reduced glutathione (GSH) to detoxify Î±-DCs stress, especially MGO to lactate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), in cytosol and nucleus. Differential expression levels of glyoxalases are reported in various disease conditions such as diabetes, hypertension, neurodegenerative disorders, anxiety disorders, infertility, and cancer, suggesting their role in exacerbating their pathogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">He et al., 2020</xref>). Glo1 has been linked with several behavioral phenotypes, such as anxiety, depression, autism, and pain, among other mental illnesses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Distler and Palmer, 2012</xref>). Also, we have previously demonstrated increased neuronal damage in the <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans glod-4</italic> glyoxalase mutant model, which is shown to accumulate high levels of Î±-DCs and AGEs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1H, I</xref>); (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chaudhuri et al., 2016</xref>). AGEs accumulate in long-lived proteins, such as collagen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Monnier et al., 1984</xref>); furthermore, quantifying the glycated form of hemoglobin (HbA1c) is utilized as a biomarker in diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Rahbar et al., 1969</xref>). Increased AGEs are associated with aging, obesity, diabetes, neurodegeneration, inflammation, cardiomyopathy, nephropathy, and other age-related diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chaudhuri et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Ramasamy et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Prasad et al., 2019</xref>). Furthermore, neurodegenerative diseases have also demonstrated a strong correlation between increased levels of AGEs and pathogenesis.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Graphical representation for the formation of Î±-dicarbonyls and advanced glycation end-products (AGEs).</title><p>Dicarbonyls are highly reactive byproducts from metabolic pathways such as lipid peroxidation and glycolysis. In the above example, methylglyoxal (MGO) spontaneously forms from dihydroxyacetone phosphate which interacts with biomolecules resulting in the formation of AGEs.

Obesity is a key risk factor for other diseases including diabetes, hypertension, cancers, cardiovascular, inflammatory, and neurodegenerative disorders, among other non-communicable chronic diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lee and Yau, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Miller and Spencer, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Wolin et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Ellulu et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Keramat et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Uribarri et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Ruhm, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hossain et al., 2007</xref>). Thus, identifying signaling pathways that modulate increased feeding behavior is important to understand the underlying causes of obesity and identify novel therapeutics to overcome it. Here, we report that loss of the glyoxalase system or exogenously feeding MGO-derived AGEs increased feeding behavior in <italic>C. elegans</italic>. We also identified the mechanism for the observed phenotype and found that the MGO-derived AGE, MG-H1, acts via the <italic>elt-3</italic> GATA transcription factor (TF), to partially regulate the expression of <italic>tdc-1</italic> gene (tyramine decarboxylase â an enzyme that biosynthesis neurotransmitter tyramine), and tyramine receptors <italic>(tyra-2</italic> and <italic>ser-2</italic>) to mediate adverse effects of AGEs such as increased feeding, reduced lifespan, and neuronal damages. This study is the first to identify the signaling pathway mediated by specific AGEs molecules downstream of MGO (such as MG-H1) to enhance feeding and neurodegeneration. Our study emphasizes that AGEs accumulation is deleterious and enhances disease pathology in different conditions, including obesity and neurodegeneration. Hence, limiting AGEs accumulation is relevant to the global increase in obesity and other age-associated diseases.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>AGEs increase food intake and food-seeking behavior in <italic>C. elegans</italic></title><p>Our initial observations revealed that <italic>glod-4</italic> glyoxalases enzyme mutants exhibit a significantly enhanced pharyngeal pumping than wildtype N2 animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>).

In this study, using genetic mutants, RNAi knockdown, synthesized AGEs, and functional genomics, we elucidate that AGEs (especially MG-H1) induce increased feeding through tyramine signaling regulated by GATA transcription factor ELT-3. The <italic>glod-4</italic> KO worms, with enhance AGEs accumulation, showed increased feeding, which led to the hypothesis that increased accumulation of AGEs is a potential stimulator of binge feeding. Thus, we studied changes in pumping rate by exogenous administration of MGO and AGEs. As previously reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Ravichandran et al., 2018</xref>, MGO treatment did not change the pumping rate; however, MG-H1 and CEL increased the pumping rate in wildtype N2 worms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1E</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Ravichandran et al., 2018</xref>). Furthermore, a recent study demonstrated that treatment with sugar-derived AGE-modified bovine serum albumin accelerated the pharyngeal pumping rate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Papaevgeniou et al., 2019</xref>). Our study demonstrates that either treatment with purified MG-H1 or endogenous production and accumulation of MG-H1 via genetic mutation increases feeding and adversely affects lifespan. We also found that MG-H1-induced hyper-feeding is independent of serotonin-mediated hyper-feeding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">DalliÃ¨re et al., 2017</xref>) in <italic>C. elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1BâD</xref>).</p><p>Our detailed investigation of the time-dependent increase in pumping rate after MG-H1 treatment indicates a more robust and highly significant increase after 24 hr of treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). We also observed a MG-H1 dose-dependent increase in feeding rate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>), which is based on the stronger significance (lower p-value) caused by reduced dispersion of the data at higher concentrations of MG-H1. Our analysis indicates that higher concentrations of MG-H1 can increase the pharyngeal pumping in almost all the treatment worms, thus predisposing the worms with lower pumping rates in the Gaussian distribution to higher pumping rates. It is well established that AGEs are formed during cooking, browning the food during dry heating, making the food more appetizing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Vistoli et al., 2013</xref>). Furthermore, feeding is a multisensorial process regulated by several signaling pathways subjected to evolutionary adaptations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Luca et al., 2010</xref>). Thus, we wanted to analyze the changes in sensory behavior of <italic>C. elegans</italic> induced by either endogenous accumulation of AGEs or by exogenous administration of MG-H1 with the food. Since the <italic>glod-4</italic> mutant lacks glyoxalase system to detoxify MGO and leads to the accumulation of AGEs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), the MG-H1-mediated signaling pathway can be responsible for the increased chemoattraction of <italic>glod-4</italic> mutant worms to food source OP50-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). It can be explained that including MG-H1 in bacterial lawn increased the chemoattraction of wildtype N2 worms toward food, resulting in increased attraction to palatable MG-H1-mixed bacterial food OP50-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>). However, unlike wildtype N2 worms, exogenous MG-H1 treatment had no further increase in the feeding rate or chemoattraction of <italic>glod-4</italic> mutant worms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D, H</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1F</xref>), indicating the maximum sensory modulation attained by the endogenous accumulation of MG-H1 in the <italic>glod-4</italic> mutant. Although our screening identified CEL, a lysine-derived adduct of MGO, as another AGEs increasing the food intake, a detailed analysis is necessary to conclude the effect of CEL on feeding behavior (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1E</xref>).</p><p>We utilized RNAseq data from <italic>glod-4</italic> knockdown worms to identify the novel signaling pathway that mediates AGE-induced feeding in <italic>C. elegans</italic>. Since <italic>glod-4</italic> knockdown data are enriched with several genes regulating the synthesis of neurotransmitters and feeding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1</xref>), we performed suppression screening in mutant worms for genes involved in synthesizing biogenic amine neurotransmitters after MG-H1 treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3âfigure supplement 2A, C</xref>). Thus, our screen identified <italic>tdc-1</italic>, involved in tyramine biosynthesis, and tyramine receptors (<italic>tyra-2</italic> and <italic>ser-2</italic>) to mediate AGE-induced increased pharyngeal pumping (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3CâF</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3âfigure supplement 2</xref>). Tryptophan and tyrosine are the substrates for synthesizing biogenic amines implicated in modulating various behaviors in <italic>C. elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chase and Koelle, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alkema et al., 2005</xref>). Tyrosine to tyramine conversion in the presence of the enzyme tyrosine decarboxylase (TDC-1) followed by tyramine Î²-hydroxylase (TBH-1), is crucial for the synthesis of neurotransmitters tyramine and octopamine, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alkema et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Greer et al., 2008</xref>). Previous studies have shown the role of tyramine and its receptor (<italic>ser-2</italic>) in regulating feeding and foraging behavior in <italic>C. elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">DalliÃ¨re et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Greer et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Rex et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Li et al., 2012</xref>). Furthermore, the <italic>tyra-2</italic> receptor is expressed in MC (Marginal Cell) and NSM (NeuroSecretory Motor) pharyngeal neurons and is discussed to regulate pharyngeal pumping potentially (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">DalliÃ¨re et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Rex et al., 2005</xref>). Especially, tyramine has been shown to reduce pharyngeal pumping when applied exogenously to the worms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">DalliÃ¨re et al., 2017</xref>). Supporting previous findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">DalliÃ¨re et al., 2017</xref>), our observation shows increased pharyngeal pumping in <italic>tyra-2</italic> and <italic>ser-2</italic> single mutant worms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E, F</xref>); at the same time, <italic>tdc-1</italic> single mutants did not increase pumping (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). Converse to our observation of <italic>tyra-2</italic> and <italic>ser-2</italic> single mutants, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Greer et al., 2008</xref> did not find any difference in the pumping rate of <italic>tyra-2</italic> and <italic>ser-2</italic> single mutants compared to wildtype N2 worms. However, the same study reported no changes in the pumping rate of the <italic>tdc-1</italic> single mutant, similar to our results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Greer et al., 2008</xref>), which is also demonstrated by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Li et al., 2012</xref>. Interestingly, double mutants of either <italic>tdc-1</italic> or its receptors (<italic>tyra-2-</italic>partial suppression and <italic>ser-2</italic>) with <italic>glod-4</italic> mutant significantly suppress the increased pharyngeal pumping observed in either <italic>glod-4</italic> or <italic>tyra-2</italic> or <italic>ser-2</italic> single mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3DâF</xref>). It is to be noted that only two interneurons, namely RIM (Ring Interneuron M) and RIC (Ring Interneuron C) neurons, uv1 cells near vulva and gonadal sheath cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alkema et al., 2005</xref>) express the <italic>tdc-1</italic> gene, which is involved in the biosynthesis of tyramine; however, receptors of tyramine are expressed in distant tissues explaining an endocrine activity for tyramine neurotransmitter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">DalliÃ¨re et al., 2017</xref>) leading to the multi-pathway mode of action to exert differential response which should be elucidated in the future. Since <italic>ser-3</italic> mutant worms did not suppress the pumping (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3âfigure supplement 2C</xref>) and <italic>ser-3</italic> has been demonstrated to be a receptor for octopamine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">DalliÃ¨re et al., 2017</xref>), we conclude that octopamine is not responsible for mediating MG-H1-induced feeding in <italic>C. elegans</italic>.</p><p>Our suppressor screen for the upstream effector of the <italic>tdc-1</italic>-tyramine-<italic>tyra-2/ser-2</italic> pathway that mediates MG-H1-induced increased feeding identified the <italic>elt-3</italic> TF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C, D</xref>). Thus, we examined whether <italic>elt-3</italic> TF regulates the <italic>tdc-1</italic>, <italic>tyra-2</italic>, or <italic>ser-2</italic>. Our analysis revealed that in <italic>elt-3</italic> mutant worms, the <italic>tdc-1</italic> gene is significantly reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>), concluding that <italic>elt-3</italic> TF regulates tyramine biosynthesis. In favor of the data, HOMER analysis identified that the <italic>tdc-1</italic> gene is potentially regulated by <italic>elt-3</italic> TF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4âfigure supplement 1C</xref>). Although <italic>elt-3</italic> TF is predominantly expressed in hypodermal cells, its expression is also reported in the pharyngealâintestinal valve, intestine, a few neurons (head neurons and mechanosensory PVD (Posterior Ventral process D) neuron), etc. (Wormbase.org). In accordance with <italic>elt-3</italic> expression in PVD neurons and head neurons, <italic>tyra-2</italic> is also expressed in PVD neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Rex et al., 2005</xref>) and <italic>tdc-1</italic> in RIM and RIC head interneurons, respectively, suggesting a possible direct/partial regulation of <italic>tdc-1</italic> expression by <italic>elt-3</italic>. Also, <italic>tyra-2</italic> expression has been reported in pharyngeal MC neurons, which directly regulate pharyngeal pumping (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Rex et al., 2005</xref>), suggesting direct endocrine action of tyramine. Similarly, <italic>ser-2</italic> is expressed in pharyngeal muscle segment cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Rex et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Li et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Tsalik et al., 2003</xref>). Increased expression of <italic>ser-2</italic> in <italic>elt-3</italic> mutant worms can be inferred as a compensatory mechanism for reduced tyramine signaling by increasing the expression of the tyramine receptor. Also, <italic>ser-2</italic> expression is significantly increased in MG-H1 treated wildtype N2 worms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). Although the mechanism of MG-H1-induced expression of <italic>ser-2</italic> is unclear, it is evident that the <italic>ser-2</italic> genetic mutant can suppress the increased feeding in the <italic>glod-4</italic> mutant (double mutants) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>), demonstrating an important role of the SER-2 receptor in mediating the MG-H1-induced feeding via tyramine. Furthermore, <italic>elt-3</italic> expression levels significantly increased after MG-H1 treatment. Altogether, our data strongly suggest the role of the <italic>elt-3-tdc-1</italic>-tyramine-<italic>tyra-2/ser-2</italic> pathway in mediating enhanced feeding. Finally, it is essential to note that the <italic>ser-2</italic> gene is upregulated in the <italic>glod-4</italic> knockdown RNAseq dataset, similar to significant upregulation after MG-H1 treatment, validating that MG-H1 is a critical player in mediating adverse phenotypes observed in <italic>glod-4</italic> mutant worms.</p><p>Exogenous tyramine suppressed pharyngeal pumping in N2 wildtype worms; however, tyramine rescued the pumping in double mutants (<italic>elt-3;glod-4</italic> and <italic>tdc-1;glod-4</italic>) to that of <italic>glod-4</italic> single mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Although our data strongly demonstrate the role of tyramine signaling in increasing feeding rate in <italic>glod-4</italic> mutant background, our study also identified a paradox in tyramine signaling to regulated pharyngeal pumping. From the literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">DalliÃ¨re et al., 2017</xref>) as well as from our data, it is evident that tyramine suppresses pumping in N2 wildtype genetic background (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). The mechanism behind this behavioral switch, that is, from suppressor of pharyngeal pumping in wildtype to a stimulator in <italic>glod-4</italic> mutant background, remains elusive. It can be speculated that MG-H1 can modify the tissue-specific expression of tyramine receptors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>), resulting in an observed behavioral switch in response to tyramine signaling. This hypothesis can only be addressed by methodologies such as single-cell RNA sequencing and exploration of cellular signaling circuitry in further studies. Thus, our current understanding is that MG-H1 (either exogenous or endogenous accumulation in <italic>glod-4</italic> KO) modifies tyramine signaling by modulating genes in the tyramine pathway, leading to an increased feeding rate in <italic>C. elegans</italic>.</p><p>Previously, we have demonstrated reduced lifespan, hyperesthesia, and accelerated neurodegeneration-like phenotypes observed in diabetic conditions caused by excessive accumulation of Î±-DCs in <italic>glod-4</italic> mutant worms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chaudhuri et al., 2016</xref>). Lack of dicarbonyl detoxification by glyoxalases enzyme in <italic>glod-4</italic> mutant worms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) should result in the accumulation of AGEs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1H, I</xref>), which at sufficient concentration act as signaling molecules to modulate the feeding behavior (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) by causing differential gene expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). The increased amount of dicarbonyl stress, thereby AGEs, is observed in several systemic diseases such as obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular and neurodegenerative diseases, among other age-associated diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chaudhuri et al., 2018</xref>). In diabetic patients, three times higher plasma levels of MGO have been reported and is a leading cause of neuropathic pain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bierhaus et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Rabbani and Thornalley, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kold-Christensen et al., 2019</xref>). Earlier reports in the literature show that the dicarbonyl levels correlate with diabetic complications. One of the major risk factors for diabetes is obesity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Ismail et al., 2021</xref>), which is caused by overfeeding. Thus, exploring the regulatory pathways of feeding is essential to understand and identify ways to modulate feeding behavior.</p><p>Here, we show that AGEs can modulate feeding behavior in evolutionary primitive model organisms, and it will be worth exploring this pathway in mammals. The TF <italic>elt-3</italic> belongs to the GATA TF family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gilleard et al., 1999</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Shobatake et al., 2018</xref> report that GATA 2 and 3 TFs induce the expression of appetite regulator genes such as POMC and CART (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Shobatake et al., 2018</xref>). With the easy availability and unlimited access to modern-day processed food enriched in sugars and AGEs resulting in overeating, a significant cause of the obesity pandemic, it is necessary to explore signals regulating feeding. Importantly, our study shows exogenous treatment with MG-H1 increases feeding in worms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C, D</xref>), indicating that a high AGEs diet in our day-to-day life can modulate feeding behavior in humans. It is well known that food cooked by grilling, broiling, roasting, searing, and frying accelerates the formation of AGEs in food; thus, methods are explored to cook food with fewer AGEs accumulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Uribarri et al., 2010</xref>). Furthermore, increased caloric intake and changes in eating habits have been reported in a behavioral variant of frontotemporal dementia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aiello et al., 2016</xref>) and medication of antipsychotic drugs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Perez-Gomez et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Finally, we show that a lack of <italic>tdc-1</italic>-tyramine signaling rescues <italic>glod-4</italic> mutant phenotypes (lifespan and neuronal damage) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). A strong association between worsening PD phenotypes with increased aggregation of Î±-synuclein and specific sites of increased glycation has been demonstrated in different genetic models with increased AGEs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Vicente Miranda et al., 2017</xref>). Thus, it will be interesting to investigate the role of the <italic>tdc-1</italic>-tyramine pathway in modulating pathways enhancing neurodegeneration and feeding. Recent research identified neurodegenerative diseases to be influenced by metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Muddapu et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Procaccini et al., 2016</xref>) and <italic>glod-4</italic> mutants demonstrate increased neuronal damage, decreased lifespan, and increased feeding. Thus, it is essential to investigate the balance in energy metabolism to identify critical pathways to modulate the outcome of neurodegenerative diseases.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Strains</title><p>Strains were either obtained from <italic>Caenorhabditis</italic> Genetic Center (CGC), Minneapolis, USA or National Bioresource Project, Tokyo, Japan and the following strains were used: N2 (wt), VC343 <italic>glod-4(gk189)</italic>, VC143 <italic>elt-3(gk121)</italic>, MT13113 <italic>tdc-1(n3419)</italic>, MT10661 <italic>tdc-1(n3420)</italic>, FX1846 <italic>tyra-2(tm1846)</italic>, RB1690 <italic>ser-2(ok2103)</italic>, MT9455 <italic>tbh-1(n3247)</italic>, CB1112 <italic>cat-2(e1112)</italic>, MT15434 <italic>tph-1(mg280)</italic>, DA1814 <italic>ser-1(ok345)</italic>, RB1631 <italic>ser-3(ok2007)</italic>, RB745 <italic>ser-4(ok512)</italic>, VC125 <italic>tyra-3(ok325)</italic>, and OH438 otls117[<italic>unc-33p::gfp + unc-4(+)</italic>].

Grinder movement in the terminal bulb was used as a read-out for the pumping rate phenotype. Pharyngeal pumping was recorded using a Leica M165 FC microscope; thus, obtained movies were played at Ã0.25 times the original speed and a manual counter was used to count the number of pumps for 30 s. For quick pumping screening (pumping data in the figure supplements), the pumping rate was counted in real time for 30 s using a stopwatch and a manual counter focusing the grinder using an Olympus SZ61 stereomicroscope.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Jessica Tyler as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) As you will see from the reviews attached below, all reviewers found this manuscript interesting and were enthusiastic about the central idea of the work. However, all three reviewers also agreed that there were mechanistic deficiencies in the manuscript that make it unsuitable for publication in <italic>eLife</italic> without additional data. In particular the reviewers agreed that mechanistic data about how MGH1 acts on the tyraminergic pathway to potentiate food intake were lacking in several places and weak in others (e.g., the elt-3 and tdc-1 data), and require strengthening to better support the proposed model. Specific rescues (elt-3 and tdc-1), functional experiments, and manipulation of tyramine-producing cell activity are all important approaches to obtain mechanistic information that will help identify how some of these players interact with each other (e.g., the cells and circuits that govern the processes).</p><p>2) Additional experiments, such as bacterial clearance (reviewer 1, comment 4), and something to rectify reviewer 3, comment 2, should also be completed.</p><p>3) Additionally, please note that both reviewer 1 and reviewer 3 point out several instances in the writing and/or figures that require clarification/revision, although these revisions may or may not require data depending on the response (e.g., pumping controls, backcrossing of worms). All reviewer comments are included below for individual responses.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>These are the points that I feel need to be addressed:</p><p>1) The authors claim that MGH-1 modulates (positively) the tyraminergic signal through the activation of the TF elt-3. This is based on the fact that mutations in both tdc-1 and elt-3 suppress the exacerbated pharyngeal pumping of glod-4 mutants (Figure 2E and 3D), that elt-3 expression is increased in MGH1-treated worms (Figure 3F) and that in elt-3-deficient mutants tdc-1 expression is low (Figure 3 E).</p><p>First, only two determinations are shown in Figure 3 E (where the mRNA of various elt-3 targets is measured). I think it is too premature to draw conclusions with n=2. It is important to increase the n, especially considering that this is a relevant figure for the whole conclusion of the paper.</p><p>Assuming that the conclusions obtained in Figure 1 E are valid, the reasoning that MGH-1 induces the tyraminergic signal through the activation of the TF elt-3 sounds logical. However, this hypothesis does not agree with other data. For instance, MGH-1 treatment does not significantly modulate tdc-1 expression (Figure 1 F). Ser-2 expression is induced upon MGH-1 treatment (Figure 1F) but does not respond to elt-3 (Figure 1E). This raises questions as to how all these players interrelate to modulate the increase in feeding due to AGEs.</p><p>It may be possible that the increase in elt-3 upon MGH1 treatment is not sufficient to positively modulate tdc-1 Expression? In this context, one can think that a basal level of elt-3 is needed because otherwise, tyramine release would be low (and this explains the glod-4, tdc-1 and glod-4; elt-3 phenotypes?).</p><p>tdc-1 rescue assays with promoters lacking the elt-3 TF binding sequence could demonstrate how important the modulation of tdc-1 expression by elt-3 is during MGH-1 accumulation.</p><p>2) Results page 6 (line 117): As exogenous serotonin increases bacterial clearance in glod-4 animals, the authors claim that the increase in pharyngeal pumping in these animals is independent of serotonin. This is not concluded from this experiment. It may in fact be the case that even though it depends on endogenous serotonin release, the exogenous addition of serotonin at a high concentration may further induce pharyngeal pumping. The experiment in the manuscript that actually shows that the induction of pharyngeal pumping by MGH-1 does not depend on serotonin is shown in Figure suppl. 2 A, where MGH-1 treatment induces pumping even in tph-1 worms. To assume that the increase in pumping in glod-4 is independent of 5ht, one would have to compare the pharyngeal pumping (and bacterial clearance) of tph-1 and glod-4;tph-1 worms.</p><p>3) Results Page 7 &quot;In addition, we also demonstrated that MG-H1 regulates pharyngeal pumping rate in a dose-dependent manner (Figure 1E)&quot;. To assert this, one would have to compare the pharyngeal pumping between the MGH-1 conditions themselves, rather than doing a student test against the naive condition. In addition, it would be advisable to do the experiments on the same day (given the variation in pharyngeal pumping in the naive condition. For example, the first naive shows a lot of dispersion and the third naive condition seems to have a lower average than the first one).</p><p>4) Results Page 7 (line 130). &quot;In addition to food consumption, glod-4 mutant exhibited a significantly increased preference towards food source OP50-1 at day 1 and day 3 of adulthood compared to wild-type N2 worms (Figure 1F + Figure Suppl. 1F). Furthermore, we noticed that wild-type N2 worms preferred exogenous MG-H1 compared to MGO when provided with bacterial food source <italic>E. coli</italic> OP50-1. We did not observe this phenotype in the glod-4 mutant background (Figure 1G), suggesting that MG-H1 and glod-4 null mutation increases feeding by overlapping mechanism.&quot;</p><p>While the food race experiments may be interesting, the connection with increased food intake is, at the very least, very indirect. The experiment that would actually demonstrate that MGH1 and glod-4 null mutation increases feeding by overlapping mechanism would be the bacterial clearance assay shown in Figure 1D, where the addition of MGH1 does not increase bacterial clearance in a glod-4 mutant background. Something similar could be done with pharyngeal pumping, to confirm the overlapping mechanisms.</p><p>With respect to figure 1G, what would be the value corresponding to the attraction to MGO? It is not indicated on the axis.</p><p>Beyond that, these food race experiments should not be included in the context of enhanced feeding rate.</p><p>5) There is a very large variation in wild-type pharyngeal pumping between experiments. For example, in some experiments it is as high as (160 pp/30sec. Figure 3c) and in others it can be as low as (110 pp/30sec. Figure 2Suppl.) While I understand that for the supplementary figures the authors performed a quick count the difference is still large. Even within the main figures there is a high variation in the controls (see, for example, Figures 2 E, F and G). While I understand that experiments such as pharyngeal pumping can be variable between experiments, I am particularly struck by such variation. Are all the experiments done with animals of the same age and raised under exactly the same conditions?</p><p>6) It is not clear, and the authors do not present any model of the mechanism by which MGH1 excess modulates the tyraminergic signal to increase food intake. It is only shown that elt-3 may be important and that tdc-1, ser-2 and tyra-2 appear to be relevant. There are no rescue or functional experiments showing where these players would be playing their role.</p><p>For example, would tyramine release be affected at the level of RIM, RIC or UV cells? Perhaps it would be good to specifically silence these neurons (e.g. with the expression of histamine-triggered anion channels, see Pokala et al., PNAS, 2014 or De Rosa et al., Nature, 2019) and see if MGH-1 is able to induce pharyngeal pumping.</p><p>It is also unclear where elt-3 is relevant. It would be important to express this TF specifically in tdc-1 expressing cells and analyze whether the response is similar to wild-type.</p><p>This is one of my main concerns regarding the manuscript. The lack of mechanistic details to understand how AGEs accumulation increases food intake argues against the significance of the work.</p><p>7) Exogenous TA has been shown to reduce pharyngeal pumping (Greer et al., 2008). Furthermore, the absence of SER-2 suppresses the tyraminergic inhibition of exacerbated pharyngeal pumping in serotonin-treated worms (Rex et a, 2004. https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1471-4159.2004.02787.x).</p><p>Since the authors' results point more towards a positive modulation of pharyngeal pumping by tyramine and ser-2 , it would be important to discuss this paradox further.</p><p>8) Many of the strains listed have not been backcrossed to clean up the background. For example: RB1690 ser-2(ok2103); VC343 glod-4(gk189); VC125 tyra-3(ok325); RB745 ser-4(ok512), etc. For tyra-2 it is not indicated which strain is used.</p><p>If backcrosses have not been performed, it is essential to perform the experiments with the clean strains. If they have done them, the strain they used for the experiments is not called as they named it. Please clarify this.</p><p>At the same time, it would be advisable that in the absence of rescue experiments, they use other alleles to confirm the observed phenotypes.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The study is generally well done, but the strains don't appear to be outcrossed, and none of the effects are rescued. At least for the main results, tdc-1 and elt-3, there are multiple mutants available at CGC. The authors should rescue the original mutant or show the same results using a different allele. It would also be helpful for the reader to show the alleles in the figure legend.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>There are several points that need to be substantially improved.</p><p>1. The writing of the manuscript needs to be improved substantially. The introduction is very confusing with too many abbreviations. I would suggest a diagram to show the reaction of Î±-dicarbonyl (Î±-DG), AGEs, glyoxalases. In each of these terms, you can list the examples in that category, for example: Î±-DG (MGO, GO, 3DG etc.), AGEs (MG-H1, CEL, CML, GOLD, MOLD), glyoxalases (glod-4, glod-1, etc.). The introduction is not organized with a focus in each paragraph. Transitions between sentences need to be improved substantially too.</p><p>2. It is not explained or addressed in the manuscript why glod-4 KO in which we would expect less MG-H1, and MG-H1 supplementation both increase pumping. It will be helpful to measure MG-H1 level in glod-4 KO. This will also help to understand the result that the pumping rate increases are MG-H1 dose-dependent, however, glod-4 KO and MG-H1 supplementation is not additive in the increase of pumping.</p><p>3. Figure 2B shows all 66 genes are upregulated in glod-4 compared to WT. A concern is whether the gene expression is properly normalized. Are there downregulated genes other than the 66 genes? How many genes are up- and down- regulated in glod-4 vs. WT. All these necessary descriptions are not mentioned in the results part. The labeling of both A and B panels are too small for recognizing the gene and pathway names. Among the 66 &quot;neurotransmitters and feeding genes&quot;, how many of them are neurotransmitter genes and how were they defined? Are tph-1, tdc-1, tbh-1, cat-2 genes in this list? Similar question, how were the &quot;feeding genes&quot; defined?</p><p>4. Figure 2B used glod-4 RNAi while other results pumping data were collected on glod-4KO. Why glod-4 KO was not used in transcriptomics data. And please label on panel B indicating glod-4 RNAi. And it is described in the method part that RNA-seq was done on &quot;N2 and mutant animals&quot; but not RNAi.</p><p>5. tdc-1 and the two tyramine receptors knockouts abrogate pumping rate by MG-H1 and glod-4. This would indicate that tyramine release is necessary for the pumping rate increase by MG-H1 and glod-4. Did the author try rescue the abrogation by tyramine supplementation? This is a valid control to strengthen the hypothesis.</p><p>6. The authors previously showed that glod-4 KO shortens lifespan, and supplementation of glod-4 substrates MGO also shortens lifespan. The results in Figure 4 of lifespan rescue by tdc-1 is not sufficient to support that increased feeding shortens glod-4 KO lifespan suggested in the manuscript. The valid conclusion from this data is that the lifespan decreases by glod-4 KO requires tyramine synthesis and probably tyramine signaling since the two receptors are also required for the shorter lifespan. Does MG-H1 addition rescue or further shorten glod-4 KO lifespan since MG-H1 also increases pumping rate not additively to glod-4 KO? Figure 4D labeling is too small.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.82446.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) As you will see from the reviews attached below, all reviewers found this manuscript interesting and were enthusiastic about the central idea of the work.

We also appreciate the strengths pointed out by the reviewers and their constructive feedback. We address these concerns below.</p><p>To strongly demonstrate the necessity of tyramine signaling in <italic>glod-4</italic> mutants to increase pharyngeal pumping, we supplemented tyramine exogenously (instead of laser ablation/manipulation of tyramine-producing cells) to either <italic>elt-3;glod-4</italic> or <italic>tdc-1;glod-4</italic> double mutants and analyzed the pumping behavior. Further, we chose to supplement tyramine as a rescue strategy in the mutants that lack tyramine signaling. Our new results in Figure B+C demonstrate that exogenous tyramine treatment of double mutants increased their pumping levels to <italic>glod-4</italic> single mutant worms. Thus, supporting the hypothesis that lack of <italic>elt-3</italic> reduces tyramine signaling (note the reduced expression of <italic>tdc-1</italic> in <italic>elt-3</italic> mutants, Figure 4E) to suppress the pumping in <italic>elt-3;glod-4</italic> double mutants. This data also demonstrates the importance of <italic>elt-3</italic> in mediating increased pumping in <italic>glod-4</italic> mutants via tyramine. Similarly, exogenous tyramine supplementation in <italic>tdc-1;glod-4</italic> double mutant also increased pharyngeal pumping to <italic>glod-4</italic> single mutant levels. However, the pumping is not increased in double mutants such as <italic>ser-2;glod-4,</italic> and <italic>tyra-2;glod-4</italic> which lacks tyramine receptors (Figure D+E).</p><p>Further, we have shown in Figure 4F that MG-H1 treatment of N2 wildtype worms modulates the expression levels of the gene in the tyramine signaling pathway, i.e., increases the expression of <italic>elt-3</italic> as well as <italic>ser-2</italic> which are essential for increased feeding in <italic>glod-4</italic> mutants (Figure 3+4). Thus, either exogenous treatment of MG-H1 or <italic>glod-4</italic> mutants (with increased accumulation of MG-H1, Figure2âfigure supplement 1H+1I) increased tyramine signaling by modulating genes in the tyramine pathway. The mechanism is explained in the discussion of the revised manuscript on pages 21 and 22.</p><p>However, treatment of N2 wildtype worms with tyramine resulted in a significant decrease in the pharyngeal pumping (Figure 5A). Also, tyramine is shown to suppress pharyngeal pumping in N2 wildtype worms (1). These findings demonstrate that tyramine increases pharyngeal pumping only in the <italic>glod-4</italic> mutant background but decreases pumping in the N2 wildtype background. The mechanism behind this behavioral switch upon activation of the tyramine signaling pathway (i.e., from a suppressor of pharyngeal pumping in wildtype into a stimulator in <italic>glod-4</italic> mutant background) remains elusive. Although <italic>tdc-</italic>1 is expressed only in RIC, RIM, UV2 cells and gonadal sheath cells, tyramine receptors are located at distinct tissues (1) (2); thus, it can be speculated that AGEs, especially MG-H1, can modify the tissue-specific expression of tyramine receptors resulting in observed behavioral switch in response to tyramine signaling. This hypothesis can only be addressed by methodologies such as single-cell RNA sequencing which is beyond the scope of the current study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Additional experiments, such as bacterial clearance (reviewer 1, comment 4), and something to rectify reviewer 3, comment 2, should also be completed.</p></disp-quote><p>We have addressed reviewer 1-comment 4 and reviewer 3-comment 2 with appropriate experiments and explanation, please refer below.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Additionally, please note that both reviewer 1 and reviewer 3 point out several instances in the writing and/or figures that require clarification/revision, although these revisions may or may not require data depending on the response (e.g., pumping controls, backcrossing of worms).

In this context, one can think that a basal level of elt-3 is needed because otherwise, tyramine release would be low (and this explains the glod-4, tdc-1 and glod-4; elt-3 phenotypes?).</p><p>tdc-1 rescue assays with promoters lacking the elt-3 TF binding sequence could demonstrate how important the modulation of tdc-1 expression by elt-3 is during MGH-1 accumulation.</p></disp-quote><p>We show that MG-H1 treatment modulates factors in the <italic>elt-3-tdc-1</italic>/tyramine pathways (Figure 4F, especially increased expression of <italic>elt-3</italic> and <italic>ser-2</italic> genes) to increase pharyngeal pumping. In order to strengthen the involvement of tyramine signaling, we supplemented tyramine (tyramine rescue) to either <italic>elt-3;glod-4,</italic> or <italic>tdc-1;glod-4</italic> double mutant instead of <italic>tdc-1</italic> rescue suggested by the reviewer. Our results in Figure B+C demonstrate that exogenous tyramine treatment of double mutants increased the pumping levels to <italic>glod-4</italic> single mutant worms.

This is not concluded from this experiment. It may in fact be the case that even though it depends on endogenous serotonin release, the exogenous addition of serotonin at a high concentration may further induce pharyngeal pumping. The experiment in the manuscript that actually shows that the induction of pharyngeal pumping by MGH-1 does not depend on serotonin is shown in Figure suppl. 2 A, where MGH-1 treatment induces pumping even in tph-1 worms.

While I understand that for the supplementary figures the authors performed a quick count the difference is still large. Even within the main figures there is a high variation in the controls (see, for example, Figures 2 E, F and G).

Perhaps it would be good to specifically silence these neurons (e.g. with the expression of histamine-triggered anion channels, see Pokala et al., PNAS, 2014 or De Rosa et al., Nature, 2019) and see if MGH-1 is able to induce pharyngeal pumping.</p><p>It is also unclear where elt-3 is relevant.

Although <italic>tdc-1</italic> is expressed only in RIC, RIM, UV2 pair of cells and gonadal sheath cells, tyramine receptors are located at distinct tissues (1) (2); thus, it can be speculated that AGEs, especially MG-H1, can modify the tissue-specific expression of tyramine receptors resulting in observed behavioral switch in response to tyramine signaling. This hypothesis can only be addressed by methodologies such as single-cell RNA sequencing which is beyond the scope of the current study.
