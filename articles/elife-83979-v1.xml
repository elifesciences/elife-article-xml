elusive. Here, we show that the metabolic enzyme O-GlcNAc Transferase (OGT) moonlights on the chromatin of the <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> gustatory neurons to instruct changes in chromatin accessibility and transcription that underlie sensory adaptations to a high-sugar diet. OGT works synergistically with the Mitogen Activated Kinase/Extracellular signal Regulated Kinase (MAPK/ERK) rolled and its effector stripe (also known as EGR2 or Krox20) to integrate activity information. OGT also cooperates with the epigenetic silencer Polycomb Repressive Complex 2.1 (PRC2.1) to decrease chromatin accessibility and repress transcription in the high-sugar diet. This integration of nutritional and activity information changes the taste neurons’ responses to sugar and the flies’ ability to sense sweetness. Our findings reveal how nutrigenomic signaling generates neural activity and behavior in response to dietary changes in the sensory neurons.</p></abstract><kwd-group

essential role in cellular processes such as growth, division, and differentiation by providing fuel and biomass. However, nutrients can also affect these aspects of cell physiology by influencing, and often orchestrating, gene expression programs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Vaziri and Dus, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dai et al., 2020</xref>). These effects are mediated through nutrient-sensitive modifications to DNA, RNA, and proteins, as well as changes to the activity, binding, and localization of enzymes and signaling factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Huang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Katada et al., 2012</xref>). These nutrigenomic signaling pathways – nutrigenomics is the field that studies food–genes interactions – could explain how the food environment affects the risk of non-communicable diseases such as diabetes, cancer, and neurodegeneration. They also hold the potential to uncover new interventions and treatments for these debilitating diseases. While the effects of nutrients on gene expression are well established, relatively little is known about the molecular mechanisms at the food–gene interface. A significant challenge of the field has been to explain how global variations in the nutrient environment lead to changes in cell physiology and behavior, especially in neuroscience. To overcome these challenges, we have developed an experimental system where the contributions of nutrients to physiology can be studied mechanistically and in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Vaziri and Dus, 2021</xref>). Here, we use this model to characterize how changes in metabolic signaling due to diet are integrated with cellular context to diet nutrient adaptations.</p><p>Taste sensation changes depending on diet composition. In animals, the levels of bitter, sweet, and salty foods influence how these taste stimuli are perceived, with a general inverse relationship between the amount of a particular food in the diet and the responses of the sensory system to it (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">May and Dus, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Sarangi and Dus, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Reed et al., 2020</xref>). For example, in humans and rodents, the dietary concentration of sugars affects sweetness intensity or the electrophysiological responses of the sensory nerves to sucrose (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Wise et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">McCluskey et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Sung et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Sartor et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">May and Dus, 2021</xref>). A similar phenomenon occurs in flies, where diets supplemented with 15–30% sucrose, glucose, or fructose decrease the responses of the sensory neurons to sucrose and the transmission of the sweetness signal to higher brain areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">May et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Vaziri et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Wang et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Ganguly et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">May et al., 2020</xref>). In rats and flies, the dulling of the sensory system to sugar occurs even without weight gain, suggesting that diet exposure is sufficient to drive sweet-taste plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Sung et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">May et al., 2019</xref>). Our previous work in flies implicated metabolic signaling through the Hexosamine Biosynthesis Pathway (HBP) enzyme O-GlcNAc Transferase (OGT) in this phenomenon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">May et al., 2019</xref>). Specifically, knockdown of <italic>OGT</italic> exclusively in the fly sweet-taste cells prevented the neural and behavioral decrease in sugar responses observed with a high-sugar diet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">May et al., 2019</xref>). OGT uses the metabolic end-product of the HBP, UDP-GlcNAc, to post-translationally modify proteins and change their stability or activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Hart, 2019</xref>). OGT activity is sensitive to all cellular levels of UDP-GlcNAc without substrate inhibition, but it is enhanced by high dietary sugar due to a higher flux through the HBP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hanover et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bouché et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Hawkins et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Marshall et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Wang et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Olivier-Van Stichelen et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">May et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Wilinski et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Na et al., 2015</xref>). OGT is also a nucleocytoplasmic protein that interacts with many chromatin- and DNA-modifying complexes; as such, it is thought to function as a nutrigenomic sensor, bridging diet and genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Olivier-Van Stichelen et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Olivier-Van Stichelen and Hanover, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Hart, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Hardivillé and Hart, 2014</xref>). Despite global changes in HBP flux with high dietary sugar, the consequences of OGT activity differ among cell types. Understanding how this occurs would provide an opportunity to study how nutrigenomic signaling is integrated with cell-specific contexts, like activity, to generate unique adaptations. Here, we exploited the effects of OGT on <italic>Drosophila</italic> sensory neurons and the exquisite genetic tools of this organism to investigate this question. Our experiments reveal that nutrigenomic signaling synergizes metabolic state with ongoing cellular physiology to integrate cellular signals. In the sensory neurons, OGT decorates nutrient-sensitive loci also occupied by the epigenetic silencer PRC2.1 and the activity-dependent ERK effector Stripe (Sr). This cooperation leads to changes in chromatin accessibility and transcription that drive sensory plasticity, and the catalytic activity of OGT plays an instructional role in this process. Thus, our results uncover mechanistic insights into how nutrigenomic signaling translates nutritional information into dietary adaptations in the sensory neurons.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>The nutrient sensor OGT decorates the chromatin of sweet sensory cells</title><p>Since transcriptional changes have been implicated in sugar diet-induced taste plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Vaziri et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">May et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Wang et al., 2020</xref>) and OGT associated with chromatin-binding factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Vella et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Gao et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Hart et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gambetta and Müller, 2015</xref>), we asked whether this metabolic enzyme moonlights on the chromatin of sweet-taste neurons.

In flies, chromatin has been classified into five types according to the histone modifications present and the proteins bound (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Filion et al., 2010</xref>). In this chromatin characterization, there are three types of heterochromatin, developmentally regulated ‘black’ chromatin (high in Histone (H) 3 Lysine (K) methylation, H3K27m), Heterochromatin-protein 1 (HP1) associated ‘green’ chromatin (high in H3K9me2), and Polycomb group proteins-bound ‘blue’ chromatin, and two types of euchromatin (high in H3K4me2 and H3K79m3), the actively elongating H3K36me3 ‘yellow’ chromatin enriched in nucleic acid metabolism genes and the ‘red’ chromatin enriched in other cellular processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Filion et al., 2010</xref>). Our analysis found that OGT was enriched in transcriptionally active yellow euchromatin (453 genes), consistent with its role in splicing, and at ‘blue’ Polycomb heterochromatin (415 genes), consistent with the known associations between Polycomb Group proteins and this metabolic enzyme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gambetta et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Hart, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). As expected, the accessibility at yellow chromatin intervals was higher than that of blue chromatin regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>).</p><p>We next examined the differential binding of OGT between the two diets. Although the majority of intervals were shared between a CD and SD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>, find_peaks False Discovery Rete (FDR) &lt;0.01), a few hundred loci were uniquely associated with OGT in either the CD (36%) or SD (10%) only conditions. However, the chromatin accessibility at OGT-bound peaks decreased in the high-sugar diet condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>, both at blue and yellow regions, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). To characterize the function of the genes occupied by OGT, we performed pathway enrichment analysis using iPAGE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Goodarzi et al., 2009</xref>). On CD only, OGT-decorated genes were involved in signal transduction, membrane potential, and calmodulin-dependent protein kinase activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>, left). Instead, genes targeted by OGT in the SD-only condition were enriched in G-protein-coupled receptor activity, synaptic target attraction, and transcription (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>, left). Finally, genes with differential OGT binding between SD/CD were enriched for regulatory/signaling and neural GO terms, including dendrite morphogenesis, neuron projection membrane, synaptic target attraction, signal transduction, pattern formation, and asymmetric cell division (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref> right, for full iPAGE, GO term analysis see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). Interestingly, when we examined the pathways associated with genes found in OGT-associated blue and yellow chromatin intervals, only the blue genes revealed strongly significant enrichment in GO terms. These blue Polycomb chromatin genes were involved in GO terms such as dendrite morphogenesis (8.9E−08), axon guidance (7.88E−04), actin filament organization (2.45E−07), transcription factor activity (3.8E−07), MAPK kinase signaling (9.18E−05), and Transforming Growth Factor β pathway (0.0042). In contrast, the yellow genes only showed a small enrichment for plasma membrane, transcription factor activity (2.9E−01), basolateral plasma membrane (2.4E−01), and phosphonate metabolism (2.0E−01). Together, these experiments show that OGT resides on the chromatin of the sweet taste at open domains characterized by a small but significant diet sensitivity; genes associated with neural functions are abundant among the set with diet-dependent OGT binding but only enriched in the blue H3K27 Polycomb chromatin.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>OGT and PRC2.1 share diet-sensitive chromatin sites</title><p>Our previous work showed that the epigenetic silencer PRC2.1 – specifically its H3K27m activity – was necessary and sufficient to drive sweet-taste plasticity in response to the nutrient environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Vaziri et al., 2020</xref>). In the presence of high dietary sugar, PRC2.1 decreased chromatin accessibility and expression of transcription factors involved in synaptic function and signaling; these genes were located in blue-Polycomb H3K27m chromatin. Silencing these genes and their regulons lowered neural and behavioral responses to sweetness in high-sugar diet flies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Vaziri et al., 2020</xref>).

To understand more about the mechanisms of OGT function and, thus, nutrigenomic signaling, we examined the role of OGT activity on taste plasticity using the Proboscis Extension Response (PER). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, the fly proboscis houses the cell bodies and dendrites of the sensory neurons. When the taste sensilla in the labellum are stimulated with sucrose, the fly extends its proboscis to reach the sweet solution. The amount of proboscis extension for each concentration tested – 1 is a full extension, 0.5 a half, and 0 none – corresponds to the fly’s ability to taste and can be compared across genotypes and diets. As previously shown, consumption of SD for 7 days results in a decrease in PER for high (30%) and low (5%) concentrations of sucrose compared to animals that ate a control diet (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, circles vs. squares, gray shades). However, knocking down <italic>OGT</italic> in the Gr5a+ sweet-sensing neurons resulted in flies with similar sweet sensitivity between the two diets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Thus, OGT is required for diet-dependent sweet-taste plasticity. To ask if the catalytic activity of OGT was required for this taste phenotype, we compared the ability of protein null (<italic>OGT<sup>1</sup></italic>) and catalytically dead mutants (<italic>OGT<sup>K872M</sup></italic>) to rescue taste plasticity; both of these alleles are homozygous lethal and thus were tested in combination with <italic>w1118CS</italic> control flies. Neither mutant affected sweet-taste responses on a control diet, but both prevented the lower PER to sucrose observed in SD-fed control flies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). This argues that the catalytic activity of OGT is required for the effects of this enzyme on taste plasticity. Consistent with this, knocking down the antagonistic enzyme <italic>O-GlcNAcase</italic> (<italic>OGA</italic>), which removes the GlcNAc moiety from proteins, resulted in lower sweet-taste responses on CD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). We next asked if increasing the levels of OGT was sufficient to induce sweet-taste changes. OGT activity is linear across all levels of cellular UDP-GlcNAc, so increasing its levels also increases its activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Hart, 2019</xref>). Overexpression of <italic>OGT</italic> in the Gr5a+ neurons resulted in sucrose responses on CD comparable to those observed in sugar diet-fed flies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). However, inhibiting the activity of OGT with the specific OGT Small Molecule Inhibitor-1 (OSMI) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Ortiz-Meoz et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">May et al., 2020</xref>) blocked the effects of OGT overexpression on sweet-taste responses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>, right); this drug treatment had no effect on survival (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>). To finally test if the effects of SD on taste plasticity were dependent on OGT activity, we supplemented the CD and SD with OSMI during the entire duration of the diet exposure (7 days) and then tested PER to sucrose. Control (vehicle, Dimethyl Sulfoxide (DMSO)) flies exhibited a dulling of sweet-taste responses on SD (squares), but this decrease was entirely blocked by OSMI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>); no effects were observed on a CD (circles). Thus, decreasing the activity of OGT, either with genetics or pharmacological tools, resulted in similar effects on taste plasticity, arguing that the activity of this enzyme plays an essential role in taste changes in response to the dietary environment.</p><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>O-GlcNAc Transferase (OGT) activity is necessary for taste plasticity in response to the sugar diet environment.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) (<italic>top</italic>) Anatomy of the sensory system showing the cell bodies, dendrites, and axons of the sweet-sensing Gr5a+ neurons; (<italic>bottom</italic>) Diagram of the Proboscis Extension Response (PER).

However, inhibition of OGT activity did not affect Pcl occupancy at these peaks, indicating that recruitment of PRC2.1 to these sites is largely independent of this metabolic enzyme (pink, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). OSMI also had a mild effect on the occupancy of Dam::Pcl genomewide since the number (~1800), and identity (80%) of Dam::Pcl peaks were mainly the same with or without OSMI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1C</xref>).

Thus, OGT activity is required for the diet-dependent decrease in chromatin accessibility but not PRC2.1 recruitment or occupancy, suggesting that other factors or events mediate these.

These genes were enriched in metabolic and neural processes, such as chemical synapse transmission, synaptic target attraction, cell differentiation, glucose metabolism, and detection of chemical stimuli (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4</xref>). Notable among these were the homeobox <italic>cad</italic> and <italic>Ptx1</italic> and their regulons, which have been implicated in taste function and plasticity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3D</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Vaziri et al., 2020</xref>), but also many whose effects of sweet-taste sensation are not known, like the Activin ligand <italic>dawdle</italic> (<italic>daw</italic>) and the transcription factor <italic>cabut</italic> (<italic>cbt</italic>). To functionally validate some of these new genes, we knocked down or overexpressed them (depending on their SD/CD log2 fold) in the Gr5a+ neurons and assayed sweet-taste function by PER (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>).

To understand which other cellular context factors may cooperate with OGT and PRC2.1 to mediate taste plasticity, we examined the regulatory regions of OGT × Pcl and OGT × PREs (Polycomb Responsive Elements, DNA motifs to which Polycomb Proteins bind) loci for enriched cis-regulatory motifs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A, B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>; also, note that a TF may appear multiple times as dots in this graph because of different binding motifs).

To determine if they affected sweet taste, we measured the proboscis extension in response to sucrose when these genes were overexpressed or knocked down in the Gr5a+ neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1C</xref>). The only factor that affected sweet-taste responses across low and high sucrose concentrations was Sr, which also showed higher mRNA abundance in the sensory neurons of SD-flies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1D</xref>).</p><p>Sr is a conserved transcription factor induced by neural activity via the MAPK/ERK pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chen et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Gonzales et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Beckmann and Wilce, 1997</xref>) and is essential for sensory nerve development and plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Murphy et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Duclot and Kabbaj, 2017</xref>). The MAPK pathway is sensitive to neural activity and nutrients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Robles-Flores et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Papa et al., 2019</xref>); it is stimulated by mitogens, such as TGF-β/Activin signaling, which increase with high-sugar levels, eating, and neural activity in flies and mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Lavoie et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Liu and Chen, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Wilinski et al., 2019</xref>). Of note, OGT × Pcl co-occupied loci were enriched in MAPK/ERK targets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>, blue). Enrichment for <italic>Sr</italic> cis-regulatory motifs was modest at OGT <italic>or</italic> Pcl-only loci (l2fc = 0.196 and 0.398, respectively; p &lt; 0.001 in both cases via an approximate permutation test) but strong at genes bound by both factors (OGT × Pcl = 0.429 and OGT × PREs = 0.976, p &lt; 0.001, permutation test) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). When we compared the distribution of Sr sites around the regulatory regions of OGT × PRC2.1 genes (either together or separately), we found a marked bias around the TSS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>, top), with enrichment of Sr-binding sites in the 500 bp window immediately preceding the TSS. In contrast, genes that OGT or PRC2.1 did not occupy, were depleted for Sr-binding sites at the TSS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>, bottom). This suggests that Sr is enriched at the TSS of genes that are bound by OGT <italic>and</italic> PRC2.1. To this end, when we examined the expression of Sr-targets in the Gr5a+ neurons of flies on the two diets, we noticed that these genes had negative log2 fold changes on the sugar diet; this repression, however, was abolished by mutations in <italic>Pcl</italic> and by inhibition of OGT activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>, compare gray vs. pink and green, respectively), which hints toward functional cooperation between Sr and OGT/PRC2.1. To characterize the effects of higher <italic>Sr</italic> levels on neural activity and behavior, we used the UAS/GAL4 system to overexpress this gene in the Gr5a+ neurons of adult flies. Overexpression of <italic>Sr</italic> resulted in lower electrophysiological responses of the gustatory neurons to sucrose (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>, Mann–Whitney test, <italic>p</italic> = 0.001) as well as lower PER at both high and low sucrose concentrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). This effect, however, was dependent on the catalytic activities of PRC2 and OGT. Indeed, overexpression of <italic>Sr</italic> in flies treated with OSMI (green) or with an inhibitor of PRC2 (pink, EEDi <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Vaziri et al., 2020</xref>) resulted in sucrose responses comparable to those of control flies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>). Overall, these results argue for a role of Sr in taste plasticity in coordination with OGT and PRC2.1. Importantly, since OGT and PRC2.1 are not always found at TSS, the bias in Sr distribution at the TSS of ‘OGT/PRC2.1 regulated genes’ indicates that coordination between Sr and OGT/PRC2.1 may arise not from direct interactions but rather from two distinct paths of information flow, such as metabolism and neural activity.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>The immediate early gene Sr is found at PRC2 × OGT genes and is involved in sweet-taste sensation.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Log<sub>2</sub>fold (l2f) enrichment for Sr motifs at sites occupied by O-GlcNAc Transferase (OGT; green), Pcl (pink), or OGT + Pcl and OGT + PREs (purple), p &lt; 0.0001.

To differentiate between these two possibilities, we expressed either a wild-type <italic>rl</italic> (<italic>rl<sup>WT</sup></italic>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>, top, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Biggs et al., 1994</xref>) or constitutively active form of the kinase (<italic>rl<sup>Sem</sup></italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>, bottom, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Oellers and Hafen, 1996</xref>) in the Gr5a+ neurons and tested neural and taste responses to sucrose. Overexpression of <italic>rl<sup>WT</sup></italic> with Gr5a-GAL4 did not affect the electrophysiological responses of the sensory neurons to sucrose (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>, <italic>dark blue</italic>); however, expression of the active <italic>rl<sup>Sem</sup></italic> decreased neuronal responses to sucrose (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>, <italic>light blue</italic>). These activity phenotypes were reflected in the behavioral taste responses to sucrose, with <italic>rl<sup>WT</sup></italic> flies having identical PER to sucrose as controls and <italic>rl<sup>Sem</sup></italic> showing reduced PER across high and low sucrose concentrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>, <italic>left</italic> vs. <italic>right</italic>; note that controls are shared here, plotted separately for clarity). Thus, rl activity, but not higher levels alone, was sufficient to affect sweet-taste plasticity. Not surprisingly, given the known function of rl/ERK in neural activity, we found that this kinase was also necessary for sweet-taste responses, as loss of function mutants and RNAi for <italic>rl</italic> had lower electrophysiological and behavioral responses to sucrose (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1B, C</xref>). To test whether there was a synergetic interaction between rl and OGT, we repeated the same experiments in the presence of the OGT inhibitor OSMI. Strikingly, OSMI treatment almost entirely blocked the effects of <italic>rl<sup>Sem</sup></italic> on both neural and behavioral responses to sucrose while having no effect on <italic>rl<sup>WT</sup></italic> flies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E, F</xref>).</p><p>To characterize the function of the rl/Sr pathway on taste plasticity, we used Trametinib, a drug that inhibits ERK activation in animals (currently used for treating melanoma). At concentrations previously used in flies (15.6 μM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Castillo-Quan et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Slack et al., 2015</xref>), Trametinib blocked the effects of <italic>rl<sup>Sem</sup></italic> expression on sweet-taste responses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1A</xref>); this had no effect on survival (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Treatment with this ERK inhibitor also negated the effects of <italic>Sr</italic> overexpression on sucrose responses, resulting in flies with PER comparable to controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1B</xref>), placing Sr downstream of ERK activation. Thus, Trametinib treatment efficiently blocks ERK signaling. To determine if the activity of the rl/Sr (ERK/EGR2) pathway was necessary for taste plasticity in response to the sugar diet environment, we fed flies a control or sugar diet with or without Trametinib for 7 days, then measured their neural and behavioral responses to sucrose. Exposure to a high-sugar diet decreased the electrophysiological (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>) and behavioral (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>) responses to sucrose. However, when rl activity was blocked with Trametinib, there was no decrease in neural responses or PER (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C and D</xref>). Of note, Trametinib had a minor but significant effect on sweet-taste activity (compare CD of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref> with CD of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>), consistent with the observation that rl is necessary for normal sweet-taste function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1B, C</xref>). Together, these data indicate that the ERK pathway plays a critical role in the development of taste adaptations in response to diet and place its function upstream of OGT.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>The rl &gt; Sr pathway is important for taste adaptations in response to diet.</title><p>Representative traces (left) and averaged responses to 25 mM sucrose from L-type sensilla of flies fed a CD and SD (<bold>A</bold>), gray or Trametinib (<bold>C</bold>), blue. <italic>n</italic> = 11–14.

However, the molecular mechanisms and consequences of this type of nutrient sensing are still poorly understood. In particular, how nutrigenomic signals are integrated with cellular contexts has remained hard to define due to the lack of mechanistic nutrigenomic models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Müller and Kersten, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Vaziri and Dus, 2021</xref>). In this work, we exploited the conserved phenomenon of diet-induced taste plasticity and the genetic tools of the <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> fly to answer these questions.</p><p>Here, we report that the metabolic enzyme OGT is associated with neural chromatin at introns and TSSs. While OGT-associated genes showed subtle but significant changes in chromatin accessibility in response to diet, these dynamics were much more robust at loci co-occupied by both OGT and the epigenetic silencer PRC2.1. At genes decorated by both factors, we observed sizable diet-dependent chromatin variations that were critically dependent on the catalytic activity of OGT. OGT activity was also necessary for the differential transcriptional and taste responses to the high-sugar diet. The OGT- and PRC2.1-bound nutrient-dependent loci were enriched for binding motifs for the activity-dependent transcription factor Sr at TSS, the effector of the ERK pathway. We show that this signaling pathway functions upstream of OGT/PRC2.1 to shape neural and behavioral taste responses to the dietary environment. We thus propose a model where a nutrigenomic pathway composed of OGT and PRC2.1 integrates information from the nutrient and cellular environment via ERK signaling to orchestrate sensory responses to diet (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>). Our data suggest that this integration occurs at the level of chromatin and modulates the expression of transcription factors and signaling regulators that further amplify and extend the reach of nutrigenomic signaling. Our findings thus shed light on how nutrigenomics contributes to neural plasticity and behavior.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>OGT and chromatin dynamics</title><p>OGT is a conserved enzyme that catalyzes the transfer of UDP-GlcNAc to the serine and threonine residues of proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Hart, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Olivier-Van Stichelen et al., 2017</xref>). Because UDP-GlcNAc synthesis by the HBP combines sugar, amino acid, nucleotide, and fatty acid metabolism, the levels of this metabolite, as well as the activity of the enzymes in this pathway, are inextricably linked to cellular metabolism and diet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Hart, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Olivier-Van Stichelen et al., 2017</xref>). Higher HBP flux directly impacts OGT activity because the function of this enzyme is linear across a vast range of physiological UDP-GlcNAc concentrations. Because of this, OGT is recognized as a critical nutrient sensor in animal physiology, particularly in development, cancer, and metabolic disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Hart, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Olivier-Van Stichelen et al., 2017</xref>). More recently, its importance for neural function and plasticity has also been recognized, with studies implicating it in synapse maturation, neural excitability, activity, and plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Butler et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ardiel et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Lagerlöf et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Su and Schwarz, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Giles et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Lagerlöf et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Ruan et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Hwang and Rhim, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Li et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">May et al., 2019</xref>). Our group showed that a high-sugar diet acutely and chronically increased HPB activity in flies and played a role in diet-induced sensory plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Wilinski et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">May et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>OGT is a nucleocytoplasmic enzyme, and the GlcNAc modification is enriched in nuclear and synaptic proteins, which extends its reach on cellular physiology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Hart, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Olivier-Van Stichelen et al., 2017</xref>). Although OGT is thought to play a role in gene regulation, only one study has shown its direct association with chromatin in murine embryonic stem cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Vella et al., 2013</xref>). Here, we report that OGT also decorates neural chromatin in <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>. Like in murine embryonic stem cells, OGT was enriched at introns and TSSs and primarily associated with transcriptionally active chromatin. However, we found that half of OGT intervals were also enriched at Polycomb repressive chromatin, consistent with previous reports that the GlcNAc modification is found at PREs, as well as on many Polycomb Group (PcG) proteins; OGT is also associated with PcG complexes to mediate Hox-gene repression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Hart, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Olivier-Van Stichelen et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Schuettengruber et al., 2017</xref>). On a high-sugar diet, there was a higher association of OGT with DNA but lower chromatin accessibility. However, the magnitude of these changes depended on what other regulatory and DNA-binding factors were found at OGT loci. At loci with PRC2.1 binding and Sr/EGR2 motifs, chromatin openness was markedly reduced in response to the high-sugar diet environment. This is the first study to show that OGT-associated chromatin is nutrient sensitive to the best of our knowledge. Importantly, this nutrient sensitivity was entirely dependent on the catalytic activity of OGT because it was abolished in the presence of the inhibitor OSMI. Interestingly, OGT activity had no effect on PRC2.1 association with co-occupied loci (and only a small effect at non-OGT loci, data not shown). The H3K27 methylation activity of PRC2.1 is required for changes in chromatin accessibility, including those that depend on diet in the sensory neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Schuettengruber et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Vaziri et al., 2020</xref>). Thus, our data suggest that OGT activity affects the repressive action but not the recruitment of PRC2.1; we also demonstrate that the catalytic activity of PRC2.1 is required for the effects of OGT on taste plasticity.</p><p>These findings raise several important questions about the biochemical mechanisms of OGT action that our genetic system is poorly suited to address, but that will be important to define in future studies. First, what are the targets of OGT at nutrient-sensitive loci? Is OGT directly GlcNAcylating PRC2.1 to modify its repressive drive? Several studies have linked OGT activity with the stability, chromatin occupancy, or catalytic function of Polycomb Group Proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Hart, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Olivier-Van Stichelen et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chu et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Sakabe and Hart, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Forma et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Sui et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Jiang et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">You et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Decourcelle et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gambetta and Müller, 2014</xref>). Thus, converging evidence suggests that OGT impacts different aspects of PRC2.1 and PcG biology and is broadly consistent with our data. Connections between OGT and ERK have also been uncovered in the context of cancer and cell division, with studies showing that inhibition of ERK signaling decreases O-GlcNAcylation and vice versa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">Zhang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Jiang et al., 2016</xref>) and that GlcNAcylation promotes ERK effects while OGT inhibition blocks them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cork et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Weiss et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Lei et al., 2020</xref>). These findings are consistent with the effect and direction of the genetic interactions we observed between OGT and PRC2.1 and OGT and ERK, the direction of ‘information flow’ within the cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>), and the effects of our genetic manipulations. OGT could also affect chromatin accessibility by GlcNAcylating histones, although the function and effects of these histone modifications are still poorly understood <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://paperpile.com/c/7gr2lA/tqpv7+ScnR5+04KI5+c4mQw">(Gambetta and Müller, 2015;</ext-link> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Hirosawa et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Konzman et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Olivier-Van Stichelen et al., 2017</xref>). Another outstanding question is how OGT is targeted to chromatin and whether this recruitment is dynamic and related to nutrient availability. For example, are there different local pools of OGT and GlcNAc in the nucleus vs. cytoplasm (or mitochondria) where OGT has been described? Because of the lack of functional fly OGT antibodies, we could not ask this question, but it is possible that the levels of OGT in the nucleus and cytoplasm change between diets. Finding answers related to the cellular compartmentalization of this metabolic enzyme and its targets will be an essential step in understanding nutrient signaling.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Sensors and effector mechanisms of nutrigenomic signaling in neural plasticity</title><p>In the case of the sweet-taste neurons, sugar directly activates the cells via receptor-dependent mechanisms and enhances OGT’s metabolic activity. Our data support the idea that integrating these two signals at the level of chromatin – a synergy almost entirely unique to these cells – is key for developing sensory plasticity. First, binding sites for the ERK effector Sr were among the most enriched at OGT × Pcl/PRE loci, consistent with our finding that OGT/Pcl/PRE loci were enriched in MAPK signaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref>); second, diet-driven changes in Sr regulons depended on the activity or presence of OGT and PRC2.1, and most importantly, the effects of rl/Sr (ERK/EGR2) on taste plasticity had strong epistatic interactions with OGT. Together, these molecular and functional data support the idea that the activity-dependent ERK pathway provides a relevant cellular context (likely neural activity) for adaptations to the nutrient environment. However, these sensing mechanisms must be turned into action to be effective. This is likely the role of PRC2.1 since the effects of ERK/EGR2 and OGT manipulations were dependent on the PRC2.1 function. Of note, only a small portion of the genes occupied by PRC2.1 is sensitive to diet and OGT activity, and our data show that PRC2.1 is not binding to new loci but instead tuning the output of those it is already bound to, likely via OGT instruction.</p><p>In the model we propose, metabolic and activity sensors integrate cellular information to promote changes in gene expression. But how are these actualized into physiological (in this case, neural) adaptations that underlie behavior or disease? This is one of the central and unresolved questions in nutrigenomics. Our model’s genetic and neural tractability provides a unique opportunity to get some answers. The 162 co-occupied loci identified were enriched for transcription and regulatory factors involved in cell proliferation, differentiation, signaling, and neural activity, as well as pathways implicated in neural plasticity. Many of these DNA-binding factors play essential roles during the development of sensory neurons to set their biophysical properties, such as Ptx1 and cad, but also affect adult taste plasticity. The regulons of these TFs include genes known to affect pre- and postsynaptic branching and structure, as well as synaptic physiology. Thus, our collective data indicate that this nutrigenomic pathway promotes taste adaptations, most likely by re-engaging developmental gene batteries, a mechanism that has been hypothesized to play a role in neural plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Hobert, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Marder and Prinz, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Parrish et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Vaziri et al., 2020</xref>). Whether this is a general rule of nutrigenomic signaling or something specific to these cells or neurons is yet to be determined; however, it is interesting to note that this is similar to how cancer cells exploit developmental networks for uncontrolled growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Faubert et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">DeBerardinis and Chandel, 2016</xref>). On this note, many neural and psychiatric conditions show associations and connections with diet and metabolic states, including epilepsy, schizophrenia, bipolar, depression, Alzheimer’s, and Parkinson’s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Sarangi and Dus, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Grigolon et al., 2020</xref>). Thus, uncovering nutrigenomic mechanisms in the brain could shed light on the etiology of these conditions and help design nutritional strategies to support people suffering from them; this is similar to how metabolic disorders like diabetes and cardiovascular disease are treated with a combination of drugs and nutrition.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Limitations</title><p>Although using sensory plasticity and fly gustatory neurons as a model to study nutrigenomic signaling brings unique advantages, it also has significant limitations. These primarily arise from the small number of cells (60) and the in vivo nature of our model. First, we cannot probe whether OGT, PRC2.1, and Sr/EGR2 physically interact or modify each other in these cells. We also could not probe whether SD enhances the presence of OGT protein in the nucleus compared to a control diet due to the lack of functional antibodies. Thus, evidence for our model arises from the combination of cell-specific molecular, genetic, and physiological data. Second, we only inferred that the loci with Sr/EGR2 motifs integrate activity due to the well-established function of the ERK pathway in activity-dependent plasticity; future studies should address this directly and compare the effects of acute vs. chronic nutrient influx.</p><p>Further, while inhibitors have allowed us to establish critical epistatic interactions and conduct dietary manipulations while bypassing developmental effects and genetic challenges, we cannot exclude that some of these effects may be non-cell autonomous. Integrating this model with biochemical approaches that preserve the appropriate activity and nutrient context would help address these critical questions. Finally, pathways beyond OGT, ERK, and PRC2.1 may also play a role in sensory plasticity.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Conclusions</title><p>In summary, we show that activity and nutrient-sensing mechanisms are integrated at the genomic level to promote neural adaptations to the food environment. In particular, our data reveal a central and instructional role for OGT and meaningful epistatic interactions with sensors (ERK) and effectors (PRC2.1). More generally, we put forth a model where cell and context specificity transforms ‘nutritional data’ – that is, variations in nutrient and metabolite levels – into nutritional information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Floridi, 2005</xref>), as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref> (pink boxes). This information is processed and interpreted by gene regulatory processes to make ‘decisions’ about responding to environmental challenges and carrying out physiological, neural, and behavioral changes. Thus, nutrigenomic mechanisms could provide a critical path for information flow in biological systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Shannon, 1948</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Reinagel, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Smith, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Fabris, 2009</xref>). A clear advantage could reside in their ability to amplify transient, and often minor, variations in nutrient and activity levels into strong reactions, which can be used to orchestrate responses to current <italic>and</italic> future environmental challenges. Future studies in this field will no doubt uncover fascinating insights about the rules of nutrigenomic communication: these discoveries will illuminate how nutrition and gene expression converge to

Permutation tests to assess significance were performed through repeated application of the bedtools shuffle [cite: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/btq033">https://doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/btq033</ext-link>] command to obtain 100 resamplings (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>) or 1000 resamplings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>) of the feature location of interest, requiring non-overlap of the randomly placed features.

For comparison of Sr motif locations with TSSs, we first identified the (strandedness-aware) start location of all ‘gene’, ‘mobile_genetic_element’, or ‘pseudogene’ features from the dmel6 Genbank annotations and then categorized all of these locations as ‘OGT/PRC2’ or ‘Not OGT/PRC2’ based on whether or not the gene was associated with an OGT, Pcl, or PRE location (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref> for gene lists for each feature type).

One- or two-way repeated measure analysis of variance with post hoc tests were used for all PER experiments. All behavioral data were tested for normality, and the appropriate statistical tests were applied if data were not normally distributed. For the RNA-seq expression datasets, we coupled our standard differential expression with a test for whether each gene could be flagged as ‘significantly not different’ – that is, a gene for which we can confidently state that no substantial change in expression occurred (rather than just a lack of evidence for change, as would be inferred from a large p-value on the differential expression test). Defining a region of practical equivalence as a change of no more than 1.5-fold in either direction, we tested the null hypothesis of a change larger than 1.5-fold using the gene-wise estimates of the SE in log2fold change (reported by Deseq2) and the assumption that the actual l2fcs are normally distributed. Rejection of the null hypothesis is evidence that the gene’s expression is not changed substantially between the conditions of interest.

The work also identifies Mitogen Activated Kinase as a critical mediator in this pathway.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and K VijayRaghavan as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Allan-Hermann Pool (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>There was relative consensus amongst the reviewers about the interest and potential importance of this study. In addition to the relatively straightforward controls and textual revisions detailed below, there were two major areas in which additional experiments are needed to strengthen and extend the impact of this study.</p><p>1) Perform additional genetic experiments (detailed below) to confirm and underscore the specificity of the pharmacological experiments. This might include a demonstration that the drug phenocopies the OGT enzymatic loss-of-function and related experiments.</p><p>2) Presenting analyses in non-sweet sensing neurons to strengthen the impact and specificity of the manipulations.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>As the study currently stands, the proposed model is speculative, and a significantly revised approach and design would be needed to support the study's conclusions.</p><p>1) The genetic interactions of OGT with other genes (PRC, Plc, rolled) rely only on the treatment of the flies with a systemic pharmacological OGT activity inhibitor OSMI. But, it is not possible to draw strong and nuanced conclusions from the datasets that rely heavily of a systemic drug-based manipulation instead of precise genetic alleles. Ideally the authors would want to include the same DAM-ID experiments performed with a OGT enzymatic mutant versus a OGT-WT.</p><p>The authors are encouraged to ask what happens to PRC occupancy in CD and SD in tissue-specific KD of OGT using RNAi. If the RNAi reagent does not provide the authors a complete loss of function, they should consider using sgRNA-based KD approaches or generate a HA or GFP OGT knock-in line and then utilize degron based tissue-specific KD of OGT.</p><p>2) For the OSMI experiments, would the authors present evidence that the drug is specific to OGT and has no off-target effects? Alternatively, authors might want to consider presenting results with OGT KD or OGT enzyme specific mutants to correlate OSMI results with. These orthogonal and corroborative datasets would be required to bolster the conclusions.</p><p>3) This study is measuring the chromatin availability and determined that there was higher accessibility under CD conditions. Since OGT also has critical cytosolic roles, it would be important to determine if this is due to differences in nuclear: cytoplasmic localization of OGT or due to changes in OGT activity. To this end, I would recommend a western blot of Nuclear v. cytoplasmic fractions of OGT for flies on CD vs SD or imaging based approaches would be needed.</p><p>4) In Figure 2A, the authors describe a high correlation in chromatin binding sites between Pcl and OGT, concluding that the overlapping OGTXPRC2.1 regions are a critical subset for sweet tasting response. However, these overlapping regions are a rather small subset of sites, with the largest subset actually belonging the &quot;yellow&quot; H3K4/H3K36 euchromatin subset. It is unclear from this analysis why the authors chose to pursue the blue chromatin instead. It would be important to rank regulatory regions bound by DAM:OGT alone and DAM:Pcl alone to establish the primary regions of binding for both OGT and Pcl irrespective of each other. These regions can then be compared with the known sweet tasting genes to rank the relevant binding regions. Should there be other regions relevant to sweet taste that are not overlapping between OGT and Pcl that should be reported. This will also give readers a more comprehensive understanding about the role of Sr motifs and if this is a small but significant subset of genes regulated by OGT or comprise the majority of cis-regulatory regions controlled by OGT.</p><p>5) The authors use PCL as a proxy for PRC2.1 activity as it is the recruiter for PRC2.1. However, why wasn't DAM::PRC2.1 performed to directly compare to OGT? This data should be provided to show the overlap of PRC2.1 to Pcl or it should be explained in the results.</p><p>6) The authors findings are performed using flies overexpressing Pcl or OGT in Gr5a expressing cells for the TADA, PER experiments, and electrophysiology analysis. Because this analysis is based on an overexpression of the gene of interest, I believe it is important to repeat these experiments in flies overexpressing these genes in neurons unrelated to the sweet taste response- such as in the neighboring bitter taste neurons. This is especially a critical set of experiments to do, as the primary thesis of this study is about how each cell alters its nutrigenomic signaling in different cell types, but the analysis is primarily focused on DAM-ID datasets from overexpressed OGT in Gr5a. The study would be relevant if the authors did comparative analysis of OGT-PRC interactions in neurons that have different sensitivities or taste modalities to sugar.</p><p>7) The Proboscis extension response needs to be further elaborated on. The data plotted seems to be normalized but this is not explained in the paper. What is actually being measure? What is the N? If the data is normalized, then the authors should present raw data graphed in a supplemental figure at least.</p><p>8) Figure 4B seems misleading in the way it is plotted. Authors claim a bias of SR genes at the TSS in the PRC2.1 and OGT overlapping regions. However, the y axes are not to the same scale. In fact, the not OGT/PRC2 regions have much higher number of genes with SR motifs at every single position plotted on 4B. Specifically the strong statements findings in the results paragraph on lines 262-283 are not sufficiently supported and the authors are encouraged to revise this or move it to discussion.</p><p>9) Many of the experiments involved moving flies to OSMI or Trametinib diets. A caveat to this method is that this treatment will influence OGT/ERK in the fly globally. Because both OGT/ERK impact a number of critical biological processes, this makes the results difficult to interpret as impacts of taste sensing or due to the flies being generally unhealthy. It would be helpful to see fly survival on control, OSMI supplemented, and Trametinib diets to determine how detrimental these diet conditions are in general to the fly.</p><p>10) In general, the figure legends and methods are lacking in detail. For instance, in Figure 1F, are the GO terms for control diet comprised from all peaks listed or just the peaks unique to CD? Same question for the SD GO terms. Abbreviations are not elaborated in the legend or methods (ex: Figure 2B TPM) or lacking axis labels (ex: Figure 2D), etc. I suggest a thorough review of the methods and legend to add details necessary to interpret the results and make it possible to replicate experimental designs.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1. There are too many instances of non-technical phrases that are unclear/nonspecific. For example, &quot;…OGT moonlights on the chromatin ….&quot;, or &quot;… OGT decorates nutrient-sensitive …&quot;. These phrases should be replaced with more precise words, unless these phrases are common in the field and I am just unaware.</p><p>2. The Discussion section is overall too long and delves too much into the previous literature. It should be condensed and there should be more focus on the translational implications of the results.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>– Almost all quantitative data in figures lack definition of variance measures (e.g. Panel 3C and E). Are data represented as mean +/I standard deviation, s.e.m.?</p><p>– Regarding setting up the problem – claiming &quot;how nutritional information is transmuted to neural activity and behavioral changes remains elusive&quot; is inaccurate – we know the receptors, increasingly many cells in the food intake regulatory circuit from sensory input to motor output in <italic>Drosophila</italic>.</p><p>– Methods refer to a python code on Github but no github repository is specified.</p><p>– Please also make the code for analyzing the DaMID and CaTaDa available online.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.83979.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>There was relative consensus amongst the reviewers about the interest and potential importance of this study.

In the revised manuscript, these experiments are shown in a new Figure 3 and revised Figure 4, and Figure 4-Supplement 1, Figure 5-Supplement 1, and Figure 6-Supplement 1; below, we outlined the experiments and explained the findings for the reviewers’ below before addressing the individual comments.</p><p>1A. OGT catalytic activity and OSMI-1</p><p>There are several published OGT mutant alleles, but we were only able to obtain two from the lab that generated them; we were told that all the others, including the UAS-versions which would have been useful for our experiments, were lost due to the mishandling of the fly stocks. We requested these stocks in early 2020 but were unable to get them for nearly a year due to the COVID lab restrictions in the UK; this is why we originally carried out the experiments with OSMI-1 once our own lab reopened at 20% capacity in July 2020-May 2021 since we had previously validated, used, and published with this reagent (May et al. 2020). In brief, OSMI-1 is a specific inhibitor of OGT developed by Harvard Medical School and the NIH and published in 2015 (Ortiz-Meoz et al. 2015); its inhibition is insensitive to UDP-GlcNAc concentration, and it doesn’t affect cell-surface glycosylation.</p><p>In data now added to Figure 3C, we compared <italic>OGT<sup>K872M</sup></italic>, a full catalytically dead mutant, to the protein null <italic>OGT<sup>1 –</sup></italic> please note that both of these are homozygous lethal, so here they were tested in heterozygous combination with <italic>w1118cs</italic> (<italic>wcs</italic>) control flies (Mariappa et al. 2015). As you can see in Figure 3, the heterozygous catalytically dead mutant, <italic>OGT<sup>K872M/+</sup></italic> (100% of OGT protein but only 50% catalytic activity, see diagram on the right), phenocopies the effects of protein null <italic>OGT<sup>1</sup></italic> allele (50% of protein with catalytic activity) in preventing diet-induced taste plasticity on a sugar diet (SD, squares). No effects were observed on a control diet (CD, circles). This provides genetic evidence for OGT activity being essential for taste changes in response to a sugar diet. Please note that as the diagram in Figure 3A now shows, proboscis extension response (PER) is measured from 1 (full extension) to 0 (no extension). Thus, the PER data shown in the manuscript is the raw data (mean +/-SEM) obtained from observing the flies during sucrose stimulation; it is not normalized (a comment of Reviewer 1). Importantly, the phenotype of <italic>OGT<sup>K872M</sup></italic><sup>/+</sup> flies (wild-type taste on sugar diet) is similar to that of <italic>OGT RNAi</italic> targeted specifically to the Gr5a+ neurons (now Figure 3B). It is also identical to that of OSMI-1 treatment (now Figure 3F).</p><p>To further validate the role of OGT catalytic activity, we knocked down the gene for the antagonistic enzyme to OGT, <italic>O-GlcNAcase</italic> (<italic>OGA</italic>), which removes the GlcNAc moiety. If OGT catalytic activity were important, we would expect that interfering with removing the GlcNAc mark would mimic the effects of a sugar diet (and OGT overexpression) on taste. Figure 3 D shows that the knockdown of <italic>OGA</italic> in the Gr5a+ neurons resulted in a marked decrease in sucrose taste sensation in control-diet flies (Figure 3D). Thus, <italic>OGA</italic> knockdown recapitulates the effects of OGT overexpression and sugar-diet on sucrose taste, further validating the role of OGT activity in taste plasticity.</p><p>Finally, to link OSMI-1 to OGT function in our system, we tested the effects of OSMI-1 treatment in flies that overexpress <italic>OGT</italic> in the Gr5a+ neurons. As a reminder, expression of <italic>OGT</italic> in the Gr5a+ neurons results in taste depression on a control diet, recapitulating the effects of a sugar diet. Treatment with OSMI-1, however, inhibited the effects of OGT overexpression on sweet taste, as shown in Figure 3E. These results link the OGT overexpression phenotype to its catalytic activity. As reviewer 1 asked, we tested the effects of OSMI-1 and Tretmetinib on survival and found no effect (Figure 4-Supplement 1A).</p><p>Together, the experiments in the new Figure 3 provide solid evidence for the role of OGT catalytic activity in taste plasticity and support the design of the molecular experiments in Figure 4.</p><p>1B. Epistasis experiments</p><p>Reviewers 2 and 3 commented on the “elegant group of experiments” and “the thorough exploration of epistatic relationships between different players in the system.” These epistatic relationships would be very hard – and perhaps impossible– to parse out without the combination of genetic and pharmacological tools we used here. Since Reviewer 1 expressed concern about OGT, Pcl, and PRC2 interactions, we carried out additional genetic and pharmacological epistasis experiments, which we added to Figure 4 in the revised manuscript.</p><p>Figure 4C shows that the taste phenotype caused by <italic>OGT</italic> overexpression in the Gr5a+ neurons (green) is dependent on the presence of a functioning <italic>Pcl</italic> (pink and purple). And consistent with the function of Pcl as a PRC2.1 recruiter, Figure 4D shows that the ability of OGT to induce taste plasticity depends on the catalytically active PRC2 complex. These data provide genetic evidence for the data shown in the original version of the manuscript (now Figure 4B), where we rescued the effects of <italic>Pcl</italic> overexpression on taste with OSMI; they also suggest that PRC2 H3K27 methylation is likely the effector arm of this nutrigenomic signaling. A note in response to Reviewer 1: we manipulated Pcl instead of Ez because this manipulation is more specific. The PRC2 complex comes in many different “flavors,” all of which contain Ez as the H3K27m. Each of the PRC2 variants is characterized by a different recruiter, which targets the complex to specific regions of chromatin (i.e., Pcl has a Tudor domain which is thought to target PRC2.1, the PCl<sup>-</sup>containing PRC2, to actively transcribed chromatin). Thus, by manipulating Pcl, we can target a specific type of PRC2.1; in (Vaziri et al. 2020) we demonstrated that the other PRC2 variants are not involved in taste plasticity; in that manuscript, we also show that <italic>Pcl, Ez, Suz12,</italic> and <italic>Esc</italic> mutants phenocopy one another, and that the effects of Pcl on sweet taste are dependent on the catalytic activity of Ez.</p><p>Together these new data in Figure 4 place OGT and PRC2.1 in the same genetic pathway, and argue for a strong interaction between OGT, Pcl, and PRC2; these results also support those of the DAM-ID and TRAP molecular experiments, which show synergistic effects between these two players.</p><p>Additional experiments</p><p>We added data showing that Gr5a+-specific knockdown of the kinase <italic>rl</italic> (we previously only had mutant data) has marked effects on sucrose taste sensitivity (Figure 6-Supplement 1)</p><p>We also added a functional characterization as measured by proboscis extension response of some of the sugar diet DEGs that are dependent on OGT/Pcl as suggested by Reviewer 3 (Figure 4).</p><p>These genetic experiments make the conclusions of the manuscript stronger – we thus hope the reviewers find their concerns addressed.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Presenting analyses in non-sweet sensing neurons to strengthen the impact and specificity of the manipulations.</p></disp-quote><p>This study is a cell-specific investigation of nutrigenomic mechanisms in the Gr5a+ sweet-taste neurons; our intention was not to examine mechanisms across different cell types. However, we can understand the reviewers’ comments about this after rereading the abstract and introduction. As such, we have rewritten part of the manuscript to better introduce the rationale behind the study as the integration of metabolic signaling and cellular contexts. We hope this is now an improved framing for the study rationale.</p><p>About analyzing the effects of diet on other cells, no doubt this is an interesting question. However, this also signifies embarking on a completely separate project that would take, optimistically speaking, at least one year to complete and require a budget of ~ $130,000 (see breakdown). Thus, this suggestion doesn’t seem in line with the peer review and editorial philosophy of <italic>eLife</italic>. Carrying out this new project would result in an additional 6-7 figures but would not fundamentally change the conclusion of the current work; in fact, it may even take away from the targeted integration of molecular biology and neuroscience we have tried to achieve.</p><p>Moreover, talking about the practicality of this proposal, we do not have such an unallocated budget, and so this new project would require us first to generate preliminary data on the bitter neurons, then write a grant proposal to fund it; as you can appreciate, this would take longer than a year, especially since we do not even know if the bitter gustatory neurons are affected by a high-sugar diet. Beyond this, looking at the bitter neurons would do little to prove specificity. If we found no effects of this pathway on the activity of the bitter neurons, it wouldn’t establish that the changes in the sweet taste neurons are specific. In fact, the same pathway could be acting in some of the other thousands of fly circuits that were not investigated (Black swan effect). If we did find that OGT/PRC2.1/Sr play a role in the bitter neurons, it would also do little to disprove specificity since their targets would likely be different because the sets of genes expressed in these two sensory neurons are different. By analogy, the protein sensor mTOR is expressed and active in every cell, where it modulates some of the same targets (i.e., S6K); however, the effects of the pathway may be different due to the distinct metabolic and genetic idiosyncrasies of cells, as well as cellular compartments. This lack of specificity doesn’t mean that mTOR is not important or unspecific. Finally, we would like to note that we have tested the effects of manipulating OGT levels in other neurons (dopamine and Mushroom Body Output Neurons) without effects on behavior or neural responses (May et al. 2020; Pardo-Garcia et al. 2022); based on these, OGT doesn’t seem to affect neurons indiscriminately.</p><p>Budget ~ $129,000</p><p>Salary and fringe benefits for PD for 10 calendar months: $75,000 (2 months behavior experiments, 2 months training for molecular biology experiments and troubleshooting in new neurons, 4 months growing flies and conducting experiments, 2 months data analysis and visualization)</p><p>DAM ID: $16,0000, Pcl:dam and OGT:dam in CD and SD, with and without OSMI x 4 biological replicates per condition = 32 samples @ $500 per sample (UM Genomics core)</p><p>TRAP: $16,0000 Pcl mutant and OSMI in CD and SD x 4 biological replicates per condition + sequencing input = 32 samples @ $500 per sample (UM Genomics core)</p><p>Animals' food and maintenance: $ 5,000, $500 per person/10 months</p><p>Reagents: = $17,000, including sequencing kit (32 reactions = $6,000) x 2 = $12,000, and other reagents such as drugs and plastic</p><p>Note that this PD would have to be hired and retrained. The first author of the manuscript who carried out the molecular experiments graduated in Dec 2021 but failed to pass on the technical knowledge due to COVID restrictions at the UM: we were completely shut down until July 2020, and at 20% capacity from March 2020 to July 2021 (people also couldn’t work together to show techniques), and no new people joined the lab in 2020-2022 (most of the 2021 grad student class deferred to 2022 and no PD candidates apply).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>As the study currently stands, the proposed model is speculative, and a significantly revised approach and design would be needed to support the study's conclusions.</p><p>1) The genetic interactions of OGT with other genes (PRC, Plc, rolled) rely only on the treatment of the flies with a systemic pharmacological OGT activity inhibitor OSMI. But, it is not possible to draw strong and nuanced conclusions from the datasets that rely heavily of a systemic drug-based manipulation instead of precise genetic alleles. Ideally the authors would want to include the same DAM-ID experiments performed with a OGT enzymatic mutant versus a OGT-WT.</p><p>The authors are encouraged to ask what happens to PRC occupancy in CD and SD in tissue-specific KD of OGT using RNAi. If the RNAi reagent does not provide the authors a complete loss of function, they should consider using sgRNA-based KD approaches or generate a HA or GFP OGT knock-in line and then utilize degron based tissue-specific KD of OGT.</p><p>2) For the OSMI experiments, would the authors present evidence that the drug is specific to OGT and has no off-target effects? Alternatively, authors might want to consider presenting results with OGT KD or OGT enzyme specific mutants to correlate OSMI results with. These orthogonal and corroborative datasets would be required to bolster the conclusions.</p></disp-quote><p>Response to 1 and 2 (as point 1 in the author’s recommendations):</p><p>In data now added to Figure 3C and added here for the reviewer’s convenience, we show that heterozygous catalytically dead mutants, <italic>OGT<sup>K872M</sup>/+</italic> ((Mariappa et al. 2015) 100% of OGT but only 50% cat activity, see diagram on the right), phenocopies the effects of protein null <italic>OGT<sup>1</sup></italic> allele (50% of protein with catalytic activity) in preventing diet-induced taste plasticity on a sugar diet (SD). No effects were observed on a control diet (CD). This shows genetic evidence for OGT activity being essential for taste changes in response to a SD. Please note that as the diagram in Figure 3A now shows, proboscis extension response (PER) is measured from 1 (full extension) to 0 (no extension). Thus, the PER data shown in the manuscript is the raw data (mean +/-SEM) obtained from observing the flies during sucrose stimulation; it is not normalized (see below for full response to this comment). Importantly, the phenotype of <italic>OGT<sup>K872M</sup>/+</italic> flies (wild-type taste on sugar diet) is similar to that of OGT RNAi targeted specifically to the Gr5a+ neurons (now Figure 3B). It is also identical to that of the OSMI-1 treatment (now Figure 3E). OSMI-1 is a specific inhibitor of OGT developed by Harvard Medical School and the NIH and published in 2015 (Ortiz-Meoz et al. 2015); its inhibition is insensitive to UDP-GlcNAc concentration, and it doesn’t affect cell-surface glycosylation. We had previously used OGT in (May et al. 2020).</p><p>If OGT catalytic activity were important, we would expect that interfering with the removal of GlcNAcylation would mimic the effects of a sugar diet and OGT overexpression on taste. We tested this possibility by knocking down the antagonistic enzyme to OGT, O-GlcNAcase (OGA), which removes the GlcNAc moiety only in the Gr5a+ neurons. This resulted in a marked decrease in sucrose taste sensation in control-diet flies (Figure 3D), mimicking the effects of <italic>OGT</italic> overexpression and sugar diet and further validating the role of OGT activity.</p><p>To further validate these findings, we tested the effects of OSMI-1 treatment in flies that overexpress OGT in the Gr5a+ neurons. As a reminder, expression of OGT in the Gr5a+ neurons results in taste depression on a control diet, mimicking the effects of a sugar diet. Treatment with OSMI-1, however, inhibited the effects of OGT overexpression on taste, as shown in Figure 3 E. These results link the OGT overexpression phenotype to its catalytic activity.</p><p>Together, the experiments in the new Figure 3 provide further evidence for the role of OGT catalytic activity in taste plasticity.</p><p>We disagree with the comment that we rely solely on pharmacological manipulations; in fact, we use cell-specific – pharmacological and dietary interventions. Indeed, Reviewers 2 and 3 praised our approaches by saying: “This is an elegant group of experiments revealing mechanisms for how nutrigenomic signaling triggers cellular responses to nutrients” and “Strengths: the thorough exploration of epistatic relationships between different players in the system.” All of our experiments combine genetic manipulations in combination with dietary and/or pharmacological treatments to show that molecular, neural, and behavioral taste phenotypes arise only in specific contexts, so no single phenotype occurs due to nonspecific manipulations. Without this approach, most of these epistatic relationships would be largely inaccessible in this system. We have also used a combination of both genetic and pharmacological tools to implicate not only genes but also their function (i.e., enzymatic activity) to nutrient-specific effects. Third, we established causality and relationship by inducing and rescuing the molecular, behavioral, and electrophysiological phenotypes. Thus, our model is based on a combination of direct and indirect data (genetic manipulations are by nature inferential) obtained from a controlled and careful set of experiments.</p><p>We could spend the next 6+ months trying to generate cell-specific alleles of OGT, which could bring their own unspecific effect, such as development and compensatory effects. However, this would only marginally add to the story now that we have added additional characterizations. In particular, we carried out additional genetic and pharmacological epistasis experiments, which we added to Figure 4. Here, we show that the taste phenotype caused by OGT overexpression in the Gr5a+ neurons entirely depends on the presence of <italic>Pcl</italic>. This provides genetic evidence for the data in the original manuscript version (now Figure 4B), where we rescued the effects of Pcl overexpression with OSMI-1.</p><p>We manipulated <italic>Pcl</italic> instead of <italic>Ez</italic> because this manipulation is more specific. The PRC2 complex comes in many different “flavors,” all of which contain Ez. Each of the PRC2 variants is characterized by a different recruiter, which targets the complex to specific regions of chromatin (i.e., Pcl has a Tudor domain which is thought to target PRC2.1, the PCl<sup>-</sup>containing PRC2, to actively transcribed chromatin). Thus, by manipulating <italic>Pcl</italic>, we can target a specific type of PRC2.1, and as we showed in, (Vaziri et al. 2020), the other PRC2 variants do not play a role in taste plasticity; in that manuscript, we also show that <italic>Pcl, Ez, Suz12,</italic> and <italic>Esc</italic> mutants phenocopy one another, and that the effects of Pcl on taste are indeed dependent on the catalytic activity of Ez. Here we took a similar approach and showed that <italic>OGT</italic> expression requires not only <italic>Pcl</italic>, but a catalytically active PRC2 to mediate its effect on taste plasticity (Figure 4D).</p><p>Together the new Figure 4 experiments place OGT and PRC2.1 in the same genetic pathway, indicating a strong interaction between OGT, Pcl, and PRC2, and support the results of the DAM-ID and TRAP molecular experiments, which show synergistic effects between these players.</p><p>Finally, we added data showing that Gr5a+-specific knockdown of the kinase <italic>ERK</italic> (we previously only had mutant data) has marked effects on sucrose taste sensitivity (now in Figure 6-Supplement 1C).</p><p>The addition of these genetic experiments makes the manuscript stronger and hope the reviewer finds their concerns addressed.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) This study is measuring the chromatin availability and determined that there was higher accessibility under CD conditions. Since OGT also has critical cytosolic roles, it would be important to determine if this is due to differences in nuclear: cytoplasmic localization of OGT or due to changes in OGT activity. To this end, I would recommend a western blot of Nuclear v. cytoplasmic fractions of OGT for flies on CD vs SD or imaging based approaches would be needed.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that this is an important possibility. We tried available OGT antibodies for Western blot and immunofluorescence (to retain cell specificity), but they were not functional. In 2019 we attempted to generate rabbit polyclonal antibodies against OGT based on the two peptides below, as recommended by protein chemists:</p><p>DmOGT(570-592): KPYNFLKKLPTKGRLRIGYLSSD</p><p>DmOGT(1045-1059): Cys-EKYENGELPDHISAV</p><p>We injected 4 different rabbits, which gave rise to two different polyclonals per peptide. To our disappointment, none of the found antibodies showed a specific signal in Western blot and immunofluorescence experiments. We originally mentioned OGT compartmentalization in the discussion, but we agree that this point needs more stress, so we added it to the “limitation” portion of the discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) In Figure 2A, the authors describe a high correlation in chromatin binding sites between Pcl and OGT, concluding that the overlapping OGTXPRC2.1 regions are a critical subset for sweet tasting response. However, these overlapping regions are a rather small subset of sites, with the largest subset actually belonging the &quot;yellow&quot; H3K4/H3K36 euchromatin subset. It is unclear from this analysis why the authors chose to pursue the blue chromatin instead. It would be important to rank regulatory regions bound by DAM:OGT alone and DAM:Pcl alone to establish the primary regions of binding for both OGT and Pcl irrespective of each other. These regions can then be compared with the known sweet tasting genes to rank the relevant binding regions. Should there be other regions relevant to sweet taste that are not overlapping between OGT and Pcl that should be reported. This will also give readers a more comprehensive understanding about the role of Sr motifs and if this is a small but significant subset of genes regulated by OGT or comprise the majority of cis-regulatory regions controlled by OGT.</p></disp-quote><p>The OGT:dam data show that this enzyme is found at about an equal number of genes in yellow and blue chromatin (Figure 1B-D); only genes in blue chromatin are enriched for neural functions- see new text based on the suggestion to carry out more analyses on these two types of chromatin. The overlap between Pcl and OGT only occurs in a small proportion (162) of these OGT peaks, as shown in Figure 2. As we wrote in the text, the OGT/Pcl peaks are enriched in blue chromatin (permutation test); this is somewhat expected in a way since Pcl occupies blue chromatin, as shown in our previous analyses (Vaziri et al. 2020), and also demonstrated by the lower expression of the OGT x Pcl genes compared to OGT-alone (Figure 2B). Intriguingly, in (Vaziri et al. 2020) we observed that PCl<sup>-</sup>associated genes have a lower expression than non-PCl<sup>-</sup>bound genes but also show considerable variation in expression among them. The comparison in Figure 4B with Pcl vs. OGT/Pcl shows that the PCl<sup>-</sup>only genes have lower expression.</p><p>We added the enrichment for cis-regulatory regions among OGT-bound, PCl<sup>-</sup>bound, and OGT/Pcl and OGT/PREs regulatory regions in the supplementary excel file; the breakdown for Sr is shown in Figure 4A (now 5A). Very few genes are known as “sweet taste genes” outside of the sweet taste receptors, and the occupancy and expression of these sweet taste receptor genes is unchanged by diet. However, our previous molecular characterization of the sweet sensing neurons did identify two transcription factors, Ptx1, and cad, which we show here are occupied by OGT and Pcl, as mentioned in the manuscript. We took the reviewer’s suggestion and analyzed the GO terms and accessibility for OGT occupancy among yellow and blue chromatin (Figure 1-Supplement 1). We found that only blue genes showed enrichment in GO terms, which are a subset of those found in the OGT/Pcl genes. We discuss the results of the analysis in the text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The authors use PCL as a proxy for PRC2.1 activity as it is the recruiter for PRC2.1. However, why wasn't DAM::PRC2.1 performed to directly compare to OGT? This data should be provided to show the overlap of PRC2.1 to Pcl or it should be explained in the results.</p></disp-quote><p>We manipulated and measured <italic>Pcl</italic> binding instead of <italic>Ez</italic> because this manipulation is more specific. The PRC2 complex comes in many different “flavors,” all of which contain Ez. Each of the PRC2 variants is characterized by a different recruiter, which targets the complex to specific regions of chromatin (i.e., Pcl has a Tudor domain which is thought to target PRC2.1, the PCl<sup>-</sup>containing PRC2, to actively transcribed chromatin).

Because this analysis is based on an overexpression of the gene of interest, I believe it is important to repeat these experiments in flies overexpressing these genes in neurons unrelated to the sweet taste response- such as in the neighboring bitter taste neurons. This is especially a critical set of experiments to do, as the primary thesis of this study is about how each cell alters its nutrigenomic signaling in different cell types, but the analysis is primarily focused on DAM-ID datasets from overexpressed OGT in Gr5a. The study would be relevant if the authors did comparative analysis of OGT-PRC interactions in neurons that have different sensitivities or taste modalities to sugar.</p></disp-quote><p>The expression of Pcl and OGT for the molecular experiment only occurs for 18 hours. We do not solely use overexpression, but also RNAi, loss of function alleles, and genetic manipulations compared to overexpression. Importantly, we show that our manipulations only have an effect in combination with an environmental variable (diet, i.e., OGT RNAi, OGT mutants, and Pcl mutants).</p><p>(As in the authors’ recommendation response): This study is a cell-specific investigation of nutrigenomic mechanisms in the Gr5a+ sweet taste neurons; it was not our intention to examine mechanisms across different cell types.

In the proboscis extension response, what is measured is the extent of the proboscis extension when the fly labellum is stimulated with different sucrose concentrations.

We added this as a diagram in Figure 3A.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) Figure 4B seems misleading in the way it is plotted. Authors claim a bias of SR genes at the TSS in the PRC2.1 and OGT overlapping regions. However, the y axes are not to the same scale. In fact, the not OGT/PRC2 regions have much higher number of genes with SR motifs at every single position plotted on 4B. Specifically the strong statements findings in the results paragraph on lines 262-283 are not sufficiently supported and the authors are encouraged to revise this or move it to discussion.</p></disp-quote><p>4B (Now 5B) plots the distribution of Sr binding sites along the regions up and downstream of the TSS. The reason for the difference in the Y axis is that far more genes have Sr binding sites and do not have OGT/PRC2/Pcl. What the graph clearly shows, however, is where the position of Sr is relative to the TSS, and the pattern is opposite between OGT/Pcl and non-OGT-Pcl. To address the reviewer’s comment, we have now normalized the counts relative to the genome-wide expectation (derived by multiplying the number of potential target genes by the fractional coverage of Sr motifs on the genome); a score of 1.0 indicates the hypothetical genome-wide average overlap with Sr motifs and is shown as a red dashed line. This normalized analysis shows an even stronger enrichment of Sr at the TSS of OGT/PRC2/Pcl genes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) Many of the experiments involved moving flies to OSMI or Trametinib diets. A caveat to this method is that this treatment will influence OGT/ERK in the fly globally. Because both OGT/ERK impact a number of critical biological processes, this makes the results difficult to interpret as impacts of taste sensing or due to the flies being generally unhealthy. It would be helpful to see fly survival on control, OSMI supplemented, and Trametinib diets to determine how detrimental these diet conditions are in general to the fly.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now added these experiments to Figure 4-Supplement 1A. There is no effect on survival. Also, OSMI and Trametinib affect the taste system in specific dietary contexts, not indiscriminately.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10) In general, the figure legends and methods are lacking in detail. For instance, in Figure 1F, are the GO terms for control diet comprised from all peaks listed or just the peaks unique to CD? Same question for the SD GO terms. Abbreviations are not elaborated in the legend or methods (ex: Figure 2B TPM) or lacking axis labels (ex: Figure 2D), etc. I suggest a thorough review of the methods and legend to add details necessary to interpret the results and make it possible to replicate experimental designs.</p></disp-quote><p>In Figure 1, “CD” means the Control diet only GO terms, “SD” means the Sugar diet only go terms, and SD/CD the differential binding go terms. We further clarified this in the legends and text and added the missing abbreviation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>1. There are too many instances of non-technical phrases that are unclear/nonspecific. For example, &quot;…OGT moonlights on the chromatin ….&quot;, or &quot;… OGT decorates nutrient-sensitive …&quot;. These phrases should be replaced with more precise words, unless these phrases are common in the field and I am just unaware.</p></disp-quote><p>We were also surprised to see these terms used in the literature. However, “moonlight” is indeed generally used to describe alternative functions of enzymes, especially metabolic enzymes. The term was generated early in the 2000s, but it has been used more in the last 5-10 years; currently, there are 1,700 manuscripts on Pubmed that use “moonlight” as we did in the manuscript. “Decorate” first originated to describe post-translational or non-enzymatic modifications to histones, but more recently, it has also been used to refer to the association of a protein with chromatin or nucleic acids; this is widely used in the epigenetics field, perhaps because some find that using “binding” or “association” may imply direct interactions with DNA or chromatin.
