inactivation of their Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 calcium channels. Mutations in the <italic>CABP2</italic> gene underlie non-syndromic autosomal recessive hearing loss DFNB93. Besides CaBP2, the structurally related CaBP1 is highly abundant in the IHCs. Here, we investigated how the two CaBPs cooperatively regulate IHC synaptic function. In <italic>Cabp1/2</italic> double-knockout mice, we find strongly enhanced Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 inactivation, slowed recovery from inactivation and impaired sustained exocytosis. Already mild IHC activation further reduces the availability of channels to trigger synaptic transmission and may effectively silence synapses. Spontaneous and sound-evoked responses of spiral ganglion neurons in vivo are strikingly reduced and strongly depend on stimulation rates. Transgenic expression of CaBP2 leads to substantial recovery of IHC synaptic function and hearing sensitivity. We conclude that CaBP1 and 2 act together to suppress voltage- and calcium-dependent inactivation of IHC Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 channels in order to support sufficient rate of exocytosis and enable fast, temporally precise and indefatigable sound encoding.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>DFNB93</kwd><kwd>calcium channel</kwd><kwd>hearing impairment</kwd><kwd>ribbon synapse</kwd><kwd>CACNA1D</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PP1608: PA 2769/1-1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Pangrsic</surname><given-names>Tina</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>413501650</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Oestreicher</surname><given-names>David</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CRC889: B09</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Pangrsic</surname><given-names>Tina</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CRC889: A06</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Strenzke</surname><given-names>Nicola</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Multiscale Bioimaging Cluster of Excellence</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>EXC 2067/1-390729940</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Pangrsic</surname><given-names>Tina</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection, and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Analysis of <italic>Cabp1/2</italic> double knockout phyenotype and rescue by viral delivery of <italic>Cabp2</italic> identifies the interplay between two CaBPs to promote sustained synaptic transmission at the inner hair cell synapses.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Calcium influx through voltage-gated calcium channels (Ca<sub>V</sub>s) is a pivotal initiator of neurotransmission. These channels typically undergo considerable Ca<sup>2+</sup>- and voltage-dependent inactivation (CDI and VDI), which limits the amount of incoming Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions and thus possible excitotoxicity. In sensory receptor cells such as sensory inner hair cells (IHCs) and photoreceptors, however, the extent of inactivation is significantly reduced to allow encoding of graded and sustained membrane potential fluctuations in response to ongoing sound or visual (t.i. ‘darkness’) stimuli (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Pangrsic et al., 2018</xref>). Furthermore, slowed inactivation of L-type Ca<sub>V</sub>s was also reported at ribbon synapses of retinal bipolar cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">von Gersdorff and Matthews, 1996</xref>), which transmit visual information via continuous exocytosis of synaptic vesicles onto retinal ganglion cells. The attenuation of channel inactivation may be largely attributed to the action of calcium-binding proteins, CaBPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Haeseleer et al., 2000</xref>), which primarily abate the calmodulin (CaM)-mediated CDI of Ca<sub>V</sub> channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Haeseleer et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Findeisen and Minor, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Haeseleer et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lee et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Yang et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Yang et al., 2014</xref>). At the IHC ribbon synapses, the Ca<sup>2+</sup> current is carried through the L-type Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Baig et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Platzer et al., 2000</xref>). Their biophysical properties may be regulated by several CaBP family members (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cui et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Yang et al., 2018</xref>), but most prominently by CaBP2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Picher, 2017</xref>). Mutations in the <italic>CaBP2</italic> gene cause moderate to severe autosomal recessive hearing impairment DFNB93 (see e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Picher, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Koohiyan, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Schrauwen et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Sheyanth et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Tabatabaiefar et al., 2011</xref>). Interestingly, the loss of CaBP2 seems to significantly affect VDI, but not CDI of the IHC Ca<sup>2+</sup> currents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Picher, 2017</xref>). Furthermore, isolated disruption of CaBP1 or CaBP4 in mice leads to at most modest enhancement of IHC Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 inactivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cui et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Yang et al., 2018</xref>). Moreover, the automodulatory C-terminal domain of the long Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 isoform, abundant at the IHC ribbon synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bock et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Scharinger et al., 2015</xref>), does not seem critical for CDI suppression either, as its disruption does not lead to hearing impairment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Scharinger et al., 2015</xref>). The question of which mechanisms are primarily responsible for suppressing IHC Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 CDI thus remains unresolved. Since CaBP2, followed by the structurally similar CaBP1, are the most abundant members of the CaBP family in the cochlea (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Yang et al., 2016</xref>), we set out to investigate the phenotype of <italic>Cabp1/2</italic> double-knockout (DKO) animals at the systems and cellular levels. Severe hearing impairment that we observed in these animals reveals that CaBP1 and 2 act together to attenuate the inactivation of the IHC Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 channels. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the combined absence of CaBP1 and 2 almost abolishes sustained, and, upon increased hair cell synaptic activity, the fast component of exocytosis. Such phenotype was observed neither in <italic>Cabp1</italic> nor in <italic>Cabp2</italic> single KO animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Yang et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Picher, 2017</xref>). To obtain a more comprehensive understanding of the roles of the two calcium-binding proteins, we attempted to rescue the auditory function of the CaBP1/2-depleted auditory system by viral delivery of a <italic>Cabp2</italic> coding sequence in the inner ear. These experiments revealed a substantial recovery of hearing, which may be related to the successful restoration of Ca<sup>2+</sup> currents and IHC exocytosis upon transgenic expression of CaBP2. Our findings indicate that the functions of CaBP1 and 2 partially overlap at the IHC ribbon synapse. Together, they provide sufficient attenuation of channel inactivation to sustain Ca<sup>2+</sup> currents and exocytosis required for temporally precise, indefatigable neurotransmission at this synapse.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Pronounced VDI and CDI of Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 channels in CaBP1/2-deficient IHCs</title><p>CaBP1 and 2 show high expression levels in the organ of Corti (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Yang et al., 2016</xref>), where they may modulate voltage-gated Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 channels at the IHC ribbon synapses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Deletion of CaBP2 results in an early-onset, progressive hearing impairment in the KO mouse model and moderate to severe hearing impairment, DFNB93, in affected human patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Picher, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Koohiyan, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Schrauwen et al., 2012</xref>). Loss of CaBP1 in mice, on the other hand, leaves hearing unperturbed in the first few months after birth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Yang et al., 2018</xref>). Since these proteins show a high degree of homology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Haeseleer et al., 2000</xref>), it is plausible that they possess similar features and are partially redundant, at least initially. Therefore, we were interested in understanding their cumulative impact on the function of hair cells and hearing. For this, we analyzed the phenotype of the <italic>Cabp1/2</italic>-DKO animals and tested the extent of functional rescue following the transgenic expression of CaBP2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>) in the ears of the DKO mice.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Strong inactivation of inner hair cell (IHC) Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 channels upon deletion of <italic>Cabp1</italic> and <italic>Cabp2</italic>.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic of the IHC and one of its several ribbon synapses.

The lack of complete recovery suggests either an inadequate expression of transgenic material or irreversible adaptive changes in response to the lack of major CaBPs that may occur prior to gene delivery. Similarly, Ca<sup>2+</sup> currents were greatly reduced upon application of short train stimuli and rescued efficiently by the introduction of the transgenic CaBP2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). However, it has to be noted that the cells in which train stimuli were applied showed a considerably lower calcium current inactivation upon a 500-ms step depolarization than the average (0.36 (<italic>n</italic> = 5) vs 0.47 (<italic>n</italic> = 21)). Short stimuli at different potentials revealed maximal Ca<sup>2+</sup>-current amplitudes in the IHCs of DKO mice that were comparable to controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>).

Exocytosis was probed by recordings of membrane capacitance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). In response to short stimuli [primarily recruiting the readily releasable pool (RRP) of vesicles], increases in capacitance were comparable, while long stimuli (reporting sustained exocytosis) evoked significantly smaller responses in the CaBP1/2-deficient IHCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A, B</xref>). These results are in line with the observation of comparable peak Ca<sup>2+</sup>-current amplitudes but reduced calcium charge transfer (<italic>Q</italic><sub>Ca</sub>) for stimulus durations above 50 ms. However, calculating exocytosis efficiency revealed that the reduction in sustained exocytosis cannot completely be explained by the diminished Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). This suggests an additional impairment in exo- or endocytic processes, the underlying mechanism of which is currently unknown. Transgenic expression of CaBP2 largely restored the efficiency of exocytosis, indicating that the impairment as observed in the IHCs of DKOs is related to the absence of the CaBPs.

We thus performed additional sets of experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D, E</xref>), in which the cells were held at either –65 or –55 mV, closer to the suggested resting potential of IHCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Russell and Sellick, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Dierich et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Oliver et al., 2003</xref>). Raising the holding voltage to –55 mV resulted in a significant reduction in the maximal Ca<sup>2+</sup> currents, which was more pronounced in the CaBP1/2-deficient IHCs as compared to controls (60 ± 4% vs 25 ± 4% reduction in DKO and WT IHCs, respectively; p &lt; 0.005, Student’s <italic>t</italic>-test). Consequently, further discrepancy between the <italic>Q</italic><sub>Ca</sub> in IHCs of WT and DKO animals was observed (p &lt; 0.001), which in DKO animals resulted in a complete loss of sustained exocytosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>; p &lt; 0.005). The latter was well restored upon AAV-mediated transgenic expression of CaBP2 (p &lt; 0.05), which also reduced the amount of calcium channel inactivation (38 ± 8% reduction in the maximal Ca<sup>2+</sup> current as well as a partial recovery of <italic>Q</italic><sub>Ca</sub> as compared to <italic>Cabp1/2</italic>-DKO IHCs; p &lt; 0.05). Rapid voltage oscillations during capacitance recordings may additionally activate calcium channels prior to the depolarizing step. We thus reduced the sine wave amplitude, which resulted in an intermediate phenotype, indicating pronounced activity-dependent deterioration of synaptic function in the absence of CaBPs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). We propose that in vivo in the absence of CaBP1 and 2 a large fraction of IHC Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 channels are in a state of prolonged inactivation. This does not support sufficient RRP exocytosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>) to sustain sensory coding during ongoing stimulation of IHCs.</p><p>Lastly, we asked whether the deletion of CaBP1 and 2 affects the speed of recovery from Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 inactivation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). We applied an initial 5-ms long pulse followed by a conditioning stimulus and a series of 5-ms long pulses to test the kinetics of recovery of the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-current amplitude. Upon 500-ms depolarization step (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>), the speed of recovery from inactivation was fast both in DKO as well as WT IHCs where a much smaller fraction of channels underwent inactivation (time constants of 0.62 and 0.75 s in DKO and WT IHCs, respectively; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>, left). As expected, transgenic expression of CaBP2 reduced the initial inactivation (Ca<sup>2+</sup>-current amplitude 10 ms after the conditioning pulse, expressed as the fraction of initial current – <italic>I</italic><sub>10ms_post</sub>/<italic>I</italic><sub>pre</sub>, WT: 0.73 ± 0.01; DKO: 0.36 ± 0.03; DKO + PHP.eB-<italic>Cabp2</italic>: 0.64 ± 0.02; p &lt; 0.001 for DKO vs DKO + PHP.eB-<italic>Cabp2</italic>). However, the recovery from the step-evoked inactivation was slowest in the <italic>Cabp2</italic>-injected DKO IHCs. We hypothesize that this may be related to the speed at which the intracellular [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] after depolarization is restored to the basal level allowing Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 recovery from CDI (see discussion). A 2-min long sine wave (±15 mV) from –55 mV to mimic a milder but prolonged hair cell stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>) elicited smaller inactivation of Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 channels as compared to a 500-ms depolarization step (<italic>I</italic><sub>10ms_post</sub>/<italic>I</italic><sub>pre</sub> of 0.73 ± 0.01 in WT; 0.58 ± 0.03 in DKO; 0.68 ± 0.03 in DKO + PHP.eB-<italic>Cabp2;</italic> p &lt; 0.05 for DKO vs DKO + PHP.eB-<italic>Cabp2</italic>). In these conditions, however, the recovery from inactivation was slowest in the DKO IHCs (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>, right). This suggests that in the absence of CaBP1 and 2 even mild but prolonged stimulation of IHCs in vivo may drive a significant fraction of Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 channels into ‘deep-state’ of inactivation with very slow recovery, as was described for Na<sub>V</sub>, K<sub>V</sub>, and Ca<sub>V</sub> channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bezanilla et al., 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Payandeh et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Olcese et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Ferreira et al., 2003</xref>), not allowing efficient sound encoding.</p><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>The speed of recovery of Ca<sup>2+</sup> currents is affected in CaBP1/2-deficient inner hair cells (IHCs).</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Ca<sup>2+</sup> currents were probed by 5-ms long depolarization steps to the maximum current potential.

In WT mice, we recorded responses in 39 neurons, which were classified as SGNs based on their location, response patterns, spike waveforms and recording stability. Their spiking characteristics resembled typical WT data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Picher, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Jean et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Jing et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Taberner and Liberman, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Vogl et al., 2017</xref>). In response to 50- or 500-ms tone burst at the characteristic frequency 30 dB above threshold (i.e. where the sigmoidal rate-intensity functions have saturated spike rates) and at a stimulus repetition rate of 5 or 0.5 Hz, they showed the SGN-typical very high onset firing rates, gradually adapting to reach steady-state rates between 100 and 400 Hz (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A, B</xref>). In contrast, only one out of the 20 neurons we recorded and analyzed from DKO animals showed a normal response in our automated tuning curve algorithm with a threshold of 35 dB SPL at 7.8 kHz, while all others displayed thresholds above 80 dB SPL and extremely low spike rates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A, B</xref>). Since in the majority of neurons frequency tuning was very broad, we used subjectively chosen best frequency tone burst or white noise burst stimulation of at least 80 dB SPL for subsequent characterization. 16 out of 19 DKO units responded with a relatively high onset rate but strong adaptation to a minimal sustained spiking (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A, B</xref>), which prevented unit classification based on the response patterns. Judging from the criteria described above, we assume that approximately 13 of these represent SGNs and 3 represent bushy cells or multipolar cells of the anteroventral cochlear nucleus. Three additional units (two resembling a pauser/buildup- and one displaying a clear chopper neuron-type response) were excluded from further analysis. Overall, in DKO neurons, peak and adapted rates were greatly reduced as compared to WT controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>), which came along with an increased latency (12.5 ± 2.8 ms vs WT 4.8 ± 0.2 ms; p &lt; 0.001, Wilcoxon rank-sum test) and increased jitter (18.3 ± 5.0 vs WT 1.5 ± 0.4; p &lt; 0.00001, Wilcoxon rank-sum test) of the first spike that followed the sound onset.</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Impaired sound encoding in <italic>Cabp1/2</italic>-DKO mice.</title><p>Single neuron responses to sound stimulation in vivo in the region of the auditory nerve of <italic>Cabp1/2</italic>-DKO mice were extremely scarce.

We hypothesize that in DKO SGNs, recovery of Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 channels after a silent interval in the range of 1–2 s is the limiting factor for determining the maximal SGN spiking rate at the sound onset. This may be further contributed by potentially slowed re-supply of synaptic vesicles, as suggested by reduced efficiency of sustained exocytosis in the CaBP1/2-deficient IHCs (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). In contrast, in WT SGNs, the maximal spike rates are mostly recovered after a silent interval of 150 ms, which may be mostly limited by vesicle replenishment at the IHC ribbon synapse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Strenzke et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Pangrsic et al., 2010</xref>). During a 5-Hz sound stimulation, the strength of adaptation was greatly enhanced (peak to adapted ratio 12.5 ± 3.0 vs WT 3.4 ± 0.2; p &lt; 0.00001, Wilcoxon rank-sum test) whereas the time constant of adaptation was unchanged 7.9 ± 2.0 ms in DKO compared to 6.9 ± 0.4 ms in WT (p = 0.5, Wilcoxon rank-sum test). However, for the longer 500 ms tone bursts used in the 0.5 Hz stimulation dataset, it becomes obvious that despite the strong adaptation, DKO neurons are still able to sustain spiking at a low rate throughout the stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). DKOs also showed reduced spontaneous spiking activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>), which supports the hypothesis that already in the absence of sound stimulation over tens of seconds a considerable fraction of calcium channels may be in steady-state inactivation.</p><p>The reduction in spike rates and their strong dependence on the strength of stimulation in the preceding seconds introduces experimental bias to our data. In the units of the DKO animals, it was not feasible to faithfully assess sound thresholds or dynamic ranges. Furthermore, the overall experimental yield was generally much lower in DKO animals. On average we hit 0.3 sound-responsive neurons per hour of recording, compared to 2.5 in WT. Very likely many DKO neurons failed to generate spontaneous and evoked action potentials, thus we were not able to identify them. Based on the DPOAE data we assume that cochlear mechanics and active amplification and thus the IHC receptor potential thresholds are mostly normal in the DKOs. We cannot exclude that IHC receptor potentials are decreased in amplitude, which however should rather reduce SGN adaptation. We thus interpret the observed increase in adaptation and delay of recovery of SGN spiking to be the effects of changed synaptic Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 channel kinetics as described above.</p><p>In summary, sound responses of DKO SGNs and cochlear nucleus neurons showed a drastic reduction in spontaneous and evoked action potential rates, which was associated with increased sound thresholds and reduced temporal precision of action potential generation. Together, these factors explain well the poor ABR thresholds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In this study, we examined the effects of genetic disruption of the two major CaBPs expressed in the cochlea. In the IHCs of CaBP1/2-deficient animals, we found largely inactivated Ca<sup>2+</sup> currents with prolonged recovery from inactivation upon mild oscillatory stimulation, which did not support sufficient neurotransmission for proper sound encoding. The extent of channel inactivation and impairment of IHC synaptic exocytosis aggravated with the extent of IHC stimulation. Similarly, SGN action potential rates in vivo declined at increased sound stimulation rates and displayed very strong adaptation upon stimulation, going along with impaired sustained IHC exocytosis. The impairment was significantly stronger as compared to the phenotype in the absence of CaBP2 alone. This suggests that under in vivo conditions the roles of CaBP1 and 2 are partially overlapping.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Function and expression profile of CaBPs in the cochlea</title><p>The murine cochlea shows strong expression of CaBP1 and 2, while the levels of CaBP4 and 5 seem negligible (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Yang et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Jean et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Xu et al., 2022</xref>). Among the three putative splice isoforms of CaBP2 differing in the N-terminal aminoacid sequence, the alternative long isoform, termed CaBP2-alt, may be the most abundant splice variant in the IHCs, as suggested by in situ hybridization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Yang et al., 2016</xref>), while SGNs seem to express none. So far our gene-rescue experiments were conducted with the conventional L-isoform only, which however shows strong inhibition of Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 inactivation in the HEK cells as well as IHCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Picher, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Oestreicher et al., 2021</xref>). Alternative splicing also generates three CaBP1 variants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Yang et al., 2016</xref>). The alternative long variant caldendrin is primarily expressed in the SGNs or the surrounding glia cells, while weak expression of CaBP1-S/-L (as judged by the mRNA production) was detected in hair cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Yang et al., 2016</xref>). Our DKO model lacks all splice isoforms of both CaBPs. Since <italic>Cabp1</italic> KO animals show normal hearing several weeks after birth, and CaBP2 is absent from SGNs, we interpret the hearing impairment of the <italic>Cabp1/2</italic> DKO animals to be primarily due to defects of hair cell function and judge contribution by SGN dysfunction as rather unlikely, at least in the early postnatal weeks.</p><p>The ABR thresholds of <italic>Cabp1</italic> KO animals are normal at 4 weeks of age, but deteriorate with age, starting with high-frequency hearing loss at 9 weeks. Conversely, the suprathreshold ABRs to tone burst stimulation show increased amplitudes and reduced latencies during the first 2 months after birth. This suggested enhanced SGN activity at first, followed by slowly progressing functional decline, possibly due to overexcitability-related toxicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Yang et al., 2018</xref>). Due to early strong impairment of hair cell synaptic function, the latter effects are not expected to occur in the DKO animals. However, ABR thresholds for clicks were further increased and an additional reduction in the summating potential was observed in the DKO animals at two as compared to 1 month of age despite relatively well-preserved DPOAEs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A–D</xref>). It thus remains to be clarified whether the absence of CaBP1 and 2 may affect (IHC) mechanotransduction at more mature stage. Unfortunately, this is difficult to assess due to the increased fragility of hair bundles at mature age. Intriguingly, CaBPs share similarities with calcium and integrin-binding protein 2 (CIB2), associated with hair bundle defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Giese et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Riazuddin et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Wang et al., 2017</xref>). When we overexpressed CaBP2 in the DKO animals, interestingly, suprathreshold responses of ABR wave I were very large (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>) and the summated wave I–IV responses were not distinguishable from WT responses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2C</xref>). However, tone burst and click thresholds did not completely recover to WT levels. The difference in the extent of rescue of threshold and suprathreshold responses may be due to possibly distinct requirements for CaBPs at synapses providing inputs to low- or high-threshold SGN fibers. Apart from a small shift in voltage activation and abundance of the channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Ohn et al., 2016</xref>), not much is known about the possible differences in the Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 properties and interaction partners at distinct ribbons. Neither is it known whether the composition of the channel complex t.i. proportions of alpha subunit splice variants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Scharinger et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Singh et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Vincent et al., 2017</xref>), and different beta subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Ortner et al., 2020</xref>) differs systematically between ribbon-AZs partnered by different classes of SGN fibers. Investigation of intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals from individual AZs may offer some answers in the future. Different amounts of rescue of threshold vs suprathreshold responses could be further due to confounding effects of CaBP1 and 2, for example augmented SGN response in <italic>Cabp2</italic>-injected DKO animals still lacking CaBP1 (reminiscent of the phenotype of young <italic>Cabp1</italic> KOs) in combination with ‘only’ partial rescue of CaBP2 function. Possible adverse effects of exogenous expression of CaBP2, for example off-target toxicity and uncontrolled overexpression of the transgene, have been discussed previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Oestreicher et al., 2021</xref>), and further experiments need to be performed in the future to achieve (close to) complete rescue of hearing function in these mutants.</p><p>Our results reveal that the amount of Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 inactivation increases dramatically when IHCs lack both major CaBPs. This suggests that the sole loss of either CaBP1 or 2, can be largely compensated by the other of the two CaBP members. Yet, the loss of CaBP2 alone still results in progressive hearing impairment in mice and DFNB93 in humans. The inability of CaBP1 to fully replace CaBP2 in the CaBP2-deficient IHCs may stem from either too low concentration of CaBP1 (and other CaBPs), or from distinct properties of the two proteins (enabling CaBP2 to exert more potent suppression of Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 inactivation, e.g. VDI, or potentially performing additional, yet unidentified cellular function). Interestingly, even the overexpression of CaBP2 did not completely rescue the hearing phenotype of DKO animals. Future experiments involving overexpression of CaBP1 (and possibly CaBP1-2 molecular chimeras) in <italic>Cabp2</italic> SKO and/or <italic>Cabp1/2</italic> DKO animals together with further biophysical interaction studies are required to gain a better understanding of the potentially distinct functions performed by the two major CaBPs in the hair cells.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>CaBPs as the regulators of IHC synaptic transmission</title><p>Previously, patch-clamp recordings surprisingly revealed normal whole-cell exocytosis in CaBP2-deficient IHCs despite enhanced inactivation of calcium channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Picher, 2017</xref>), and no obvious defects in the CaBP1-deficient IHCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Yang et al., 2018</xref>). In contrast, IHCs deficient in both, CaBP1 and 2, displayed strongly impaired exocytosis. Transgenic overexpression of CaBP2 in IHCs resulted in a partial recovery of the Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx and an even better recovery of exocytosis. Together, these results corroborate the hypothesis of the role of CaBPs in preventing extensive steady-state inactivation of Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 channels to support sufficient synaptic exocytosis for proper sound encoding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Picher, 2017</xref>). The lack of CaBP1 and 2 seems to impair sustained exocytosis and efficiency of exocytosis beyond the levels that could be attributed to reduced <italic>Q</italic><sub>Ca</sub>. This became particularly apparent when the IHCs were challenged by higher holding potentials in combination with large sine wave amplitudes during capacitance measurements, which we assume to partially deplete the pool of RRP vesicles. At present, it is not clear how CaBPs may directly affect the exocytosis, for example by influencing the coupling of the Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 channels and synaptic vesicles or potentially affecting the expression levels of other synaptic proteins that mediate synaptic vesicle replenishment. In this respect, it is worth noting that CaBP1 and 2 have been reported to modulate CaMKII activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Haeseleer et al., 2000</xref>), which in turn may through phosphorylation modify the Ca<sup>2+</sup> affinity of otoferlin C2 domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Meese et al., 2017</xref>). In the future, it is thus essential to investigate if CaBPs regulate the function of otoferlin and thus synaptic processes. Furthermore, other members of the CaBP/CaM family have been suggested to interact with synaptic proteins and/or be involved in the regulation of synaptic vesicle cycle: CaM in endocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Wu et al., 2009</xref>), CaBP5 in priming via interaction with Munc18-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Sokal and Haeseleer, 2011</xref>), CaBP1 via inhibition of IP<sub>3</sub> receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Haynes et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kasri et al., 2004</xref>). An important challenge for future studies is to identify further CaBP(2)-interaction partners and possible functions beyond modulation of calcium channels.</p><p>The recovery of Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 channels from inactivation upon prolonged milder stimulation (2-min sine wave) was following a single exponential course in WT IHCs, but additional slower component was detected in the IHCs deficient in CaBP1 and 2. In the IHCs of injected DKO animals, this second component appeared smaller and faster, suggesting that CaBPs speed-up recovery of Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 channels from inactivation. Upon a comparably shorter (500 ms) but stronger depolarization, the recovery of Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 from inactivation was very fast in DKO IHCs, in fact faster than in (WT or) <italic>Cabp2</italic>-injected DKO IHCs. We hypothesize this to be due to faster Ca<sup>2+</sup> clearance from the DKO IHC synapses as the intracellular [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] levels are expected to rise significantly less in CaBP1/2-deficient IHCs due to fast and pronounced Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 inactivation. In contrast, higher [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] may buildup at the synapses of WT and ‘rescued’ DKO IHCs; consequently, CDI may be prolonged. Another plausible explanation for the observation is, if we consider that CaPB2 may act as a slow mobile calcium buffer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Picher, 2017</xref>). In the presence of excessive ‘overexpressed’ CaBP2 in injected IHCs of DKO animals, the depolarization-evoked intracellular [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] transients may become biexponential as has been described for parvalbumin alpha (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lee et al., 2000</xref>), which may prolong the time constant of Ca<sup>2+</sup> clearance and determine the kinetics of channel recovery from inactivation. Our results of the recovery upon 500-ms depolarization may thus mostly reflect the kinetics of the Ca<sup>2+</sup> clearance from the cytosol, while the experiments with prolonged sine wave stimulation (when e.g. the function of calcium pumps and other extrusion systems and intracellular [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] levels may be at equilibrium), may report the speed of calcium channel recovery from a slow inactivation. Slow inactivation with very slow recovery was described for Na<sub>V</sub>, K<sub>V</sub>, and Ca<sub>V</sub> channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bezanilla et al., 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Payandeh et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Olcese et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Ferreira et al., 2003</xref>). It has to be noted that the time constant of recovery of Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 from slow VDI was comparably shorter (4 s) as observed in the present study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Ferreira et al., 2003</xref>). Possibly different conditions (e.g. stimulus parameters) or channel subtype may underlie this difference. Future experiments combining patch-clamp recordings with calcium imaging should be employed to address this question further. Finally, while we consider the effects of surgery on Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 recovery kinetics in injected mice as unlikely, we can at present not exclude this possibility.</p><p>From our in vitro recordings at higher holding potential or upon prolonged stimulation with small voltage oscillations we predict that in vivo a noteworthy proportion of Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 channels may be effectively inactivated and not available for mediating IHC synaptic transmission. This could explain the low experimental yield, the low ‘spontaneous’ spiking rates of the SGNs and lower sound-evoked spike rates with higher thresholds. Similarly, thresholds may be high for tone bursts in the ABR measurements due to high proportion of inactivated channels upon stimuli at high repetition rate used for these recordings (20–40 Hz repetition rate for click and tone burst stimulation, respectively). We believe that any sound stimulation and potentially even spontaneous activity may effectively silence DKO synapses. As expected, longer interstimulus intervals may allow a larger proportion of channels to recover between stimuli, increasing the onset rates of SGN spiking while decreasing the first spike latency and jitter. Still, high-intensity stimulation had to be used in the DKO animals to evoke an increase in SGN spiking. It is possible that spontaneous activity and/or our routines used to determine the SGN characteristic frequency inactivate a majority of IHC Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 channels thus not allowing reliable assessment of the characteristic frequency. In addition to Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 channel inactivation, other factors may contribute to low hearing sensitivity, such as possible impairment of synaptic vesicle replenishment, or IHC mechanotransduction, and, in some cases, impaired cochlear amplification. A complete lack of BK channels was shown to affect the IHC resting potential, receptor potential amplitude and timing, and consequently the timing and frequency of spiking in the SGNs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Oliver et al., 2006</xref>). Lower expression of BK channels is not expected to significantly affect hearing thresholds, at least initially (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Rüttiger et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Maison et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Pyott et al., 2007</xref>), and thus likely does not contribute to the hearing defect of the <italic>Cabp1/2</italic> DKO animals. However, at advanced ages, the effects described above may combine with the lack of CaBPs to additionally desynchronize already scarce spikes in the auditory nerve fibers.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Clinical implications for the diagnosis and treatment of DFNB93</title><p>The SGN sound encoding phenotype in <italic>Cabp2</italic>-KO mice was surprisingly mild compared to the deficits observed in DFNB93 patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Picher, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Schrauwen et al., 2012</xref>): SGN thresholds and evoked spike rates were only minimally affected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Picher, 2017</xref>). Given the strong recovery phenotype in the DKO we now consider the possibility that synaptic activity in response to everyday sounds could already inactivate calcium channels and reduce SGN spiking. In this case, communication in daily life would be more strongly impaired than audiometric data obtained in a soundproof chamber, especially when short stimuli separated by silent intervals are used. In mild cases, a gap detection test may be used to assess auditory fatigue. Based on our data, we further predict that patients that have a stronger channel inactivation phenotype might not benefit much from sound amplification by hearing aids. Instead, they should use technologies that improve the signal to noise ratio (e.g. noise cancellation, directional microphones, and wireless transmitters). An alternative or additional future treatment approach may be gene therapy. In our hands, re-expression of CaBP2 by genetic treatment partially restored Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 properties, IHC exocytosis and consequently ABR wave amplitudes and thresholds. This successful viral rescue supports the view that a reversible inactivation of IHC Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 currents is the main mechanism of hearing loss in CaBP-related deafness, which can be targeted by gene therapy in the future.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom">Reagent type (species) or resource</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Designation</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Source or reference</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Identifiers</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Strain, strain background (<italic>Mus musculus</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><italic>Cabp1</italic>-KO</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kim et al., 2014</xref></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID:5780462">MGI:5780462</ext-link></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">A KO of <italic>Cabp1</italic> used for cross-breeding to obtain <italic>Cabp1/2</italic>-DKO animals</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Strain, strain background (<italic>Mus musculus</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><italic>Cabp2<sup>LacZ/LacZ</sup></italic></td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Picher, 2017</xref></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID:6155766">MGI:6155766</ext-link></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">A KO of <italic>Cabp2</italic> used for cross-breeding to obtain <italic>Cabp1/2</italic>-DKO animals</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Other</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">PHP.eB viral capsid</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Addgene plasmid</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID:103005">#103005</ext-link></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Gift of V.

<italic>CaBP2<sup>LacZ/LacZ</sup></italic> mice, carrying LacZ trapping cassette in place of the exons 3 and 4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Picher, 2017</xref>), were crossbred with <italic>Cabp1</italic> KO mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kim et al., 2014</xref>) and maintained on a C57/Bl6 background. Mice of both sexes from 3 to 13 weeks were used for electrophysiological and systems physiology recordings. All experiments complied with the national animal care guidelines and were approved by the University of Göttingen Board for animal welfare and the animal welfare office of the state of Lower Saxony (AZ 33.19-42502-04-19/3134 and AZ 33.19-42502-04-19/3133).</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Systems physiology recordings: ABR and DPOAE</title><p>Prior to the experiments mice were weighed and anesthetized via intraperitoneal injections of ketamine (125 µg/g) and xylazine (2.5 µg/g). Recordings were obtained in a custom-made soundproof box with a Tucker-Davis (TDT) BioSig System II/BioSig software (Tucker-Davis Technologies, Alachua, FL). Body temperature was maintained using a heating pad (37°C) and ECG was monitored continuously. For ABR recordings, subcutaneous needles were placed at the vertex, the ipsilateral pinna and at the lower back. Using a JBL2402 speaker in free-field configuration, tone bursts (10 ms plateau, 1 ms cos<sup>2</sup> rise/fall) or clicks of 0.03 ms were ipsilaterally presented at 40 Hz for tone bursts or 20 Hz for clicks. ABR traces were amplified 50000-fold, band-pass filtered between 400 Hz and 4 kHz (NeuroAmp) and averaged from 1300 repetitions sampled at 50 kHz for 20 ms. Thresholds were defined in stacked waveforms as the lowest stimulus intensity (dB SPL) at which a reproducible waveform could be visually detected with a 10-dB precision. Wave I amplitudes were measured peak-to-trough. DPOAEs were measured using a custom-written MATLAB (MathWorks) routine. Two primary tones f1 and f2 (ratio f1/f2 = 1.2, level difference f2 = f1 + 10 dB) were presented via two speakers (MF-1, TDT) and a custom-made ear probe containing an MKE-2 microphone (Sennheiser). Stimulus duration was 16 ms and f2 levels varied from 10 to 70 dB SPL in 10 dB steps. The microphone signal was amplified (DMX 6Fire; Terratec (young animals), or UAC-2; Zoom (older animals)) and digitized (TDT System III). DPOAE amplitude was analyzed at 2 × f2 − f1 using custom-written MATLAB software (MathWorks) with fast Fourier transformation. DPOAE thresholds were determined as responses that exceeded –18 dB SPL in young and –4 dB SPL in older animals. Experimental data with obvious technical abnormalities (higher noise floor, inappropriate selection of frequency/intensity combinations) was excluded.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Auditory nerve fiber recordings</title><p>Mice were anesthetized by injection of xylazine (5 mg/kg), urethane (1.32 mg/kg), and buprenorphine (0.1 mg/kg) i.p., tracheotomized, and placed in a stereotactic apparatus. The left occipital bone and the cerebellum were partially removed to visualize the left superior semicircular canal. The latter served as a landmark to navigate a glass microelectrode through the cochlear nucleus, aiming at the location where the auditory nerve leaves the internal auditory canal and enters the cochlear nucleus. 85 or 90 dB broadband noise bursts (ScanSpeak, Avisoft Bioacoustics) were used as search stimuli to identify neurons that displayed sound-driven spiking activity. They were characterized by spontaneous rate and frequency tuning and the responses to tone bursts at the characteristic frequency, 30 dB above the threshold, as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Strenzke et al., 2016</xref>). In the majority of sound-responsive DKO neurons, thresholds were so high and tuning so broad that neither the automated tuning curve algorithm nor systematic or manual changes in sound frequency elicited frequency-specific responses. In these cases, we either chose a subjective ‘best frequency’ or used white noise burst stimulation at 85 dB.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Patch-clamp recordings</title><p>For patch-clamp recordings, the apical coils of 3- to 4-week-old animals were dissected in HEPES (2-[4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazinyl]ethanesulfonic acid)-Hanks solution containing (in mM): 10 HEPES, 5.35 KCl, 141.7 NaCl, 0.5 MgSO<sub>4</sub>, 1 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 11.1 <sc>D</sc>-glucose and 3.42 L-glutamine. pH was adjusted to 7.2. IHCs of the ~6 kHz tonotopical region were investigated using the perforated patch configuration. The pipette solution contained (in mM): 130 Cs-gluconate, 10 Tetraethylammonium-Cl, 10 4-AP, 1 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 10 HEPES, 300 mg/ml amphotericin B, pH 7.2–290 mOsm. The bath solution was composed of (in mM): 111 NaCl, 35 TEA-Cl, 2.8 KCl, 1 CsCl, 1 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 10 NaOH–HEPES, 11.3 <sc>D</sc>-glucose, and 1.3 or 2 CaCl<sub>2</sub> or BaCl<sub>2</sub> (pH 7.2, 300–310 mOsm). When the bath solution contained 2 mM BaCl<sub>2</sub>/CaCl<sub>2</sub>, NaCl was adjusted to 110 mM. The bath solution was supplemented by the SK2 channel blocker apamin (100 nM; Peptanova, Germany) freshly on the day of the experiment. Recordings were performed at room temperature using an EPC-9 amplifier (Heka-Germany) controlled by Pulse software. Currents were leak-corrected using a p/10 protocol, sampled at 50 kHz and corrected offline for the liquid junction potential (–15 mV). IHCs were patched at a holding potential of –85 mV (in a subset of experiments, –65 and –55 mV) and stimulated with depolarizations to the peak Ca<sup>2+</sup>-current potential. Changes in membrane capacitance were monitored by applying a 2-kHz-sine wave with an amplitude of 35 mV. In a subset of experiments, the amplitude was reduced to 15 mV to diminish possible stimulation of the cells caused by the sine wave. Recordings with leak currents exceeding –50 pA, series resistance above 34 MΩ and unstable recordings were excluded from analysis. VDI and CDI were calculated as follows: VDI = 1 − <italic>I</italic><sub>Ba_500</sub>/<italic>I</italic><sub>Ba_initial</sub> and CDI = 1 − (<italic>I</italic><sub>Ca_500</sub>/<italic>I</italic> <sub>Ca_initial</sub>)/(<italic>I</italic><sub>Ba_500</sub>/<italic>I</italic><sub>Ba_initial</sub>), where <italic>I</italic><sub>Ba_500</sub> and <italic>I</italic><sub>Ca_500</sub> represent whole-cell Ba<sup>2+</sup> and Ca<sup>2+</sup> currents 500 ms after beginning of depolarization, and <italic>I</italic><sub>Ba_initial</sub> and <italic>I</italic><sub>Ca_initial</sub> correspond to the initial, peak currents with the respective divalent cations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Tadross et al., 2010</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Immunohistochemistry</title><p>Apical coils (6–8 kHz tonotopical region) of the organ of Corti were fixed with 4% (vol/vol) formaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) on ice. After incubation for 1 hr at room temperature in goat serum dilution buffer [16% (vol/vol) normal goat serum, 450 mM NaCl, 0.6% Triton X-100, 20 mM phosphate buffer (pH 7.4)], the explants were incubated in primary antibodies over night at 4°C. The following antibodies were used: chicken anti-Homer1 (1:200, Synaptic Systems), mouse anti-Myosin VIIa (1:200, Santa Cruz), guinea pig anti-Synapsin1/2 (1:200, Synaptic Systems), rabbit anti-RibeyeA (1:200, Synaptic Systems), guinea pig anti-parvalbumin-α (1:200; Synaptic Systems), rabbit anti-BK (1:200; Alomone), rabbit anti-SK2 (1:200; Sigma), mouse anti-CtBP2 (1:200; BD Biosciences), goat anti-GluA3 (1:200; Santa Cruz), rabbit-anti-CaV1.3 (1:100; Alomone), and chicken anti-GFP (1:200, Abcam). The explants were then incubated with secondary AlexaFluor-labeled antibodies (1:200; Molecular Probes/Thermo Fischer, Abcam) for 1 hr at room temperature, washed three times in PBS and mounted. Confocal images were acquired with an Abberrior Instruments Expert Line STED microscope using a 1.4 NA ×100 oil immersion objective. ImageJ software (NIH) was employed to analyze 2D confocal stacks and generate maximum projections. Volumetric synapse and BK-cluster immunofluorescence analysis ran on Imaris (Bitplane, Zurich, Switzerland) paired with a custom-written Matlab software (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Ohn et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Neef et al., 2018</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Molecular biology and AAV vector production</title><p>The construct containing the long isoform of mouse CaBP2 (CaBP2-L; NCBI Reference Sequence: NP_038906.2) and eGFP is depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>. AAV9-PHP.eB particles were generated using our standard AAV purification procedure previously described in more detail in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Huet and Rankovic, 2021</xref>. In brief, triple transfection of HEK-293T cells was performed using pHelper plasmid (TaKaRa/Clontech), the <italic>trans</italic>-plasmid providing viral capsid PHP.eB (a generous gift from Viviana Gradinaru, Addgene plasmid #103005) and the <italic>cis</italic>-plasmid providing hCMV/HBA_wtCaBP2-P2A-eGFP. PHP.eB viral particles were harvested from the medium 72 hr after, and from cells and the medium 120 hr after transfection. Precipitation was done with 40% polyethylene glycol 8000 (Acros Organics, Germany) in 500 mM NaCl for 2 hr at 4°C. Both, precipitate and cells were lysed in high salt buffer (500 mM NaCl, 2 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 40 mM Tris–HCl, pH 8.0) and non-viral DNA was degraded using salt-activated nuclease (SAN, Arcticzymes, USA). The cell lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 2000 × <italic>g</italic> for 10 min and then purified over iodixanol (Optiprep, Axis Shield, Norway) step gradients (15, 25, 40, and 60%) at 350,000 × <italic>g</italic> for 2.25 hr (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Grieger et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Zolotukhin et al., 1999</xref>). Finally, viral particles were concentrated using Amicon filters (EMD, UFC910024) and formulated in sterile PBS supplemented with 0.001% Pluronic F-68 (Gibco, Germany). Virus titer was 8.2 × 10<sup>12</sup> genome copies/ml measured by determining the number of DNase I resistant genome copies using qPCR (StepOne, Applied Biosystems) and AAV titration kit (TaKaRa/Clontech). The purity of viruses was routinely checked by silver staining (Pierce, Germany) after gel electrophoresis (NovexTM 4–12% Tris-Glycine, Thermo Fisher Scientific).</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Virus injections</title><p>Mice were injected at postnatal day 6 using the round window approach as described in earlier studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Rankovic et al., 2020</xref>). In brief, anesthesia was established with isoflurane (5% for induction, 2–3% for maintenance, frequent testing of the absence of hind-limb withdrawal reflex). For analgesia, buprenorphine (0.1 mg/kg, 30 min before surgery) and carprofen (5 mg/kg, during and 1 day after surgery) were applied subcutaneously and Xylocain (10 mg spray) locally. Body temperature was maintained by a custom-built heating blanket. Following a retro-auricular approach, the facial nerve was exposed to determine where to puncture the cartilaginous bulla with the injection pipette and target the scala tympani where virus suspension (1–1.5 μl, corresponding to 0.82–1.23 × 10<sup>10</sup> AAV particles) was injected. Following injection, the endogenous tissue was relocated and the surgical situs closed by suturing the skin. Two to three weeks later, the injected mice were used for hearing tests, in vitro electrophysiology and immunohistochemistry of the cochleae.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Data analysis</title><p>Data were analyzed using Igor Pro Software (Wavemetrics), GraphPad PRISM (GraphPad Software, Inc), Matlab (Mathworks), and Imaris (Bitplane).

The authors measured the calcium current inactivation from the double knock-out CaBP1 and 2 and show that both proteins contribute to the voltage-dependent and calcium-dependent inactivation. Synaptic release was reduced in the double KO. As a consequence, the authors observed a depressed activity within the auditory nerve. Taken together, this study identifies a new player that regulates the stimulation-secretion coupling in the auditory sensory cells.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>In this study, the authors bring compelling evidence that CaBP 1 and 2 are both involved in the inactivation of the calcium current, from cellular up to system level and by taking care to probe different experimental conditions such as different holding potentials and by rescuing the phenotype with the re-expression of CaBP2. Indeed, while changing the holding potential worsen the secretion, it completely changes the kinetics of the inactivation recovery.

The authors measured the calcium current inactivation from the double knock-out CaBP1 and 2 and showed that both proteins contribute to voltage-dependent and calcium-dependent inactivation.

Indeed, while changing the holding potential worsens the secretion, it completely changes the kinetics of the inactivation recovery.

We agree with the reviewer that sham surgery may convey more information that might benefit the interpretation of our data. The recovery experiments were very tedious and these long patch-clamp paradigms required extremely stable recordings. Based on our observations, we plan to address the recovery kinetics into more detail in the follow-up study. However, we would consider off-side effects of the surgery (as it may mainly affect middle ear function) and of the empty AAV-vector on inner hair cell calcium current recovery rather unlikely, but we cannot exclude them. We thus added a sentence in the discussion to alert to that. Based on previously published data of the effect of PHP.eB-Cabp2eGFP in WT animals we expect some (mild) adverse effects on hearing from overexpression of CaBP2 and/or eGFP in the inner ear. In the future, we thus plan to further optimize the treatment. In terms of the in vivo recordings from the auditory nerve fibers of the rescued mice, we could not agree more. That is in plan for the follow-up study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>The authors attempted to unravel the role of the Ca2+-binding proteins CaBP1 and CaBP2 for the hitherto enigmatic lack of Ca2+-dependent inactivation of Ca2+ currents in sensory inner hair cells (IHCs).

In the future, we will address this question into greater detail, possibly with improved viral constructs. In a previous study, we attempted to correlate eGFP fluorescence intensity with residual depolarization-evoked calcium current in CaBP2-injected IHC of Cabp2 single KO animals. At that time, we were unable to establish a convincing correlation. This could be related to (i) large variability in the data, possibly requiring much larger datasets to observe potential correlation above the noise, (ii) variable imaging conditions from prep to prep, or (iii) additional parameters that could influence the outcome of the current rescue, e.g. uncontrolled expression of the transgene. However, we did analyse the correlation between ABR click thresholds and mean IHC eGFP fluorescence in another, preliminary set of data that included different viruses at different titres. There, we were able to observe a relatively good correlation. Interestingly, some of the highest expression levels resulted in poorer threshold recovery, which could indicate harmful overexpression. Moreover, the correlation was only detected when the difference of the mean eGFP expression levels per organ was large. Furthermore, significantly less efficient ABR threshold recovery was observed in the non-injected contralateral ears, which showed a significantly lower viral expression of the transgene. In our follow-up study, we will investigate the question of dose dependence of rescue in more detail.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>- There are two paragraphs in the results text about supplemental figure #2, which suggests that it should be moved to the main figures.</p></disp-quote><p>We would like to thank the reviewer for this suggestion.

The choice of test was made based on the distribution and the variance of the data points. We now opted for a unified test, t test with Welch correction, which assumes that samples come from populations with normal distribution, but does not make assumption about equal variances. The outcome of these tests were similar.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- The much broader tuning of the auditory nerve fibers is interesting, consider including this in a figure.</p></disp-quote><p>For recording tuning curves, we use an automated algorithm which adapts the tone burst intensity and frequency depending on the preceding results. The threshold criterion is an increase of spiking by 20Hz above spontaneous rate. This routine works fairly well in wild-type animals. However, DKO SGNs typically had very high thresholds at &gt;80 dB across all frequencies, which can partly be explained by the fact that they had very low spike rates and did not reach that criterion. Besides tuning curve runs, we also tried systematic frequency sweeps and manual frequency control to determine a best frequency, followed by a rate intensity function at that frequency to determine “best threshold”.</p><p>All this was difficult, because in the DKO SGNs, sound threshold detection was challenged by the strong dependence of spiking on the duration of the preceding silent interval. A preceding stimulus outside the frequency response area or below the activation threshold of the SGN would thus improve spiking by allowing for longer recovery, while a preceding efficient stimulus would reduce it. Thus, the sound threshold determined in a rate level sweep varied depending on the interstimulus interval and possibly even on the (randomized) order at which the intensities were played.</p><p>A meaningful threshold measure would require long silent interstimulus intervals, i.e. a long recording time. As tuning curves require multiple threshold measures, it seemed impossible to obtain a useful dataset at high quality. As we deemed the spike rate dependence on interstimulus intervals more important than the tuning we rather focused on tone burst responses acquired at frequency/intensity combinations at which the hair cells and their synapses were maximally activated. In wild-types, these would be tone bursts at characteristic frequency or noise bursts in the saturated part of the rate intensity function, which typically has a dynamic range of 10-25dB. As we assume (based on DPOAE) that cochlear micromechanics and amplification are mostly normal in the DKOs, we hypothesize that the sensitivity and dynamic range of basilar membrane motion and inner hair cell transduction are normal and that the increase in single unit thresholds and loss of sharp tuning are another readout of synaptic dysfunction.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- Figure S2 - please show separate panels for each channel, it is very difficult to make out the changes by eye in the merged panels.</p></disp-quote><p>Done.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- Figure S2 G - the results text stated that the BK channel clusters 'appeared' smaller - why was this not measured?</p></disp-quote><p>We have performed additional experiments to enable proper analysis of the BK channel clusters.
