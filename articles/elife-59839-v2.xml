modulated by volatile anesthetic (VA) drugs and play important roles in clinically relevant effects that accompany general anesthesia. Here, we utilize a photoaffinity analog of the VA isoflurane to identify a VA-binding site in the TREK1 K2P channel. The functional importance of the identified site was validated by mutagenesis and biochemical modification. Molecular dynamics simulations of TREK1 in the presence of VA found multiple neighboring residues on TREK1 TM2, TM3, and TM4 that contribute to anesthetic binding. The identified VA-binding region contains residues that play roles in the mechanisms by which heat, mechanical stretch, and pharmacological modulators alter TREK1 channel activity and overlaps with positions found to modulate TASK K2P channel VA sensitivity. Our findings define molecular contacts that mediate VA binding to TREK1 channels and suggest a mechanistic basis to explain how K2P channels are modulated by VAs.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>K2P</kwd><kwd>TREK1</kwd><kwd>isoflurane</kwd><kwd>anesthetic</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd><kwd><italic>Xenopus</italic></kwd><kwd>Zebrafish</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100005831</institution-id><institution>Foundation for Anesthesia Education and Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>FAER-182483-2</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Riegelhaupt</surname><given-names>Paul M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>K08GM132781</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Riegelhaupt</surname><given-names>Paul M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P01GM055876</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Eckenhoff</surname><given-names>Roderic G</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The volatile anesthetic isoflurane directly binds to the transmembrane domains of the TREK1 channel to allosterically modulate its function.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Tandem pore (K2P) potassium channels are a group of physiologically important K<sup>+</sup> leak channels that modulate cellular resting membrane potential to control excitability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Enyedi and Czirják, 2010</xref>).

Systemic effects of VA administration have been directly linked to K2P channel activity, including a role for carotid body TASK channels in mediating VA-induced respiratory depression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cotten, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chokshi et al., 2015</xref>) and for TREK1 channels in the vasodilatory and neuroprotective effects of both polyunsaturated fatty acids and VAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Blondeau et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Tong et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Initial evidence for a VA-induced potassium leak current was found in molluscan pacemaker neurons, an activity subsequently determined to be mediated by a member of the TASK K2P subfamily (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Franks and Lieb, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Andres-Enguix et al., 2007</xref>). Follow-up studies of both snail and human TASK channels identified specific amino acids that alter TASK responsiveness to VAs or eliminate stereoselective discrimination between enantiomeric VA agents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Andres-Enguix et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Conway and Cotten, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Luethy et al., 2017</xref>). These findings enabled predictions of structural determinants of anesthetic binding within the TASK channel family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bertaccini et al., 2014</xref>). However, significant differences in the gating and regulation of divergent K2P subfamilies make it difficult to generalize molecular details of the interactions between VAs and TASK K2P channels to other anesthetic-sensitive K2Ps (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Patel et al., 1999</xref>), most notably the TREK1 channel.</p><p>TREK1 is a member of a subgroup of K2Ps (including TREK1, TREK2, and TRAAK) regulated by the biophysical properties of their surroundings, including membrane stretch or deformation, temperature, and bilayer lipid composition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Honoré, 2007</xref>). This pronounced sensitivity of TREK1 to its surrounding environment is unique amongst known biologically relevant VA targets. VAs are small hydrophobic drugs that readily partition into lipid bilayers and in vivo anesthetic potency has long been known to correlate with lipid solubility, a relationship that holds true over a wide range of structurally diverse anesthetic agents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Sonner and Cantor, 2013</xref>). While the majority of studies exploring the interaction between anesthetics and ion channels have identified discrete binding sites thought to underlie the modulatory effects of these drugs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Nury et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Sauguet et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hemmings et al., 2019</xref>), modulation of TREK1 by VAs could be posited to occur via indirect effects on the properties of the surrounding bilayer. In fact, a recent study has proposed that in vitro administration of VA agents disrupt membrane lipid rafts, altering phospholipase C activity and modifying the milieu of lipids surrounding TREK1 to modulate its activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Pavel et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>The question of how VA drugs modulate TREK1 is the key issue addressed in this study. By utilizing an unbiased photolabeling approach, we show that the VA isoflurane binds to a TREK1 TM2 residue in close proximity to the previously proposed VA modulatory site in TASK K2P channels. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulation studies based on our photolabeling findings show that isoflurane, a known low-affinity ligand for TREK1, is mobile within this newly identified TREK1-binding site and interacts with residues from TM2, TM3, and TM4. These interactions include key molecular contacts with residues known to influence the conformational rearrangement of the TM4 helix that drive K2P modulation by heat, mechanical stretch, and other pharmacological channel modulators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dong et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lolicato et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brohawn et al., 2014a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Pope et al., 2018</xref>). Our photolabeling and MD results enabled us to design multiple point mutations within the putative VA-binding pocket that specifically diminished TREK1 VA responsiveness without otherwise perturbing channel function. Our data support the notion of a shared VA modulatory site across the TREK and TASK K2P subfamilies and suggest a mechanism by which binding of VA within this site promotes conformational rearrangements known to gate K2P channels.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Azi-isoflurane photolabeling of TREK1 identifies VA-binding sites</title><p>In order to identify TREK1 VA-binding sites, we utilized a previously validated photoreactive analog of the clinically important VA isoflurane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Eckenhoff et al., 2010</xref>). This biochemical adduct, azi-isoflurane, features a diazirine moiety capable of generating a highly reactive and chemically non-selective carbene adduct when irradiated with UV light. Azi-isoflurane has been shown to retain the anesthetic effects of isoflurane in animals, and we first sought to ensure that the chemical modifications present in the azi-isoflurane compound would not alter the effect of this drug on the TREK1 channel. Two electrode voltage clamp studies of <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic> oocytes expressing mouse TREK1 (mTREK1) showed that application of azi-isoflurane causes a dose-dependent potentiation of mTREK1, with an EC<sub>50</sub> of 735 ± 192 µM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>).

We attributed lack of coverage in these regions to the difficulty in ionizing and resolving hydrophobic transmembrane protein regions with this technique. Alternatively, binding of the hydrophobic azi-isoflurane photolabel could reduce the MS signal from bound protein peptides, causing gaps in MS coverage that correspond to regions where photolabeling has occurred. To exclude this possibility, we performed MS on non-photolabeled drTREK1 protein, finding essentially the same lack of high confidence coverage within the TM3 and TM4 region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). This suggests that the poor MS coverage of drTREK1 TM3 and TM4 is not the result of photolabeling within these regions. However, we cannot rule out the possibility that azi-isoflurane might label positions within the TM3 or TM4 domains that we are simply unable to detect with our MS approach.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Functional validation of TREK1 VA-binding sites</title><p>To determine the functional importance of the VA- binding sites identified by azi-isoflurane photolabeling, we introduced mutations into the mTREK1 gene at positions 182 and 194 and used two-electrode voltage clamp recordings to assay for changes in mTREK1 channel properties. We first substituted the endogenous mTREK1 amino acids at positions 182 and 194 with tryptophan, to mimic the size and hydrophobic nature of the azi-isoflurane photolabel. Tryptophan mutagenesis at position 194 (as well as other more conservative modifications) had no significant effect on the functional properties of the resultant mutant mTREK1 channels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). The amino acid at position 194 is poorly conserved across species, a lysine in the drTREK1 gene used for azi-isoflurane photolabeling but an aspartic acid in the mTREK1 construct used for our functional studies. To account for this difference, we introduced a D194K mutant into the mTREK1 background and found that this mutation also had no effect on mTREK1 basal current or temperature dependence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E and F</xref>). The absence of any observable functional effect of mutation at mTREK1 194, along with the inability of excess isoflurane to protect position 194 from photolabeling by azi-isoflurane, suggest that despite being modified by azi-isoflurane, this site is unlikely to be relevant to the mechanism by which isoflurane and other clinically relevant VAs modulate TREK1. This notion is supported by the location of position 194 at the far end of TM2, facing toward the bulk solution and away from the core of the TREK1 protein.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Functional assessment of mTREK1 residues identified by azi-isoflurane photolabeling.</title><p>Representative two electrode voltage clamp recordings of mTREK1 wildtype (WT) and channel mutants G182W and D194W. (<bold>A</bold>) Basal current measured 24 hr after microinjection of 2.4 ng cRNA.

Similar to our functional results in the mTREK1 background, the drTREK1 G182W mutant also exhibits diminished sensitivity to heat, VA, and BL1249 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref> panels F–H). We found no evidence of azi-isoflurane labeling at position 182 or at any neighboring residues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>), suggesting that the G182W mutation either eliminates azi-isoflurane binding or reduces the affinity of VA for this site. We did observe azi-isoflurane photolabeling at two positions far from the G182 site, one near the top of TM1 (A67) and one in the C-terminal domain (T303). These residues were not photolabeled in the VA-sensitive drTREK1 WT background and as such they are unlikely to contribute to the mechanism by which VAs modulate TREK1. However, enhanced accessibility of these residues in only the G182W background could be explained by global changes in protein tertiary structure induced by the G182W mutation, consistent with the dramatic functional effects observed in this mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>While the G182 residue is located at the cytosolic face of the TREK1 channel, activation gating in K2P channels is thought to occur via a ‘C-type’ gating mechanism involving a rearrangement of the extracellular selectivity filter region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bagriantsev et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Piechotta et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Zilberberg et al., 2001</xref>). Given that the G182 residue is located far from the selectivity filter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>), a significant allosteric effect would be required for steric crowding at G182 to exert an effect on this distant gate. To explore whether the G182W mutation modulates the TREK1 ‘C-type’ gate, we examined the stability of the selectivity filter against closure by application of extracellular acidosis. Acidification of the extracellular face of TREK1 has been shown to inhibit channel activity and to simultaneously diminish potassium selectivity, a hallmark of selectivity filter-based gating (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cohen et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Sandoz et al., 2009</xref>). While the mTREK1 WT and mTREK1 D194W mutants were both strongly inhibited by application of extracellular acidosis, the mTREK1 G182W channel was resistant to closure by acid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref>, IpH<sub>5.5</sub>/pH<sub>9.0 </sub>0.15 ± 0.05 for mTREK1 WT, 0.17 ± 0.1 for mTREK1 D194W, 0.51 ± 0.08 for mTREK1 G182W), although the IC<sub>50</sub> of the effect was similar for all three channels tested (pH 7.88 ± 0.07 for mTREK1 WT, 7.63 ± 0.08 for mTREK1 D194W, and 7.59 ± 0.07 for mTREK1 G182W).

In TREK1 + isoflurane MD simulation trajectory 1, the isoflurane ligand directly interrupts the pi-stacking interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B and F</xref>), while in trajectory two it is the ligand induced reorientation of the F214 rotamer that is responsible for disrupting the pi-stacking interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G</xref>). Even after the isoflurane molecule escapes from its binding site during trajectory 1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>), the F185/F214 interaction remained disrupted due to the isoflurane induced reorientation of the F185 sidechain.</p><p>While additional sampling time might have allowed the F185/F214 interaction to eventually re-establish, the structural model that serves as the starting point for our simulations is in the mTREK1 ‘TM4-up’ state and the F185/F214 interaction is predicted to favor the ‘TM4-down’ conformation of mTREK1. In the neighboring unliganded subunit of mTREK1, we found no evidence of F185/F214 pi-stacking, lending support to the idea that pi-stacking between these two residues is generally disfavored in the ‘TM4-up’ state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1C</xref>). The observed difference in the behaviors of the two subunits likely reflects subtle differences in initial conditions derived from differences in crystal packing in the regions surrounding the TM2/TM3 loops of the two subunits. Given the relatively short simulation timescales sampled in our study, we treated each subunit independently and did not expect to observe significant allosteric effects across the two subunits.</p><p>Based on our MD findings, we hypothesize that a combination of VA-induced local structural perturbations, disruption of the F185/F214 pi-stacking interaction, and direct steric effects upon TM4 movement all combine to alter the dynamics of the TM4 movements known to influence K2P gating. While our MD simulations did not directly reveal major conformational rearrangements of TM4, the observed isoflurane occupancy at numerous positions known to govern the energetics of TM4 translocation from the ‘down’ to ‘up’ position suggest a mechanism by which VA binding ultimately alters K2P activity by modulating TM4 movements.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Key residues transfer VA insensitivity from TRAAK to TREK1</title><p>Although both TREK and TASK channels are potentiated by VA agents, the TRAAK K2P channel is anesthetic insensitive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Patel et al., 1999</xref>). TRAAK is 44% identical and 69% homologous to TREK1, and the two channels share many functional properties, including modulation by heat, mechanical stretch, pH, and arachidonic acid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Maingret et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kang et al., 2005</xref>). The relative selectivity of VA agents for TREK1 over TRAAK despite the many similarities between these two channels allowed us to utilize the TRAAK channel as a negative control to further characterize the K2P VA-binding site.</p><p>VA insensitivity of TRAAK could arise from one of two possibilities; failure of VAs to bind to TRAAK or inability of bound VA to modulate TRAAK activity. To distinguish between these possibilities and ascertain whether VAs bind to the TRAAK channel, we recombinantly expressed, purified, and reconstituted human TRAAK (hTRAAK) into liposomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>) and performed azi-isoflurane photolabeling studies identical to those used for drTREK1 channels. The G182 residue identified by azi-isoflurane photolabeling of drTREK1 is conserved in the hTRAAK sequence, but we found no evidence of azi-isoflurane photolabeling at this glycine or at any other position in the hTRAAK channel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>). MS of hTRAAK protein after photolabeling showed a relatively lower total coverage of the hTRAAK sequence compared to our results for drTREK1 (84% for hTRAAK versus 91% for drTREK1), but all hTRAAK residues homologous to the drTREK1 azi-isoflurane binding region identified by MD simulations were positively identified, precluding the possibility that azi-isoflurane binds within this region of hTRAAK. Our results suggest that the inability of VA agents to activate TRAAK channels is due to either an absence of binding or a significantly reduced affinity of anesthetic for this VA binding region.</p><p>We next explored the sequence similarity between mTREK1 and mTRAAK at the residues that showed the highest isoflurane occupancy during MD simulations. Amongst the identified amino acids, we found four residues that differ significantly between the mTREK1 and mTRAAK sequences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A–B</xref>) and created a series of mutant mTREK1 channels that contain one or two of the corresponding mTRAAK residues at these positions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C–E</xref>). When examined by TEVC, the ‘TRAAK-like’ mutant mTREK1 channels all exhibit diminished responsiveness to the potentiating effect of isoflurane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>), supporting a role for these residues in either forming the VA binding domain or transducing the effects of binding to channel opening. While the extent of the effect of these mutants was less dramatic than the near complete absence of isoflurane responsiveness in the G182W mutant, the effect of combining two TRAAK-like mutations was additive, as shown for the double mutant mTREK1 F185L G186R (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Mutations in the isoflurane-binding site alter anesthetic sensitivity without perturbing global channel function.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Representative MD) snapshot showing the isoflurane-binding site, including residues predicted to have &gt;20% occupancy by isoflurane shown in sphere representation and isoflurane shown in stick representation (lime).

The fact that the ‘TRAAK-like’ mutants selectively alter VA activation without significantly perturbing gating by heat argues for their specificity to the mechanism of action of VAs. Activation of TREK1 by heat is known to be critically related to the phosphorylation state of serine 333 in the intracellular C-terminal domain of TREK1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Maingret et al., 2000</xref>) and the persistence of mTREK1 heat activation in these ‘TRAAK-like’ mutants suggests that these mutations do not eliminate VA modulation by simply causing a global activation of the mTREK1 ‘C-type’ gate (as was the case for the G182W mutant). Rather, the ‘TRAAK-like’ mutations appear to reduce VA sensitivity by acting specifically at the VA site of action, consistent with predictions made by our MD simulation data and mTREK1 vs mTRAAK sequence homology.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Effort to determine regions within the K2P channel structure susceptible to small-molecule modulators has become a topic of significant recent interest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dong et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lolicato et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Pope et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Rinné et al., 2019</xref>), motivated by the lack of specific and high-affinity pharmacology targeting K2P channels. Here, we focus on K2P modulation by VAs, drugs heavily utilized in common clinical practice. We identify an interface formed by the TM2, TM3, and TM4 helices of TREK1 as the binding site for the VA isoflurane and identify site-specific interactions between TREK1 and isoflurane that define this binding region. The identified VA modulatory site features TREK1 residues previously identified to play key roles in K2P modulation by mechanical stretch, heat, and the pharmacological activator BL1249, suggesting a common mechanistic pathway shared by VA and other K2P gating cues.</p><p>Prior to our study, the strongest evidence for a VA-binding site in K2P channels was found in the TASK subfamily, where a single point mutation in the <italic>lymneal</italic> TASK TM3 residue M159 (homologous to TREK1 position T211) caused loss of steroselective discrimination between R and S optical isomers of isoflurane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Andres-Enguix et al., 2007</xref>). TREK1 T211 lies within a span of the TM3 helix we were unable to resolve with MS but through MD simulation we identified T211 as a determinant of TREK1 VA binding (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). Two additional residues identified by MD simulation, TREK1 F185 and M291, also align to positions implicated in TASK VA sensitivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Andres-Enguix et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Conway and Cotten, 2012</xref>). All three residues (F185, T211, M291) differ significantly in the TRAAK protein sequence and ‘TRAAK-like’ mutations at these positions decreased TREK1 VA sensitivity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). The overlapping molecular determinants of TREK1 and TASK1 VA sensitivity (and of TRAAK VA insensitivity) suggest a shared VA-binding site across the K2P family. While the gating mechanisms of TASK channels have not been as extensively studied as those of the mechanosensitive K2Ps, recent work exploring the inhibitory effect of the local anesthetic agent bupivacaine on TASK1 channels demonstrates that bupivacaine binding constrains TM4 helix movement and ultimately alters selectivity filter behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Rinné et al., 2019</xref>). The bupivacaine site of action in TASK channels differs from the VA modulatory site identified in our study, but the effect of drug binding on TM4 conformation may be a shared feature in K2P gating utilized by both local and general anesthetics.</p><p>Our data suggest that VAs modulate K2P channel activity by influencing the position of the TM4 helix. The proximity of the azi-isoflurane labeled TREK1 G182 residue to the TM4 helix initially suggested such a mechanism and the potentiating effect of increased G182 side chain size supported this hypothesis. MD simulation studies identified direct contacts between isoflurane and the TM4 helix. However, the MD simulation data do not show major TM4 conformational rearrangements in the presence of isoflurane and thus whether VAs induced TM4 movements. Similarly, we have no evidence of whether the VA-bound TREK1 channel more closely resembles the ‘TM4 up’ or ‘TM4 down’ states defined by crystallography (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dong et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brohawn et al., 2014a</xref>). As there is evidence to suggest that both the ‘TM4 up’ and ‘TM4 down’ conformations can promote active K2P channel states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">McClenaghan et al., 2016</xref>), each of the two conformations could be consistent with a VA-activated channel. However, both the direct steric constraints imposed by the presence of VA near TM4 and the disruption of the ‘TM4 down’ state stabilizing F185/F214 pi-stacking interaction would be predicted to favor a ‘TM4 up’ conformation. The starting point for our MD simulations is a crystallographically determined structural model of TREK1 already in the ‘TM4 up’ state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lolicato et al., 2017</xref>) and may explain the lack of any additional TM4 rearrangement in the presence of isoflurane. Further MD simulation utilizing a homology model of TREK1 based on K2P structures determined in the ‘TM4 down’ state might more definitively answer this question. However, it is also possible that VA binding induces a conformation distinct from either of these two structurally defined states. The molecular mechanisms governing the connectivity between TM4 conformation and the flux gating behavior of the selectivity filter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Schewe et al., 2016</xref>) remains poorly defined and is an area of significant ongoing interest.</p><p>Having identified a VA modulatory site that appears to be shared across the TREK and TASK K2P subfamilies, we are cognizant of some of the inconsistent VA responses observed across these K2P subfamilies. For instance, while the obsolete VAs chloroform and diethyl-ether activate TREK1 and TASK3, they paradoxically inhibit the TASK1 channel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Patel et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Andres-Enguix et al., 2007</xref>). Nitrous oxide and xenon have been reported to activate TREK1 but have no effect on TASK channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gruss et al., 2004</xref>), and TRAAK channels are unresponsive to VAs despite their close similarity to other mechanosensitive and VA-sensitive K2Ps. Meanwhile, little is known about the gating of THIK channels but they are inhibited by the VAs halothane and isoflurane, an effect that appears to play an important role in the clinically relevant central respiratory depressant effect of VA administration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Rajan et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lazarenko et al., 2010</xref>). How can we explain the paradoxical effects of VA agents at structurally similar targets? One explanation would be that the VA-binding site identified in our study represents only one of a subset of VA modulatory domains in the K2P family. Within the anesthetic mechanisms literature there are numerous examples of VA-responsive ion channels that feature multiple low-affinity anesthetic modulatory sites acting in a combinatorial fashion to produce a given output (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Fourati et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Heusser et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Woll et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hemmings et al., 2019</xref>). However, the location of the identified K2P VA-binding site at a position central to TM4 gating offers an alternative explanation. We understand relatively little about the mechanism by which TM4 movements govern K2P channel activity and it is possible that VA binding to this single site may produce opposing effects in the context of subtle differences in the connectivity between TM4 movements and the channel gate. Recent studies utilizing the state-dependent binding of the mechanosensitive K2P inhibitor fluoxetine demonstrate that the resting and activated conformation of the TM4 helix in TREK1 versus TRAAK channels are inverted, underscoring this point (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Soussia et al., 2018</xref>) and perhaps contributing to the absence of VA binding and responsiveness in TRAAK channels.</p><p>The TREK1 channel is strongly modulated by its surrounding membrane environment, with lipid headgroup as well as acyl-chain length and saturation playing roles in shaping K2P functional behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chemin et al., 2005a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chemin et al., 2005b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cabanos et al., 2017</xref>). In prokaryotic ligand gated ion channels, binding sites for anesthetics and lipids have been found to overlap (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Nury et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Prevost et al., 2012</xref>), raising the question of whether the VA-binding site identified in our study could also be a site responsible for lipid modulation of TREK1. While numerous structural studies of K2P channels have identified bound lipids, none of these lipid-binding sites overlap with the VA-binding site identified in our study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brohawn et al., 2014a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dong et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lolicato et al., 2017</xref>). Despite this absence of structural evidence, an MD simulation study of TREK2 has shown that a lipid can bind to a site akin to our TREK1 VA-binding site and that this bound lipid restricts the movement of TM4 in response to a simulated membrane stretch (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aryal et al., 2017</xref>). While we suspect that multiple sites on the TREK1 channel may ultimately play important roles in the modulatory effects of lipids, numerous residues within the VA-binding site are likely to be determinants of both lipid and VA modulation of K2P channel gating. The interplay between the mechanisms by which VAs and lipids modulate the TREK1 channel is an area of ongoing interest for future study.</p><p>While our results support the presence of a defined modulatory site within the TREK1 channel structure, these findings do not preclude a contribution from indirect effects of VAs on membrane lipid composition, as has been recently proposed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Pavel et al., 2020</xref>). Such a mechanism is in fact a particularly appealing explanation for the effects of the structurally simple and TREK1-specific VA agents chloroform, nitrous oxide, and xenon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gruss et al., 2004</xref>). In this context, the location of the TREK1 VA-binding site described in our study at a region key to the mechanism by which C-terminal-domain-dependent signals (including lipid modulation) are translated to TM4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Zhuo et al., 2016</xref>) and ultimately to the selectivity filter gate would allow both an indirect and direct modulatory effect on channel behavior to feed into a shared common pathway.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Purification of drTREK1 or hTRAAK</title><p>TREK1 and TRAAK proteins were expressed in <italic>Pichia pastoris</italic> using previously described pPICZ vectors bearing residues 1–300 of the human TRAAK gene (hTRAAK, K2P4.1, UniProt Q9NYG8-2) or residues 1–322 of the <italic>D. rerio</italic> TREK1 gene (drTREK1, K2P2.1, UniProt X1WC65), followed by a PreScission protease-cleavage site (LEVLFQ/GP) and C-terminal GFP and His<sub>10</sub> tags (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brohawn et al., 2014b</xref>).

Proteins were digested overnight at 37°C. To enhance sequence coverage, a second protease digestion was performed with chymotrypsin. Samples were diluted to a final volume of 200 μL with final concentrations of 100 mM NH<sub>4</sub>HCO<sub>3</sub> and approximately 0.02% ProteaseMAX Surfactant. Sequencing grade chymotrypsin (Promega) to a 1:20 protease:protein ratio (w:w) was then added and proteins were digested overnight at 37°C. Multiple extraction steps were performed to remove peptides embedded in the gel. The digest solution was removed and the remaining gel was suspended in 100 μL 30% acetylnitrile and 5% acetic acid in ddH<sub>2</sub>O (v/v%) and sonicated for 20 min. The solution was removed and the gel was then resuspended in 100 μL 70% acetylnitrile and 5% acetic acid in ddH<sub>2</sub>O (v/v%) and sonicated for 20 min. The digest and two extraction solutions were pooled and dried by speed vac before resuspension in 0.5% acetic acid (pH &lt;2). Samples were sonicated for 10 min prior to centrifugation to remove insoluble debris. Samples were desalted using C18 stage tips prepared in house. Samples were dried by speed vac and resuspended in 0.1% formic acid immediately before MS analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Mass spectrometry</title><p>Desalted peptides were analyzed employing either an Orbitrap Elite Hybrid Ion Trap-Orbitrap mass spectrometer (MS) or Q Exactive Hybrid Quadrupole-Orbitrap MS coupled to an Easy-nanoLC 1000 system. In both instances, the same liquid chromatography procedure and data-dependent acquisition mode was applied. Peptides were eluted over 100 min with linear gradients of ACN in 0.1% formic acid in water (v/v%) starting from 2% to 40% (85 min), then 40% to 85% (5 min) and finally 85% (10 min) using a flow rate of 300 mL/min. For Orbitrap Elite, in every 3 s cycle, one full MS scan was collected at a scan range of 350–1500 m/z, a resolution of 60K, and a maximum injection time of 50 ms with automatic gain (AG) control of 500,000. The MS2 scans were followed from the most intense parent ions. Ions were filtered with charge 2–5 with an isolation window of 1.5 m/z in quadruple isolation mode. Ions were fragmented using collision induced dissociation (CID) with collision energy of 35%. Iontrap detection was used with normal scan range mode and rapid iontrap scan rate. For Q Exactive, one full MS was performed with 70K resolution, maximum injection time of 100 ms and scan range of 350–1200 m/z. The MS2 scans were performed in Higher-energy Collisional Dissociation (HCD) with normalized collision energy (NCE) of 30, and isolation window of 3 m/z. The AG control was set to be 10,000 with a maximal injection time of 100 ms.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Mass spectrometry analysis</title><p>Analysis was performed as previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Eckenhoff et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Woll et al., 2018</xref>). Spectral analysis was conducted using Thermo Proteome Discoverer 2.0 (Thermo Scientific) and the Mascot Daemon search engine with a customized database containing <italic>dr</italic>TREK or <italic>h</italic>TRAAK protein sequences. All analyses included dynamic oxidation of methionine (+15.9949 <italic>m/z</italic>) as well as static alkylation of cysteine (+57.0215 <italic>m/z</italic>; iodoacetamide alkylation). Photolabeled samples were run with the additional dynamic azi-isoflurane (+195.97143 <italic>m/z</italic>) modification. A mass variation tolerance of 10 ppm and 20 ppm for MS and 0.8 and 0.02 Da for MS/MS were used for the for Orbitrap Elite and Q Exactive, respectively. Both the in-solution and in-gel sequential trypsin/chymotrypsin digests were searched without enzyme specification with a false discovery rate of 0.01. All MS experiments were conducted in triplicate and samples containing no photoaffinity ligand were processed and analyzed equivalently to those containing the photolabel, to control for false-positive detection of photoaffinity ligand modifications.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Molecular dynamics simulation</title><p>The crystallographically derived structural model of <italic>Mus musculus</italic> TREK1 (PDBID 6CQ6) was used for MD simulation. Missing nonterminal loops were predicted using MODELLER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Webb and Sali, 2017</xref>) with side-chain conformations predicted using SCRWL4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Krivov et al., 2009</xref>). Molecular mechanics parameters for isoflurane were used, as previously published (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hénin et al., 2010</xref>). In the ligand-bound simulation, one isoflurane molecule was placed manually, adjacent to G182, in the position of the best-scoring hit from molecular docking of isoflurane to TREK1 using AutoDock Vina software (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Trott and Olson, 2010</xref>). Docking parameters were: num_modes = 9, exhaustiveness = 8, energy_range = 3. The search box was 43.5 × 40.0×30.0 Å in size, centered on one of the two G182 residues. Docking scores of the nine hits requested from AutoDock Vina ranged from −5.1 to −4.6. Three of these were adjacent to G182, including the best-scoring hit.</p><p>The mTREK1 channel was embedded in a POPC (1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-<italic>sn</italic>-glycero-3-phosphocholine):cholesterol 70:30 lipid bilayer and the system was solvated with TIP3P water with 0.15 M NaCl using the CHARMM-GUI service (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Jo et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Jo et al., 2009</xref>). The CHARMM36 force field (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Klauda et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Best et al., 2012</xref>) and NAMD 2.12 simulation software (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Phillips et al., 2005</xref>) were used. Periodic boundary conditions with particle mesh Ewald summation of long-range electrostatics was used. The system was equilibrated according to the CHARMM-GUI protocol and production equilibrium MD simulation was run for 10 ns using the isothermic-isobaric ensemble with Langevin thermostat and barostat at 303.15 K. Further equilibrium MD simulations were continued from that point.</p><p>During isoflurane-bound mTREK1 WT simulation trajectory 2, a flat-well spherical restraint as used in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Salari et al., 2018</xref> was imposed to keep the isoflurane molecule within a sphere of radius 7 Å in the G182 binding pocket while minimizing the energy imparted in the system to do so. This restraint only imposed an energetic cost if the ligand migrated to the edge of the sphere, and zero cost otherwise. As this restricts only the volume the ligand can occupy, it represents purely an entropic cost which can be quantified parametrically as Δ<italic>G</italic><sub>restraint</sub> = -<italic>RT</italic> ln <italic>V</italic>*/<italic>V</italic> where <italic>V</italic>* is the volume occupied by the sphere, <italic>V</italic> is the volume occupied by one ligand molecule at 1 M concentration, <italic>R</italic> the gas constant and <italic>T</italic> the temperature. For the 7 Å radius spherical flat-well restraint, Δ<italic>G</italic><sub>restraint</sub> = 0.09 kcal/mol.</p><p>For root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) calculations to assess binding site changes induced by isoflurane, both of the isoflurane-bound mTREK1 WT simulation trajectories were analyzed using the last frame of the WT-free simulation as reference. To remove global rotation and translation, simulation trajectories were aligned at selectivity filter residues I143, F145, and N147.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Two electrode voltage clamp electrophysiology</title><p>For electrophysiological studies, <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic> oocytes were microinjected with capped RNA translated from full length mouse or zebrafish TREK1 (K2P2.1, UniProt P97438-2) or mouse TRAAK (K2P4.1, UniProt O88454) genes. TREK1 mutations were introduced using a Phusion site-directed mutagenesis kit (ThermoFisher), with the mTREK1 C93S C159S C219S C365S C399S mutant channel referred to as mTREK1 cys- for brevity. cRNA from WT or mutant K2P genes was synthesized using an mMessage mMachine Kit (T7 promoter, Ambion, Life Technologies) and purified using an RNeasy RNA cleanup kit (Qiagen). Defolliculated stage V–VI <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic> oocytes were purchased commercially from Xenoocyte (Dexter, MI) and were stored in antibiotic supplemented ND96 (96 mM NaCl, 2 mM KCl, 1.8 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 2 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 100 units mL<sup>–1</sup> penicillin, 100 μg mL<sup>–1</sup> streptomycin) until use. Oocytes were microinjected with 2.5 ng cRNA (unless otherwise noted) and two-electrode voltage clamp (TEVC) recordings were performed 24–48 hr after microinjection. All TEVC data in the manuscript represents recordings from oocytes isolated from at least two independent ovaries, n &gt; 3 oocytes per group.</p><p>For recordings, oocytes were impaled with borosilicate recording microelectrodes (0.3–2.0 MΩ resistance) backfilled with 3 M KCl. Oocytes were perfused with ND96 solution (96 mM NaCl, 2 mM KCl, 1.8 mM CaCl2, and 2.0 mM MgCl2, 5 mM HEPES [pH 7.4]) at a rate of 2.5 mL/min. Currents were evoked from a −90 mV holding potential by a 2000 ms ramp from −150 mV to +50 mV. Data were acquired using an OC-725C oocyte clamp amplifier (Warner Instruments) controlled by pClamp software (Molecular Devices), and digitized at 2 kHz using a Digidata 1332A digitizer (MDS Analytical Technologies).</p><p>For temperature experiments, recording solutions were heated by an SC-20 in-line heater/cooler combined with an LCS-1 liquid cooling system operated by the CL-100 bipolar temperature controller (Warner Instruments). Temperature was monitored using a CL-100-controlled thermistor placed in the bath solution immediately downstream of the oocyte. The perfusate was warmed from 15°C to 35°C in 5°C increments, with recordings performed once temperature readings stabilized at the desired values. For external pH experiments (pH<sub>o</sub>), each oocyte was initially perfused with ND96 solution at pH 7.4, switched to ND96 at pH 9.0 and then subsequently assayed at the experimental pH, with recordings performed 15 s after each new solution was applied. This allowed for all pH<sub>o</sub>-dependent changes to be normalized against the current density at pH 9.0. The buffer present in ND96 solutions was altered as appropriate, with one of the following: 10 mM TRIS (pH 9.0–8.1), 5 mM HEPES (pH 8.1–6.5), or 5 mM MES (pH 6.5–5.9). Aggregate pH<sub>o</sub> data were fitted with a modified Hill equation: I = I<sub>min</sub> + (I<sub>max</sub> - I<sub>min</sub>)/(1 + 10^((pH<sub>o</sub>IC<sub>50</sub>/pH<sub>o</sub>) ∗ H)), where I<sub>max</sub> and I<sub>min</sub> are maximal and minimal current values, respectively, pH<sub>o</sub>IC50 is a half-maximal effective pH<sub>o</sub> value, and H is the Hill coefficient.</p><p>For VA experiments, isoflurane saturated ND96 was prepared by adding commercially available isoflurane (Baxter Healthcare Corporation) to a 100 mL volume of ND96 until phase separation was clearly observable. This mixture was stirred vigorously overnight in a closed glass bottle prior to use. The established maximal solubility of isoflurane in salt solution at room temperature is 15 mM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Scheller et al., 1997</xref>) and working isoflurane concentrations used for electrophysiological experiments were prepared by dilutions of the 15 mM saturated stock solution. Azi-isoflurane was diluted into DMSO prior to use and the concentration of this stock solution was determined using the optical extinction coefficient of 126 M<sup>−1</sup> cm<sup>−1</sup> at 300 nm Abs. Anesthetic solutions were stored in closed perfusion bags and were perfused onto oocytes through Teflon perfusion tubing, to prevent loss of isoflurane to the environment or electrophysiology rig.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This work was supported by research grants from the Foundation for Anesthesia Education and Research (FAER) and the NIH National Institute for General Medical Sciences (NIGMS K08 GM132781 and P01 GM055876).

modulators of the resting membrane potential of most cells. These manuscript by Wague et al. presents exciting data that solidly identifies a binding region for volatile anesthetics (VAs) that regulates the function if TREK1 channels. The data paper is supported by various lines of evidence that convincingly present a case for direct gating effects of the volatile anesthetic isoflurane. This is an important finding given that the general mode of action of VAs is still not completely understood. The evidence presented here should help further the case for the existence of direct molecular targets of VAs that modulate cellular excitability and further our knowledge both at the basic and clinical levels.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Mechanistic insights into volatile anesthetic modulation of K2P channels&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, including Leon D Islas as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Richard Aldrich as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Rebecca Howard (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>We would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). Specifically, when editors judge that a submitted work as a whole belongs in <italic>eLife</italic> but that some conclusions require a modest amount of additional new data, as they do with your paper, we are asking that the manuscript be revised to either limit claims to those supported by data in hand, or to explicitly state that the relevant conclusions require additional supporting data.</p><p>Our expectation is that the authors will eventually carry out the additional experiments and report on how they affect the relevant conclusions either in a preprint on bioRxiv or medRxiv, or if appropriate, as a Research Advance in <italic>eLife</italic>, either of which would be linked to the original paper.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This manuscript by Wague et al. presents solid evidence of binding and modulation of TREK1 channels by the volatile anesthetic isoflurane. TREK1 is a member of a family of two-pore potassium channels associated with the resting leak current in most cells, therefore supporting an essential physiological function.</p><p>The authors have used photo-affinity labeling of a photo-activated derivative of isoflurane coupled with mass spectroscopy to identify a residue involved in isoflurane binding. Further molecular dynamics and electrophysiology experiments support the finding of a binding pocket in the M2 transmembrane helix and identification of several other residues involved in forming this pocket. The experiments and simulations are supportive of the conclusions reached and the paper is well written. Characterization of a binding site for a volatile anesthetic in leak channels is an important finding that further solidifies the view that volatile anesthetics exert their anesthetic effects by acting of specific ion channels at dedicated binding sites and also helps clarify our understanding of the several anesthetic effects observed in patients and at the cell physiological level.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Please clarify how the important initial pose for isoflurane was chosen. The Results seem to cite AutoDock Vina, but the Materials and methods indicate the molecule was merely &quot;placed manually, adjacent to G182&quot;. Moreover, the Results seem to use docking to substantiate relevance of the G182 site; this claim would benefit from a clear description of the docking approach/parameters, and of other hits and scores obtained.</p><p>2) The main limitation of the isoflurane simulations, on which much of the dynamic mechanism relies, is that they represent a single trajectory (albeit of reasonable length) for a single isoflurane molecule (subsection “MD simulation identifies residues important for VA modulation to TREK1 channels”). At least one replicate simulation would be preferable; particularly given isoflurane seems relatively unstable in its docked pose. Why did the authors choose not to dock both subunits?</p><p>Similarly, please clarify if the unbound subunit retains its initial configuration (e.g. with regards to π-stacking) in the presence of isoflurane in the neighboring subunit?</p><p>3) It is stated that G182W, but none of the &quot;TRAAK-like&quot; mutants, &quot;exhibited diminished responsiveness to…heat&quot; (Figure 6D). To support this comparison, please include statistics indicating a shift in heat sensitivity for G182W but not for other mutants.</p><p>4) Given suggestions elsewhere of indirect, lipid-mediated as well as direct mechanisms of anesthetic modulation in these channels, please comment on whether the proposed isoflurane binding site might also be occupied by lipids, in the presence or absence of Vas.</p><p>5) Photo labeling and functional studies are carried out in two different orthologues of TREK1. Given that it seems like both are modulated by isoflurane and perhaps equally amenable to the same experimental procedures, please explain this choice.</p><p>6) In Figure 1, the potassium current amplitudes at two different concentrations of isoflurane and azi- isoflurane are compared and the authors reached the conclusion that &quot;We found no statistically significant difference between the effect of 2 mM isoflurane or 3 mM azi-isoflurane…&quot;. Comparing current size obtained with different concentrations of different compounds is not really significant. What needs to be compared is the complete dose-response relationship of isoflurane and azi- isoflurane. The authors must have these experiments already, as they show the dose-response curve of azi- isoflurane.</p><p>7) Since different orthologues of TREK1 are used throughout the manuscript, it would improve the clarity to add the prefix corresponding to the organism in each instance, e.g. dTREK1 for Danio, etc. This is done in some cases in some figures but it should be maintained thorough the manuscript.</p><p>8) The data in Figure 3D should not be presented as current magnitude at 0 mV but rather, please use current density, since absolute current size is determined by expression levels as a result of different mutants being trafficked to the membrane differently or changes in open probability and single channel conductance possibly induced by the mutants. At least a control experiment for expression level of the mutants illustrated should be carried out and presented. For example, the current present at 0 mV can be compared to the current activated by a full activator of the channel.</p><p>Revisions expected in follow-up work:</p><p>Some functional studies in Danio TREK1 should be carried out and shown or cited if available, to demonstrate that at least the same effect of isoflurane and selected mutations (i.e. G182W) is present in this species TREK1 channel. See point 5.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.59839.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Please clarify how the important initial pose for isoflurane was chosen.

A thorough description of the AutoDock Vina approach has now been added to the revised manuscript (subsection “MD simulation identifies residues important for VA modulation to TREK1 channels”).

Given the low experimentally-determined affinity of isoflurane for TREK1, we found it unlikely that the initial pose within the experimentally identified site would strongly influence the ensemble of ligand configurations derived from MD simulation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The main limitation of the isoflurane simulations, on which much of the dynamic mechanism relies, is that they represent a single trajectory (albeit of reasonable length) for a single isoflurane molecule (subsection “MD simulation identifies residues important for VA modulation to TREK1 channels”).

To ensure that the isoflurane molecule would not escape from the low affinity TREK1 binding site during this additional trajectory, we introduced a boundary restraint to the ligand. We have included a plot showing the distance of the center-of-geometry of the isoflurane molecule from the center of the restraint sphere (included in new Figure 6—figure supplement 1A), demonstrating that the ligand rarely approached the edge of the restraint during the simulation. A description of this additional restraint is provided in the Materials and methods section of the revised manuscript.</p><p>A comparison of residues that exhibit &gt;20% isoflurane occupancy during either the initial MD trajectory or the new 1 μs trajectory is shown in revised Table 1. In general, there is very good concordance between the two simulations and we found no significant differences in the C-α RMSD plots between the two trajectories (shown in Figure 6—figure supplement 1B). In the revised manuscript, we have added an analysis of side chain RMSD, showing significant reorientations of the F185 (trajectory 1) or F214 (trajectory 2) rotameric orientation induced by the presence of the isoflurane ligand. New plots of all-atom RMSD as well as rotamer dihedral angle and pi-stacking frequency for the F185 and F214 residues have all been added to an additional figure in the revised manuscript (new Figure 6).</p><p>Given the simulation timescales we were evaluating, we did not expect to observe significant allosteric effects of ligand binding on the neighboring subunit and as such focused our efforts on isoflurane binding to a single subunit, chosen arbitrarily. While we have tried to infer effects of ligand binding on TREK1 channel gating by contextualizing our results within the larger K2P literature, the scope of our simulations are not geared to directly address this question.</p><p>In the neighboring subunit, there was virtually no pi-stacking between F185 and F214, in both wild-type free TREK1 simulations and wild-type isoflurane-bound TREK1 simulations. We note that the F185/F214 pi-stacking interaction is predicted to be disfavored in the TREK1 TM4 up conformation present in the only available TREK1 crystal structure. Differences in crystal packing in the regions surrounding the TM2/TM3 loop of the two subunits likely accounts for subtle differences in initial conditions that influence the propensity of these two residues to interact. In the revised manuscript, we note this absence of F185/F214 pi-stacking in the neighboring subunit in the context of a discussion of the failure for the F185/F214 pi-stacking interaction to reform after isoflurane escapes the binding pocket during isoflurane bound TREK1 simulation trajectory 1. We thank the reviewers to directing our attention to this question, one we had not previously explored.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) It is stated that G182W, but none of the &quot;TRAAK-like&quot; mutants, &quot;exhibited diminished responsiveness to…heat&quot; (Figure 6D). To support this comparison, please include statistics indicating a shift in heat sensitivity for G182W but not for other mutants.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for pointing out this omission. We have now included Q10 measurements (30°C/20°C) for the &quot;TRAAK-like&quot; mutants as Figure 7E, demonstrating a statistically significant difference in Q10 for TREK1 G182W compared to TREK1 WT and the “TRAAK-like” mutants.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Given suggestions elsewhere of indirect, lipid-mediated as well as direct mechanisms of anesthetic modulation in these channels, please comment on whether the proposed isoflurane binding site might also be occupied by lipids, in the presence or absence of Vas.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this suggestion. We have now expanded the pertinent section near the end of the Discussion to include this question.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Photo labeling and functional studies are carried out in two different orthologues of TREK1. Given that it seems like both are modulated by isoflurane and perhaps equally amenable to the same experimental procedures, please explain this choice.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewers that performing all of the experiments on a single TREK1 orthologue would have been an ideal experimental approach. While it is clear in retrospect that this would have been possible, at the time it was not clear that the mouse TREK1 construct was amenable to biochemical purification. The decision to use two different orthologues of TREK1 in this study was made entirely for practical considerations, given our knowledge at the outset of the project</p><p>The zebrafish TREK1 orthologue utilized for photolabeling studies was chosen for its biochemical tractability. The protocol for expression and purification of the drTREK1 orthologue was published by the MacKinnon laboratory and they graciously shared this construct with us. This drTREK1 protein has previously been characterized (Brohawn PNAS 2014) and shown to be functionally active and modulated by biologically important cues including mechanical stretch and the polyunsaturated fatty acid arachidonic acid.</p><p>After we initiated our photolabeling studies, the structure of the mouse TREK1 protein was published by the Minor lab (Lolicato et al., 2017). To date, this is the only published TREK1 structure and as such the mouse TREK1 structural model (PDBID 6cq6) was used as the basis for our molecular dynamics simulations. Functional studies were then performed in the mouse TREK1 background.</p><p>In the revised manuscript, we discuss this issue early in the Results section and we have added functional characterization of the drTREK1 orthologue expressed in <italic>X. laevis</italic> oocytes, shown in new Figure 3—figure supplement 1. Similar to the mouse TREK1 orthologue, drTREK1 is modulated by azi-isoflurane, temperature, and BL1249. The drTREK1 G182W mutation blunts responsiveness to all of these modulatory cues.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) In Figure 1, the potassium current amplitudes at two different concentrations of isoflurane and azi- isoflurane are compared and the authors reached the conclusion that &quot;We found no statistically significant difference between the effect of 2 mM isoflurane or 3 mM azi-isoflurane…&quot;. Comparing current size obtained with different concentrations of different compounds is not really significant. What needs to be compared is the complete dose-response relationship of isoflurane and azi- isoflurane. The authors must have these experiments already, as they show the dose-response curve of azi- isoflurane.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now amended the manuscript to clarify that in Figure 1, we are comparing the effects of saturating doses of the two drugs. The dose response curve for azi-isoflurane is shown in Figure 1 and we now explicitly cite Patel et al., 1999 as the source for dose response measurement of isoflurane activation of TREK1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) Since different orthologues of TREK1 are used throughout the manuscript, it would improve the clarity to add the prefix corresponding to the organism in each instance, e.g. dTREK1 for Danio, etc. This is done in some cases in some figures but it should be maintained throughout the manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>drTREK1 or mTREK1 prefixes have now been added throughout the manuscript, as appropriate.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) The data in Figure 3D should not be presented as current magnitude at 0 mV but rather, please use current density, since absolute current size is determined by expression levels as a result of different mutants being trafficked to the membrane differently or changes in open probability and single channel conductance possibly induced by the mutants. At least a control experiment for expression level of the mutants illustrated should be carried out and presented. For example, the current present at 0 mV can be compared to the current activated by a full activator of the channel.</p></disp-quote><p>We certainly agree that in the ensemble whole cell measurements performed in our study, it is difficult to differentiate between a mutation that alters channel expression level or membrane trafficking from one that alters more fundamental channel properties.</p><p>In our initial manuscript, panel 3D was a statistical summary of the results in panel 3A. We injected fixed concentrations of cRNA (as stated in the figure legend) and screened for mutations that alter the measured current density. For the G182W mutant, we found a large increase in outwardly rectifying current density compared to TREK1 WT channels. In order to perform a statistical analysis from recordings of many oocytes, we compared the current recorded at a 0mV holding potential as an arbitrary point far from the reversal potential. This convention has been used frequently by others who study K2P channels, hopefully making it simpler for colleagues to compare their results to our findings.</p><p>For the remainder of the experiments in Figure 3, we titrated the amount of G182 cRNA injected into the oocytes to obtain currents with magnitudes similar to TREK1 WT. If the functional consequence of the G182 mutations were solely a result of changes in trafficking or expression, titrating the injected cRNA should account for this and produce recordings indistinguishable from TREK1 WT. On the contrary, we found that the TREK1 G182W mutant showed a near complete loss of positive and negative modulation by heat and a loss of potentiation by the VA isoflurane. In line with the suggestion made by the reviewers, we took these results as a sign that G182W alters intrinsic properties of the TREK1 channel.</p><p>In the revised manuscript, we now also include the additional finding that TREK1 G182W is insensitive to saturating doses of BL1249, a potent TREK1 channel activator (Figure 3D and I). We believe the sum of our findings in Figure 3 are most easily explained by an increased open probability in the G182W mutant. We recognize that without single channel recordings we are unable to comment on the effect of the G182W mutant on TREK1 single channel conductance, though there is no evidence in the literature for modulation of TREK1 activity by changes in single channel conductance and as such this seems a less plausible explanation for our observed findings.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Revisions expected in follow-up work:</p><p>Some functional studies in Danio TREK1 should be carried out and shown or cited if available, to demonstrate that at least the same effect of isoflurane and selected mutations (i.e. G182W) is present in this species TREK1 channel. See point 5.</p></disp-quote><p>Please see above, addressed in point 5. This new data is present in Figure 3—figure supplement 1.</p></body></sub-article></article>
