elongation in the promoter-proximal region is an important and ubiquitous control point for gene expression in metazoans. We report that transcription of the adenovirus 5 E4 region is regulated during the release of paused Pol2 into productive elongation by recruitment of the super-elongation complex, dependent on promoter H3K18/27 acetylation by CBP/p300. We also establish that this is a general transcriptional regulatory mechanism that applies to ~7% of expressed protein-coding genes in primary human airway epithelial cells. We observed that a homeostatic mechanism maintains promoter, but not enhancer, H3K18/27ac in response to extensive inhibition of CBP/p300 acetyl transferase activity by the highly specific small molecule inhibitor A-485. Further, our results suggest a function for BRD4 association at enhancers in regulating paused Pol2 release at nearby promoters. Taken together, our results uncover the processes regulating transcriptional elongation by promoter region histone H3 acetylation and homeostatic maintenance of promoter, but not enhancer, H3K18/27ac in response to inhibition of CBP/p300 acetyl transferase activity.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>adenovirus</kwd><kwd>chromatin</kwd><kwd>transcription</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Professor June Lascelle Fund</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Berk</surname><given-names>Arnold J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>CBP/p300 acetylation of histone H3 at promoters and enhancers stimulates transcriptional elongation through recruitment of the super-elongation complex and BRD4.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>In addition to RNA polymerase II (Pol2) pre-initiation complex (PIC) assembly and initiation, the transition from promoter-proximal paused Pol2 to productively elongating Pol2 is an essential step in gene transcription and an important process in the overall multicomponent orchestration of gene expression in metazoans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Core et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Seila et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Core and Adelman, 2019</xref>). After the recruitment of Pol2 to a promoter by its general transcription factors and assembly of a PIC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Nogales et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Sainsbury et al., 2015</xref>), transcription initiation occurs concurrently with TFIIH phosphorylation of Ser5 of the Pol2 heptapeptide repeat C-terminal domain (CTD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cramer, 2019</xref>). In metazoan cells, Pol2 then transcribes approximately 30–60 bases downstream of the transcription start site (TSS) and then pauses because it is bound by negative elongation factor (NELF) and DRB-sensitivity-inducing factor (DSIF, Spt4 and Spt5 in <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jonkers and Lis, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adelman and Lis, 2012</xref>). Association of elongation factor P-TEFb, including its enzymatic subunits CDK9-cyclin T, results in phosphorylation of NELF, DSIF, and Ser2 of the Pol2 CTD, whereupon NELF dissociates and Pol2 is released and proceeds to productive elongation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cramer, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jonkers and Lis, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adelman and Lis, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Vos et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Histone acetylation is well known to contribute to a permissive chromatin state for Pol2 PIC assembly at active promoters, and there is recently published work concerning its function in facilitating transcriptional elongation as well. For example, the chromatin reader protein BRD4 is thought to recruit P-TEFb (CDK9-cyclin T) to promoters and serves as a Pol2 elongation factor dependent on its interactions with acetylated histone lysines through its bromodomains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kanno et al., 2014</xref>). In addition, H3 acetylation mediated by the <italic>Drosophila</italic> CBP ortholog stimulates productive elongation past the +1 nucleosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Boija et al., 2017</xref>). Recruitment of the yeast histone chaperone FACT by acetylated H3 has also been shown to stimulate elongation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Pathak et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>The super-elongation complex (SEC) is a multi-subunit complex comprising P-TEFb (CDK9-cyclin T) along with AF4/FMR2 proteins AFF1/4, ELL family members ELL1/2/3, ELL-associated factors EAF1/2, and one or the other highly homologous proteins AF9 or ENL containing YEATS acetyl-lysine-binding domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Luo et al., 2012</xref>). There are various forms of the SEC, including SEC-like complexes that contain different combinations of elongation factors suggesting diversity in their regulatory mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Luo et al., 2012</xref>). The central serine/threonine-kinase P-TEFb (CDK9-cyclin T), an AFF scaffold protein, and ENL or AF9 are consistent components of SEC complexes. ENL and AF9 have been functionally linked to SEC recruitment to acetylated chromatin via their YEATS domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Li et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gates et al., 2017</xref>). The SEC then stimulates transcription elongation through phosphorylation by CDK9 of NELF, DSIF, and Ser2 of the Pol2 CTD repeat, as well as interactions with the PAF1 complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">He et al., 2011</xref>), which blocks NELF-binding to Pol2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cramer, 2019</xref>), and DOT1L, which deposits the active chromatin modification H3K79me in the first intron (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Li et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Huff et al., 2010</xref>). Importantly, AF9 and ENL YEATS domains bind to active chromatin marks H3K9ac and H4K15ac (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gates et al., 2017</xref>), and, to a lesser extent, H3K18/27ac (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Li et al., 2014</xref>), and are essential for SEC-dependent activation of a luciferase reporter driven by the HIV-1 LTR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">He et al., 2011</xref>). Despite these conclusions, the function of histone acetylation during the transition from promoter-proximal paused to productively elongating Pol2 remains incompletely understood.</p><p>We previously reported that CBP/p300 acetylation of H3K18 and K27 in the two to three nucleosomes spanning the TSS had very different effects on distinct steps in transcription from different human adenovirus 5 (HAdV-5) early promoters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hsu et al., 2018</xref>). At the E3 promoter, loss of H3K18/27ac in the promoter region had little effect on PIC assembly, and the rate of E3 mRNA synthesis was only modestly reduced (less than twofold) compared to transcription activated by wt E1A, which induces H3K18/27ac at the early viral promoters. In contrast, PIC assembly at the E2early promoter was almost eliminated by loss of promoter H3K18/27ac, and E2 mRNA synthesis was undetectable at 12 hr post-infection (p.i.) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hsu et al., 2018</xref>). For E4, loss of promoter H3K18/27ac had little effect on PIC assembly but caused a significant (approximately tenfold) decrease in E4 transcription at 12 hr p.i. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hsu et al., 2018</xref>). This result was particularly striking as it suggested that E4 transcription is regulated by promoter H3K18/27 acetylation at a step in transcription subsequent to PIC assembly, possibly during release of promoter-proximal paused Pol2.</p><p>To investigate the function of H3K18/27ac in transcriptional elongation at E4, we mapped the association of transcriptionally active Pol2 on the Ad5 genome using Global Run-On sequencing (GRO-seq) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Core et al., 2008</xref>). We found defective paused Pol2 release at E4 in cells expressing an E1A mutant (‘E1A-DM’) with polyalanine substituted for two highly acidic regions of the E1A activation domain (AD) that each mediate an interaction with CBP/p300 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hsu et al., 2018</xref>). ChIP-seq for BRD4 and SEC components CDK9, AF9, and ENL revealed decreased SEC recruitment to E4 by E1A-DM compared to wt E1A. Using the specific small molecule inhibitor of CBP/p300 acetyl transferase activity A-485 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lasko et al., 2017</xref>), we determined that CBP/p300 histone acetyl transferase (HAT) activities are essential for maximal paused Pol2 release at the E4 promoter, but not at the E3 promoter.</p><p>We then extended our studies to the human genome, where we found that 2 hr of A-485 treatment resulted in hypoacetylation of total cell H3K18/27 to a new, extensively hypoacetylated steady state. This was associated with defective pause release at a subset of active genes (~7%) where promoter H3K18/27ac was decreased by the drug. Differences in the sensitivity of transcription from different promoters to H3K18/27ac correlated with differences in SEC component association with the genes after A-485 treatment. This was similar to what we had observed for the HAdV-5 E4 promoter during activation by the multi-site E1A mutant (DM-E1A) with mutations in the E1A-AD acidic peptides required for CBP/p300 binding to the E1A-AD. We also found that at a subset of enhancers with greatly decreased H3K18/27ac in response to A-485 treatment, H3K9ac is sufficient for BRD4 binding and stimulation of Pol2 pause release. Based on these results, we propose mechanisms of BRD4 and SEC recruitment by histone H3 acetylation during the transition from promoter-proximal paused to productively elongating Pol2 and report a homeostatic process that maintains promoter H3K18/27ac.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>CBP/p300 acetylation of promoter histone H3K18 and K27 stimulates paused Pol2 release at the HAdV-5 E4 promoter, but is not required at the E3 promoter.</p><p>Transcription from HAdV-5 early promoters is activated by the first viral proteins expressed following infection, the E1A isoforms, primarily large E1A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). While transcriptional activation from the viral early promoters is entirely dependent on the interaction of the large E1A isoform with the mediator complex, transcription of E4 is stimulated an additional tenfold through interactions between CBP/p300 and two highly acidic regions immediately flanking the E1A mediator-binding region (large E1A aa residues 133—138 and 189—200; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hsu et al., 2018</xref>). Separate Ad5 expression vectors were constructed that express the wt E1A from the wt E1A promoter/enhancer or DM-E1A with several mutations that convert these acidic peptides in wt E1A to polyAla (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1b</xref>).</p><p>To analyze the effects of promoter H3K18/27ac on Pol2 elongation through the early Ad5 genes, we applied the GRO-seq method, which reveals the position and direction of transcribing Pol2 by BrU-labeling of 3′-ends of nascent RNA transcripts in isolated nuclei (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Core et al., 2008</xref>). The nuclei were first washed with the non-ionic detergent sarkosyl to remove proteins from chromatin that block transcription elongation and prevent Pol2 initiation, so only actively transcribing RNA polymerases at the time the nuclei were isolated produce BrU-labeled RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Core et al., 2008</xref>). To avoid possible effects of cellular mutations in stable cell lines, we performed these studies in primary human bronchial-tracheal epithelial cells (HBTECs) derived from human adult lung transplant donors. These HBTECs are a cell culture model for the airway epithelial cells infected by HAdV-5 in humans.</p><p>We infected HBTECs with the wt E1A vector or the DM-E1A vector expressing mutant E1A with polyAla substitutions of the two highly acidic peptides flanking CR3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Wt E1A binds CBP/p300 through these highly acidic peptides, inducing histone H3 acetylation at K18 and K27 by the CBP/p300 acetyl transferase domain at the viral E2early, E3, and E4 promoter regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hsu et al., 2018</xref>). In cells expressing DM-E1A, which does not interact in vivo with CBP/p300 through the E1A activation domain (E1A-AD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hsu et al., 2018</xref>), there was far less H3K18/27ac at these viral early promoter regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). To express equal steady-state levels of the wt E1A and less stable DM-E1A proteins, infections were performed at a twentyfold higher multiplicity of infection for the DM-E1A vector than for the wt E1A vector (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hsu et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).

The PI equals the number of GRO-seq reads in the promoter-proximal region (TSS to +200 bp) divided by the total GRO-seq reads in the gene body (+201 to TTS). The GRO-seq reads in the promoter-proximal region reflect the amount of promoter-proximal paused Pol2 in the population of cells at the time the nuclei were isolated, while the GRO-seq reads in the gene body reflect the amount of elongating Pol2 subsequent to pause release. Therefore, an increase in PI indicates a reduced rate of promoter-proximal pause release.</p><p>After activation by DM-E1A, the PI at E4 increased 2.5-fold on average in three biological replicate GRO-seq experiments, a significant increase compared to the degree of pausing at E4 when activated by wt E1A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>). Because the vectors expressing wt E1A and DM-E1A had different size deletions in E3 due to differences in their constructions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>, bottom), the calculation of PI for E3 was based on the ~1.1 kb region of E3 common to both vectors (gray line above E3 in the Ad5 map, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>, bottom). In contrast to E4, there was no significant change in PI at E3 where promoter H3K18/27 acetylation had only a modest effect on transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hsu et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>). Similar to E3, the low level of GRO-seq counts at the E2early promoter region showed an insignificant change in PI between wt E1A and DM E1A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>), suggesting that H3K18/27ac acetylation does not affect pause release at the E2early promoter and primarily promotes Pol2 initiation. Therefore, loss of H3K18/27 promoter acetylation produced a smaller defect on promoter-proximal Pol2 pause release at the E2 and E3 promoters than at the E4 promoter.</p><sec id="s2-1"><title>Decreased Pol2 pause release in the E4 promoter-proximal region correlated with decreased association of SEC subunits CDK9, AF9, and ENL</title><p>The CDK7 subunit of TFIIH phosphorylates Ser5 of the Pol2 CTD repeat during transcription initiation, and subsequently the CDK9 subunit of P-TEFb phosphorylates Ser2 of the CTD repeat, NELF, and DSIF causing release of Pol2 arrested by NELF binding in the promoter-proximal region, and the transition to productive elongation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cramer, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jonkers and Lis, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Rahl et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Yamada et al., 2006</xref>).

At E2early, Ser5-P peaked near the TSS and decreased throughout the gene body, a distribution that is typical in yeast that also has short genes with few introns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Buratowski, 2009</xref>), as well as mouse ES cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Rahl et al., 2010</xref>) with the much longer, multi-exon, long-intron genes typical of vertebrates. We observed two Ser2-P peaks in the E2early gene body, one positioned just downstream of the TSS probably corresponding to paused Pol2 in complex with NELF, and a second peak upstream of the E2early second exon. A small Ser5-P peak was also observed at this position (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>). These Pol2 peaks just upstream of the E2 second exon may be explained by a previously reported reduction in elongation rate over some exons, proposed to influence splice site recognition and spliceosome assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Jonkers et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Martin et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Both CDK9 and NELF peaks occurred at the expected E2early, E3, and E4 pause sites ~40 bp downstream of the TSSs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>).

To determine the effects of H3K18/27ac on SEC and P-TEFb-BRD4 recruitment to early adenovirus genes, we performed ChIP-seq for CDK9, AF9, ENL, and BRD4 on the HAdV-5 genome in infected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>). Reduced H3K18/27ac in DM-E1A vector-infected cells compared to wt E1A-expressing cells correlated with decreased CDK9, AF9, and ENL association with the viral early promoters and gene bodies compared to cells expressing wt E1A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>). Importantly, we did not observe decreases in average AF9 and ENL association with TSSs of most human genes in the same infected cells expressing DM-E1A, demonstrating the specificity of this effect on SEC subunit association at the viral early promoters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref>).</p><p>The ChIP-seq counts for AF9 and ENL in cells expressing wt E1A were twofold to fourfold higher at the E3 promoter compared to the E2early and E4 promoters.

Western blotting demonstrated an extensive decrease in total cellular H3K18ac, which approached steady state by 2 hr after addition of A-485, as expected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lasko et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Weinert et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>).

Remarkably, AF9 and ENL were extensively enriched at TSSs and throughout gene bodies of 2XPI genes compared to the average for all active genes.

Thus, genes with an increase in PI after A-485 treatment (2XPI genes) had a very high association of SEC complexes throughout their transcription units that was selectively sensitive to A-485 treatment.

Following A-485 treatment, we observed the expected decreases in H3K18/27ac at typical enhancers and to an even greater extent at super-enhancers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a</xref>). This accounts for the average total cell H3K18/27 hypoacetylation observed by western blotting of total cell protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>) since most H3K18/27 acetylation occurs in enhancers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2b</xref>).

No evidence for inhibition of a histone deacetylase by A-485 was detected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lasko et al., 2017</xref>) and is very unlikely given the highly specific interactions of A-485 with the CBP acetyl-CoA binding pocket (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lasko et al., 2017</xref>). Consequently, the decrease in average enhancer H3K18/27ac in A-485-treated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a</xref>) suggests that the rate of H3K18/27 acetylation at enhancers in A-485-treated cells is greatly reduced compared to the normal rate in control DMSO-treated cells, as expected from the mechanism of a competitive inhibitor.

This result suggests that H3K18/27ac is more stable at promoters than at enhancers and/or that the rate of H3K18/27 acetylation at promoters is higher than at enhancers. These results also suggest that there is an uncharacterized homeostatic mechanism that maintains promoter region H3K18/27ac in the face of extensive inhibition of the known lysine acetyl transferases that acetylate these sites, the closely related CBP and p300 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Jin et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>It is possible that the difference in the effects of A-485 on the rates of promoter versus enhancer acetylation by CBP/p300 is due to differences in nucleosome density or the density of other proteins at promoters versus enhancers such that high protein concentration near promoters restricts the diffusion of the 536 Da A-485 drug molecule to the CBP/p300 active site. However, it seems unlikely that diffusion of A-485 molecules would be greatly restricted by nucleosomes that are ~400 times larger than the drug and irregularly packed into disordered chains of ‘beads on a string’ nucleosomes with variable particle and linker DNA arrangements in interphase nuclei (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Ou et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Eagen et al., 2015</xref>). Consequently, the resistance of promoters to A-485-induced hypoacetylation compared to enhancers in living cells probably is a result of a faster average rate of H3K18/27 acetylation by CBP/p300 at promoters than at enhancers. This is the result expected if transient interactions between the ADs of activators bound to their cognate DNA-binding sites in enhancers increase the local concentration of CBP/p300 in promoter regions.</p><p>BRD4 contains two bromodomains that bind acetylated lysines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Filippakopoulos et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kanno et al., 2004</xref>). The C-terminal portion of BRD4 binds P-TEFb and is thought to recruit it to hyperacetylated genomic regions to stimulate elongation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chen et al., 2018</xref>). BRD4 has been shown to associate with promoters and enhancers and act as a histone chaperone to facilitate Pol2 elongation through chromatin to produce both protein-coding and enhancer RNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kanno et al., 2014</xref>). By clustering BRD4 enhancer peaks into A-485-sensitive and A-485-resistant groups and correlating these peaks with H3K9ac and H3K18/27ac ChIP-seq data, we conclude that H3K9ac is sufficient for BRD4 recruitment at enhancers in the absence of H3K18/27ac (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7a</xref>). Additionally, GRO-seq in cells treated with A-485 revealed a correlation between decreased BRD4 enhancer association and defective release of paused Pol2 from nearby promoters. The mechanism by which this occurs is likely through direct promoter–enhancer interactions facilitated by long-range chromatin interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Takahashi et al., 2011</xref>). Another possibility is that transcription of enhancer RNAs facilitated by BRD4 stimulates paused Pol2 release by promoting NELF release at a promoter brought into close proximity to the enhancer by folding of the chromatin fiber (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Schaukowitch et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Our results suggest a model in which histone H3K18/27 acetylation by CBP/p300 in the promoter region is essential for maximal paused Pol2 release at the HAdV-5 E4 promoter.

Additionally, the identification of BRD4 enhancer peaks that were either sensitive or resistant to A-485 treatment presented an opportunity to study the effects of elongation factor association with enhancers on transcriptional elongation through neighboring transcription units. Interestingly, we found that BRD4 association with enhancers correlated with decreased Pol2 pausing and increased productive elongation from neighboring promoters.</p><p>A consensus TATA box (TATAWAWR) in the promoter regions of cellular genes correlated with increased pausing for 2XPI genes and decreased initiation for 2XIn genes in response to A-485 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). TATA boxes are common in promoters of tightly regulated genes with focused TSSs, while TATA-less CpG island promoters are more common for constitutively expressed housekeeping genes with many unfocused TSSs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Juven-Gershon and Kadonaga, 2010</xref>). Since 2XPI and 2XIn genes are enriched for developmental functions with tightly regulated expression, enrichment for TATA boxes in the promoters of these genes is expected. This fits with the model that these tightly regulated genes are dependent on the dynamic enhancer H3K18/27ac for either transcription initiation, elongation, or both. Taken together, our results draw interesting causal links between histone H3 acetylation and regulation of Pol2 elongation as well as initiation.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4"

confluence. Cells were then incubated 3 days more without addition of fresh medium and were infected for 12 hr with the indicated HAdV-5 mutants in the conditioned medium. A-485 (MedChemExpress) was added to a final concentration of 10 µM, or the same volume of DMSO (dimethyl sulfoxide) vehicle was added, and cells were incubated for an additional 2 hr.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>GRO-seq</title><p>Cells were harvested and incubated in swelling buffer (10 µM Tris-HCl, 2 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 3 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>). Nuclei were isolated with lysis buffer (10 µM Tris-HCl, 2 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 3 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 10% glycerol, 1% NP-40).

Nuclear RNA was isolated with Trizol (Invitrogen). DNAse treatment was performed with Turbo DNA-free kit (Invitrogen). RNA was purified with Micro Bio-Spin P-30 Gel Columns (Bio-Rad), fragmented with RNA Fragmentation Kit (Invitrogen), and treated with 10 units RppH (NEB) and 30 units T4 PNK (NEB). RNA immunoprecipitation was performed with anti-BrdU-conjugated agarose beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnologies). Library preparation was performed with TruSeq Small RNA Library Preparation Kit (Illumina). GRO-seq reads were aligned with HISTAT2 software to Ad5 and human (hg19) genomes and normalized to the number of reads aligned to hg19. Pause indexes (TSS to +200 counts)/(+201 to TTS counts) were calculated using HTSeq software. Genes determined to be affected by A-485 underwent additional profiling using Homer software (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://homer.ucsd.edu/homer/">http://homer.ucsd.edu/homer/</ext-link>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Heinz et al., 2010</xref>) for biological processes gene ontology enrichment as well as TF motif analysis in promoter regions (± 300 bp from TSSs).</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>qRT-PCR</title><p>Total RNA extracted from HTBECs using a PureLink RNA minikit (Ambion) was reverse transcribed with random hexamer priming using Superscript III (Invitrogen).

For analysis on the Ad5 genome, sequence tags were aligned using Bowtie2 software and normalized to the following formula: (number of Ad5-aligned reads in the input sample/number of human-aligned reads in the input sample) × (number of Ad5-aligned reads in the ChIP sample). For analysis on the human genome, reads were mapped to the hg19 human genome reference using Bowtie2 software. Only reads that aligned to a unique position in the genome with no more than two sequence mismatches were retained for further analysis. Duplicate reads that mapped to the same exact location in the genome were counted only once to reduce clonal amplification effects. MACS2 software was used for peak calling (q-value &lt;0.05 was considered significant). The total counts of the input and ChIP samples were normalized to each other. Samples were normalized for equal number of uniquely mapped reads. The input sample was used to estimate the expected counts in a window. Wiggle files were generated using a custom algorithm and present the data as normalized tag density as seen in all figures with genome browser shots. Metagene plots displaying normalized average relative ChIP-seq signals were generated using CEAS software.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Antibodies</title><p>Antibodies included H3K18ac (814),

Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, including Irwin Davidson as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Kevin Struhl as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>As the editors have judged that your manuscript is of interest, but as described below that additional experiments are required before it is published, we would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). First, because many researchers have temporarily lost access to the labs, we will give authors as much time as they need to submit revised manuscripts. We are also offering, if you choose, to post the manuscript to bioRxiv (if it is not already there) along with this decision letter and a formal designation that the manuscript is &quot;in revision at <italic>eLife</italic>&quot;. Please let us know if you would like to pursue this option. (If your work is more suitable for medRxiv, you will need to post the preprint yourself, as the mechanisms for us to do so are still in development.)</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This study addresses the role of histone acetylation on the release of paused Pol II first from Adenovirus early promoters and then extended to all cellular promoters. By combining Gro-Seq to assess Pol II nascent transcription and ChIP-seq for modified Pol II, BRD4 and SEC components in the presence or absence of A-485 a P300/CBP inhibitor, the authors identify both Adenoviral and cellular promoters where P300/CBP inhibition affects Pol II initiation or more specifically release of Pol II pausing. The study specifically uncovers a group of around 1000 cellular promoters that are particularly sensitive to P300/CBP inhibition leading to decreased released of paused Pol II. The results also indicate that P300/CBP inhibition has different effects on histone acetylation at enhancers and proximal promoters/TSS.</p><p>The reviewers think this is a well-conducted study that yields important novel insights in the connection between histone acetylation by the CBP/p300 coactivators and Pol II pause release by the SEC. This manuscript is well suited to the general readership of e<italic>Life</italic>.</p><p>However, before acceptance, several issues should be addressed in a revised version.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The effect of A-485 on ENL recruitment to the E4 promoter in Figure 4A are minimal and much weaker than on AF9 binding. The authors should strengthen their case by including a CDK9 ChIPseq on A-485 treated Ad-infected cells.</p><p>2) In the subsection “Decreased Pol2 pause-release in the E4 promoter-proximal region correlates with decreased association of SEC subunits CDK9, AF9, and ENL”, the authors speculate that decreases in pol II elongation would lead to increased phosphor-CTD signals. To provide data for this, the authors could perform a ChIPseq on a core pol II subunit.</p><p>3) The authors should provide a statistical test of the π differences mentioned in the subsection “CBP/p300 acetyl-transferase activity is required for efficient Pol2 pause-release and recruitment of AF9, ENL, and BRD4 at E4”.</p><p>4) In the context of the Adenovirus early promoters, the authors discuss that the presence of a consensus TATA-element can account for resistance to histone hypo-acetylation, but they do not extend this analyses to the cellular genes. Have they investigated the relationship between consensus TATA-elements and sensitivity of Pol II initiation/pause release at cellular genes to inhibition by A-485, in particular as it has been shown that only a limited subset of cellular promoters comprises consensus TATA-elements?</p><p>5) When analyzing the cellular promoters and their differential responses to A-485, there is no investigation of “super-enhancers” that are characterized by extended regions of histone acetylation and BRD4 occupancy, key actors in this study. In Figure 7—figure supplement 4, there seems to be a “super-enhancer” region where histone acetylation is strongly affected. Can the authors comment on whether “super-enhancers” are more affected than other enhancers by A-485 and what are the effects on transcription of the associated genes.</p><p>6) While the study identifies cellular genes where release from Pol II pausing is modulated by histone acetylation, there is no investigation of the underlying mechanism that would explain the differential sensitivity of these 2XPI promoters. Why is H3 acetylation lowered at these promoters but increased at the majority of the others? For example, have they investigated the sequence motifs seen at these promoters or associated enhancers to assess whether binding motifs for specific factors are enriched at promoters where Pol II release is sensitive/resistant to acetylation levels and recruitment of SEC components, have they assessed a relationship to GC content and/or position of the +1 nucleosomes? It is important that the authors provide some data or at least some discussion of which characteristics set these promoters apart and would account for their differential sensitivity to A-485 treatment and release of paused Pol II.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.63512.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The effect of A-485 on ENL recruitment to the E4 promoter in Figure 4A are minimal and much weaker than on AF9 binding.

This is because the principal importance of the ChIP-seq results for AF9 and ENL on the Ad5 genome was that they led us to do the analysis of AF9 and ENL association with cellular genes shown in Figure 6B. We observed an unequivocal and much more extensive decrease in both AF9 and ENL ChIP-seq reads on cellular DNA after A-485 treatment than on the Ad5 genome. This may be because the increase in π caused by A-485 was much greater on the 2XPI cellular genes (≥ 2 fold) than on the Ad5 E4 region (1.4 fold).</p><p>In the revised manuscript, in order to be clear about the relatively small effect of A-485 we now present quantitation based on the total ChIP-seq read counts under the peaks in the ENL ChIP-seq showing that the ENL read counts were reduced only ~20% by A-485 treatment, a relatively small effect as the reviewers note.</p><p>New text: &quot;To determine if inhibition of CBP/p300 HAT activity resulted in defective SEC recruitment at E4, we performed AF9, ENL, and BRD4 ChIP-seq in cells infected with the wt E1A vector after DMSO or A-485 treatment. As with cells expressing DM-E1A, A-485 treatment greatly decreased AF9 association at the E2early, E3, and E4 promoter regions, and decreased the number of counts in ENL peaks from the E2early TTS to the right end of the Ad5 genome from 13,712,875 to 10,804,279, an ~20% decrease (Figure 4A).&quot;</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) In the subsection “Decreased Pol2 pause-release in the E4 promoter-proximal region correlates with decreased association of SEC subunits CDK9, AF9, and ENL”, the authors speculate that decreases in pol II elongation would lead to increased phosphor-CTD signals. To provide data for this, the authors could perform a ChIPseq on a core pol II subunit.</p></disp-quote><p>We did not mean to “speculate that decreases in pol II elongation would lead to increased phosphorCTD signals.” In this portion of the submitted manuscript we were discussing the small peaks of Pol2 Ser2-P and Pol2 Ser5-P observed just upstream of the short E2 second exon in Figure 2A. These peaks were not a major subject of this paper. The relevant passage reads:</p><p>“We observed two Ser2-P peaks in the E2early gene body, one just downstream of the TSS, likely indicating paused Pol2. Another Ser2-P peak occurred over the E2early second exon. […] Such a decrease in Pol2 elongation rate over the short E2 second exon would cause an increase in the steady-state level of Pol2 over the exon, potentially leading to the increase in the Pol2 ChIP-seq signal observed over the E2 second exon.”</p><p>Contrary to the statement in the Review point (2), we did not “speculate that decreases in pol II elongation would lead to increased phosphorCTD signals.” We were simply providing a potential explanation for the small Ser2-P and Ser5-P peaks over the E2 second exon, which were not important points of the paper, and were not discussed further.</p><p>To clarify our point here and avoid confusion, we changed the wording to:</p><p>“These Pol2 peaks just upstream of the E2 second exon may be explained by a previously reported reduction in elongation rate over some exons, proposed to influence splice site recognition and spliceosome assembly (Jonkers, Kwak and Lis, 2014; Martin et al., 2013).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The authors should provide a statistical test of the π differences mentioned in the subsection “CBP/p300 acetyl-transferase activity is required for efficient Pol2 pause-release and recruitment of AF9, ENL, and BRD4 at E4”.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now performed three independent biological replicates of the GRO-seq assays on the Ad5 genome in HBTECs infected with the wt E1A and DM E1A vectors. From this data we calculated the fold change in pause index (PI) at the viral early promoters between wt E1A which makes the E1A-AD interaction with p300/CBP and DM E1A which is blocked specifically for the p300/CBP interaction (as opposed to several other E1A interactions with other host proteins Figure 1—figure supplement 1). We calculated the average change in π and the statistical significance (p-value) of the differences between wt E1A and DM-E1A. The p-values are now shown in the new Figure 1B, and the figure legend has been modified accordingly:</p><p>“(B) Average fold change in pause index for E2early, E3, and E4 in cells expressing DM-E1A compared to wt E1A. Pause index is the ratio of reads in the promoter region (TSS to +200) to reads in the gene body (+200 to TTS). […] * indicates a significant difference (p-value &lt; 0.05) between cells expressing wt E1A and DM-E1A. “ns” indicates no significant difference.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) In the context of the Adenovirus early promoters, the authors discuss that the presence of a consensus TATA-element can account for resistance to histone hypo-acetylation, but they do not extend this analyses to the cellular genes. Have they investigated the relationship between consensus TATA-elements and sensitivity of Pol II initiation/pause release at cellular genes to inhibition by A-485, in particular as it has been shown that only a limited subset of cellular promoters comprises consensus TATA-elements?</p></disp-quote><p>We are grateful to the reviewers for asking us to clarify this point. The new Figure 5—figure supplement 1 shows that ~4.5% of 2XPI promoters and ~4.8% of 2XInitiation promoters have consensus TATA-boxes (TATAWAAR), compared to ~1.8% of all active promoters.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) When analyzing the cellular promoters and their differential responses to A-485, there is no investigation of “super-enhancers” that are characterized by extended regions of histone acetylation and BRD4 occupancy, key actors in this study. In Figure 7—supplement 4, there seems to be a “super-enhancer” region where histone acetylation is strongly affected. Can the authors comment on whether “super-enhancers” are more affected than other enhancers by A-485 and what are the effects on transcription of the associated genes.</p></disp-quote><p>Again, we are grateful to the reviewers for asking us to clarify this point. The new Figure 5—figure supplement 2 shows the total number of peaks and the percentage of total peaks of H3K27ac, H3K18ac, H3K9ac, and BRD4 in super-enhancers, typical enhancers, and promoters in primary human tracheal epithelial cells and the changes in these values in A-485 treated and control DMSO vehicle treated cells. As the reviewers suggested, these plots and numbers of peaks show that “super-enhancers” are more affected than other enhancers by A-485. This is discussed in the revised manuscript:</p><p>“Comparing the average signals for H3K18ac and H3K27ac at all TSSs and enhancer peaks (defined as peaks &gt;2.5kb from the nearest TSS), we observed the expected decreases in H3K18ac and H3K27ac by A-485 at enhancer peaks (Figure 5A). […] Furthermore, the percentage of total H3K27ac and H3K18ac peaks increased at promoters and decreased at enhancers after A-485 treatment, while the effects on H3K9ac peaks were minimal (Figure 5—figure supplement 2).”</p></body></sub-article></article>
