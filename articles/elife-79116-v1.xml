Gdown1 is a ubiquitously expressed, RNA polymerase II (Pol II) interacting protein, essential for the embryonic development of metazoan. It tightly binds Pol II <italic>in vitro</italic> and competitively blocks the binding of TFIIF and possibly other transcriptional regulatory factors, yet its cellular functions and regulatory circuits remain unclear. Here, we show that human GDOWN1 strictly localizes in the cytoplasm of various types of somatic cells and exhibits a potent resistance to the imposed driving force for its nuclear localization. Combined with the genetic and microscope-based approaches, two types of the functionally coupled and evolutionally conserved localization regulatory motifs are identified, including the CRM1-dependent nucleus export signal (NES) and a novel Cytoplasmic Anchoring Signal (CAS) that mediates its retention outside of the nuclear pore complexes (NPC). Mutagenesis of CAS alleviates GDOWN1’s cytoplasmic retention, thus unlocks its nucleocytoplasmic shuttling properties, and the increased nuclear import and accumulation of GDOWN1 results in a drastic reduction of both Pol II and its associated global transcription levels. Importantly, the nuclear translocation of GDOWN1 occurs in response to the oxidative stresses, and the ablation of <italic>GDOWN1</italic> significantly weakens the cellular tolerance. Collectively, our work uncovers the molecular basis of GDOWN1’s subcellular localization and a novel cellular strategy of modulating global transcription and stress-adaptation via controlling the nuclear translocation of GDOWN1.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>GDOWN1</kwd><kwd>nucleocytoplasmic shuttling</kwd><kwd>RNA polymerase II</kwd><kwd>transcriptional regulation</kwd><kwd>stress adaptive mechanism</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>The National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>31771447</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cheng</surname><given-names>Bo</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>The Gansu Provincial Outstanding Graduate Student &quot;Innovation Star&quot; project</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2021CXZX-107</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Liu</surname><given-names>Jingjing</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>The Gansu Provincial Outstanding Graduate Student &quot;Innovation Star&quot; Project</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2022CXZX-096</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhu</surname><given-names>Zhanwu</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100012226</institution-id><institution>The Foundation of the Ministry of Education of China, the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>lzujbky-2020-it16</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhu</surname><given-names>Zhanwu</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>The Foundation of the Ministry of Education of China, Key Laboratory of Cell Activities and Stress Adaptations Grant</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>lzujbky-2021-kb05</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cheng</surname><given-names>Bo</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>The National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>31471233</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cheng</surname><given-names>Bo</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>The National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>31970624</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cheng</surname><given-names>Bo</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Human GDOWN1 is identified as an extremely tightly controlled nucleocytoplasmic shuttling protein, and its translocation into the nucleus plays a crucial role in modulating the global transcription and facilitating the cellular adaptation to certain stresses.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>In eukaryotes, RNA Polymerase II (Pol II) catalyzes the RNA synthesis of the clear majority of protein coding genes and a great number of non-coding genes in eukaryotic genomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Haberle and Stark, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Osman and Cramer, 2020</xref>).

Many of these Pol II-binding and regulatory factors are not only essential for facilitating the production and processing of transcripts but also play critical roles in dynamic integrating the intracellular and extracellular information and adjusting Pol II’s target specificity and enzymatic activities in real time to maintain cell homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lynch et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">McNamara et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Muniz et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Schier and Taatjes, 2020</xref>).</p><p>Gdown1 was initially identified as a protein copurified with Pol II in calf thymus and porcine liver, and designated as the 13th subunit of Pol II due to its high-affinity interaction with Pol II (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hu et al., 2006</xref>). Data from <italic>in vitro</italic> transcription assays along with EMSA and chemical crosslinking-based structural analyses have demonstrated that Gdown1 interacts with multiple Pol II subunits via its various regions and strongly inhibits the binding and/or functions of a series of transcription regulatory factors, including the factors required for transcription initiation, such as TFIIF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Jishage et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Jishage et al., 2018</xref>), the factors involved in the productive elongation such as RTF1/PAF1C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ball et al., 2022</xref>), and the transcription termination factor such as TTF2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Cheng et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Although the biochemical properties support Gdown1’s potential in regulating Pol II transcription, it is largely unknown how exactly its regulatory activities are executed under the physiological circumstances. Knockout (<italic>KO</italic>) of <italic>Gdown1</italic> in flies and mice caused embryonic lethality, and moreover, the attempt of establishing a <italic>Gdown1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mouse embryonic stem cell line failed, pointing out its essential roles during the embryonic development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Jishage et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Jishage and Roeder, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Jishage et al., 2018</xref>). Interestingly, Gdown1 has been reported as a nucleocytoplasmic shuttling protein in flies. It colocalizes with Pol II in the nuclei at the transcriptionally silent syncytial blastoderm stage and moves to the cytoplasm at the later blastoderm stage when the global transcription is activated, and meanwhile, Gdown1 is found to be retained in the nuclei of the transcriptionally silent pole cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Jishage and Roeder, 2020</xref>). Although not being proven yet, these findings imply that controlling the nucleocytoplasmic shuttling of Gdown1 may be tightly associated with tuning the transcriptional regulatory activities. At the beginning of the embryonic development, the nuclear Gdown1 may serve as a global transcriptional inhibitor, and once the embryos get adequately prepared, exclusion of Gdown1 from the nucleus provides an effective way to promote zygotic genome activation (ZGA). Further studies are certainly required to explore the functional and regulatory mechanisms behind and find out whether the above phenomena revealed in flies are similarly applied in higher animals or in other situations.</p><p>Evidence is piling up that Gdown1 also plays critical roles in somatic cells. It is expressed throughout the whole life cycle of flies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Jishage et al., 2018</xref>) and ubiquitously present across various types of mouse tissues (data not shown). Mice with Gdown1 specifically knocked out in liver were found viable and relatively normal, yet tended to trigger the quiescent hepatocytes to re-enter cell cycle in the absence of hepatic injury, highlighting its important roles in maintaining the homeostasis of hepatocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Jishage et al., 2020</xref>). Further ChIP-Seq analyses revealed that Gdown1 bound with the elongating Pol II at many genes in liver (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Jishage et al., 2020</xref>). However, the RNA-Seq results unexpectedly revealed that the expression levels of those direct targets of Gdown1 were dramatically reduced upon its ablation, suggesting a positive effect of Gdown1 on transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Jishage et al., 2020</xref>). Thus, it is necessary to clarify the underlying reasons behind the apparently opposite transcriptional regulatory effects of Gdown1 observed in somatic cells and in the defined <italic>in vitro</italic> transcription assays.</p><p>To further explore GDOWN1’s functions in somatic cells, we started out by examining its subcellular localization in many cultured human cell lines and confirmed that it was predominantly localized in the cytoplasm. Based on the known functions, it’s reasonable to presume that human GDOWN1 is a nucleocytoplasmic shuttling protein. However, our data demonstrated that GDOWN1 was subjected to a very tight restriction for its nuclear import under the regular cell culture conditions. Based on these findings, we established various mutagenesis-based screening assays of GDOWN1 and identified multiple intrinsic localization-regulatory signals and their working mechanisms. In addition, manipulation of GDOWN1’s nuclear translocation caused a significant reduction of both the protein levels of Pol II and the global transcription. Its massive and constant nuclear accumulation resulted in a severe growth inhibition and even triggered cell death. Moreover, we provided the experimental evidence that the nuclear import of GDOWN1 was naturally induced upon certain cellular stresses and its genetic ablation resulted in a decreased cell viability under stresses. Overall, our data revealed a novel function of GDOWN1 in facilitating stress adaptation via modulating transcriptional homeostasis, and this protective strategy was achieved by its stress-responsive nuclear translocation.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Gdown1 is primarily a cytoplasmic localized protein in mammalian somatic cells</title><p>We started out to detect the subcellular localization of GDOWN1 in the cultured human cell lines by ectopically expressing GDOWN1 fused with a fluorescent tag at its N- or C-terminus or simply with a Flag tag. Consistent with the previous observation in adult flies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Jishage et al., 2018</xref>) and the recent report in human somatic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ball et al., 2022</xref>), the localization signals of GDOWN1 were exclusively present in the cytoplasm of HeLa cells, regardless of the position or size of the fused tags (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). To explore GDOWN1’s functions in the nucleus, two nuclear localization signals (NLS) were fused to GDOWN1 at each end, which were known to be efficient for driving the 160 kDa SpCas9 protein into the nucleus in a commonly used CRISPR-vector pX459 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Ran et al., 2013</xref>). Unexpectedly, the addition of two NLS did not affect GDOWN1’s cytoplasmic localization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). We then detected the nucleocytoplasmic distribution of the endogenous GDOWN1 in the fractionated cell lysates from various human and mouse cell lines by Western Blotting (WB) using two <italic>KO</italic>-verified GDOWN1 antibodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>).

Most of the nucleocytoplasmic shuttling proteins contain a nuclear export signal (NES) and a typical NES contains a hydrophobic leucine-rich motif recognized by the ubiquitous transporter chromosome maintenance protein 1, CRM1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">la Cour et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Xu et al., 2010</xref>). To test the possibility of GDOWN1 being a CRM1 cargo, HeLa and SW620 cells were treated with leptomycin B (LMB), a potent CRM1 inhibitor for efficiently blocking CRM1-NES interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kudo et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kudo et al., 1998</xref>).</p><p>Using two <italic>KO</italic>-verified GDOWN1 antibodies, our WB data unambiguously demonstrated that GDOWN1 didn’t accumulate in the nucleus upon LMB treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). The resistance to LMB treatment implies that either GDOWN1 does not have any NES, or this treatment alone is not sufficient to achieve the nuclear accumulation of GDOWN1.</p><p>On the other hand, we employed BiFC assays to detect the interactions between GDOWN1 and its potential nuclear binding partners in live cells. An efficient interaction between the proteins of interest drives the formation of the fluorescence complementation, achieved via the covalent interactions between the two truncated parts of a fluorescent protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Hu et al., 2005</xref>). Therefore, BiFC signals are irreversible once generated, making this assay beneficial for capturing the transient protein-protein interactions. To support the specificity of BiFC assays, a collection of the negative controls was provided, including three cytoplasmic proteins, VDAC1 (a mitochondrial protein), GALNT2 (a Golgi protein) and PDIA3 (an endoplasmic reticulum protein) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>). Then, a series of the transcription associated proteins were tested in HeLa cells, including a Pol II subunit (RPB5) and the RPB1-CTD binding factors (RPRD1A, RPRD1B), the Mediator components (MED1, MED26), and the transcription elongation factors (SPT4 and SPT5 in DSIF complex, NELF-E in NELF complex). The results indicated that GDOWN1 interacted to all the above factors tested except for the two Mediator components, well supporting its known characteristics as a co-purified factor of Pol II and the potential functions involved in transcriptional regulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). However, all these BiFC signals were shown in the cytoplasm, yet in the parallel tests, the interaction signals between NELF-E•NELF-A, SPT4•SPT5 pairs were both exclusively present in the nucleus as expected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Meanwhile, our BiFC assays detected the self-interaction of GDOWN1 in the cytoplasm, suggesting that GDOWN1 may form homodimers or oligomers in cells. It was reported that the transcription regulator RYBP contained three potent and functionally independent NLS motifs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Tan et al., 2017</xref>), and when attached to GDOWN1, the BiFC signal of the 3xNLS-GDOWN1 dimers mainly remained in the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). These results support GDOWN1’s potential functions in transcriptional regulation, while the stringent cytoplasmic localization of the BiFC signals indicates that GDOWN1 is restricted from entering the nucleus under the regular cell culture conditions. Thus, our data further confirm that the nuclear entry of GDOWN1 is subjected to a tight regulation. Apparently, alleviation of this restriction will be a prerequisite for permitting GDOWN1 to execute its transcriptional regulatory functions in the nucleus.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Human GDOWN1’s cytoplasmic localization is determined by two distinct types of localization regulatory signals</title><p>Next, we constructed a series of GDOWN1 mutants to screen for localization regulatory signals by monitoring the changes in the subcellular localization by itself or together with other proteins. Based on the information of the predicted secondary structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>), GDOWN1 was truncated into three parts at its structurally flexible coiled regions (the N-terminus, namely <italic>m1</italic>; the middle part, <italic>m2</italic>; the C-terminus, <italic>m3</italic>), fused with a Flag-VN tag in a BiFC vector or with an intact Venus to monitor their dynamic localization in the presence or absence of LMB treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A and B</xref>). Consistent to the above cell fractionation results, both the ectopically expressed full length GDOWN1, and the BiFC signal between the full length of GDOWN1 and NELF-E remained in the cytoplasm in the presence of LMB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>). <italic>m1</italic> was partially located in the nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, <italic>left panel</italic>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>), and the BiFC signal of <italic>m1</italic>•NELF-E was completely nuclear localized (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, <italic>right panel</italic>). The other two GDOWN1 fragments, <italic>m2</italic> and <italic>m3</italic>, remained the cytoplasmic localization on their own or together with NELF-E, which was the same as the full-length protein. Interestingly, both <italic>m2</italic> alone and <italic>m2</italic>•NELF-E BiFC signals were translocated into the nucleus upon the LMB treatment, while either <italic>m3</italic> alone or the <italic>m3</italic>•NELF-E signal did not respond to LMB at all (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>). The quantitative and statistical analyses of these confocal images confirmed that the change in the nucleocytoplasmic distribution of <italic>m2</italic> upon the LMB treatment was significant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>). These results clearly indicate that the middle part of GDOWN1 contains an NES motif. Given that the translocation of GDOWN1 into the nucleus may not be an autonomous and efficient process, we reasoned that monitoring the nuclear accumulation of the BiFC signals between GDOWN1 and its nuclear binding partners (such as NELF-E) would have the advantage for better mining and demonstrating the nuclear translocation potential of GDOWN1. Thus, the above BiFC system was further employed for screening the putative localization regulatory motif(s). The conserved sequence of a classical NES for CRM1 recognition was known as Ψ-(x)<sub>1-3</sub>-Ψ-(x)<sub>1-3</sub>-Ψ-(x)<sub>1-3</sub>-Ψ (Ψ stands for L, I, V, M, or F, x can be any amino acid) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">la Cour et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Xu et al., 2012</xref>). We generated a ‘<italic>m1 +m2’</italic> mutant, namely <italic>m4</italic>, and found it responded to LMB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). We then tested a series of GDOWN1 truncation mutants on the basis of <italic>m4</italic> to identify the functional NES motif (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref>, <italic>m5-m7</italic>), and further confirmed that a putative NES motif located between amino acids 191–201 was responsible for the LMB responsiveness. Mutation of the four hydrophobic amino acids within this region completely abolished the NES activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, <italic>m4 and m4*</italic>). By co-immunoprecipitation and BiFC assays, we confirmed that GDOWN1 interacted to CRM1/RAN, the core components of the protein nuclear export machinery (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). These results prove that GDOWN1 indeed contains a classical CRM1-dependent NES motif, and meanwhile suggest that the C-terminus of GDOWN1 contains a regulatory motif responsible for the observed resistance activity of the full-length GDOWN1 to LMB treatment.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Identification of the Nuclear Export Signal (NES) motifs in GDOWN1.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) A diagram of human GDOWN1 and its mutants used in the IF or BiFC-based motif screening analyses.

It turned out that deletion of the amino acids 352–361 abolished this cytoplasmic localization regulatory activity and switched GDOWN1 into a LMB-responsive manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A, B</xref>, <italic>m10,</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A and B</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, <italic>m10</italic>). After testing a series of combinations of point mutations, we found that mutations of the three arginines (R352, R354, and R357) were efficient to abolish the above cytoplasmic localization activity of GDOWN1 in the presence of LMB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A, B</xref>, <italic>m11</italic>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B–D</xref>, <italic>m11, m17, m18</italic>).

In these stable cell lines, the dynamic localizations of GDOWN1 were monitored and the consistent results were obtained (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2B</xref>). Interestingly, the confocal microscopy images demonstrated that the wild type GDOWN1 accumulated around the nuclear membrane, as if these molecules attempted to burst through this last defense line into the nucleus, while the <italic>CAS</italic> mutant lost this ‘ring-form’ accumulation at the nuclear periphery, and became widely scattered all over the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). We hypothesized that the Venus signal enriched around the nuclear periphery might be an indicator of GDOWN1’s association with the Nuclear Pore Complex (NPC). Due to the complicated composition of NPC, we detected the interaction of GDOWN1 to several representative NPC components via BiFC assays. RAE1 and NUP50 are two NPC components typically assembled within the cytoplasmic filaments and the nuclear baskets, respectively. BiFC results indicated that the wild type GDOWN1 strongly interacted to RAE1 at the cytoplasmic side of the nuclear membrane and in the cytoplasm while this interaction was drastically weakened in the <italic>CAS</italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>), suggesting that the CAS motif was involved in the GDOWN1•NPC interaction. More interestingly, the BiFC signal of the wild type GDOWN1 and NUP50 was very weak and randomly distributed throughout the cytoplasm, but when the CAS motif was mutated, this interaction signal was specifically translocated into the nucleus, especially at the inner face of the nuclear membrane where NUP50 naturally located (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). The IP results also demonstrated that the wild type GDOWN1 interacted with the cytoplasmic NPC component, NUP214, while the <italic>CAS</italic> mutant lost this interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). Overall, these results demonstrated that GDOWN1 specifically interacted to the cytoplasmic NPC components, while the <italic>CAS</italic> mutant reduced this binding affinity and simultaneously enhanced the interaction of GDOWN1 to the nuclear NPC components. Due to the irreversible nature of BiFC signal, the nuclear signal of <italic>mCAS</italic>-GDOWN1•NUP50 interaction was a clear indication of a successful capture of this GDOWN1 mutant in the nucleus, while its wild type counterpart was restricted in the cytoplasm. The above data highlight the crucial role of the CAS motif on locking GDOWN1 in the cytoplasm, presumably through anchoring GDOWN1 to the cytoplasmic components of NPC, and imply that any cellular strategy of preventing CAS function will potentially switch GDOWN1 from a stringent cytoplasmic localized protein into a nucleocytoplasmic-shuttling protein.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>The NES and CAS motifs in Gdown1 are functionally interconnected and both conserved during evolution</title><p>Based on the structural prediction of GDOWN1, its CAS motif is located within the disordered region near the carboxyl-terminus, which makes it difficult to obtain reliable structural information to predict the potential CAS-NES interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Indeed, a previous report, carrying out chemical crosslinking with mass spectrometry readout (CX-MS) to analyze Gdown1-Pol II interaction, did not provide any information about the CAS region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Jishage et al., 2018</xref>).

When both NES2 and CAS were mutated to allow NES1 alone to function, the mutant <italic>GDOWN1</italic> performed as a typical CRM1-cargo, and on the other hand, the <italic>NES1</italic> mutant maintained the same cytoplasmic localization and LMB resistance activity as the wild type GDOWN1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, a-c). Thus, NES1 was a functional NES motif working independently to NES2. Similarly, we proved that NES2 was a functional NES as well, although somewhat weaker than NES1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, d and b). The subcellular distribution of GDOWN1 in these images was quantified and plotted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>. It turned out NES1 better responded to CRM1 than NES2. The <italic>NES2</italic> mutant regularly remained in the cytoplasm while it did not resist to LMB treatment as well as the wild type, suggesting that the cytoplasmic localization activity of CAS might be partially interfered (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, e). Double mutations in both NES motifs made GDOWN1 distributed in both the cytoplasm and the nucleus, and did not respond further to LMB, which proved that the entire GDOWN1 contained two NES motifs, and again mutations in NES2 partially abolished the CAS activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, f). Compared with the wild type, the <italic>CAS</italic> mutant responded well to the LMB treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, g). Further mutating the CAS motif on top of NES1 or NES2 increased the portion of the nuclear GDOWN1 upon LMB treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref><italic>, d and c; b and e</italic>), suggesting that CAS is the main motif to keep GDOWN1 in the cytoplasm via a CRM1-independent manner. Consistently, in the stable cell lines, we found that the <italic>NES2</italic> mutant lost the perinuclear staining, which was very similar to the phenotype of the <italic>CAS</italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). The above data from the intrinsic motif analyses demonstrate that each one of the two NES motifs of GDOWN1 acts as an independent CRM1-regulated motif and the function of CAS motif partially depends on the existence of NES2. Taken together, GDOWN1 is identified as a nucleocytoplasmic shuttling protein subjected to both CRM1-dependent and CRM-independent regulation and the two layers of regulation are functionally coupled.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>The working mechanisms and conservation of the binary localization regulatory apparatus in Gdown1.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Dissection of the functional independence and interplay among CAS and NES motifs.

The Clustal Omega analyses were carried out to compare the Gdown1 sequences from various representative species (fly, zebrafish, mouse, and human). The NES motifs are modestly conserved across these species with the key hydrophobic amino acids roughly present in fly and zebrafish Gdown1 proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>, top, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>). In terms of the CAS motifs, there is no difference between mouse and human, while there is only one or two key arginines remained present in the putative CAS motifs of zebrafish and fly Gdown1 proteins, respectively. When ectopically expressed in HeLa cells, fly and zebrafish Gdown1 proteins also located stringently in the cytoplasm and resisted to LMB treatment as same as their human counterpart (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1C</xref>). When the conserved amino acids in the putative CAS motifs of fly and zebrafish Gdown1 proteins were mutated, these mutants became partially nucleus localized upon LMB treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1C</xref>), indicating that fly and zebrafish Gdown1 also contained functional NES and CAS motifs. In addition, the results from BiFC analyses demonstrated that fly and zebrafish Gdown1 proteins were able to interact to human NELF-E in the cytoplasm, indicating that these orthologs in lower animals were structurally conservative to human GDOWN1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1D</xref>). Different from the mammalian counterpart, the BiFC signals between fly or zebrafish Gdown1 and NELF-E were partially translocated into nucleus in the presence of LMB, and when CAS regions were mutated, these BiFC signals were completely present in the nucleus, indicating that the regulatory effect of CAS in fly and zebrafish Gdown1 was present but not as potent as that in human (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1D</xref>). Furthermore, we found that <italic>Drosophila CAS</italic> mutant appears to accumulate more in the nucleus than the mutated zebrafish protein in the presence of LMB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1C and D</xref>). We surmised that the phenomenon is because the CAS motif in fly Gdown1 is more conserved than which in zebrafish. The above results demonstrate that both the CRM1-dependent and CRM1-independent regulatory mechanisms of Gdown1 are well conserved across the various species from flies to human, while during evolution, the cytoplasmic anchoring effect of the CAS motif seems to have been enhanced to strengthen the regulation of Gdown1’s subcellular localization.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Nuclear-accumulated GDOWN1 reduces the total Pol II and the global transcription levels, and prevents cell growth</title><p>The great effort devoted by the cells to prevent Gdown1 from entering the nucleus strongly implies that it is essential to stringently control the nuclear activities of Gdown1. To help explore the outcome of Gdown1’s nuclear accumulation in somatic cells, we generated a nuclear localized, full-length human <italic>GDOWN1</italic> mutant by mutating all the ten key amino acids identified in the three motifs of NES and CAS (highlighted in red in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3A</xref>, simply named the <italic>10M</italic> mutant). The wild type GDOWN1 or the GDOWN1(<italic>10M</italic>) was fused with Venus, and further with or without an NLS, in a commercial pTripZ vector to achieve the doxycycline (Dox)-inducible expression. The four corresponding stable HeLa cell lines were generated. The main experimental procedures are demonstrated in a diagram of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>. The confocal images after a one-day induction were shown and the <italic>10M</italic> mutant was evenly distributed in cells and further addition of an NLS motif switched GDOWN1 into a complete nuclear localized protein (NLS-<italic>10M</italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>, i). These stable cell lines were generated by collecting the pool of cells survived from the puromycin selection, which turned out to be heterogenous that both Venus<sup>+</sup> and Venus<sup>-</sup> cells were present upon Dox induction. The benefit of using such heterogenous cell pools instead of the single clones hereby was that the co-cultured Venus<sup>-</sup> cells (mainly expressing the very low levels of GDOWN1-Venus) could serve as the internal negative controls for a parallel comparison. When Dox was continuously supplemented in the culture medium, the fluorescence intensity in the Venus<sup>+</sup> cells and their ratio to the whole population reached nearly maximum around day 3, and remained stable hereafter in the cell lines expressing the wild type GDOWN1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>, ii). However, these values were significantly reduced in the cell lines expressing the nuclear localized GDOWN1(<italic>10M</italic>) mutants, especially in the NLS-GDOWN1(<italic>10M</italic>)-Venus cells which almost completely lost the Venus signal on day 9 after the initial Dox addition, suggesting that the accumulation of GDOWN1 in the nucleus was unfavorable for the cell growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>, ii). To dissect the underlined reasons for the signal loss, we comprehensively evaluated the growth status of the cells upon expressing either the cytoplasmic or the nuclear localized GDOWN1. The cells on day 0 (Dox addition), day 3 (Dox withdrawal), and day 9 were analyzed by FACS. The results demonstrated that the cells expressing the cytoplasmic GDOWN1 only showed the basal levels of cell death (indicated by the DAPI<sup>+</sup> subgroup), while the cells expressing the nuclear GDOWN1(<italic>10M</italic>) showed a drastic reduction of expression (indicated by the decreased FITC values), and simultaneously those Venus<sup>+</sup> cells mainly contributed to the significant increased death rate at the later time point (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>, iii). The expression levels of the wild type GDOWN1 and its mutants in these cell lines were tested by WB, and the expression level of the NLS-GDOWN1(<italic>10M</italic>)-Venus was comparable to that of the endogenous GDOWN1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>). In addition, the results from the cell counting and the real-time cell analysis assays (RTCA) also demonstrated that the cells expressing the <italic>10M</italic> mutant had severe defects in their growth and proliferation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>, iv, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B</xref>). The above data indicate that the translocation of GDOWN1 into the nucleus inhibits cell growth, and its continuous and massive accumulation eventually causes cell death.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Massive accumulation of GDOWN1 in the nucleus slows down cell growth and may trigger cell death.</title><p>HeLa cells stably and inducibly expressing GDOWN1- or NLS<sup>sv40</sup>-GDOWN1-Venus-Flag, either wild type or the <italic>10M</italic> mutants were used for detection. ‘i’ stands for inducible and Dox was used as the inducer.

Since the global transcription was dramatically repressed upon the massive accumulation of GDOWN1, we reasoned that the remained proteins were determined by their half-lives. Histone proteins were experimentally proven to be very stable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Savas et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Toyama et al., 2013</xref>), so we employed histone H3 as the internal control for data normalization. The results indicated that the total Pol II was clearly reduced upon the nuclear accumulation of GDOWN1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). The 8WG16 antibody was previously confirmed to preferentially recognize the unphosphorylated RBP1 via the <italic>in vitro</italic> kinase assays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Cheng and Price, 2007</xref>). Thus, using this antibody, we found that the levels of the unphosphorylated Pol II were significantly reduced as well (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1B</xref>).

In both cases, the nucleocytoplasmic ratio of the total and the unphosphorylated forms of Pol II seemed to be unaffected.</p><p>To further dissect the detailed status of the affected Pol II, the IF assays were carried out using several Pol II antibodies with distinct specificities. Again, the 8WG16 antibody was applied to monitor the signals of the unphosphorylated Pol II, and the antibodies specifically recognizing the CTD-phosphorylated form at either the Ser5 positions (S5P) or the Ser2 positions (S2P) were employed to detect the Pol II subgroup engaged in either transcriptional initiation or productive elongation, respectively. Compared with the parental HeLa cells or the stable cell lines expressing the wild type GDOWN1, the signals of the unphosphorylated and the phosphorylated forms of Pol II were all dramatically reduced in the cell lines expressing the nuclear localized GDOWN1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1C</xref>). The image quantification analyses indicated that the S5P signals were decreased more severely than those of the S2P, suggesting that the nuclear GDOWN1 may inhibit transcription initiation more effectively than transcription elongation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1D</xref>). Taken together, these data demonstrate that the massive accumulation of the nuclear GDOWN1 results in the significant loss of Pol II and the global transcriptional repression.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>GDOWN1 shuttles into the nucleus in response to certain stresses and helps strengthen cellular adaptability</title><p>Next, we tested various types of reagents to search for any potential exocellular stimuli capable of triggering the nuclear translocation of the endogenous GDOWN1. No obvious change of GDOWN1’s subcellular localization was observed when cells were treated with the transcriptional inhibitors DRB or Madrasin, the translational inhibitor CHX, or the inhibitors for DNA topoisomerases such as CPT or Doxorubicin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Interestingly, we found the treatment of sodium arsenite (NaAsO<sub>2</sub>) reproducibly caused the nuclear translocation of GDOWN1. NaAsO<sub>2</sub>-induced nuclear translocation of GDOWN1 occurred in a dose-dependent manner and reversed upon the drug removal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). The exposure to inorganic arsenite was known to induce a global transcriptional repression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Nelson et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Rea et al., 2003</xref>), and eventually to accumulate severe cellular toxicity, resulting in growth inhibition, DNA damage, reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, apoptosis, and/or autophagy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Tam et al., 2020</xref>). When cells were treated with 0.5 mM NaAsO<sub>2</sub> for 30 minutes (the prevalently used condition in the literature), nearly all cells generated stress granules (SGs) no matter GDOWN1 was competent or knocked out, indicated by the IF signals of G3BP1, a typical SG marker (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1B</xref>). However, under a milder condition (0.1 mM of NaAsO<sub>2</sub>, for 6 hr), the <italic>GDOWN1 KO</italic> cells also generated a great number of SGs, while SGs were only detected in a very small fraction in the control cells or the cells ectopically expressing the exogenous GDOWN1-Venus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). The EU staining results indicated that even under this milder NaAsO<sub>2</sub> treatment condition, the global transcription was already significantly downregulated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). Furthermore, the viability of the <italic>GDOWN1 KO</italic> cells was significantly less than the GDOWN1 competent counterparts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>), indicating that loss of GDOWN1 made the cells hypersensitive to the cell toxicity induced by the low dose of NaAsO<sub>2</sub> treatment. Taken together, our data demonstrate that the nucleocytoplasmic localization of the native GDOWN1 is switchable in response to NaAsO<sub>2</sub>-induced cellular stress and potentially to other types of unidentified cellular stimuli. Our data strongly suggest that GDOWN1-mediated transcriptional control contributes to the cellular sensitivity and adaptation to those stresses.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>The expression levels of GDOWN1 correlate to the cellular sensitivity to NaAsO<sub>2</sub> treatment.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Upon NaAsO<sub>2</sub> treatment, a portion of the cellular GDOWN1 was subjected to a reversible translocation into the nucleus.

This study is mainly focused on the exploration of human GDOWN1’s subcellular localization and the associated functional and regulatory mechanisms in the somatic cells. Our results confirmed the cytoplasmic localization of Gdown1 in the cultured mammalian somatic cell lines. To demonstrate the nucleocytoplasmic shuttling properties of GDOWN1, we treated HeLa and other types of cells with a specific inhibitor of the nuclear exportin protein CRM1, LMB, with the expectation to observe its nuclear accumulation upon the treatment. Strikingly, it turned out that for all the cell lines tested, GDOWN1 remained its cytoplasmic localization in the presence of LMB, confirmed by both biochemical fractionation and the cell imaging-based assays. Furthermore, the artificial addition of NLS motifs to GDOWN1 did not efficiently promote its nuclear translocation either. Thus, we conclude that under the conventional cell culture conditions, GDOWN1 is strictly locked in the cytoplasm rather than dynamically shuttling between the cytoplasm and the nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>), which makes GDOWN1 remarkably different from the typical nucleocytoplasmic shuttling proteins.</p><p>Our systematic dissection of the intrinsic localization regulatory motif(s) in GDOWN1 via the detailed mutant analyses let us identify a binary localization regulatory system composed of the functionally coupled NES and CAS motifs. This delicate orchestration between CAS and NES controls the nucleocytoplasmic distribution of GDOWN1, guaranteeing the appropriate input of GDOWN1 in transcriptional regulation. The facts that both NES and CAS motifs are conservative and the CAS activity seems to be strengthened from lower to higher animals further highlight the essential role of this regulatory apparatus/mechanism in controlling Gdown1’s subcellular localization and functions.</p><p>In terms of the working mechanisms of the CAS motif, at least it is partially attributed to its participation of anchoring GDOWN1 to the cytoplasmic filament subcomplex of the NPC. NPCs are composed of ~32 conserved nucleoporin proteins. Besides their central role as nucleocytoplasmic conduits, recent studies have revealed that Nups play an important role in the maintenance of cellular homeostasis through their participation in many cellular activities such as chromatin organization, transcription regulation, DNA damage repair, genome stabilization, and cell cycle control, etc. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Raices and D’Angelo, 2022</xref>). Therefore, our results support the potential involvement of NPCs in recruitment of GDOWN1 to the nuclear periphery and the resultant cytoplasmic retention, suggesting that the nuclear periphery might be the main workplace for GDOWN1 to execute its cytoplasmic functions. When CAS is fully functional, it sufficiently locks GDOWN1 in the cytoplasm so that the function of NES becomes a backup, which explains the phenomenon that GDOWN1 is insensitive to LMB treatment under this circumstance. Thus, our data suggest that removing or at least alleviating the constraint of CAS would be a prerequisite for licensing GDOWN1’s nuclear translocation and the following transcription regulatory activities. Besides the NPC-anchoring activity, other working mechanisms of the CAS-directed cytoplasmic retention remain to be explored. In addition, the controlling mechanisms for switching off the CAS activity remain unclear. Based on our findings, one reasonable hypothesis is that post translational modifications of the core arginines within CAS or possibly other amino acids nearby might facilitate this switch via causing a conformational change or affecting the interactions of GDOWN1 to its regulatory factors (illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>), which is similar to the reported cases in the literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ashida et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Navarro-Lérida et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>Our data demonstrate that mutation of the CAS motif immediately switches GDOWN1 into an LMB-sensitive nucleocytoplasmic shuttling protein, and its nuclear abundance is determined by the dynamic balance between its functionally associated binding partners (such as Pol II) and the CRM1/RAN-mediated nuclear export machinery. This partial translocation of GDOWN1 leads to tremendous changes inside of the nucleus, including the reduction of Pol II and the global transcriptional decrease. The less Pol II, the less active transcription there is, and vice versa, and this mutual feedback causes the drastic decline of the cellular transcription levels. In the previously published <italic>in vitro</italic> biochemical data, we and others found that GDOWN1 strongly inhibited both the transcriptional initiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Jishage et al., 2012</xref>) and elongation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Cheng et al., 2012</xref>). In this study, our data indicated that the nuclear GDOWN1 tended to affect the S5P-Pol II more than the S2P subgroup, suggesting that GDOWN1 may have a stronger or a more rapid effect on the transcription initiation than elongation. It’s also worth noting that the effects of transcription inhibition and pol II defect may be attributed to the overexpression and massive nuclear accumulation of the GDOWN1(<italic>10M</italic>) mutant, although its expression level in our stable cell line was only about one-fold higher compared with the endogenous GDOWN1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Certainly, further studies are required to figure out the working mechanisms of the nuclear GDOWN1. Moreover, it was suggested that GDOWN1 was involved in the cytoplasmic assembly of Pol II as well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ball et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Forget et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Forget et al., 2013</xref>). Therefore, the nuclear translocation and accumulation of GDOWN1 may also lead to the reduced efficiency of both Pol II assembly and the following nuclear import, which contributes the observed global transcriptional repression.</p><p>Recently it was reported that GDOWN1 played a role in facilitating global transcriptional shut down during mitosis and the genetic ablation of <italic>GDOWN1</italic> exhibited mitotic defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ball et al., 2022</xref>), which is consistent with GDOWN1’s stringent localization in the cytoplasm during the interphase. Our discovery of GDOWN1’s nuclear translocation upon cellular stresses further expands the context in which GDOWN1 plays an essential role in the global transcriptional repression. The cells without GDOWN1 are much more sensitive to the cellular stresses, emphasizing that GDOWN1 is a crucial factor in maintaining cellular homeostasis. Further studies are needed to explore GDOWN1’s functions in the cytoplasm and to identify more cellular situations that may trigger its nuclear translocation. Overall, this work uncovered GDOWN1’s new functions and switchable localization in mammalian somatic cells and shed a light on a new connection between the global transcriptional regulation and the cellular stress adaptation.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom">Reagent type (species) or resource</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Designation</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Source or reference</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Identifiers</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Gene (human)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><italic>POLR2M</italic></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">EMBL database</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">ENST00000299638.8</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">RNA polymerase II subunit M (GDOWN1)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Gene (human)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><italic>POLR2E</italic></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">EMBL database</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">ENST00000615234.5</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">RNA polymerase II subunit E (RPB5)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Gene (human)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><italic>NELFA</italic></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">EMBL database</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">ENST00000382882.9</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">negative elongation factor complex member A.

The mouse embryonic stem cell line, E14Tg2a, (gift of Dr. Qintong Li in Sichuan University) was cultured in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle’s Media supplemented with 15% Fetal Bovine Serum (900–108, Gemini Bio-products, California, USA), 1 x non-essential amino acids (11140–035, Gibco, New York, USA), 200 mM L-glutamine, 0.1 mM β-mercaptoethanol, 10<sup>3</sup> U/mL leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF, purified in lab), and pen/strep. All the dishes or coverslips used for culturing E14Tg2a cells were pretreated with 0.5% gelatin. All cells were maintained at 37°C, 90% humidity, and 5% CO2. Plasmid transfections were carried out using the Xfect Transfection Reagent according to the manufacturer’s protocol. 0.25 μg plasmid was used for transfecting one well of cells in a 24-well cell culture dish and normally confocal microscopy images were taken at 24 hr post transfection.</p><p>For samples treated with LMB, 20 nM final concentration of LMB was added to the culture medium at 18 hr post transfection and incubated for 6 hr before data collection (or mock treated with an equal volume of ethanol). For NaA<sub>S</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, DRB, CHX, Madrasin, Tubercidin, CPT, and Doxorubicin treatment, the drug was added to the complete medium at the indicated final concentration and incubated with cells for the indicated timing.

parental vectors for generating all the indicated BiFC plasmids. The coding sequences of human <italic>MED1</italic>, <italic>MED26</italic>, and <italic>SPT5</italic> genes were PCR amplified from the plasmids (gifts from Dr. Ruichuan Chen, Xiamen University, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lu et al., 2016</xref>). Human <italic>GDOWN1</italic> (also namely <italic>POLR2M</italic>，NM_015532.5) and other genes were all amplified by RT-PCR used cDNA samples generated from HeLa cells as the templates. The <italic>Gdown1</italic> genes in <italic>Danio rerio</italic> (NM_001346180.1) and <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> (NM_142537.2) were cloned from the cDNA samples generated directly from animal lysates. Total RNA was extracted by the MolPure Cell/Tissue Total RNA Kit (19221ES50, YEASEN, Shanghai, China) and the cDNA was synthesized using the 1st Strand cDNA Synthesis SuperMix (11141ES60, YEASEN, Shanghai, China). The purified RT-PCR products were double digested by BamHI (R3136S, NEB, Massachusetts, USA) and XbaI (R0145S, NEB, Massachusetts, USA) and then ligated into pBiFC-Flag-VN or -YC vectors by T4 DNA ligase, or when these two restriction enzymes had cut sites within the cDNA sequences, the PCR products were assembled into pBiFC-Flag-VN or -YC vectors via homologous recombination using the ClonExpressII One Step Cloning Kit (C112-02, Vazyme, Nanjing, China). The two NLS motifs in a plasmid named Flag-NLS-GDOWN1-NLS in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> were adopted from the pX459 plasmid originally constructed from Dr. Feng Zhang’s lab in MIT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Ran et al., 2013</xref>). The three NLS motifs in the VN/YC-3xNLS-GDOWN1 plasmids shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref> were cloned from the CDS sequences of human <italic>RYBP</italic> gene corresponding to the amino acids 1–94 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Tan et al., 2017</xref>). The truncated fragments of human <italic>GDOWN1</italic> were amplified using the full-length CDS as a template and further used to construct the pBiFC-based GDOWN1 mutants. Point mutations were introduced by designing the long PCR primers containing the designated mutated sequences and then amplified the fragments in the regular PCR or bridging PCR reactions as needed. The information on the amino acids for mutagenesis was shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3A</xref>. The above pBiFC-based plasmids series were applied in both BiFC assays (directly monitoring the BiFC signals) or in IF assays (detection via a Flag antibody) as indicated in the figure legends. For generating the GDOWN1-Venus plasmid series, pcDNA3.1(+) was used as a parental vector. The full-length, wild type GDOWN1 was amplified from the above pBiFC vector and ligated into the pcDNA3.1-Venus plasmid (previously constructed in lab). The <italic>NES</italic> and/or <italic>CAS</italic> mutant fragments were PCR amplified from the above pBiFC plasmids expressing the corresponding mutant GDOWN1 and further amplified by the bridging PCR and then assembled into the pcDNA3.1-Venus plasmid.</p><p><italic>GDOWN1 KO</italic> HeLa cells were generated via the CRISPR-Cas9 technology. The sgRNAs were selected according to the information provided by ChopChop. The targeting sequences of sgRNAs are listed in the table down below. The pX459-sg<italic>GDOWN1-</italic>#1/#7/#8/#9/#10 plasmids were constructed and transfected into HeLa cells and the cells were selected with 0.5 μg/mL puromycin starting from 48 hr post transfection. After 5 days of selection, the survived cells were pooled and further verified by sequencing and WB. For cells transfected with pX459-sg<italic>GDOWN1-</italic>#1, the pooled cells after puromycin selection were re-plated in a p100 cell culture dish at a density of 2000 cells per dish. After 15 days of culture, the single colonies were picked to a 96-well plate and further expanded.

Two experiments were performed at the same time, with the cells either being seeded in 12-well plates for cell counting, or in 6 well plates for FACS. For generating the growth curve, the cells were incubated with 0.25 μg/mL of Dox for 9 days, and the equal number (6×10^4) of cells from each cell line were re-plated into a fresh cell culture dish every three days (on day 3 and 6). The number of cells was counted on days 3, 6, and 9 using a cell counter (Bodboge, Guangzhou, China), and the averaged value was calculated based on at least three independent readings. The finalized cell counts were calculated based on the averaged values and the distinct dilution coefficient upon each passage.</p><p>For FACS analyses, the cells were harvested on days 0, 3, and 9 after Dox induction. To gather the dead cells, the culture medium was centrifuged at 1000 ×g for 5 minutes and the cells at the bottom of the tubes were collected. Then the adherent cells in the plates were trypsinized (0.25% trypsin) and collected via a centrifugation at 800 xg for 5 minutes. Both the attached cells and the dead cells originally from the same sample were combined and resuspend with 500 μL of PBS, and further incubated with DAPI (at a final concentration of 5 μg/mL) at dark for 15 minutes. Then, the cells were immediately handled in the Flow Cytometer (LSRFortessa, BD, New Jersey, USA) for the fluorescence detection. For each sample, a minimum of 10,000 cells were analyzed with the FlowJo 7.6 software. A control sample generated by mixing 2/3 of live cells with 1/3 of the formaldehyde fixed dead cells (indicated as DAPI<sup>+</sup> cells) was utilized to facilitate the accurate setting of the gating parameters. The data were exported using the FlowJo 7.6 software.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf2"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Project administration</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Formal analysis, Investigation, Visualization, Project administration</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Conceptualization, Validation, Visualization, Methodology, Project administration</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Project administration</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Project administration</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Project administration</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Supervision, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con8"><p>Supervision, Validation, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con9"><p>Conceptualization, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Validation, Investigation, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Writing - review and editing</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s6"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="mdar"><label>MDAR checklist</label><media xlink:href="elife-79116-mdarchecklist1-v1.docx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="docx"/></supplementary-material></sec><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="s7"><title>Data availability</title><p>All data generated or analyzed during this study are included in the manuscript and supporting file; Source Data files have been provided for Figures whenever is necessary.</p></sec><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors acknowledge Dr. David Price (the University of Iowa) for providing Gdown1 antibody made in sheep (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Cheng et al., 2012</xref>) and for the helpful comments and discussion from his group; Dr. Ruichuan Chen (Xiamen University), Dr. Qintong Li (Sichuan University), Dr. Yingmei Zhang and Bingtao Niu (Lanzhou University) for providing necessary plasmids, cells and animals; many members of Cheng laboratory for their helpful discussion; Yaojia Wang for her help of revising our model diagram.

Your article has been reviewed by 2 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Kevin Struhl as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>The referees agreed that this study should be of general interest to readers of <italic>eLife</italic> following an adequate revision that takes into account the issues raised by the referees.</p><p>The authors should pay specific attention to the following points.</p><p>1). The BiFC results indicate that GDOWN1 appears to interact with all the tested cytoplasmic proteins and moreover most on the deletion mutants also still interact with their nuclear targets. The authors must provide negative controls to demonstrate the specificity of the interactions detected in this way. The referees also question the utility of these experiments that in any case to not add to the conclusions concerning the sequences that regulate GDOWN1 intra-cellular localization.</p><p>2). On page 9 the authors claim that M1 localizes mainly in the nucleus. It is more accurate to say partitions between the cytoplasm and nucleus. If fact there are cells where it seems also to remain cytoplasmic. Similarly, in Figure 3C there are cells on the left of the upper panel that also seem to show diffuse cytoplasmic staining. The authors should perform quantitative image analyses. This has been done in some figures but should be added for all.</p><p>3). The manuscript requires a major revision by a native English speaker to correct a large number of grammatical errors.</p><p>4). The style of the title could also be changed. Lifting the ban sounds too familiar. For example 'Overcoming cytoplasmic retention of GDOWN1 by the combinatorial action of nuclear export and cytoplasmic anchoring signals modulates transcription and facilitates adaption to cellular stress.</p><p>Reviewing editor comments.</p><p>1). Figure 3D is rather difficult to visualize, could the authors show a higher magnification?</p><p>2). In Figure 4B the <italic>Drosophila</italic> Cas mutant appears to accumulate more in the nucleus that the mutated zebrafish protein. This is rather surprising as given that <italic>Drosophila</italic> is more distantly related than zebrafish, but may reflect the fact that <italic>Drosophila</italic> CAS motif seems better conserved. Can the authors comment on this? Quantification analyses of the images would strengthen the results.</p><p>3). In Figure 5B, rather than simply using DAPI in the flow cytometry, can the authors use activated caspase 3 or Annexin V to look for apoptosis? Is apoptosis the mechanism of cell death?</p><p>4). In Figure 6B there seems to be a perinuclear staining on the iNLS-GDOWN in the bottom right Venus panel. Can the authors comment on this?</p><p>5). Many of the experiments in this study are performed with stable or inducible ectopic expression. It is difficult to assess the expression level of the exogenous proteins versus the endogenous by the immunofluorescence. In the supplemental data, the authors performed immunoblots that often showed the exogenous proteins to be expressed at much higher levels that endogenous. To some extent, this reinforces some of the conclusions when the overexpressed mutants remain cytoplasmic as it indicates the robustness of the retention mechanism. However, the authors should mention the potential caveats that overexpression may introduce.</p><p>In addition to the above, the authors should also address the various issues raised by the referees and listed below.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>On p. 3, lines 42-43: The general Pol II transcription factors are listed; TFIIS should not be included in that group.</p><p>Figure 1D, for example. The authors use BiFC signals to track Gdown1; these rely on the presence in the cytoplasm of proteins that should be nuclear, like Spt4/5. I found this confusing, and the approach did not seem to add anything to straight detection of tagged Gdown1.</p><p>On p. 9, lines 198-199: The authors refer to the structurally flexible regions of Gdown1 without any indication of how that determination was made. They should refer to the structural predictions in Figure S4A.</p><p>On p. 14, lines 342-345: It is asserted that the function of the CAS motif depends partially on structural support from NES2. &quot;Structural support&quot; seems like an overstatement- I don't think any particular mechanistic connection can be inferred.</p><p>P. 17, first paragraph: Do the authors have any sense for the relative levels of the 10M and NLS<sup>-1</sup>0M versions of Gdown1, post dox exposure, as compared to the endogenous Gdown1?</p><p>Figure 6B and S6: The overall effect of Gdown1 access to the nucleus is clear, but more could have been learned with a quantitative comparison of the relative loss of total Pol II, ser5P and ser2P. For example, if ser2 is reduced more than ser5 this could imply an effect on elongation. Probing a panel C blot with the appropriate antibodies could have addressed this point.</p><p>I could not understand the result in panel 6C. If nuclear export is blocked by LMB, how can most of HeLa Pol II be cytoplasmic after LMB treatment?</p><p>Points in the Discussion:</p><p>How is Gdown1 acting in the nucleus? The earlier biochemical work provided a number of possibilities but those aren't investigated here or extensively discussed. Is Gdown1 mostly acting to tie up Pol II so that it cannot make PICs, or is it also/mostly acting downstream of initiation to block elongation? As noted above, determining whether ser5 and ser2 Pol II are affected differently might have shed light on this. Additionally, it would have been useful to know if nuclear Gdown1 is chromatin associated (probably talking to elongation) or free in the nucleoplasm (probably bound to Pol II). The point about effects on elongation seems particularly important when trying to understand how nuclear Gdown1 reduced overall Pol II levels. In particular, if elongation were severely affected polymerases could be stalled for extended periods at difficult-to-traverse locations, provoking the ubiquitination and clearance of those complexes (and thus reducing overall Pol II levels).</p><p>Finally, lines 604-607: The authors assert that EU labeling in nucleoli is drastically reduced upon Gdown1 entry into nuclei, showing that Gdown1 interferes with both Pol I and Pol III activity. There is no quantitation provided for the assertion that nucleolar labeling is reduced, but regardless such reduction would not show a direct effect on Pol I (or Pol III) activity- strong reductions in mRNA synthesis should feed back into reductions in rRNA synthesis.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>We have a few suggestions to increase the clarity of this manuscript:</p><p>1. The current title is a bit complicated. Can the authors make the title simpler?</p><p>2. The authors have some factually incorrect statements in their introduction. They should try to improve the content and presentation of the introduction. Examples:</p><p>a. In the introduction (line 57-64), they discuss in vitro work done on GDOWN1, but they do not mention the 2018 structure from Roeder (doi: 10.1038/s41594-018-0118-5). Can the authors please add this paper, as it also clarifies what is known about GDOWN1-Pol II interactions?</p><p>b. In the introduction (line 89), they mention ChIP-seq data of Gdown1 and elongating Pol II. Can they please clarify this sentence? It is confusing to understand.</p><p>c. Line 38: RNA polymerase II is in fact not the only polymerase that synthesis protein coding genes in eukaryotes (e.g., mitochondrial RNA polymerase also synthesizes protein coding mRNA).</p><p>3. The figures are very complicated with many panels. Could the authors consider making more subpanels? For example, Figure 1D is showing two different things; what factors GDOWN1 interacts with, and then various factors interacting with other factors. We recommend separating these figures to increase the clarity of the paper.</p><p>4. We have a few suggestions for improving Figure 4A. It is of particular interest to see how NES1, NES2, and then the double NES mutation influences nuclear levels. Could they more directly compare these three mutation-types by putting quantitative analysis of all constructs next to each other?</p><p>5. While the evolutionary analysis in Figure 4B+C is exciting, we feel it takes away from the figures purpose. We suggest moving figure 4B+C to the supplementals and then expanding on the analysis of the different NES in the main figure.</p><p>6. Please make a cartoon describing that 10M is a triple mutation of all three identified domains in figure 5. We generally to produce an additional supplementary figure panel that summarizes all used constructs in a graphical representation.</p><p>7. In Figure 6, the authors provide evidence for a decrease in EU RNA incorporation in the context of the triple mutant. It would strengthen the manuscript if the authors could demonstrate a transcriptional defect by providing data from a complementary technique.</p><p>8. Could the authors provide additional quantification of Figure S6B?</p><p>9. The authors should also provide error bars for Figure S6C.</p><p>10. As the authors are well aware, Pol II antibodies show sub-optimal specificity. Could the authors provide data from additional Pol II antibodies (e.g., S2P, S5P, RPB3) for Figure S6C?</p><p>11. In lines 455-456, the authors mention in vitro transcription assays, but do not cite anything. Please cite the study being referred to.</p><p>12. We ask the authors to discuss why GDOWN1 apparently interacts with so many transcriptional regulators in the cytoplasm. Is GDOWN1 regulating these factors by interacting with them in the cytoplasm?</p><p>13. The Alphafold structure in supplement figure 4 – 1A is difficult to see. Can the authors increase clarity by changing to a white background and focusing more on the regions they are showing? Please also add the same cartoon that is used throughout the paper to further help clarifications.</p><p>14. The authors should also carefully check their manuscript for missing prepositions etc.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.79116.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors should pay specific attention to the following points.</p><p>1).

The Reviewers concerned about the interacting specificity between GDOWN1 mutants and NELF-E. We agree this part of data is not very easy to be fully understood. GDOWN1 was reported to be directly interacting to multiple components of Pol II (Hu et al., 2006; Jishage et al., 2018). We also found GDOWN1 played an important role in the cytoplasmic assembly of Pol II (our unpublished data), which led us hypothesize that the GDOWN1 (both the full length and the truncated mutants) &amp; NELF-E interactions seen in our BiFC assays were possibly mediated by other factors such as the Pol II components. The binding specificity of our BiFC results have been well proven. Quite a lot of factors were screened in our BiFC assays and some of them did show negative results. To further strengthen the specificity, we added more negative controls in Figure 1—figure supplement 1D. This new collection of negative controls includes three cytoplasmic proteins, VDAC1 (a mitochondrial protein), GALNT2 (a Golgi protein) and PDIA3 (an endoplasmic reticulum protein). These results, together with the two nuclear factors previously shown in Figure 1D (MED1 and MED26), emphasize that GDOWN1 only interacts to its real binding partners.</p><p>We prefer to keep the BiFC data in the manuscript since it is beneficial of using BiFC assays to identify key localization-controlling motifs. The detailed reasons are listed as followed:</p><p>1) BiFC assays have the advantages of directly exhibiting the interactions between GDOWN1 and its potential binding partners in live cells. Originally, we employed these assays as a quick way to verify the interaction of GDOWN1 to Pol II components, and meanwhile to test our hypothesis that GDOWN1 might physically interact to transcription elongation factors due to their functional coordination (Cheng et al., 2012). Indeed, the BiFC results indicated very strong signals between GDOWN1 and DSIF (SPT4 and SPT5) or NELF (NELF-E and NELF-A etc.). However, these interactions were unexpectedly present in the cytoplasm. As shown in Figure 1E, the BiFC signals of SPT4•SPT5 interaction, and NELF-E•NELF-A interaction were both present in the nucleus as expected. These results actually fit quite well with the fact that GDOWN1 is primarily present in the cytoplasm. Under the BiFC conditions, a portion of the overexpressed nuclear factors are present in the cytoplasm, so that their interactions to the cytoplasmic GDOWN1 become well captured, while these interactions are typically occurring only in the nucleus upon the appearance of GDOWN1.</p><p>2) BiFC system has the advantage to stably capture GDOWN1’s binding partner(s). The irreversibility of BiFC has been considered as its drawback in many circumstances, while in our case, it was actually turned it into an advantage for efficiently identifying any possible and even transient interactions between GDOWN1 and other factors. Our BiFC results well supported the data from our immunofluorescence and cell fractionation assays about GDOWN1’s subcellular localization on its own. In addition, they were able to capture protein/protein interactions between GDOWN1 and other factors, even when they only occurred transiently.</p><p>3) BiFC system provides better efficiency and contrast in mutant screening for the key localization motifs of GDOWN1. We observed that when being transiently transfected into the cells, BiFC signals could be well detectable very rapidly (as early as 6 hours post transfection), comparing to expressing GDOWN1 tagged with a fluorescent protein (more than 12 hours). Thus, it allowed us to acquire the data at an early time point, which was especially useful when testing the mutants with a potential of triggering cell death. In addition, since GDOWN1 by itself does not contain any strong NLS, its truncation mutants do NOT enter the nucleus actively even when its cytoplasmic retention signal is chopped off. To overcome this potential problem, we employed NELF-E as a potent nuclear partner of GDOWN1 in our BiFC assays to facilitate GDOWN1’s nucleus entry. This difference is clearly demonstrated in Figure 2B, when data from both IF and BiFC are shown side by side. For example, the <italic>m2</italic> mutant was uniformly localized in both cytoplasm and nucleus in the IF result, while it was strictly present in the nucleus in the BiFC result. Similar examples also include Figure 4D and Figure 4—figure supplement 1D. Overall, this better contrast of BiFC data facilitated our mutant screening and simplified our statistical analyses.</p><p>The functional efficiency of those regulatory motifs identified by BiFC assays was further confirmed by a battery of tests including IF assays and direct detections of the mutants via monitoring the fused fluorescent tags. Taken together, we believe that the main conclusions from these BiFC results in the manuscript are solid.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2).

We think the visualization difficulty for Figure 3D is mainly due to the brightness, not the magnification. The actual intensity of BiFC signals were variable across samples. The main point here is to demonstrate the interactions between GDOWN1 and some representative nuclear pore components, and compare their distinct subcellular localizations qualitatively. Thus, for better demonstration, we adjusted the brightness of the images to make the differences of their subcellular localization easier to be visualized.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2).

This is rather surprising as given that Drosophila is more distantly related than zebrafish, but may reflect the fact that Drosophila CAS motif seems better conserved. Can the authors comment on this? Quantification analyses of the images would strengthen the results.</p></disp-quote><p>This is an interesting point! In this study, we identified that the three arginines as a whole in the CAS motif were very important for the cytoplasmic retention of human GDOWN1. However, we did not further narrow it down to dissect the contribution of each individual R. From our data, it appeared that fly CAS played a very similar localization-regulatory role to its human counterpart. We followed the Reviewing editor’s suggestion to quantify these images and provided the data in Figure 4─figure supplement 1C. The quantitative data were consistent with the images that the <italic>Drosophila</italic> CAS mutant was indeed accumulated more in the nucleus than the zebrafish mutant upon LMB treatment.</p><p>Our experiments of ectopically expressing either fly or fish Gdown1 in human cells mainly tested the conservation of CAS motifs qualitatively but not quantitatively.

In Figure 5B, rather than simply using DAPI in the flow cytometry, can the authors use activated caspase 3 or Annexin V to look for apoptosis? Is apoptosis the mechanism of cell death?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this very valuable suggestion! We have been very interested in the type and the mechanism of cell death upon the nuclear accumulation of GDOWN1 as well. Previously, we transiently transfected a GDOWN1 truncation mutant and observed severe cell death within a few hours upon its nuclear accumulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1A</xref>). These cells were rapidly dying with the appearance of apoptotic-like bodies. Recently, we carried out Flow cytometry experiments using Annexin-V to check any possible signs of early-stage apoptosis. Two cell lines shown in Figure 5B, iGDOWN1(WT)-Venus expressing in the cytoplasm and iNLS-GDOWN1(<italic>10M</italic>) expressing in the nucleus, were compared in parallel. The two cell lines were incubated with Dox for 3 days to induce the expression of the GDOWN1 proteins and then subjected to Flow cytometry analyses. As seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1B</xref>, the cells expressing GDOWN1-Venus did not show much Annexin-V<sup>+</sup> signals (1.49% in Quadrant 4), while the cell expressing NLS-GDOWN1(<italic>10M</italic>) indeed showed increased Annexin-V<sup>+</sup> signals (8.83%). Due to some loss of dead cells during the cell harvest process, the ratio of Annexin-V<sup>+</sup> cells might be underestimated. These data suggest that the nuclear GDOWN1 may cause apoptosis to some extent.</p><fig id="sa2fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>The nuclear accumulation of GDOWN1 may trigger apoptosis.</title><p>(A) Transient transfection of a human GDOWN1 truncation mutant resulted in cell death within hours post LMB-induced nuclear translocation of GDOWN1.

This cell population actually experienced a constant and slow process of cell death, indicating that some other unknown cell-death mechanisms were also existing along with apoptosis.

In Figure 6B there seems to be a perinuclear staining on the iNLS-GDOWN in the bottom right Venus panel. Can the authors comment on this?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for pointing this out! We think this observation was consistent to the rest of the findings in this manuscript quite well and happened exactly as we expected! The massive accumulation of the perinuclear signal of NLS-GDOWN1 was contributed by the combinatory effects of two layers of actions. One was the intrinsic nature of cytoplasmic retention determined by GDOWN1’s CAS motif, the other was the artificial driving force for its accumulation in the nucleus enforced by NLS. Apparently, NLS lost this game, as indicated by the enhanced retention of GDOWN1 at the entrance of the nucleus. Overall, this observation emphasized the unusually potent capability of GDOWN1’s retention in the cytoplasm.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5). Many of the experiments in this study are performed with stable or inducible ectopic expression. It is difficult to assess the expression level of the exogenous proteins versus the endogenous by the immunofluorescence. In the supplemental data, the authors performed immunoblots that often showed the exogenous proteins to be expressed at much higher levels that endogenous. To some extent, this reinforces some of the conclusions when the overexpressed mutants remain cytoplasmic as it indicates the robustness of the retention mechanism. However, the authors should mention the potential caveats that overexpression may introduce.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this valuable suggestion! In this revised manuscript, we provided immunoblots to directly compare the expression levels of the ectopically expressed GDOWN1 to their endogenous counterpart (shown in Figure 5─figure supplement 1A) and the result is briefly mentioned in the <italic>RESULTS</italic> session of the manuscript. As seen in this figure, this experimental system often resulted in overexpression of the exogenous protein(s) of interest, as the Reviewing Editor concerned. Theoretically, this might generate non-objective observations and conclusions. Luckily, in our case, the three stable cell lines with GDOWN1 overexpressed (~5 fold or more comparing to the endogenous GDOWN1) did not cause much cell death or other cell growth defects, while the one that triggered severe cell death (iNLS-GDOWN1-<italic>10M</italic>) only expressed the exogenous protein at a level comparable to the endogenous. Thus, the general concerns and the potential caveats about studying overexpressed exogenous proteins did not apply here so that the basic observation and the conclusions would not be interfered much. Overall, we believe that our conclusions stated in the manuscript are objective and solid.

The three mutants (<italic>m1-m3</italic>) used in Figure 2 are labeled and as can be seen in this figure, the two positions selected to split GDOWN1 (amino acids 110 and 250) are both located within the coiled region, which we believe to have minimal impact on the overall structure of GDOWN1.

We agree that more evidence is required in order to draw this conclusion. Our data indicated that the functions of NES2 and CAS are interconnected.

Therefore, we reword the statement here. ‘The above data from the intrinsic motif analyses demonstrate that each one of the two NES motifs of GDOWN1 acts as an independent CRM1-regulated element and the function of CAS motif depends partially on the existence of NES2.’</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>P. 17, first paragraph: Do the authors have any sense for the relative levels of the 10M and NLS<sup>-1</sup>0M versions of Gdown1, post dox exposure, as compared to the endogenous Gdown1?</p></disp-quote><p>To address reviewer’s concern about the expression levels across the stable cell lines used on Figure 5, we add the immunoblots of these cell lines in Figure 5─figure supplement 1A, showing the expression levels of both endogenous and exogenous GDOWN1 in the presence or absence of Dox induction. As seen in this figure, the expression levels of the exogenous GDOWN1 are all higher than the endogenous counterpart, ranging from a couple to several folds. When comparing the expressions in each cell line pairs, it can be seen that the level of the GDOWN1(<italic>10M</italic>) is similar to that of wild type GDOWN1, while the level of the NLS-GDOWN1(<italic>10M</italic>) is much less than that of NLS-GDOWN1(WT). However, our results from various experiments shown in Figure 5 clearly and consistently indicated that the equal or less expressions of the 10M mutants achieved more severe defects on global transcription and cellular growth. Therefore, we believe that the drastic defects observed in the cells with the 10M mutants being expressed are mainly attributed to the nuclear accumulation and functions of GDOWN1. It is worth to note that the expression level of NLSGDOWN1(<italic>10M</italic>) is at a level very close to that of the endogenous, which is the lowest among the four cell lines, while it exhibits the most severe defects. Thus, our major findings claimed in the manuscript were not generated due to the excessive expression of exogenous GDOWN1.</p><p>In the revised manuscript, besides adding the above WB data in the supplementary figure, we also pointed out this results in the <italic>RESULTS</italic> session (line 485-486).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 6B and S6: The overall effect of Gdown1 access to the nucleus is clear, but more could have been learned with a quantitative comparison of the relative loss of total Pol II, ser5P and ser2P.

Probing a panel C blot with the appropriate antibodies could have addressed this point.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this good suggestion and we agree that checking the changes of Ser5P and Ser2P would provide more valuable information. We did this experiment and the quality of the WB data was ok. Since the stable cell lines used in these assays were cell pools with the expression levels of the total and the nuclear GDOWN1 varied from cell to cell, checking the total protein levels by WB might underestimate the real expression changes. Please refer to our response to your related question #8 and the Response Figure 2A-B. In addition, we carried out the IF experiments using various antibodies and carefully quantified the results (Figure 6C and Figure 6—figure supplement 1B) and the data indicated that upon the expression of the GDOWN1(<italic>10M</italic>) and NLS- GDOWN1(<italic>10M</italic>) (on day 4 post Dox addition), both Ser5P and Ser2P were reduced upon the expression of the nuclear GDOWN1, suggesting that both transcription initiation and elongation were inhibited. However, the statistical analyses shown in Figure 6—figure supplement 1C (better presented in Response Figure 2C-D) indicated that the S5P signal dropped more severe than the S2P signal, suggesting that the transcriptional initiation was more sensitive to the regulation of GDOWN1. The point was mentioned in both the RESULTS session.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>I could not understand the result in panel 6C. If nuclear export is blocked by LMB, how can most of HeLa Pol II be cytoplasmic after LMB treatment?</p></disp-quote><p>This is an interesting question! Although Pol II is not a target of CRM1 by itself, it has been known that its assembly factors, such as RPAP2 and RPAP4/GPN1 are cargoes of CRM1(Forget et al., 2010; Forget et al., 2013). Upon LMB treatment, these factors will be accumulated in the nucleus and result in the dramatic reduction of Pol II assembly and its cytoplasm retention. This piece of data is now moved to the Figure 6—figure supplement 1A.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Points in the Discussion:</p><p>How is Gdown1 acting in the nucleus? The earlier biochemical work provided a number of possibilities but those aren't investigated here or extensively discussed. Is Gdown1 mostly acting to tie up Pol II so that it cannot make PICs, or is it also/mostly acting downstream of initiation to block elongation? As noted above, determining whether ser5 and ser2 Pol II are affected differently might have shed light on this. Additionally, it would have been useful to know if nuclear Gdown1 is chromatin associated (probably talking to elongation) or free in the nucleoplasm (probably bound to Pol II). The point about effects on elongation seems particularly important when trying to understand how nuclear Gdown1 reduced overall Pol II levels. In particular, if elongation were severely affected polymerases could be stalled for extended periods at difficult-to-traverse locations, provoking the ubiquitination and clearance of those complexes (and thus reducing overall Pol II levels).</p></disp-quote><p>Very good questions and suggestions, thank you! Our original goal was to dissect GDOWN1’s functional mechanisms in regulating transcription in the nucleus. However, the fact that it did not enter the nucleus redirected us to a new route of digging the molecular basis of its cytoplasmic retention. It was exciting to uncover that the native GDOWN1 was translocated into the nucleus upon the oxidative stresses, possibly opening a new avenue of identifying its physiological roles in the cellular adaptation to stresses.</p><p>When being translocated into the nucleus, GDOWN1 triggered the global repression of transcription. The IF signals of the un-phosphorylated Pol II (preferably detected by the Pol II-CTD antibody 8WG16, Abcam, ab817; please also refer to our response to Reviewer 2’s Q8 for some evidence about this antibody’s specificity), and the phosphorylated forms of Pol II on the Ser5 residues (detected by the Pol II-S5P-CTD antibody CTD4H8, Biolegend, 904001) and on Ser2 residues (detected by the Pol II-S2P-CTD antibody, Abcam, ab5095) were all reduced in the cells with the expression of the nuclear GDOWN1 at 4 days after the Dox induction (Figure 6B and Figure 6—figure supplement 1A).</p><p>To confirm these data, we carefully tested the changes of these various forms of Pol II via WB experiments using a series of Pol II antibodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig2">Author response image 2A</xref>). A newly ordered Pol II-NTD antibody (clone D8L4Y, CST) was employed to more accurately detect the total level of Pol II, including the un-phosphorylated and the phosphorylated forms (Figure 6B). As seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig2">Author response image 2A</xref> and the quantified data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig2">Author response image 2B</xref>, the protein levels of the total, the un-phosphorylated, and the S5P form of Pol II all got reduced significantly upon the nuclear accumulation of GDOWN1 (the <italic>10M</italic> mutant VS the wild type), while the change of the S2P-Pol II was relatively small.

More thorough analyses are definitely necessary to dissect the mechanistic details of these processes, and we are working on it to make it clear.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Finally, lines 604-607: The authors assert that EU labeling in nucleoli is drastically reduced upon Gdown1 entry into nuclei, showing that Gdown1 interferes with both Pol I and Pol III activity. There is no quantitation provided for the assertion that nucleolar labeling is reduced, but regardless such reduction would not show a direct effect on Pol I (or Pol III) activity- strong reductions in mRNA synthesis should feed back into reductions in rRNA synthesis.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for helping us find this inaccurate statement in our manuscript. Actually, it was shown in the literature that the transcription rate of Pol II was much higher than Pol I and Pol III (Jackson et al., 2000), and ~80% of the EU labeled transcripts via a short pulse (within one hour) were Pol II products (Nozawa et al., 2017). Therefore, we partially missed the detection about the dynamic changes of Pol I and Pol III transcripts in our 20 min-EU pulse labeling assays, and the major signals and the associated changes shown in our IF results were mainly representing Pol II transcripts. Yes, you are right, the reduction of the nucleolar labeling might be directly or indirectly affected by GDOWN1 and the associated Pol II activity, while we are currently lacking of evidence.

We now reorganized the quantitative data analyses of all the constructs shown in Figure 4A and show them side by side for better comparison (Figure 4B) and the detailed description was added in the <italic>RESULTS</italic> Session. Upon LMB treatment, the N/C ratios of the three GDOWN1 mutants are ordered as mCAS (g) &gt; mNES2 (e) &gt;&gt; mNES1 (c), which indicates that the CRM1-independent cytoplasmic localization of GDOWN1 is mainly determined by CAS, while NES2 also plays a role on this regulation. In the presence of LMB, there is no significant difference between mNES2 (e) and mNES1+2 (f), indicating that NES1 is not involved in regulating GDOWN1’s localization via the CRM1-independent manner. The significantly enhanced N/C ratio of NES1+CAS and NES2+CAS double mutants comparing to the NES single mutants (d to c, b to e) in the presence of LMB further confirms that CAS is the core motif in controlling GDOWN1’s cytoplasmic localization.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5.

We borrowed that piece of data (the supplemental figure 2 in that <italic>JBC</italic>paper) and provided it in Response Figure 4A..

The WB experiments using this antibody were repeated and very similar results were obtained (both sets of data are shown in parallel in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig4">Author response image 4</xref>). To simplify the data for publication, we only provided one set in Figure 6—figure supplement 1A in the revised manuscript.</p><fig id="sa2fig4" position="float"><label>Author response image 4.</label><caption><p>The changes of the level of the un-phosphorylated RPB1 and its nuclear fraction upon the nuclear accumulation of GDOWN1 or the treatment of LMB. A. The target specificity test of the Pol II-CTD antibody, 8WG16. in vitro kinase assays were carried out using the purified P-TEFb as the kinase, and either the purified factors or the HeLa nuclear extract (HNE) as the substrates. The 8WG16 antibody was employed for Pol II detection in the WB experiment. This data was published as the Supplementary Figure 2 in Cheng et al., <italic>JBC</italic>, 2007, 282(30): 21901-21912. B-E. The indicated cell lines were cultured and subjected to cell fractionation and WB analyses. Two independent experiments were performed and the results are shown in B&amp;C, and D&amp;E, respectively. Antibodies used for detection were labeled on the left side. The relative changes of the RPB1 level as a whole and the ratio of its nuclear fraction were shown in the bar graphs on the right. As a very long-life protein, histone H3 was used as the internal control for data normalization.

The original Figure 6C was thus replaced with this new set of data, and became the new Figure 6B in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9. The authors should also provide error bars for Figure S6C.</p></disp-quote><p>Figure S6B in the previously submitted manuscript demonstrated the controls for</p><p>the WB experiment shown in the main Figure 6 to support the effectiveness and purity of our cell fractionation experiment. Both TUBULIN and FBL were used as the reference proteins to represent the cytoplasmic protein and the nuclear protein, respectively, and the purpose of showing these controls was mainly for the qualitative use, but not for the quantitative use. We understand why the Reviewer ask for data quantification here since the level of these controls (especially FBL) apparently reduced quite a lot upon the expression of the nuclear GDOWN1. Because GDOWN1 causes a global transcriptional repression, the effect on the level of each protein actually varies based on the half time of the protein. Therefore, for data quantification, we refer to use histone 3 because histones proteins are the well-known, most stable proteins in cells.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10. As the authors are well aware, Pol II antibodies show sub-optimal specificity. Could the authors provide data from additional Pol II antibodies (e.g., S2P, S5P, RPB3) for Figure S6C?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this good suggestion! We ordered several new Pol II antibodies and provided some new IF and WB data. Please refer our responses to Reviewer 1’s Q8 and to Reviewer 2’s Q8. Overall the results were consistent with our previous data, and the data quantification suggest that the unphospho-Pol II and the S5P-Pol II were more severely and rapidly affected than the S2P-Pol II.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>11.

We cited two corresponding references (Cheng et al., 2012; Jishage et al., 2012).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>12. We ask the authors to discuss why GDOWN1 apparently interacts with so many transcriptional regulators in the cytoplasm. Is GDOWN1 regulating these factors by interacting with them in the cytoplasm?</p></disp-quote><p>Very good point! We checked the subcellular localization of some transcriptional regulators, such as NELF-E etc., and found they were only present in the nucleus. Thus, the BiFC signals about the ‘GDOWN1•transcriptional regulator’ interactions may only represent their interaction potential in the nucleus instead of the actual occurrence in the cytoplasm between their endogenous counterparts. We hypothesize that under the physiological conditions, GDOWN1 may be transiently and unstably interacting to the newly translated transcriptional regulators in the cytoplasm while it does NOT trap them in the cytoplasm or affect their functions. When both factors are overexpressed in cells in our BiFC assays, GDOWN1 is able to trap a fraction of its nuclear partners in the cytoplasm and the transient interaction can be stabilized by BiFC (the BiFC signal is irreversible because of the covalent bonds set up in between the two split parts of a fluorescent protein upon the BiFC interaction occurs). On the other hand, from the mass spectrometry data and some of our GST-pull down or IP data, we confirmed that GDOWN1 interacted to Pol II components and their assembly factors in the cytoplasm. In addition, we observed that in <italic>GDOWN1 KO</italic> cells, the nuclear/cytoplasmic ratio of RPB1 decreased (data not shown). Therefore, GDOWN1 may contribute to the assembly and also the nuclear import of Pol II. More thorough analyses are needed to dissect its roles in these processes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>13. The Alphafold structure in supplement figure 4 – 1A is difficult to see.
