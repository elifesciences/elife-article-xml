We investigated whether interaural time difference (ITD) statistics inherent in natural acoustic scenes are parameters determining spatial discriminability. The natural ITD rate of change across azimuth (ITDrc) and ITD variability over time (ITDv) were combined in a Fisher information statistic to assess the amount of azimuthal information conveyed by this sensory cue. We hypothesized that natural ITD statistics underlie the neural code for ITD and thus influence spatial perception. To test this hypothesis, sounds with invariant statistics were presented to measure human spatial discriminability and spatial novelty detection. Human auditory spatial perception showed correlation with natural ITD statistics, supporting our hypothesis. Further analysis showed that these results are consistent with classic models of ITD coding and can explain the ITD tuning distribution observed in the mammalian brainstem.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>When a person hears a sound, how do they work out where it is coming from? A sound coming from your right will reach your right ear a few fractions of a millisecond earlier than your left. The brain uses this difference, known as the interaural time difference or ITD, to locate the sound.</p><p>But humans are also much better at localizing sounds that come from sources in front of them than from sources by their sides. This may be due in part to differences in the number of neurons available to detect sounds from these different locations. It may also reflect differences in the rates at which those neurons fire in response to sounds. But these factors alone cannot explain why humans are so much better at localizing sounds in front of them.</p><p>Pavão et al. showed that the brain has evolved the ability to detect natural patterns that exist in sounds as a result of their location, and to use those patterns to optimize the spatial perception of sounds. Pavão et al. showed that the way in which the head and inner ear filter incoming sounds has two consequences for how we perceive them. Firstly, the change in ITD for sounds coming from different sources in front of a person is greater than for sounds coming from their sides. And secondly, the ITD for sounds that originate in front of a person varies more over time than the ITD for sounds coming from the periphery. By playing sounds to healthy volunteers while removing these differences, Pavão et al. found that natural ITD statistics were correlated with a person’s ability to tell where a sound was coming from.</p><p>By revealing the features the brain uses to determine the location of sounds, the work of Pavão et al. could ultimately lead to the development of more effective hearing aids. The results also provide clues to how other senses, including vision, may have evolved to respond optimally to the environment.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>binaural cues</kwd><kwd>HRTF</kwd><kwd>cochlear filtering</kwd><kwd>sensory reliability</kwd><kwd>MMN</kwd><kwd>predictive coding</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NS104911</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Peña</surname><given-names>José L</given-names></name><name><surname>Fischer</surname><given-names>Brian J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000055</institution-id><institution>National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DC004263</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sussman</surname><given-names>Elyse S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000055</institution-id><institution>National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DC007690</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Peña</surname><given-names>José L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Human brain has incorporated natural statistics of spatial cues to the neural code supporting perception of sound location.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Humans and other species localize sound sources in the horizontal plane using sub-millisecond interaural time difference (ITD) between signals arriving at the two ears (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Middlebrooks and Green, 1991</xref>).

In addition, because the brain computes ITD in narrow frequency bands, the interaction of nearby frequencies within a given cochlear filter may also be a source of ITD variability over time (ITDv). Sensory variability is known to be fundamental in change detection. It has been shown that stimulus discrimination depends not only on the mean difference between stimuli but also on the variability of the sensory evidence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Green and Swets, 1966</xref>).</p><p>This study tested the hypothesis that the natural ITD statistics are encoded by the brain, determining ITD perception. Using human HRTF databases and models of cochlear filters, we estimated ITD rate of change and ITDv, and tested whether these statistics combined in a Fisher information metric predicted spatial discrimination thresholds and deviance detection better than ITD rate of change alone. We presented sounds through insert earphones, removing ITD statistics, to determine whether sound location discriminability and spatial deviance detection were predicted by natural ITD statistics independently from the actual stimulus properties. We found that natural ITD statistics were correlated with auditory spatial discriminability and spatial deviance detection. Analysis of classic models of ITD coding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Stern and Colburn, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Harper and McAlpine, 2004</xref>) support the idea that ITD statistics influence the density distribution of ITD tuning, which may be genetically encoded and conserved across human subjects.

The ITD statistics were estimated using the same method described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, by convolving each of these signals with impulse responses from the left and right ears, then filtering using parameters analogous to human cochlear at 500 Hz center frequency. This procedure was applied across all other locations and subjects in the reported dataset. Note that ITDrc is similar for the three signals, indicating no significant effect of frequency interference on this statistic. However, while ITDv is near zero across azimuth locations for 500 Hz alone (yellow) and 500 + 723 Hz (blue), it increases from front to periphery when neighboring frequencies within a single cochlear filter are combined (500 + 523 Hz; red).

Consistently, the correlation between ITDrc and ITDv was not strong (r<sub>Spearman</sub> = −0.41). These ITD statistics were consistent across broadband signals with different frequency spectra (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Additionally, we tested the consistency of ITD statistics across environments, comparing statistics estimated from HRTFs recorded in anechoic and reverberant rooms (database available in <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://medi.uni-oldenburg.de/hrir">http://medi.uni-oldenburg.de/hrir</ext-link>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kayser et al., 2009</xref>).

Accordingly, ITD statistics estimated in anechoic and reverberant environments were similar when signal transients were considered (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Finally, the estimated ITDv was equivalent to the variability over trials (obtained from one instantaneous sample of 200 different broadband signals; r<sub>Spearman</sub> = 0.99), indicating that ITDv exhibits ergodicity.

These results are consistent with the hypothesis that selectivity for √FI<sub>ITD</sub> statistic (which combines ITDv and ITDrc) may underlie the evolution of the neural code supporting discrimination thresholds.</p><p>Additionally in the current study, to test ITD-change discrimination thresholds and evaluate prediction accuracy of ITD statistics we presented sounds through earphones instead of free-field stimulation. This avoids potential effects of ongoing ITD statistics and the influence of other sound localization cues. The 24 normal-hearing adults that participated in the testing were instructed to detect a change in ITD within a pair of tonal sounds (Methods), which allowed us to obtain dichotic dITD thresholds across reference ITD and frequency, for the range of interest (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C-left</xref>). The dichotic dITD thresholds averaged across subjects correlated with free-field thresholds reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Mills, 1958</xref> (r<sub>Spearman</sub> = 0.64). However, dITD thresholds were higher in the present study compared to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Mills, 1958</xref>; other studies also using dichotic stimuli reported higher dITD thresholds (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brughera et al., 2013</xref>) than <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Mills, 1958</xref>. This may be due to approach differences, such as presentation of sounds through earphones vs. free-field stimulation and testing untrained subjects in the present study rather than highly trained individuals as was done in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Mills, 1958</xref>. Using free-field stimulation leaves open the possibility that listeners rely on cues other than ITD to detect sound location in azimuth, which may have lowered the thresholds as found in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Mills, 1958</xref>. Additionally, training in ITD detection may have an effect on threshold levels compared to normal untrained individuals.</p><p>We computed the average dichotic dITD thresholds across participants and quantified the Spearman correlation between them and ITD statistics estimated in our study. When all frequency conditions were analyzed, average dichotic dITD thresholds showed moderate correlation with ITDrc (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C-middle</xref>) and √FI<sub>ITD</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C-right</xref>). This was particularly influenced by low correlation for dITD thresholds for 250 Hz tones. Higher thresholds for this frequency have previously been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brughera et al., 2013</xref>). Exclusion of this frequency substantially improved √FI<sub>ITD</sub>’s prediction accuracy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C-right</xref>), suggesting that dITD thresholds at 250 Hz may be determined by additional parameters not addressed by the ITD statistics investigated in our study. Comparing the prediction accuracy of these statistics using linear mixed-effects models (Materials and methods) resulted in the same outcome as the Spearman correlation analysis. This provides further support for the hypothesis that both ITDrc and ITDv statistics, combined in √FI<sub>ITD</sub>, influence the ITD neural code underlying discrimination thresholds.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Neural code underlying deviance detection is adapted to ITD statistics</title><p>A further investigation to support the idea that ITD statistics are correlated with auditory spatial perception was conducted by testing the ability to detect spatial deviants from a standard sound location in space.

Although properties of the neural mechanisms underlying human and owl sound localization differ in frequency range and putative ITD coding schemes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Schnupp and Carr, 2009</xref>), studies in both species support the concept that natural ITD statistics guide ITD processing.</p><p>This study specifically investigated whether ITDrc and ITDv, inherent in natural acoustic scenes, are relevant parameters determining ITD discriminability. We tested this hypothesis using discrimination thresholds obtained through free-field (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Mills, 1958</xref>) and dichotic stimulation protocols that disabled natural ITDrc and ITDv statistics. We found that the integration of these ITD statistics based on Fisher information (√FI<sub>ITD</sub>) was the best predictor of discrimination thresholds of spatial changes across frequency and location. This suggests that the neural code is adapted to the combination of ITDrc and ITDv statistics. However, the higher dichotic dITD thresholds for 250 Hz tonal stimuli (also reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brughera et al., 2013</xref>) constituted an outlier, indicating limited predictive power of ITD discriminability at this particular frequency by the ITD statistics investigated in this study. Although additional factors may determine discriminability in lower frequencies, our results overall are consistent with the notion that natural √FI<sub>ITD</sub> statistics can modulate the neural code underlying human sound localization.</p><p>We also implemented an MMN paradigm to obtain converging evidence that natural ITD statistics influence spatial perception. Although both ITD-change detection thresholds and the MMN novelty detection paradigms required discriminating a change in ITD, novelty detection also involves identification of a repetitive (standard) pattern. Furthermore, the combination of ITDrc and ITDv (√FI<sub>ITD</sub>) was a better predictor of the deviance detection response, the MMN component, than ITDrc alone, which is also consistent with results of psychophysical discriminability thresholds.</p><p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Parras et al., 2017</xref> developed an approach designed to isolate the relative contribution of prediction errors and repetition suppression in novelty detection. In the present study, natural ITD statistics might have modulated novelty detection at both levels. However, the model that best described the MMN signals in the current study relied mostly on the ITD statistics of the standard stimulus for weighting the difference between the ITDs of standard and deviants stimuli primarily by the ITD statistics of the standards. Other factors with potential influence on detecting ITD changes in a reference location are attention and training. The novelty detection protocol controlled for these factors because the MMN indexes a brain response to detected deviations irrespective of attention or training. Our finding that prediction of novelty detection signals was based primarily on the ITD statistics of the standard stimulus is consistent with the interpretation that natural ITD statistics are critical for pattern detection. Our results indicate that when the standard stimulus is in a location of higher statistical discriminability, a ‘stronger’ standard is built, which makes deviance detection easier. We speculate that the different weights for standards and deviants are the result of the mechanism underlying the building up of a standard, which requires repetitive stimulation.</p><p>Finally, our results support classic neural models of ITD coding. The compatibility of ITD statistics with classic neural models of ITD coding suggest that ITD statistics provide a potential mechanism influencing the density distribution of ITD tuning. The critical parameter of the density distribution of fiber pairs encoding interaural delays that the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Stern and Colburn, 1978</xref> model relied on to explain ITD discriminability was correlated with our ITD statistics. Thus, this model prediction matches the experimental data. Additionally, the coding scheme of the model proposed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Harper and McAlpine, 2004</xref> is a plausible framework for our results, in which ITD discriminability is predicted by the neural population Fisher information. When the neural population Fisher information was modeled to match the ITD Fisher information, the predicted distribution of ITD tuning resembled experimental observations in brainstem of mammalian species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">McAlpine et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Harper and McAlpine, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hancock and Delgutte, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Pecka et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>In sum, we found evidence that natural ITD statistics are correlated with auditory spatial perception, supporting the idea that these statistics may determine the density distribution of ITD tuning in the auditory system and influence auditory spatial perception. The consistency across subjects indicates that this information may be genetically encoded and conserved, and serve as a potentially adaptive evolutionary mechanism for approaching optimal performance. Such a mechanism would be useful where larger ITD changes are required for detecting shifts in location for regions of space and frequency levels at which ITD discriminability is naturally weaker. These results have clinical implications in identifying stimulus parameters that are relevant to spatial discrimination and novelty detection that may lead to the development of more efficient hearing-aid devices.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>HRTF measurement</title><p>The dataset used in this study consisted of head-related impulse responses collected at the Institute for Research and Coordination in Acoustics/Music (IRCAM) from 2002 to 2003, available to the public at the LISTEN HRTF website <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://recherche.ircam.fr/equipes/salles/listen">http://recherche.ircam.fr/equipes/salles/listen</ext-link>.

Data collection for this study was performed inside an anechoic room with a movable speaker, which delivered tones of different frequencies. The three participants were blindfolded and had their heads fixed by a clamp mounted on the chair on which they were sitting. In each trial, a 1 s duration ‘reference azimuth’ tone was played first, and 1 s after, the same signal played again after the speaker was moved slightly to the left or to the right. Subjects reported the left or right change using an interface box. Psychometric functions were obtained plotting the proportion of judgments to the left and to the right against the angle between reference and test locations. The azimuth changes leading to 75% responses to the right and to the left were estimated by linear interpolation. The threshold angle for discriminating a change was estimated by dividing the distance between these values by 2.</p><p>To convert azimuth to ITD, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Mills, 1958</xref> used binaural microphones placed inside a dummy-head ears.

Threshold dIPD was converted to threshold dITD (using the same equation described in the HRTF analysis section).</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Estimation of spatial ITD discriminability thresholds</title><p>A test was designed to estimate detection thresholds of changes in stimulus ITD (dITD) across specific frequencies of interest for this study. Healthy adult subjects were included in the sample (N = 24; 12 females and 12 males; mean age 28.0 ± 8.6; five left-handed and 19 right-handed; 19 from São Paulo and five from New York). After the procedure was described to the subjects, they provided written informed consent. The protocol was approved by the Ethics Committee of Universidade Federal do ABC and by the Internal Review Board of the Albert Einstein College of Medicine, where the study was conducted. There were no distinct groups in the experiment. All subjects had no reported history of neurological disorders or hearing impairments.</p><p>Pilot measurements of dITD thresholds were initially conducted in 10 subjects, using the same combination of frequencies and ITDs across subjects. This pilot experiment, which lasted approximately 150 min, was performed in up to five sessions per subject. Results from these measurements already showed that the ratio between ITDrc and ITDv leads to good prediction for frequencies above 250 Hz. Based on feedback from subjects undergoing pilot measurements, a shorter protocol lasting about 60 min was designed, which was conducted in 24 subjects, leading to the reported dITD thresholds results.</p><p>In this computer-based test, subjects were presented with 65 dB (A scale) tones within a range of frequencies through headphones calibrated with an Instrutherm DEC-460 decibel meter or a B&amp;K 4947 microphone with an artificial ear. Trials started by pressing the spacebar key. In each trial, two binaural tones were presented in sequence. The ITD of both sounds started at the same value (reference ITD) and changed by different amounts (dITD) in the second half of either the first or the second sound in the sequence. Subjects were instructed to press the keys ‘1’ or ‘2’ depending on which sound in the pair they perceived a shift in location, and press a given key twice if confident, or alternate both (1 and 2) keys if unable to perceive a shift or unsure about it. Trials could be repeated as many times as needed by pressing the spacebar key. Feedback sounds indicated whether each of the pressed keys was correct or wrong.</p><p>The range of reference ITDs spanned from frontal (0 µs) to peripheral locations within the unambiguous range of ITD for each frequency. ITD change (dITD) varied from 1 µs to 200 µs towards the periphery to cover a range from unequivocally detectable and undetectable changes for each frequency. The direction of dITDs relative to the reference ITD was always away from the front, to avoid direction dependent biases affecting threshold measurements. Each condition (a given combination of frequency and reference ITD) was presented 29 times: four training trials with dITD 200 µs which were not computed and 25 testing trials which were used for estimating the dITD threshold. An initial training block used 750 Hz tones and −50 µs reference ITD for all subjects and was not included in the analysis. The following 20 blocks presented tones of frequencies 250, 500, 750, 1000 or 1250 Hz, and reference ITDs from −500 to 0 varied in steps of 100 µs. Reference IPDs of absolute values smaller than π/2 radians were included, to avoid phase ambiguity. The sequence of conditions was randomly varied across subjects.</p><p>Ongoing estimation of dITD thresholds was conducted from trial 1 of each block, to optimize the test estimate. A psychometric sigmoid curve was progressively fit to a plot of correct responses (assigned 1) and incorrect or unsure responses (assigned 0) as a function of dITD; the dITD corresponding to 0.5 accuracy was selected as the estimated dITD threshold. Preliminary dITD thresholds were computed from subsets of trials within varying dITD ranges. The first six trials ranged from dITDs 10 to 190 µs, spaced by 36 µs. From these trials, a first preliminary dITD threshold was estimated. In the following six trials, dITD was varied from −50 to 50 µs in steps of 20 µs, centered on the first preliminary dITD threshold; by the end of trial 12 a second preliminary dITD threshold was estimated using trials 1 to 12 using the same sigmoid fitting procedure. A third preliminary dITD threshold was then estimated using trials 1–18. The final seven trials ranged from −21 to 21 µs spaced by 7 µs, centered on the third preliminary dITD threshold. When a set of dITDs centered on a preliminary dITD threshold extended beyond the 1 to 200 µs range, dITDs were adjusted to fall within this range. While this procedure permitted an efficient estimate of dITD thresholds, it did not yield plausible dITD threshold estimates in cases where subjects provided largely random responses across dITDs. To address this limitation, a nonparametric receiver operating characteristic (ROC) classifier was conducted offline to independently verify the validity of estimated dITD thresholds.</p><p>For estimating threshold dITDs, an ROC classifier was computed over the 25 trials of each condition for each subject. The threshold was estimated by averaging the subset of possible thresholds within the 1 to 200 µs range that jointly maximized the number of correct (hit) responses and minimized false positive (type II error) ones. This optimization was obtained by selecting candidate dITD thresholds within a minimum euclidean distance from the perfect discrimination (i.e. 100% hit rate and 0% type II error rate) yielded by the ROC analysis. The ROC classifier was robust enough to estimate consistent dITD thresholds to all conditions from all subjects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C-left</xref>). The threshold within 1–200 µs range estimated by the sigmoid fitting method were significantly correlated with those estimated by the ROC classifier (r<sub>Pearson</sub> = 0.85).</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Prediction of spatial discriminability thresholds by ITD statistics</title><p>An initial analysis of the ranked (Spearman’s) correlation coefficients was performed for the relationship between the threshold dITD averaged across subjects and the ITD statistics of the reference ITD (middle and right plots of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Spearman’s correlations, which were computed from averages of dITD thresholds over subjects across multiple conditions (<italic>N</italic> number of combinations of reference ITD and frequency), were used to assess the monotonicity of this relationship. Since the <italic>N</italic> in this analysis reflects the number of conditions, not the number of subjects, the standard statistical power analysis does not apply. Accordingly, p-values were not computed for this correlation analysis.</p><p>Additional analysis for the selection of dITD thresholds’ best predictors was performed using linear mixed-effect models (LMM; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Magezi, 2015</xref>), classifying ITD statistics across stimulus conditions as ‘fixed factor’ and participants as ‘random factor’. LMM analysis assumes linearity between measures and predictors, then we inspected whether the relationship between dITD thresholds and each of the predictors was linear. Although relationships were mostly linear, some were best fitted by a power function. In these cases, we applied the standard method for achieving linearity by log-transforming both predictors and dITD thresholds. Linear regressions of the relationship between the multiple log-transformed dITD thresholds collected from each subject and log-transformed ITD statistics were performed, and Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) computed. The AIC analysis was used to compare the performance of each model, relying on both the number of model parameters and sample size (i.e. number of subjects) as a metric of goodness of fit; the lowest AIC corresponds to the best model. Since AIC is a relative quantity (i.e. the actual value brings no information alone), we normalized the AIC values by subtracting the minimum AIC observed for that behavioral measure (dAIC), which corresponds to the information loss compared to the best available model. Models with dAIC between 0 and 2 were considered equally good in their prediction capacity. Sample sizes were made several times higher than the number of parameters of our models to ensure samples were sufficiently large.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Collection and analysis of the mismatch negativity (MMN) component</title><p>Healthy adult participants were included in the sample (N = 33, 16 females; 17 males; mean age 29.5 ± 4.8; all right-handed). After the procedure was described to the subjects, they provided written informed consent. The protocol was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the Albert Einstein College of Medicine, where the study was conducted. All subjects had no reported history of neurological disorders and passed a bilateral hearing screening (20 dB HL or better at 500, 1000, 2000, and 4000 Hz).</p><p>A statistical power analysis for the MMN component using a stringent minimum MMN amplitude of −0.5 µV (SD 0.7 µV) revealed substantial power (1-β=0.87) with an alpha level of 0.05 in 30 adult subjects. We performed the first set of conditions (1–10) in 17 subjects and found that adjusting the difference between ITD of standard and deviant by a weighted average of the ratio between ITDrc and ITDv of the stimuli ITD; 16 additional subjects were recruited for a second set of conditions (11–20), replicating the initial findings. No significant difference was found between groups and therefore the analysis reported in the manuscript was performed on the pooled data of all 33 participants. Participants were seated inside a sound-attenuated booth (IAC Acoustics, Bronx, NY) in front of a TV screen where a subtitled muted movie was presented. Sound was delivered by a Neuroscan StimAudio system through insert earphones (3M Eartone 3A) calibrated to 53 dB (A-weighted) using a B and K 4947 microphone with an artificial ear. Sound signals were 50 ms duration tones (25 ms rise-fall time) of different frequencies and ITDs synthesized with MATLAB software.</p><p>Participants listened to oddball sequences presenting repetitive (‘standard’) tones embedded with sporadic (‘deviant’, 15% of the trials) tones with a 300 ms inter-stimulus interval (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A-left</xref>). Each subject was presented with 10 conditions, which differed in frequency and ITD. Subjects 1 to 17 performed the following conditions (‘ITD standard’ vs. ‘ITD deviant’ at ‘tone frequency’): (1) −590 vs. −295 µs at 400 Hz; (2) −295 vs. 0 µs at 400 Hz; (3) 0 vs. −295 µs at 400 Hz; (4) −295 vs. 295 µs at 400 Hz; (5) 295 vs. −295 µs at 400 Hz; (6) −295 vs. 590 µs at 400 Hz; (7) 590 vs. −295 µs at 400 Hz; (8) −590 vs. −295 µs at 600 Hz; (9) −295 vs. 0 µs at 600 Hz; and (10) 0 vs. −295 µs at 600 Hz. Subjects 18 to 33 performed the conditions (11) 0 vs. −499 µs at 400 Hz; (12) −499 vs. 0 µs at 400 Hz; (13) 0 vs. −159 µs at 400 Hz; (14) −159 vs. 0 µs at 400 Hz; (15) 0 vs. −499 µs at 550 Hz; (16) −499 vs. 0 µs at 550 Hz; (17) 0 vs. −499 µs at 650 Hz; (18) −499 vs. 0 µs at 650 Hz; (19) 0 vs. −159 µs at 650 Hz; and (20) −159 vs. 0 µs at 650 Hz. Each condition was presented in 3 blocks of 474 trials; the block order was randomized for each subject. Each of the conditions was presented three times during the experimental session; the order of blocks was randomized for each subject. The first trials of each block (18 standards + one deviant) were used for training and not included in the analysis. Results reported included the following trials (385 standards and 70 deviants) for each subject. MMN values for each condition were estimated by subtracting mean ERP signals of 210 deviant trials by the mean of 1155 standard trials; after removal of trials with artifacts (see below). Sessions lasted approximately 2.5 hr, including placement of electrode caps and breaks during the EEG recording.</p><p>EEG was recorded with Neuroscan SynAmps and a 32-channel electrode cap following the modified international 10–20 System, including electrodes on the nose (reference), P09 (ground) and left and right mastoids (LM and RM, used for offline analysis). A bipolar configuration was used between an external electrode below the left eye and the FP1-electrode position for measuring vertical electro-oculogram (EOG). The signal was recorded at 500 Hz sampling rate using a band-pass from 0.05 to 100 Hz. Impedances were maintained below 5 kOhms.</p><p>To measure the MMN, EEG signals from each subject were processed as follows: (1) 20 Hz low-pass filtering; (2) pooling (by concatenating) all EEG signals obtained during sound stimulation; (3) removal of eye-blink and saccade artifacts by performing Independent Component Analysis and reconstructing the signal without components correlated to the EOG; (4) selection of 600-millisecond epochs around sound presentation (−100 to 500 ms from sound onset); (5) removal of linear portions of EEG signals and exclusion of trials containing voltage deflections larger than 75 mV; (6) re-reference of the EEG recordings to the mastoid recordings by subtracting the average mastoid signal from the other channels; (7) ERP measurement, averaging separately signals evoked by standard and deviant trials (the first 19 trials were used for subject training and excluded from the analysis); (8) subtraction of standard from the deviant ERPs to compute the MMN; (9) identification of time bin containing the MMN peak in signals from the FZ channel (frontal EEG electrode, in the middle of the forehead) averaged across subjects, for each condition; (10) measurement of MMN peak for each subject and condition within this time bin.</p><p>Grand-averages of ERPs recorded at FZ electrodes were computed for standard and deviant trials across all subjects and conditions; for estimating the MMN topography, the signal from each electrode in the time bin of the peak MMN was averaged across subjects and conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A-right</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Prediction of MMN by ITD statistics</title><p>An initial analysis of the ranked (Spearman) correlation coefficients was performed for the relationship between the MMN peak amplitude averaged across subjects and the absolute ITD difference between standard and deviant stimuli, multiplied by the weighted sum of ITD statistics estimated for both standard and deviant stimuli (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C-left</xref>). Additional LMM analysis (described in “Prediction of spatial discriminability thresholds by ITD statistics'' section) was used to compare performance across predictors of MMN peak amplitude. LMM analysis was conducted on MMN peak as the dependent variable, absolute ITD difference multiplied by the weighted sum of ITD statistics as ‘fixed’ factor and participant as ‘random’ factor. Since the relationship between MMN data and predictors followed a power function, it was linearized using log transformation in both measures. No outliers were detected or excluded. The AIC method was used for comparing the models (described in “Prediction of spatial discriminability thresholds by ITD statistics'' section).</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Neural models</title><p>Two seminal models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Stern and Colburn, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Harper and McAlpine, 2004</xref>) addressing discriminability of azimuth positions in acoustic space based on ITD were used to examine the potential link between the brain representation of sensory statistics and perceptual functions.</p><p>The relative number of fiber pairs encoding interaural delays, p(τ), used as predictors of ITD discriminability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>), was extracted from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Stern and Colburn, 1978</xref>. To test whether ITD statistics could be represented by this model, the p(τ) parameter was adjusted to match statistics, by normalizing ITD statistics from 0 to 1 and scaling the resulting data to obtain a probability distribution where the sum of all probabilities was equal to 1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>).</p><p>Fisher information from single-neuron IPD-tuning curves and the optimal population distribution of IPD-tuning estimated for humans were extracted from data reported in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Harper and McAlpine, 2004</xref>. The M-shaped Fisher information curve was positioned at the best IPD of each neuron within the distribution, to obtain an estimate of the population Fisher information across IPD and frequency. The neuron population Fisher information across IPD was converted to ITD, obtaining the prediction of ITD discriminability induced by the neuron distribution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). To test whether ITD statistics could be represented by parameters of this model, for each frequency, we generated two midline-mirrored gaussian neural population distributions with random mean IPD tunings and standard deviations from 0 to π, then selected the distribution that displayed the highest Pearson correlation between Fisher information and ITD statistics, then constant were summed and multiplied to the density values in order to to obtain one in slope and intercept of a linear fit. Finally, the density across all frequencies were corrected to generate probability one.</p><p>All data processing was performed in MATLAB (Mathworks) using built-in or custom-made routines.

The authors first establish the presence of subject-invariant interaural time difference (ITD) statistics. After identifying potential physiological mechanisms that would render the neural ITD processing sensitive to these statistics, they then demonstrate the ability of those ITD statistics to predict human discrimination thresholds. Finally, an oddball sequence paradigm and EEG measurements are used to test to what extent ITD statistics processing can be detected in the human brain. The statistical characterization that is presented is compelling and interesting. However, several major concerns were raised that will have to be addressed satisfactorily for the paper to be deemed acceptable for publication. The presentation is opaque, and we had difficulty understanding how the authors computed ITDv. We were also not convinced that the data presented can distinguish whether ITDv and ITDrc simply influence ITD processing or whether the brain anticipates the location-specific invariance of these statistics and exploits them to optimize ITD discrimination.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The title and main conclusion are an overstatement. To justify these statements (anticipation etc), the authors would have to show that &quot;unnatural&quot; ITDv (i.e. scrambled higher-order stats) deteriorate ITD discrimination. Alternatively, the statements should be modified / toned down to more accurately reflect the significance of the findings.</p><p>2) It is not clear how the authors computed either the ITD rate of change with azimuth (ITDrc) or ITD variability (ITDv) (they mention across-frequency interference that changes over time). Perhaps an example and equations in the methods would make this clearer.</p><p>The critical contribution made by this paper is the introduction of ITD_v. The data for ITD_{rc} and ITD_v come from the LISTEN data base measured at IRCAM long ago. This database consists of physical measurements, interaural differences as a function of sound source location in free field for more than 50 individual heads. Unfortunately, it is not clear how ITD_v is determined. It is said to come from a variability in head related transfer functions (HRTFs) over time. But HRTFs do not normally depend on time. HRTFs describe wave filtering from a source in space to some chosen point in the ear. Why should they depend on time? Does ITD_v come from some estimate of the motion of listeners during the action of sound localization? Does it represent variability seen at IRCAM from one experimental session to the next for a given listener? The basis for the calculations presented here is a total mystery.</p><p>The critical variable ITD_v is shown in Figure 1D. There, the variability appears to be small for small ITD values (source near the geometrical midline) and it appears to be large for large ITD values (source out to the side). However, if the temporal variation of ITD is caused by inadvertent listener rotation, then the sensitivity pattern ought to be the opposite of what appears in Figure 1D. This is so because the sensitivity of ITD to azimuth is steepest near the midline and becomes quite flat at large source azimuths.</p><p>3) The manuscript is very hard to follow. The reasoning is obscure, with mathematical operations described in words instead of equations. Thus, the substance of the paper hides within a forest of details. We counted more than 120 figures. This is too many.</p><p>4) The evidence for some of the central claims of the study is either not presented sufficiently clear or tested only indirectly. We understand that the manuscript addresses an important question, and we understand the need to explain many rather complicated physical details and methodological constraints. One reviewer commended the authors for their ability to summarize and explain their data in a manner that is accessible to a broader readership. Nevertheless, the &quot;anticipation of characteristic ITDv / statistics built into the brain&quot; argument is not directly shown by the data that the authors provided (see next point).</p><p>5) We are not convinced that data that are presented can distinguish whether ITDv and ITDrc simply influence ITD processing or whether the brain anticipates the location-specific invariance of these statistics and exploits them to optimize ITD discrimination. I.e. the reported increase in variability at lateralized positions will certainly partially account for deterioration of JNDs (as will the decrease in ITDrc), and a large amount of data in support of this notion is presented.</p><p>Does changing higher-order statistics indeed deteriorate ITD JNDs (or dITD)? The experiment summarized in Figure 4 touches on this idea (loss of ITDv due to the use of in-ear earphones results in elevated thresholds), however, as the authors noted, this threshold shift could also be (partially) due to the use of naïve listeners or other factors and thus is inconclusive. Likewise, the MMN paradigm (Figure 5) is unconvincing in this respect as well. The authors first state that the paradigm design avoids the presence of ITDv. They then show that the recorded MMN data data is best explained by a model including D-stat (i.e. ITDrc and ITDv) and argue that this finding is evidence for the anticipation of these statistics. While we agree that this finding is suggesting potentially &quot;anticipatory processing&quot;, it is very difficult to judge the significance of the model performances without a control condition (including naturalistic free-field statistics). Some sort of comparative analysis (i.e. the manipulation of the higher-order statistics) to directly show whether neuronal processing is adapted to a specific statistical distribution would be required to justify the strong statements made in the Title, Abstract, and Introduction (last paragraph) about anticipation.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Natural ITD statistics are built into human sound localization&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, including Catherine Emily Carr as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Andrew King as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Michael Pecka (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you revise the manuscript. Please note, however, that we wish to see a point-by-point response to the main comments set out below, as this will determine whether we will be willing to consider another revision. We have summarized our extensive discussion in the following, and we have also appended the original (pre-consensus) reviews, for your edification.</p><p>We would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). Specifically, when editors judge that a submitted work as a whole belongs in <italic>eLife</italic> but that some conclusions require a modest amount of additional new data, as they do with your paper, we are asking that the manuscript be revised to either limit claims to those supported by data in hand, or to explicitly state that the relevant conclusions require additional supporting data.</p><p>Our expectation is that the authors will eventually carry out the additional experiments and report on how they affect the relevant conclusions either in a preprint on bioRxiv or medRxiv, or if appropriate, as a Research Advance in <italic>eLife</italic>, either of which would be linked to the original paper. This would be relevant if you wished to shorten the paper, and publish some experiments in a second publication.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) We all regard the use of ITD statistics, specifically, the derivative (rate of change) of the mean ITD over azimuth (ITDrc) and the standard deviation of ITD (ITDv) over time as a major strength of the paper. The finding that the Stern and Colburn, (1978) and Harper and McAlpine, (2004) models can reflect a representation of ITD statistics provides a strong connection between the neural coding and psychophysics. Thus, neural density may reflect the Fisher Information for azimuthal angle changes, and the paper could be motivated by explaining why the ITD sensitivity is not equally good within the entire physiological relevant ITD range.</p><p>2) Our major concern is the wording, which often seems vague. To excerpt from a review &quot;At the moment, the manuscript reads as if the ITD statistic is actually a detection cue, like &quot;Oh, I now perceive the variance! The sound must come from this direction.&quot; We think you mean that fewer neurons code sound directions where there is less Fisher information (large ITDs, typically generated from large azimuthal angles) than where there is more information from the ears (small ITDs from mid-line directions). If this is what you mean, please try to be clearer and avoid phrases like terms &quot;statistic is built in&quot; and &quot;the brain anticipates&quot;.</p><p>We have extensively discussed what you mean with respect to ITD sensitivity. You imply that ITD sensitivity (and the underlying neural processing) is improved by the naturally occurring ITDv, but you don't explain how this might work, i.e. you show that the brain uses the additional variance information for ITD calculation, but whether this information necessarily follows natural statistics is not clear. Furthermore, the wording of &quot;anticipation&quot; implies that the brain has learned what statistics exactly define naturalistic ITDv, which is not reflected in your data. Our uncertainty about what you mean motivates point 3 below.</p><p>A third point of confusion relates to D-stat. This has the highest correlation with the Mills data, and the way we understand (or interpret) your results and discussion is that even though no ITDv is present in the stimuli, the perception is explained by neural processing that incorporates the ITDv that would normally be present for these stimuli. And since the ITDv is not present, the brain must &quot;know&quot; (i.e. have learned) what these stats are. Please clarify if this is what you mean.</p><p>3) As you can tell from the above questions, our major concern is that the writing is still unclear. We have spent two weeks discussing what we think you mean. Therefore, we believe that there is potential to further clarify the wording and explanations. For example, with respect to understanding what is meant by &quot;Natural ITD statistics are built into [the brain])&quot;, we would like to clarify whether you agree or disagree with the interpretation that &quot;neural density may reflect the Fisher Information for azimuthal angle changes, etc&quot; before you start revising the manuscript for a third time. Please clarify this along with your responses to the other points in a reply letter. Once we understand what you mean, we could suggest how/if to streamline the manuscript.</p><p>4) The reviewers have discussed a recommendation to omit some of your experiments, on the grounds that the additional information doesn't substantially add to the main message (see review #4), but rather raises questions that potentially distract from it. We would prefer to resolve the issues in Points 1-3 first.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>This is my second review of this interesting paper. The basic idea is very compelling, that natural ITD statistics are built into the neural circuits that mediate sound localization. I also like the combination of modeling and psychophysics.</p><p>Nevertheless, the presentation is quite complex. The authors have written the paper three times. Once, when first sent to the journal, prior to review, and next after the prior reviews. This version is much clearer and has less than half the number of figures.</p><p>Strengths – the use of ITD statistics, specifically, the derivative (rate of change) of the mean ITD over azimuth (ITDrc) and the standard deviation of ITD (ITDv) over time are both important insights. The authors' finding, that the Stern and Colburn, (1978) and Harper and McAlpine, (2004) models can implement a representation of ITD statistics, provided a strong connection between the neural coding and psychophysics. I feel the field has been arguing about this for decades, and that this represents a major insight.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>The authors substantially revised the manuscript by adding more detailed explanations for the calculations they made. They also employ more measured wording throughout the paper, now. I remain a bit skeptical about the suitability of their use of the terms &quot;built in&quot; and &quot;anticipated&quot; with regard to the conclusions of their findings.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #4:</italic></p><p>I was initially in full agreement with the critique made in the first review (reviewer #2 was not available for re-review) and did not understand the rebuttal by the authors. But it struck me that the authors are by no means new to this research area so that the apparent absence of sense in the manuscript can only be explained by a gross misunderstanding. It took a couple of days until it clicked, and I believe I understand now what the authors are trying to convey. My take on their research question is this:</p><p>Why is ITD discrimination not equally good within the entire ecologically relevant range but is better for midline directions? Because Mills' data are already converted into milliseconds of ITD, it cannot just be the geometry (e.g Kuhn, 1977). The authors argue: It is because in real life, with broad band stimulation, the interaural correlation arriving from the left and right ear at the coincidence-detecting neurons is reduced due to differing HRTF filtering. IPD and ILD fluctuations are also introduced if ITD is not perfectly compensated by internal delay line differences (e.g. differences in left and right axonal travel times). Thus, they say, why wasting large number ITD sensitive neurons to reduce neural noise on spatial locations, where spatial cues are degraded anyway (ITDv)? In addition, ITD changes per angular location change (ITDrc) are lower at these off-centre directions relative to midline directions. In other words, one could argue that the Fisher information (change of mean divided by variance – they call it D-stat) for angular changes in source direction from these direction is low and so requires less number of neurons to be coded than the far higher information from frontal directions. The so predicted density distribution of binaural detectors as a function of their best ITD can be validated with ITD discrimination experiments using single tones, as these do not get ITD (and ILD) fluctuations by going through HRTFs, auditory filters and delay lines. Because their D-stat derived with broadband stimuli fit Mill's data very well, but D-stat can itself actually not explain Mills ITD discrimination thresholds because they were obtained with pure tones and are expressed in millisecond (not azimuthal angle), one might conclude that whatever limits ITD discrimination with tones has been influenced by D-stat by experiencing everyday broadband sounds. I assume the authors imply that it is neural noise that became somehow adjusted to match D-stat. Neural noise per ITD is determined by the number of ITD coding neuron coding this ITD (e.g. Stern and Colburn, 1978; Harper and McApline, 2004).</p><p>In the case that this indeed is, what the authors intend to say, I believe their idea is well worth disseminating. I agree with the first review that the current presentation is opaque and the description vague and misleading. It is lacking logical line of thoughts that tells the reader this story. The choice of wording itself is confusing and become more precise and descriptive in order to convey the message. The narrative can and should be kept simple and specific as it is actually a straightforward story, which is certainly novel and worth exploring further.</p><p>I would like to give further advice: The basic idea is in my opinion sufficient for an initial publication and I would not &quot;dilute&quot; it with unnecessary details. This story does not need further experimental data than those well-accepted ITD threshold data by Mills, (1958). They are sufficient for the purpose. Showing own, partly contradicting experimental data, just adds confusion and distracts the reader from the main message. Similarly, the EEG data are irrelevant for the narrative and just lengthen the manuscript unnecessarily.</p><p>I agree that one can also base the neural density on the distribution of ITD tuning slope curves, assuming neurons are most sensitive to changes in ITD here (Harper and McAlpine, 2004). This is indeed worth mentioning because this thinking is becoming the popular. But the fact that an ITD tuning curve has two slopes just complicates the matter. For the sake of keeping the argument simple, I recommend not go into detail with the slope model, but illustrate the basic idea using the classic Jeffress-based model by Stern and Colburn, (1978).</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.51927.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Summary:</p><p>This manuscript investigates whether the human brain exploits invariant spatial statistics to optimize sound source location discriminability.

We assume that ITDv and ITDrc statistics influence ITD processing, as postulated in previous studies. However, the focus of our study was not to address the direct effect of ongoing or recent statistics on ITD processing. We believe that the claim suggested above, “The brain anticipates the frequency- and location-specific invariance of these statistics [ITDv and ITDrc across contexts] and exploits them to optimize ITD discrimination”, is a valid and accurate description, and added this statement to the abstract and conclusions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The title and main conclusion are an overstatement.

It is already known that decreasing interaural correlation deteriorates sound localization in humans. Previous work by co-authors of this manuscript has shown that behavioral biases observed in barn owls when interaural correlation is manipulated is consistent with a representation of ITDv, but whether this is also observed in humans has not been tested yet. However, as we noted in the response to the editor’s summary, the main goal of our study was not to test the effect of recently modified statistics. We have revised the text to make the goal of the study clearer and statements to more accurately reflect significant findings. We had chosen the word ‘anticipate’ in an attempt to make it clear that this study is not about the processing of ongoing ITD statistics but about a built-in representation of them, affecting perception. However, we have come to understand that the word ‘anticipation’ creates confusion. We have thus revised the title to “Natural ITD statistics are built into human sound localization” and revised conclusion statements to clarify this issue across the paper.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) It is not clear how the authors computed either the ITD rate of change with azimuth (ITDrc) or ITD variability (ITDv) (they mention across-frequency interference that changes over time).

We also revised Figure 1 to clarify the methods. We would like to note that ITDv was estimated as ITD variability over time but not assumed to be induced by subjects’ motion.</p><p>The basic idea is that natural acoustic signals reaching the ears are distorted in a location- and frequency-dependent manner, leading to changes in the instantaneous ITD along the duration of these signals. These changes in instantaneous ITD induce variability of ITD within short-scale time windows along sounds and across trials, affecting the natural reliability of the ITD cue. To replicate this process, we used a broadband signal, HRIRs (HRTFs impulse responses) and digital filters that reproduced cochlear filtering, as follows: (1) we convolved a broadband signal with head-related impulse responses across azimuth locations to model spatial sounds, (2) we approximated the frequency bands that reached hair cells filtering acoustic signals using parameters of human cochlear filters previously reported, and (3) we estimated ITD variability across frequency and location by computing the standard deviation of instantaneous ITD along stimulus duration.</p><p>The revised Figure 1 now provides a visual description of this method, showing that ITDv estimation for a signal from a given position in azimuth requires convolving the signal with the corresponding left- and right-ear HRIRs for each subject and passing them through model cochlear filters to estimate the standard deviation of the differences in instantaneous phase between the left and right band-filtered signals over time.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The manuscript is very hard to follow.

We have added equations to the description of the methods and revised the manuscript to simplify the language.

As stated above, we have revised the title and conclusions to clarify the notion of ‘anticipation’ and avoided using this wording too often. We provide specific details of revisions addressing this issue below.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) We are not convinced that data that are presented can distinguish whether ITDv and ITDrc simply influence ITD processing or whether the brain anticipates the location-specific invariance of these statistics and exploits them to optimize ITD discrimination. I.e. the reported increase in variability at lateralized positions will certainly partially account for deterioration of JNDs (as will the decrease in ITDrc), and a large amount of data in support of this notion is presented.</p><p>Does changing higher-order statistics indeed deteriorate ITD JNDs (or dITD)? The experiment summarized in Figure 4 touches on this idea (loss of ITDv due to the use of in-ear earphones results in elevated thresholds), however, as the authors noted, this threshold shift could also be (partially) due to the use of naïve listeners or other factors and thus is inconclusive. Likewise, the MMN paradigm (Figure 5) is unconvincing in this respect as well. The authors first state that the paradigm design avoids the presence of ITDv. They then show that the recorded MMN data data is best explained by a model including D-stat (i.e. ITDrc and ITDv) and argue that this finding is evidence for the anticipation of these statistics. While we agree that this finding is suggesting potentially &quot;anticipatory processing&quot;, it is very difficult to judge the significance of the model performances without a control condition (including naturalistic free-field statistics). Some sort of comparative analysis (i.e. the manipulation of the higher-order statistics) to directly show whether neuronal processing is adapted to a specific statistical distribution would be required to justify the strong statements made in the Title, Abstract, and Introduction (last paragraph) about anticipation.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for raising these critical issues. It is true that the dITD thresholds we report obtained from our earphone testing are higher than those reported by Mills et al., (1958). An important difference, which motivated the decision to conduct our own measurements, is that Mills et al., (1958) used free-field stimulation and estimated ITD from azimuth values. Free-field stimulation, however, allows subjects to use spatial cues other than ITD to detect sound location in azimuth, which makes the lower thresholds expected. This argument is supported by the fact that ITD thresholds measured with dichotic stimulation by other previous studies (e.g., Brughera et al., 2013) are also higher than those reported by Mills. In addition, we believe our reference to using naïve listeners is important, not only to explain differences with Mills data but also to avoid the effect of training on spontaneous ITD thresholds. We have revised our justification of the differences between our data and Mills thresholds, adding this evidence. We would like to emphasize the idea that our study is not about the effect of ongoing statistics of experimental stimuli on ITD thresholds, which is why we did not attempt to manipulate them. At this time, it is difficult to predict the interplay of anticipated and actual statistics on ITD processing. Our group is currently conducting experiments examining this interaction but consider this project is beyond the scope of the present study and adding it would make it even more complex than what it already is.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) We all regard the use of ITD statistics, specifically, the derivative (rate of change) of the mean ITD over azimuth (ITDrc) and the standard deviation of ITD (ITDv) over time as a major strength of the paper.

We agree with the idea that Fisher information (FI) may be a better way to represent ITDrc and ITDv statistics. We have revised the manuscript showing FI’s predictive power of our psychophysical data and its consistency with Stern and Colburn, (1978) and Harper and McAlpine, (2004) models. As recognized by reviewers, in fact the D-stat metric (ITDrc/ITDv) used in the previous submissions was closely related to Fisher information; specifically, D-stat was approximately equal to the square root of Fisher information (√FI<sub>ITD</sub>), and therefore conclusions were unchanged after revising the manuscript as suggested.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Our major concern is the wording, which often seems vague. To excerpt from a review &quot;At the moment, the manuscript reads as if the ITD statistic is actually a detection cue, like &quot;Oh, I now perceive the variance! The sound must come from this direction.&quot; We think you mean that fewer neurons code sound directions where there is less Fisher information (large ITDs, typically generated from large azimuthal angles) than where there is more information from the ears (small ITDs from mid-line directions). If this is what you mean, please try to be clearer and avoid phrases like terms &quot;statistic is built in&quot; and &quot;the brain anticipates&quot;.</p></disp-quote><p>We are painfully aware that the wording did not convey our message clearly and have revised the whole manuscript to address this issue. Regarding the specific excerpt mentioned above, we must note that our paper is not conveying the idea of 'perceiving' variance and inferring from it where a sound is coming from. Rather, we are suggesting the brain possesses a prior representation of ITD statistics (ITDv and ITDrc) across frequency and location of sounds, and that this representation affects the perception and discriminability of ITD. We support the interpretation that the number of neurons coding ITD may match the natural level of Fisher information. Our paper tests that hypothesis through the Stern and Colburn and Harper and McAlpine models, showing that the distribution of neurons in these classic models of ITD discriminability are consistent with a representation of the stimulus Fisher information, such that there are fewer neurons where Fisher information is low. In this way, we argue that the human brain has a representation of ITD statistics and show that classic models of ITD coding provide a possible way that the statistics are represented.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>We have extensively discussed what you mean with respect to ITD sensitivity.

We assume that this is adaptive and creates a more efficient code for ITD because it makes ITD sensitivity finer for stimuli that are more informative about azimuth (stimuli that carry cues that vary less over stimulus duration and across trials and differ more across neighboring locations). Nor do we aim to imply that ITD ‘variance’ is ‘used’ for ITD calculation, but that ITD calculation is more accurate when ITDv is lower in natural stimuli. By using the word ‘anticipation’ in the previous version, we implied the brain has learned ITDv (and ITDrc) or contains an innate representation of it, which affects ITD perception for stimuli of different frequencies and location without needing to compute these statistics during stimulus presentation. However, our paper is not about how the statistics are learned. Our intention is to convey the idea that the brain undergoes early-life learning or, more likely, innately contains a representation of ITD statistics, including ITDv, and this is why we used the wording ‘built-in’ in earlier submissions. However, based on the critiques, we have abandoned this terminology and now refer to it as a “representation” of ITD statistics. Whether this representation of ITD statistics is genetically determined or learned is an interesting and still unanswered question, which we are currently studying. Our assumption is that the statistics that are captured over brain evolution are within a group of statistics determining Fisher information (ITDrc and ITDv).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>A third point of confusion relates to D-stat. This has the highest correlation with the Mills data, and the way we understand (or interpret) your results and discussion is that even though no ITDv is present in the stimuli, the perception is explained by neural processing that incorporates the ITDv that would normally be present for these stimuli. And since the ITDv is not present, the brain must &quot;know&quot; (i.e. have learned) what these stats are. Please clarify if this is what you mean.</p></disp-quote><p>We find this paragraph quite close to what we are trying to suggest. The brain must ‘know’ and therefore has learned early in life, or has innately received, the information of the statistics underlying D-stat (ITDrc/ITDv). Here again, this is the reason why we used the ‘built-in’ terminology in the previous version of the manuscript, which was discarded in the current revision.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) As you can tell from the above questions, our major concern is that the writing is still unclear. We have spent two weeks discussing what we think you mean. Therefore, we believe that there is potential to further clarify the wording and explanations. For example, with respect to understanding what is meant by &quot;Natural ITD statistics are built into [the brain])&quot;, we would like to clarify whether you agree or disagree with the interpretation that &quot;neural density may reflect the Fisher Information for azimuthal angle changes, etc&quot; before you start revising the manuscript for a third time. Please clarify this along with your responses to the other points in a reply letter. Once we understand what you mean, we could suggest how/if to streamline the manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>We feel remorse by the time our paper has taken from you and deeply appreciate the invaluable help. We agree with the interpretation that 'neural density may reflect the Fisher information for azimuthal angle changes', based on the assumption that Fisher information integrates both rate of change and variability of ITD, and this is what we are suggesting by showing that the Stern and Colburn and Harper and McAlpine papers could be consistent with our findings. By showing that the coding mechanisms underlying ITD sensitivity proposed by this paper reflects trends in natural statistics, our intention is to show how a representation of natural statistics could cause the observed effects on ITD discriminability.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>This is my second review of this interesting paper. The basic idea is very compelling, that natural ITD statistics are built into the neural circuits that mediate sound localization. I also like the combination of modeling and psychophysics.</p><p>Nevertheless, the presentation is quite complex. The authors have written the paper three times. Once, when first sent to the journal, prior to review, and next after the prior reviews. This version is much clearer and has less than half the number of figures.</p><p>Strengths – the use of ITD statistics, specifically, the derivative (rate of change) of the mean ITD over azimuth (ITDrc) and the standard deviation of ITD (ITDv) over time are both important insights. The authors' finding, that the Stern and Colburn, (1978) and Harper and McAlpine, (2004) models can implement a representation of ITD statistics, provided a strong connection between the neural coding and psychophysics. I feel the field has been arguing about this for decades, and that this represents a major insight.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer 1’s positive feedback. We have revised the manuscript extensively, further simplifying figures and reducing their number. We have also revised the text to make the main message clearer.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>The authors substantially revised the manuscript by adding more detailed explanations for the calculations they made. They also employ more measured wording throughout the paper, now. I remain a bit skeptical about the suitability of their use of the terms &quot;built in&quot; and &quot;anticipated&quot; with regard to the conclusions of their findings.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank reviewer 3 for acknowledging the revisions in the previous submission. We have now revised the title and text across the manuscript, removing completely the terminology of ‘built in’ and ‘anticipated’ natural ITD statistics, and replacing them by saying that natural ITD statistics are ‘represented’ in the brain.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #4:</p><p>[…] Why is ITD discrimination not equally good within the entire ecologically relevant range but is better for midline directions? Because Mills' data are already converted into milliseconds of ITD, it cannot just be the geometry (e.g Kuhn, 1977). The authors argue: It is because in real life, with broad band stimulation, the interaural correlation arriving from the left and right ear at the coincidence-detecting neurons is reduced due to differing HRTF filtering. IPD and ILD fluctuations are also introduced if ITD is not perfectly compensated by internal delay line differences (e.g. differences in left and right axonal travel times). Thus, they say, why wasting large number ITD sensitive neurons to reduce neural noise on spatial locations, where spatial cues are degraded anyway (ITDv)? In addition, ITD changes per angular location change (ITDrc) are lower at these off-centre directions relative to midline directions. In other words, one could argue that the Fisher information (change of mean divided by variance – they call it D-stat) for angular changes in source direction from these direction is low and so requires less number of neurons to be coded than the far higher information from frontal directions. The so predicted density distribution of binaural detectors as a function of their best ITD can be validated with ITD discrimination experiments using single tones, as these do not get ITD (and ILD) fluctuations by going through HRTFs, auditory filters and delay lines. Because their D-stat derived with broadband stimuli fit Mill's data very well, but D-stat can itself actually not explain Mills ITD discrimination thresholds because they were obtained with pure tones and are expressed in millisecond (not azimuthal angle), one might conclude that whatever limits ITD discrimination with tones has been influenced by D-stat by experiencing everyday broadband sounds. I assume the authors imply that it is neural noise that became somehow adjusted to match D-stat. Neural noise per ITD is determined by the number of ITD coding neuron coding this ITD (e.g. Stern and Colburn, 1978; Harper and McApline, 2004).</p><p>In the case that this indeed is, what the authors intend to say, I believe their idea is well worth disseminating. I agree with the first review that the current presentation is opaque and the description vague and misleading. It is lacking logical line of thoughts that tells the reader this story. The choice of wording itself is confusing and become more precise and descriptive in order to convey the message. The narrative can and should be kept simple and specific as it is actually a straightforward story, which is certainly novel and worth exploring further.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank reviewer 4 for the very insightful comments and the suggested connection with Fisher information. We have replaced our D-stat metric by a Fisher information index and we have revised the terminology referring to the brain representing statistics through experience and evolution. We also extensively revised the manuscript, trying to clarify the take home message and use wording easier to understand.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>I would like to give further advice: The basic idea is in my opinion sufficient for an initial publication and I would not &quot;dilute&quot; it with unnecessary details. This story does not need further experimental data than those well-accepted ITD threshold data by Mills, (1958). They are sufficient for the purpose. Showing own, partly contradicting experimental data, just adds confusion and distracts the reader from the main message. Similarly, the EEG data are irrelevant for the narrative and just lengthen the manuscript unnecessarily.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that the Mills, (1958) is powerful evidence supporting the goals of our study. We would like to argue that our experimental data are useful and provide more specific evidence regarding the effect of representing ITD statistics. We think showing that novelty detection is also influenced by ITD statistics is important. In addition, our measurements of dITD thresholds is relevant because it tests the hypothesis more specifically – Mills data are free field stimulation with tones, not through earphones. In fact, our data support our hypothesis rather than contradicting it. We believe that the revised figures, with removed unnecessary details, are able to show the main point of our study, supported by evidence from multiple datasets and approaches.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>I agree that one can also base the neural density on the distribution of ITD tuning slope curves, assuming neurons are most sensitive to changes in ITD here (Harper and McAlpine, 2004). This is indeed worth mentioning because this thinking is becoming the popular. But the fact that an ITD tuning curve has two slopes just complicates the matter. For the sake of keeping the argument simple, I recommend not go into detail with the slope model, but illustrate the basic idea using the classic Jeffress-based model by Stern and Colburn (1978).</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the notion that the two slopes of tuning curves adds complexity to Harper and McAlpine’s model prediction, which may be affecting Fisher information. We believe showing that the Harper and McAlpine, (2004) postulated coding framework could permit a representation of ITD statistics is a strong point in our manuscript, as it was pointed out by other reviewers; moreover the current analysis shows an interesting match between ITD and modeled neural population Fisher information. The models proposed in Stern and Colburn and Harper and McAlpine rely on two different frameworks explaining, respectively, psychophysics and reported tuning properties of ITD selective neurons. In our work we show the models are complementary. Furthermore, our analysis showing that adjusting the Harper and McAlpine model to match ITD statistics predicts observed neural responses suggests a potential functional connection between tuning properties and psychophysics for this model.</p></body></sub-article></article>
