pro-inflammatory microenvironment during post-partum mammary involution promotes parity-associated breast cancer. Estrogen exposure during mammary involution drives tumor growth through neutrophils’ activity. However, how estrogen and neutrophils influence mammary involution are unknown. Combined analysis of transcriptomic, protein, and immunohistochemical data in BALB/c mice showed that estrogen promotes involution by exacerbating inflammation, cell death and adipocytes repopulation. Remarkably, 88% of estrogen-regulated genes in mammary tissue were mediated through neutrophils, which were recruited through estrogen-induced CXCR2 signalling in an autocrine fashion. While neutrophils mediate estrogen-induced inflammation and adipocytes repopulation, estrogen-induced mammary cell death was via lysosome-mediated programmed cell death through upregulation of <italic>cathepsin B, Tnf</italic> and <italic>Bid</italic> in a neutrophil-independent manner. Notably, these multifaceted effects of estrogen are mostly mediated by ERα and unique to the phase of mammary involution. These findings are important for the development of intervention strategies for parity-associated breast cancer.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Estrogen</kwd><kwd>neutrophils</kwd><kwd>mammary involution</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Ministry of Education of Singapore</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MOE2017-T1-002-081</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lin</surname><given-names>Valerie Chun Ling</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Estrogen aggravates mammary involution through lysosome-mediated cell death, neutrophil recruitment via CXCR2 signalling, neutrophil-mediated inflammation and adipocyte repopulation.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>There is strong evidence that the mammary microenvironment during the post-partum mammary involution promotes mammary tumor progression. High levels of tissue fibrillar collagen and elevated expression of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) in the mammary gland have been shown to drive tumor growth and lymph angiogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Lyons et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Lyons et al., 2011</xref>). Wound healing-like tissue environment associated with mammary involution is also known to promote tumor development and dissemination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Foster et al., 2018</xref>). Estrogen has been shown to stimulate the growth of estrogen receptor-negative mammary tumors during mammary involution and estrogen-stimulated neutrophil activity plays a crucial role in fostering the pro-tumoral microenvironment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Chung et al., 2017</xref>). This suggests that estrogen exposure during post-weaning mammary involution is a risk factor for parity-associated breast cancer. However, the functional roles of estrogen and neutrophils in mammary biology during involution have been little studied to date.</p><p>Post-weaning mammary involution is a process for the lactating mammary gland to return to the pre-pregnancy state. The distinctive features of mammary involution include massive cell death of the secretory mammary alveoli, acute inflammation, extracellular matrix remodelling and adipocyte repopulation. Involution is commonly divided into two phases. In mice, the first phase is the reversible phase whereby the reintroduction of the pups within 48 hr can re-initiate lactation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Li et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Jaggi et al., 1996</xref>). It is typified by a decrease in milk protein synthesis and increased mammary cell death resulting in the appearance of shed, dying cells within the lumen of the distended alveoli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Strange et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Walker et al., 1989</xref>). Inflammation also occurs in the first phase with the infiltration of immune cells and up-regulation of immune response genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Stein et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Clarkson and Watson, 2003</xref>). The second, and irreversible phase of mammary involution occurs after 72 hr of weaning. This phase is morphologically characterized by the collapse of the alveolar structure, the second wave of epithelial cell death, continued inflammation and the repopulation of adipocytes. This is followed by mammary regeneration and tissue remodelling to the pre-pregnancy state.</p><p>Neutrophils are the most abundant leukocytes in the innate immune system against invading pathogens. Neutrophils are also activated in response to sterile inflammation, but the outcome is complicated and depends on the context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Wang, 2018</xref>). The importance of neutrophils in tumor development has been increasingly recognized in recent years. Tumor-associated neutrophils have been classified into the anti-tumor neutrophils (N1) and pro-tumor neutrophils (N2) based on the expression of specific markers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Fridlender et al., 2009</xref>). Neutrophils are known to accumulate in the peripheral blood of patients with cancer and a high circulating neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio is known as a strong biomarker of poor prognosis in various cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Shaul and Fridlender, 2019</xref>). Based on density gradient centrifugation, circulating neutrophils in mice model can also be classified into the low-density and high-density neutrophils (LDN and HDN) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Sagiv et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Mishalian et al., 2017</xref>). LDN was associated with immunosuppressive activity promoting tumor growth while HDN was considered cytotoxic to the tumor. Neutrophils were reported to be the first immune cells recruited into mammary tissue during involution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Stein et al., 2004</xref>), although the significance of their presence is not known.</p><p>Estrogen is well studied on its mitogenic effect and plays essential roles in mammary ductal development. However, the studies of estrogen influence on mammary involution are scarce. In mice, a histological examination in 1970 reported that estrogen treatment retards mammary involution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Satoh, 1970</xref>). However, estrogen was reported to promote the regression of mammary glands in rats by up-regulating a 60K gelatinase which degrades collagen and participate in extracellular matrix remodelling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ambili et al., 1998</xref>). Similar to the observation in rats, injection of estrogen during the dry off period in dairy cows hastened involution based on the abrupt decline of milk synthesis and secretion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Athie et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Athie et al., 1996</xref>). Those early preliminary studies clearly indicate the involvement of estrogen in the modulation of mammary involution, but the pieces of evidence are limited and inconsistent among different models.</p><p>In this present study, we investigated the influence of estrogen on the progression of mammary involution in mice. We also evaluated the roles of neutrophils in estrogen regulation of this process in neutrophil depletion experiments. Our data show that estrogen plays a multifaceted role in the regulation of post-weaning mammary involution by enhancing inflammation, cell death, adipocyte occupancy, and tissue remodelling through both neutrophil-dependent and neutrophil-independent mechanisms. Global transcriptomic analysis revealed striking effect of estrogen on neutrophil activities that likely exert profound influence on mammary microenvironment that may have significantly impact on the development of parity-associated breast cancer.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Estrogen promotes inflammation, programmed cell death and adipocytes repopulation during post-weaning mammary involution</title><p>Acute inflammation, programmed cell death, and adipocytes repopulation are the hallmarks of the acute phase of post-weaning mammary involution. To understand the roles of estrogen in mammary involution, its effect on these hallmarks were evaluated. Ovariectomized (OVX) mice at 24 hr post-weaning (INV D1) were treated with or without 17β-estradiol benzoate (E2B) for 48 hr. E2B caused significantly more mammary cell death, as evidenced by the increase of the number of shed cells with hyper-condensed nuclei in the lumen, a characteristic of programmed cell death (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, Ai, and 1B, p=0.0131). This effect was associated with an increase in the number of cleaved caspase-3-positive (CC3<sup>+</sup>) mammary cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, Aii, and 1B, p=0.0283). E2B also significantly increased the repopulation of adipocytes based on the staining of perilipin, a lipid droplet-associated protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Greenberg et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, Aiii, and 1B, p=0.0155).

We questioned if neutrophils are involved in E2B-induced cell death and adipocytes repopulation. The effect of estrogen on mammary involution following neutrophil depletion using anti-Ly6G antibody (Ly6G) were evaluated. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1Di</xref> shows that estrogen increased mammary neutrophils significantly (p=0.0002). Ly6G antibody reduced neutrophils in the mammary tissue of E2B-treated samples by ~90%. Estrogen also visibly increases mammary monocytes but not to a statistically significant level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1Di</xref>, p=0.1103). Interestingly, whilst neutrophil depletion had no effect on E2B-induced mammary cell death, it attenuated E2B-induced adipocytes repopulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1Dii</xref>). The representative histological images of the effect of neutrophil depletion on cell death and adipocytes repopulation are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>. Taken together, we conclude that estrogen promotes mammary involution, and neutrophils are critical for estrogen-induced inflammation and adipocytes repopulation, but not for mammary cell death.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Majority of estrogen-regulated genes in involuting mammary tissue is mediated through neutrophils</title><p>To elucidate the mechanism of estrogen regulation during mammary involution, RNA-Seq analysis of mammary tissue was conducted. Since estrogen has been shown to induce neutrophil infiltration in mammary tissue, the involvement of neutrophils in estrogen regulation of gene expression was also determined. OVX mice were injected with anti-Ly6G antibody (Ly6G) to deplete neutrophils at 24 hr post-weaning (INV D1). Mice given isotype control antibody (IgG) were used as controls. Mice were subsequently treated with or without E2B for 24 hr. Consistent with the previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Chung et al., 2017</xref>), E2B induced the infiltration of neutrophil and monocytes (CD45+ CD11b+ Ly6C<sup>hi</sup>) in mammary tissue during mammary involution. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Anti-Ly6G treatment reduced neutrophil (CD45+ CD11b+ Gr1<sup>hi</sup>) levels in the blood and mammary tissue by more than 95% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>, p&lt;0.05). Mammary monocytes were decreased by anti-Ly6G, although this reduction was not statistically significant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>, p=0.1417). It is plausible that E2B-induced monocytes infiltration is partly mediated by neutrophils.</p><p>RNA-Seq data were analyzed using DESeq2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Love et al., 2014</xref>) to identify differentially expressed (DE) genes between the different treatments.

Correspondingly, 12% (241 genes) of E2B-regulated genes in mammary tissue are independent of neutrophils. It is also noteworthy that there is only one differentially regulated gene (padj &lt; 0.05) between IgG and Ly6G groups in the absence of estrogen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, bottom panel). This could be due to the fact that the number of mammary neutrophils present in these Ctrl samples were too low (less than 1% of the total live cells in FACS analysis) to account for any differences in gene expression. Consistent with the function of neutrophils, E2B-regulated GO terms including leukocyte migration, inflammatory response, cytokines and chemokines related pathways, and fat cell differentiation were all eliminated in neutrophil depleted samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>).

Together, the analyses confirm that the up-regulation of inflammatory genes by E2B occurs mostly in neutrophils.</p><p>Next, we investigated the mechanism of estrogen-induced neutrophils infiltration. S100A8, S100A9 are known neutrophil chemoattractants that promote neutrophil migration during inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Wang et al., 2018</xref>). S100A8 and S100A9 are small calcium-binding proteins that activate calcium-dependent signalling through receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) or toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4). Paquinimod (PAQ) is a derivative of quinoline-3-carboxamide that has been shown to inhibit S100A9 activity through binding with S100A9 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bengtsson et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Björk et al., 2009</xref>). The binding inhibits S100A9 dimerization or the formation of heterodimer with S100A8, thereby preventing the activation of RAGE or TLR4. To evaluate the role of S100A9 in estrogen-induced neutrophil infiltration, PAQ was synthesized following the reported method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Jönsson et al., 2004</xref>) and tested whether it inhibits E2B-induced neutrophil infiltration by treating OVX mice with E2B or E2B+PAQ at INV D1 for 48 hr in a pilot experiment. Flow cytometry analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>) showed that E2B+PAQ treatment resulted in an increase in mammary neutrophils (CD45+ CD11b+ Ly6G+, p=0.0238) and monocytes (CD45+ CD11b+ Ly6C<sup>hi</sup>, p=0.0242) when compared to E2B treated samples. Consistently, qPCR analysis also revealed a significant increase in pro-inflammatory markers such as <italic>Cxcl2</italic> (p=0.0124), <italic>S100a8</italic> (p=0.0233), <italic>S100a9</italic> (p=0.0161), and C-type lectin domain family 4, member e (<italic>Clec4e</italic>; p=0.0186) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C</xref>). As it is not clear if PAQ has a yet to be characterized functional property that induces neutrophil infiltration, we cannot conclude from this experiment whether S100A8/A9 were significantly involved in the E2B-induced neutrophil infiltration.</p><p>CXCR2 is known to be important for neutrophil infiltration in a number of experimental settings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Aziz et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alves-Filho et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Cacalano et al., 1994</xref>). Since <italic>Cxcr2</italic> and all its ligands were significantly up-regulated by E2B, we explored the involvement of CXCR2 signalling in E2B-induced neutrophil recruitment. OVX mice were treated with Ctrl or E2B at INV D1 for 48 hr in the presence of vehicle control DMSO, or CXCR2 antagonist SB225002 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">White et al., 1998</xref>). To take into consideration of the large variations between experiments, the percentages of infiltrated mammary neutrophils (CD45+ CD11b+ Ly6G+) were presented as fold change over the Ctrl+DMSO group. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3Ci</xref>, E2B treatment alone without the antagonist (E2B+DMSO) led to 2.57-fold increase (p=0.0082) in mammary neutrophils as compared to the Ctrl+DMSO. E2B+SB225002 treatment caused a 2.26-fold reduction in mammary neutrophils when compared to the E2B+DMSO group (p=0.0508). Quantification of the number of infiltrated mammary neutrophils within a 20 mm<sup>2</sup> area of stained mammary tissue also showed a significant reduction of neutrophil infiltration within mammary tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3Cii</xref>, p=0.0369). qPCR analysis of the mammary tissue samples showed that the E2B-induced pro-inflammatory markers such as <italic>Cxcl2</italic>, <italic>S100a9</italic>, <italic>Clec4d</italic>, and <italic>Clec4e</italic> were all significantly reduced with E2B+SB225002 treatment compared with E2B+DMSO treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>, <italic>Cxcl2</italic>, p=0.0279; <italic>S100a9</italic>, p=0.0199; <italic>Clec4d</italic>, p=0.0051; <italic>Clec4e</italic>, p=0.0183). This is consistent with SB225002-induced inhibition of neutrophil infiltration because these genes are estrogen-induced in neutrophils. Collectively, the data showed that the E2B-induced activation of CXCR2 signalling and the up-regulation of CXCR2 ligands <italic>Cxcl2</italic>, <italic>Cxcl3</italic>, <italic>Cxcl5</italic> in neutrophils plays a pivotal role in estrogen-induced neutrophil recruitment.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Estrogen-induced adipocyte repopulation is associated with the induction of adipogenic and tissue remodelling genes through neutrophils</title><p>Mammary adipocytes regress during pregnancy and lactation as the mammary epithelial proliferate and differentiate to fill up the mammary fat pad. Adipocytes expansion or repopulation is a hallmark of post-lactational mammary involution. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> shows that estrogen significantly induces adipocyte repopulation during mammary involution, and neutrophil depletion attenuates it. We also determined the effect of neutrophil depletion by the Ly6G antibody on adipocytes repopulation in the intact (non-OVX) mice during mammary involution. Mice were given daily injection of Ly6G antibody from INV D1 for 2 or 3 days. Neutrophil depletion efficiency at INV D3 and D4 were ~ 95%. It was also shown that the infiltrated neutrophils at INV D4 is ~ 8 times of that at D3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>), indicating an increase of infiltrated neutrophils as involution proceeded. During sterile inflammation, infiltrated neutrophils was known to recruit monocytes from the circulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Shen et al., 2013</xref>). In our study, neutrophils depletion also reduced mammary monocytes at both D3 and D4, although it is statistically not significant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). At INV D3, neutrophil depletion showed no effect on adipocytes repopulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>, p=0.3737 and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). However, there was a significant reduction in adipocytes repopulation with neutrophil depletion at INV D4 based on perilipin immunostaining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>, p=0.0077, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). The data suggest that neutrophils involvement in adipocytes repopulation during mammary involution is limited to a specific time window when the levels of neutrophil infiltration is high. GO over-representation analysis of RNA-Seq data indicates that E2B regulated genes that are associated with fat cell differentiation. Neutrophils depletion attenuated most of E2B-induced genes in fat cell differentiation category (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). Intriguingly, some of these E2B-regulated changes indicate anti-adipogenic effect, whereas others appear pro-adipogenic. For example, E2B down-regulated the expression of <italic>Adipoq</italic>, <italic>Pparg</italic>, and <italic>Lpl</italic> independent of neutrophils, all of which are positive regulators of adipogenesis. On the other hand, E2B also up-regulated some of the upstream regulators of adipogenesis, such as early growth response 2 (<italic>Egr2</italic>), adipogenin (<italic>Adig</italic>), CCAAT/enhancer binding protein (C/EBP), beta (<italic>Cebpb</italic>), and CCAAT/enhancer binding protein (C/EBP), delta (<italic>Cebpd</italic>), all of which were validated by qPCR analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). Neutrophil depletion abolished the up-regulation of <italic>Egr2</italic>, <italic>Adig</italic> and <italic>Cebp/b</italic>.

We hypothesized that pro-inflammatory condition may prime estrogen-induced cell death during the acute phase of mammary involution. As wild-type MCF7 does not express caspase-3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Jänicke, 2009</xref>), the hypothesis was tested in an in vitro model using MCF7-caspase3(+) breast cancer cell line (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Jänicke et al., 1998</xref>). The idea was to recapitulate estrogen-induced cell death during mammary involution using the pro-inflammatory cytokine TNFα. MCF7-caspase3(+) cells were first treated with TNFα or vehicle control for 1 hr. This was followed by treatment with 17β-estradiol (E2) or vehicle control for 24 hr before the cells were stained with propidium iodide (PI) for analysis with flow cytometer. Cells undergoing programmed cell death exhibit increased membrane permeability and hence will stain positive for PI. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>, increasing concentration of TNFα from 2 ng/ml to 10 ng/ml led to a dose-dependent increase in the percentage of dead cells (p&lt;0.01). As expected, E2B treatment alone did not cause cell death. However, E2B+TNFα treatment significantly enhanced the percentage of dead cells compared to TNFα treatment alone at doses of 5 ng/ml (p=0.0104) and 10 ng/ml (p=0.0007). Expectedly, TNFα induced increases in p-STAT3 and cleaved poly-ADP ribose polymerase (PARP) protein as compared to the vehicle-treated controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). E2B+TNFα increased the levels of p-STAT3 and cleaved PARP significantly compared to TNFα treatment alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref> and C, p-STAT3, p=0.0404; cleaved PARP, p&lt;0.0001). These molecular changes are consistent with a greater level of cell death induced by the combined treatment of E2B and TNFα. Together, the in vitro data support the notion that pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNFα primes the death-inducing effect of estrogen. However, the increased p-STAT3 is not associated with increases of active CTSD and CTSB (data not shown), suggesting that estrogen-induced cell death in the presence of TNFα may not be via LM-PCD in the MCF7-caspase3(+) cells.</p><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Estrogen accelerates TNFα-induced cell death in vitro.</title><p>MCF7-caspase3(+) cells were treated with either vehicle control (1xPBS) or TNFα of varying concentrations. An hour later, cells were treated with either vehicle control (0.01% ethanol) or 10nM 17β-estradiol (E2) for 24h, after which they were collected for analysis.

But these effects may not involve neutrophils.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>This is a comprehensive study of biological effects of estrogen on the acute phase of mammary involution. We report that estrogen accelerates mammary involution by exacerbating mammary inflammation, programmed mammary cell death, and adipocytes repopulation. These effects were found to be mediated through distinct mechanisms. First, the effect on mammary inflammation is primarily mediated through the activities of mammary neutrophils. RNA-Seq analysis revealed the remarkable extent of estrogen regulation of neutrophil activity. Neutrophil depletion eliminated 88% of estrogen-regulated genes in mammary tissue, even though neutrophils account for less than 5% and 1% of the total number of live cells in FACS analysis of estrogen-treated and control samples respectively. This 88% of the genes were regulated by estrogen either in neutrophils, or as a result of neutrophil activities on other cells. Functional analysis showed that neutrophils are the primary mediators of estrogen-induced inflammation and neutrophil infiltration. The remarkable impact of estrogen on neutrophil activities would conceivably have a significant influence on the mammary tissue microenvironment. This affirms the pivotal roles of neutrophils in mediating the pro-tumoral effect of estrogen on ER-negative tumor development in mammary tissue during involution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Chung et al., 2017</xref>). Second, estrogen promotes mammary LM-PCD independent of neutrophils by inducing the expression and activity of lysosomal cathepsins and other pro-apoptotic markers such as <italic>Bid</italic> and <italic>Tnf</italic>. It is well known that dying cells release signaling molecules to stimulate inflammation and recruitment of phagocytic cells for their clearance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Rock and Kono, 2008</xref>). Likewise, estrogen-induced cell death may aggravate inflammation, leading to a greater level of neutrophil recruitment. Third, neutrophils play an important role in estrogen-induced adipocytes repopulation as neutrophils depletion attenuated adipocytes repopulation. Notably, all these effects of estrogen are unique to the mammary tissue during post-weaning involution, signifying the plasticity of estrogen action depending on the tissue microenvironment.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Plasticity of estrogen action on neutrophils</title><p>In sharp contrast to the effect on neutrophils during mammary involution, estrogen reduced mammary neutrophil infiltration in age-matched nulliparous mice. Estrogen-regulated expression of cytokines such as <italic>S100a9</italic>, <italic>Cxcl2</italic>, and <italic>Cxcr2</italic> in nulliparous mice also occurs in the opposite direction as that in mice undergoing mammary involution. The observation in nulliparous mice is consistent with reports that estrogen inhibits inflammation in obesity-induced mammary inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Bhardwaj et al., 2015</xref>), and in <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> infected bovine mammary epithelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Medina-Estrada et al., 2016</xref>). To our knowledge, this is the first evidence of the plasticity of estrogen action on neutrophils that is shaped by the tissue microenvironment in an in vivo model. This suggests that there are fundamental differences in the cistrome of mammary neutrophils between these two states.</p><p>Neutrophils are known to express ERα, ERβ, and GPER30 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Molero et al., 2002</xref>). ERα and ERβ are members of the nuclear receptor superfamily of transcription factors, whereas GPER30 is a G protein-coupled membrane receptor. Several lines of evidence suggest that the effect of estrogen on mammary neutrophils during mammary involution is mediated by ERα. Firstly, the relative expression of <italic>Esr1</italic> (ERα) in mammary neutrophils during involution is approximately 40 times that of <italic>Esr2</italic> (ERβ) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1</xref>). Secondly, ERα-specific agonist PPT elicited similar changes as E2B on the expression of a panel of inflammatory and adipogenesis-related genes in neutrophil (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). In contrast, ERβ-specific agonist DPN, had no effect. ERα has also been reported to mediate estrogen-induced neutrophil migration in the uterus through ERα phosphorylation at serine 216 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Shindo et al., 2013</xref>), and ERα mediated the effect of estrogen on myeloid-derived suppressor cells, which are mostly granulocytic cells, in stimulating tumor development in mice model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Svoronos et al., 2017</xref>). Thus, ERα plays a major part in mediating estrogen regulation of neutrophils activity during mammary involution.</p><p>Immune cells are notably plastic in their ability to adapt to changes in their environment. There has been growing evidence of phenotypic heterogeneity and functional plasticity in neutrophils, which has been the subject of comprehensive reviews (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Ng et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Silvestre-Roig et al., 2019</xref>). How neutrophils evolve into different phenotype with distinct function is still unclear. Ng et al suggested two non-mutually exclusive mechanisms: intrinsic heterogeneity in the bone marrow and blood, and extrinsic heterogeneity inducible by local or systemic factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Ng et al., 2019</xref>). The latter would conceivably apply to neutrophils in tissues, resident or conditionally infiltrated, that evolve into specialized phenotypes in order to meet the developmental demand. The distinct transcriptional responses to estrogen in infiltrated mammary neutrophils between post-weaning mice and nulliparous mice reflects this functional plasticity during development. Given that estrogen regulation of gene transcription is mediated by ERα, we postulate that signaling molecules in inflammatory mammary tissue remodel the epigenetic landscape of neutrophils so as to modify ERα cistrome. It has been reported that neutrophils undergo dynamic changes in their epigenome during development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Grassi et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Rönnerblad et al., 2014</xref>). Under mature state, neutrophils respond to environmental cues with epigenetic modification and transcription changes. For example, the inactive IL-6 genomic locus in human neutrophils undergoes chromatin remodeling in response to ligands for TLR8, leading to IL-6 secretion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Zimmermann et al., 2015</xref>). It is known that ERα cistrome is reprogrammable and TNFα has been shown to reshape the genomic action of estrogen in breast cancer cells through redistribution of NF-kB and pioneer factor FOXA1 binding across the genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Frasor et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Franco et al., 2015</xref>). Thus, the inflammatory microenvironment in mammary tissue during involution may trigger a global shift of ER-cistrome in mammary neutrophils so as to modify estrogen response that is distinct from that in nulliparous mice. The mammary involution model is thus useful for the elucidation of mechanisms that drive epigenetic and phenotypic changes in neutrophils.</p><p>It should be recognized that ERβ has been reported to play a role in neutrophil regulation of tumor biology. Selective ERβ agonist LY500307 was found to reduce lung metastasis of triple-negative breast cancer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Zhao et al., 2018</xref>). This was associated with significant increase of infiltration of neutrophils in the lung. However, this was mediated by the up-regulation of IL-1β in cancer cells which promotes neutrophil infiltration to the metastatic niche. Whether the ERβ agonist regulated the phenotypes of neutrophils directly is not clear.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Estrogen promotes CXCR2 signalling to elicit neutrophil infiltration</title><p>The involvement of CXCR2 signalling in neutrophil infiltration has been widely reported. In an acute lung injury model, <italic>Cxcr2</italic> gene deletion abolished hyperoxia-induced neutrophil accumulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Sue et al., 2004</xref>). In studies of reperfusion injury, inhibition of CXCR2 with repertaxin or anti-CXCR2 antibodies led to the reduction of neutrophils accumulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Cugini et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Belperio et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bertini et al., 2004</xref>). The CXCR2 antagonist SB225002 has also been reported to reduce neutrophil recruitment and pro-inflammatory factor expression in LPS-induced acute lung injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Cao et al., 2018</xref>). Using CXCR2 antagonist SB225002, this study identified CXCR2 signalling as a major pathway for estrogen to induce neutrophil infiltration in mammary tissue during mammary involution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C and D</xref>). This is likely mediated by the significant upregulation of <italic>Cxcr2</italic> and its ligands <italic>Cxcl2</italic>, <italic>Cxcl3</italic>, and <italic>Cxcl5</italic> in neutrophils (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). It is conceivable that the recruitment of neutrophils involves an autocrine loop, in which estrogen induces neutrophil release of CXCR2 ligands which activate CXCR2 signalling in neutrophils.</p><p>Additionally, a number of the estrogen-regulated genes through neutrophils are also linked to chemotaxis, leukocytes adhesion and migration. CXCR2 signalling likely cooperates with other estrogen-induced chemotactic factors. <italic>Trem1</italic> and <italic>Trem3</italic> are among the top estrogen-regulated genes in neutrophils (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). TREM1 was first identified to be selectively expressed on neutrophils and monocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Bouchon et al., 2000</xref>). TREM3 is highly homologous to TREM1 and is believed to have overlapping function. TREM1/3-deficient mice displayed impaired neutrophil trans-epithelial infiltration into the lung when challenged with <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Klesney-Tait et al., 2013</xref>). TREM1 was also known to amplify inflammation, as TREM1 overactivation with activating antibodies following LPS treatment led to the up-regulation of cytokines such as TNFα, MCP-1, and IL8 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Bouchon et al., 2000</xref>). It is plausible that <italic>Trem1/3</italic> up-regulation also plays a role in estrogen-induced neutrophil infiltration.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Estrogen-stimulated neutrophils play a part in adipocytes repopulation</title><p>Estrogen is traditionally known to promote metabolism and inhibit adipogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Chen and Brown, 1793</xref>). It has been reported recently that ERα signalling is required for the adipose progenitor identity and the commitment of white fat cell lineage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Lapid et al., 2014</xref>). The present study provides the first evidence that estrogen stimulates adipocytes repopulation during mammary involution. This effect likely involved neutrophils because neutrophils depletion attenuated estrogen-induced adipocytes repopulation and the gene expression related to fat cell differentiation, lipid metabolism, and ECM remodelling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). It is to be noted that mammary macrophages and infiltrated monocytes likely play a role in estrogen-induced adipocytes repopulation. First, macrophages have been shown to be critical for adipocytes repopulation during mammary involution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">O'Brien et al., 2012</xref>). Whilst we did not examine the effect of estrogen on mammary resident macrophages, estrogen has been reported to regulate gene expression of peritoneal macrophages involved in various processes including cell proliferation, immune response and wound healing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Pepe et al., 2017</xref>). Thus, estrogen may stimulate macrophage activity for adipocytes repopulation. Second, estrogen also induces infiltration of monocytes into mammary tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Chung et al., 2017</xref>), which share common properties with F4/80+ macrophages. Third, consistent with the understanding that infiltrated neutrophils recruit monocytes into the tissue during sterile inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Shen et al., 2013</xref>), we observed that estrogen-induced neutrophil depletion reduced, to a small extent, infiltrating monocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Taken together, estrogen-induced adipocytes repopulation is plausibly mediated by the activities of neutrophils, infiltrated monocytes as well as resident macrophages in the mammary gland.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Estrogen promotes LM-PCD during mammary involution</title><p>Mammary involution in the first 48 hr is known as phase I (reversible phase) of mammary involution. In phase I, LM-PCD has been shown to be the major mechanism of mammary cell death, and it is independent of caspases 3, 6, and 7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Kreuzaler et al., 2011</xref>). The present study provides the first evidence that estrogen treatment in the reversible phase of mammary involution accelerates cell death when there is ongoing LM-PCD. This is mediated by increased expression of <italic>Ctsb</italic>, and the cytosolic protein levels of active (cleaved) CTSB, CTSD, and CTSL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). We propose the following model to explain how estrogen-induced <italic>Ctsb</italic> drives LM-PCD. First, increased gene expression and protein levels of CTSB lead to increased levels of activated CTSB due to heightened lysosomal activity in mammary cells with ongoing LM-PCD. The activated CTSB would further increase the cleavage and activation of CTSB, CTSD, and CTSL. CTSB can also enhance the permeability of lysosomal membrane because lysosomal leakage is markedly decreased in cathepsin B-deficient cells in respond to TNFα treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Werneburg et al., 2002</xref>). Hence, estrogen-induced expression of <italic>Ctsb</italic> triggers a chain of events, culminating in increased LM-PCD. In addition, estrogen-induced expression of <italic>Tnf</italic> and <italic>Bid</italic> further enhances this process. Although estrogen-induced <italic>Tnf</italic> is not associated with increased activation of STAT3, TNFα has been reported to redistribute the zinc transporter ZnT2 to increase Zn in lysosomes. The high levels of Zn cause lysosomal swelling and cathepsin B release during mammary involution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Hennigar and Kelleher, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Hennigar et al., 2015</xref>). Additionally, it is well known that cathepsins cleave BID to tBID and degrade antiapoptotic BCL-2 homologues to execute LM-PCD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Droga-Mazovec et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Stoka et al., 2001</xref>). Increased <italic>Bid</italic> level would thus reinforce cathepsin-stimulated LM-PCD. Hence, estrogen-induced increases of cytosolic cathepsins together with increase of <italic>Tnf</italic> and <italic>Bid</italic> accelerate LM-PCD during mammary involution.</p><p>On the other hand, estrogen induction of <italic>Ctsb</italic> in nulliparous mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>) without ongoing LM-PCD would not lead to cell death due to the lack of a permissive cellular environment. This notion is supported by the study of estrogen in MCF7-Caspase3(+) cells, in which treatment with TNFα primes estrogen to stimulate cell death. In contrast to the observation in involuting mammary gland in which estrogen did not increase total or pSTAT3, estrogen plus TNFα enhanced STAT3 phosphorylation as compared to TNFα alone in MCF7-Caspase3(+) cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). However, TNFα did not affect the levels of cathepsins significantly in the cell model, and hence it unlikely induced LM-PCD. Nonetheless, the in vitro study demonstrates that estrogen can be primed to heighten cell death under a pro-inflammatory stimulus. Estrogen has also been reported to induce apoptosis in experimental endocrine resistance models through inducing endoplasmic reticulum stress and inflammatory response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Ariazi et al., 2011</xref>). Thus, estrogen can induce cell death under certain cellular context, but the mechanisms may vary.</p><p>Mammary macrophages have also been shown to be important for mammary involution including LM-PCD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">O'Brien et al., 2012</xref>). Depletion of mammary macrophage in Macrophage Fas-induced apoptosis (Mafia) transgenic mice targeting CSF1R-expressing cells resulted in delayed mammary involution and loss of LM-PCD due to attenuated activation of Stat3. Since estrogen induced monocyte recruitment and is known to regulate the transcriptional activity of macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Chung et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Pepe et al., 2017</xref>), we speculate that monocytes and macrophages played a part in estrogen-induced LM-PCD by heightening the proinflammatory tissue environment, leading to further activation of estrogen-induced lysosomal proteases.</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>In summary, the study reveals novel mechanisms of estrogen action that are unique to the mammary tissue during post-weaning mammary involution and most of the effects are mediated by ERα (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). Estrogen treatment intensely and extensively regulates the activity of neutrophils to elicit inflammation and adipocytes repopulation. The study identified CXCR2 signalling in neutrophils as an important mechanism of estrogen-induced neutrophil recruitment. Additionally, estrogen also exacerbates mammary LM-PCD by inducing the expression of <italic>Ctsb</italic>, <italic>Tnf</italic>, <italic>Bid</italic>, and subsequent lysosomal activation and leakage of CTSB, CTSD, and CTSL independent of neutrophils. At the same time, estrogen retains its function in inducing the expression of pro-growth genes to facilitate mammary regeneration for the subsequent reproduction. It should also be recognized that programmed cell death is often associated with growth, when the elimination of unwanted cells can benefit tissue remodelling and regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Pérez-Garijo and Steller, 2015</xref>). It has been shown in <italic>Drosophila</italic> eye imaginal discs that apoptotic cells release Spi, the EGF ligand in flies, to promote the proliferation of neighbouring cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Fan et al., 2014</xref>). Whether estrogen-induced LM-PCD during mammary involution additionally facilitates mammary regeneration and tumor development is an interesting area for future study.</p><fig id="fig9" position="float"><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><title>Estrogen exacerbates mammary cell death, inflammation and adipocytes repopulation through distinct mechanisms.</title><p>Estrogen induces <italic>Ctsb</italic> gene expression in the mammary cells leading to increased pro-CTSB which is cleaved and activated in lysosomes. The increased active sc-CTSB further activates CTSD and CTSL. Increased CTSB activity enhanced lysosomal permeabilization during mammary involution resulting in the leakage of more activated CTS into the cytosol stimulating a heightened LM-PCD. Estrogen treatment also induces expression of <italic>Bid</italic> and <italic>Tnf</italic> gene which are reported to be involved in the induction of LM-PCD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Hennigar and Kelleher, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Stoka et al., 2001</xref>). The apoptotic protein BID is cleaved into the active tBID by the activated cytosolic CTSs. TNFα is known to induce LM-PCD via the ZnT2-mediated zinc accumulation in lysosomes, leading to PCD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Hennigar and Kelleher, 2015</xref>). Estrogen stimulates neutrophil infiltration into the involuting mammary tissue via CXCR2 signalling by up-regulating CXCR2 and its ligands CXCL2, CXCL3, CXCL5 in neutrophils in a autocrine fashion. Meanwhile, estrogen promotes the expression of numerous proinflammatory genes such as <italic>Trem1, Trem3, Il1b, S100a8, S100a9</italic> in neutrophils that likely heighten mammary inflammation. Estrogen induction of genes coding for adipogenic proteins (e.g. CEBPB, Adig and Egr2), for extracellular matrix remodelling enzymes (e.g. Mmp19, Mmp3, Mmp8, Ptx3, Col8a2, Has2) and for Cox-2 etc can facilitate adipocyte repopulation. In addition, estrogen-induced monocytes infiltration and macrophage activity may further contribute to estrogen-induced adipocyte repopulation.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-57274-fig9-v2.tif"/></fig><p>Both circulating and tissue neutrophils are known to undergo functional and phenotypic changes during cancer development and under other pathological conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Sagiv et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Nicolás-Ávila et al., 2017</xref>). The observation that neutrophils in the mammary tissue during mammary involution respond to estrogen distinctively from that of nulliparous mice suggests that mammary neutrophils in these two developmental stages are functionally and phenotypically different due to epigenetic differences. Since estrogen promotes mammary tumor growth in mice undergoing mammary involution but not in nulliparous mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Chung et al., 2017</xref>), it is tempting to speculate that neutrophils in inflammatory breast cancer may be responsive to the pro-inflammatory effect of estrogen and promote tumor development.

Cells were maintained in DMEM containing 2 mM L-glutamine and 7.5% fetal calf serum (FCS) (HyClone) and kept at 37°C in a humidified 5% carbon dioxide and 95% air atmosphere.</p><p>For estrogen treatment, phenol-red free DMEM supplemented with 2 mM L-glutamine and 5% DCC-FCS (fetal calf serum treated with dextran-coated charcoal) was used. Treatment of FCS with dextran-coated charcoal was performed to remove steroid hormones present in the FCS. MCF7-caspase3(+) cells were plated at 150 k in 6-well plate (Corning) with the DCC-FCS supplemented medium. After 48 hr, the medium was replaced, and cells were treated with either TNFα (ProSpec) diluted in 1xPBS or vehicle control. One hour after TNFα treatment, cells were then treated with 10 nM 17β-estradiol (E2) diluted in 100% ethanol or vehicle control. MCF7-caspase3(+) cells were harvested for analysis 24 hr after E2 treatment. Both floating dead cells and the adherent live cells were collected. Harvested cells were resuspended in 1xPBS and stained with 0.1 μg PI per 100 ul of 1xPBS for 15 min at room temperature. After staining, 400 μl of 1xPBS were added and cells were immediately analyzed with the flow cytometer.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Graphs were plotted using the mean value with the standard error of the mean (SEM). When comparing two groups, statistical significance was determined using a two-tailed unpaired student’s t-test. When comparing between more than two groups, one-way ANOVA followed by post-hoc turkey test was performed. All statistical analysis was performed using the GraphPad Prism seven software. p-value:&lt;0.05 (*),&lt;0.01 (**),&lt;0.001 (***),&lt;0.0001 (****).</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This research is funded the Ministry of Education of Singapore.

Previous studies have unraveled different molecular mechanisms of mammary gland involution (see a previous summary PMID: 30448440). The authors highlighted that estrogen causes mammary involution by stimulating the accumulation of neutrophils, sculpturing the pro-inflammatory microenvironment, facilitating adipocytes differentiation, and causing lysosome-related programmed death of mammary cells. These findings are interesting, but further efforts are needed to nail down some of the major conclusions and to clarify the underlying mechanisms.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) A major concern is about several discoveries on neutrophils. The contribution of neutrophils during estrogen-induced mammary involution should be cautiously defined with solid experimental evidence. Do other immune cell populations, such as macrophages, actively participate in this process? Does Ly6G antibody efficiently deplete neutrophils, rather than masking the labeling of Gr1 antibody (for validation)? As neutrophils have short half-life, secret lots of inflammatory mediators, and quickly replenish from BM progenitors, this point is important. The possible coordinations between neutrophils and other immune cells (e.g. macrophages, monocytes), and their relative importance at different stages of mammary involution can be examined and discussed (see a previous summary PMID: 24952477). In addition, more evidences are needed to prove whether the recruitment of neutrophils depends on a positive-feedback loop of CXCL1 and CXCL2. Quality controls are needed for the application of inhibitors.</p><p>2) Another major concern is about estrogen-triggered mammary cell death. How do ERα, ERβ or death receptor-mediated signals contribute to this process? Does estrogen-induced programmed cell death exclusively rely on lysosome leakage and related effector molecules? Have the authors tested the existence of other cell death modalities? Does estrogen-induced cell death augment local inflammation and perhaps the accumulation of immune cell populations?</p><p>3) The authors may consider to rephrase/weaken some of their claims and reorder the display of some of their results.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>Dr. Valerie Lin discovered some interesting links between estrogen signals and the differentiation and programmed death of mammary cells, as well as the formation of pro-inflammatory microenvironment, which facilitate post-partum mammary involution and presumably parity-associated breast cancer. They also demonstrated that mammary gland-infiltrating neutrophils emerge as a major immune cell participant during this process.</p><p>1) Dr Shengtao Zhou reported that ERβ has potent antitumor effects, which suppress lung metastasis by recruiting antitumor neutrophils to the metastatic niche. It is recommended to carefully address whether estrogen specifically target ERα or ERβ on post-weaning mammary cells and infiltrating neutrophils in this setting.</p><p>2) Perhaps a missing point is whether estrogen-induced mammary cell death subsequently cause inflammation (presumably augmenting neutrophil accumulation), since several cell death modalities has been associated to inflammation via the release of danger molecules.</p><p>3) Besides lysosome-mediated PCD, can estrogen induce other cell death modalities, such as pyroptosis, necroptosis, ferroptosis, which are all caspase 3/7/8-independent? It is important to make a clear conclusion.</p><p>4) Since the synthetic estrogen regulate the differentiation associated genes of fat cells and accelerated LM-PCD. Does estrogen affect lipid metabolic pathways? How does this metabolic remodeling affect cell death and differentiation of adipocytes and the function of neutrophils? By carefully going over the Seq data, the authors may add more important discussions.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>In this study, Chew Leng Lim et al. determined the diverse effects of Estrogen exposure on neutrophil infiltration, inflammation responses, cell death and adipocytes repopulation in mice models. While the authors revealed some new findings, this study suffers from obvious defects, including overdependence on the use of chemical inhibitors, lack of in-depth mechanistic investigation as well as unfocused research topics.</p><p>1) In addition to neutrophil, estrogen exposure also induced macrophage infiltration, while &quot;neutrophil&quot; deletion by using anti-Ly6G antibody obviously reduced the infiltration of macrophage (Figure 2—figure supplement 1). Therefore, the role of macrophage in Estrogen exposure-induced biological responses should be deeply determined.</p><p>2) Since anti-Ly6G antibody also reduced macrophage infiltration significantly, it is very likely macrophage play a pivotal role in Estrogen exposure-regulated gene expressions and cellular phenotypes. Therefore, the conclusion that 88% of estrogen-regulated genes are mediated through neutrophil is not solid. This point should be addressed by specific deletion of macrophage and neutrophil, individually.</p><p>3) The source of CXCL1/CXCL2 upon estrogen exposure should be further investigated. In Figure 8, the authors indicated that CXCL1 and CXCL2 are produced by existing neutrophil. Further evidence to support this should be provided.</p><p>4) Many biological and small molecule inhibitors, including anti-Ly6G antibody, PAQ (S100a9 inhibitor), CXCR2 antagonist SB225002, etc, have been frequently used in this study. However, the effects and specificity of some of these agents have not been well validated during the study. The use of genetic mice models for critical signaling pathways is highly suggested.</p><p>5) Figure 5, The critical role of CTSB in the activation of CTSD/CTSL and induction of LM-PCD upon E2B treatment should be validated by downregulation of CTSB expression pharmacologically or genetically.</p><p>6) The data presented in Figure 7 based on the analysis in a single cell line is not reliable.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>This paper reported that estrogen can accelerate mammary involution by exacerbating mammary inflammation, inducing programmed cell death, and promoting adipocytes repopulation, that the effects of estrogen on the expressions of genes during mammary involution are majorly mediated by neutrophils, and that estrogen promotes mammary LM-PCD independent of neutrophils by inducing the expression and activity of lysosomal cathepsins and other pro-apoptotic markers such as <italic>Bid</italic> and <italic>Tnf</italic>. These findings are potentially interesting, and could expand the functions of estrogen. However, there is a lack in mechanistic insight into these observations. I. The mechanism underlying estrogen-induced cell death needs to be further explored. For example, what kind of player(s) connects estrogen with cell death? Whether TNF-α plays a role in linking estrogen to cell death? Is there any enrichment of cell death genes associated with the estrogen treatment in RNA-Seq data? Why the artificial MCF-7/Caspase-3 cells were used? The results about MCF-7/Caspase-3 cells showed that estrogen promoted TNF-α-induced apoptosis, rather than lysosomes-associated cell death. Maybe the authors should try MCF-10A cells as the model. II. Based on the data on Figure 4, it is not so convincible to conclude that neutrophils are involved in adipocytes repopulation during mammary involution normally, please see also Issues#3. The authors need to re-consider the relationship between these data and the conclusion. Maybe they should re-describe these results or modify the conclusion. III. The most interesting finding is that estrogen does not trigger the similar biological actions in age-matched nulliparous mammary tissue. However, this study does not figure out the molecular mechanism underneath the difference between the functions of estrogen in involutional and nulliparous mammary tissues. At least, the author should discuss about the potential possibilities.</p><p>Other issues:</p><p>1) Quantification in Figure 1B should indicate the fractions, for example, No. cells of total or area. The data in Figure 1C, except Csn2, were not described in the content, and these data should be associated with adipogenesis. As for Figure 1D, no any description was presented about Ly6G, and in fact, it was described in the second part of Results section. Supplemental Figure 2 was mentioned in the content before Supplemental Figure 1. The first part of results was very important for readers to understand the paper, but these problems confuse the readers.</p><p>2) &quot;E2B treatment alone without the antagonist (E2B+DMSO) lead to an expected 1.57-fold increase (p=0.0082) in mammary neutrophils as compared to the Ctrl+DMSO&quot;. Should &quot;1.57-fold&quot; be &quot;2.57-fold&quot; or something other? It is not the case based on the data in Figure 3Ci.</p><p>3) In Figure 4B, upon neutrophil depletion, <italic>Cebpb</italic> and <italic>Cebpd</italic> were already increased, which could limit their further enhancement when treated with E2B. As for Adig and Egr2, it seemed that they also apparently increased. In Figure 4D, the data had the similar problem to those in Figure 4B. No description about Figure 4E and 4F was found in the content. Overall, these data put it in question that estrogen-induced adipocyte repopulation is associated with the induction of adipogenic and tissue remodeling genes through neutrophils.</p><p>4) &quot;This suggests that the up-regulation of <italic>Ctsb</italic> expression by E2B is a direct event independent of STAT3 activation&quot;. These data in Figure 5B could not demonstrate that <italic>Ctsb</italic> expression is the direct event of E2B. In Figure 5D, why the lysosomal pellet fractions showed no lysosomal proteins, such as catheptins. In Figure 5A, at least the protein level of TNF-α should be measured, because it was very important for the functions of E2B, based on the data in Figure 6.</p><p>5) In Figure 6, TNF induces p-STAT3 while Figure 5A shows E2 induces TNF expression (mRNA), but no p-STAT3 was increased in Figure 5B. The increased mRNA does not mean the increased protein. Please measure the TNFα proteins in Figure 5A (See Issue#4). The MCF-7/Casp3 model seems not to well support the conclusion. The data in Figure 6 are about typical apoptosis not the lysosomes-associated cell death involved in the functions of estrogen as revealed in this study.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.57274.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) A major concern is about several discoveries on neutrophils.

During sterile inflammation, infiltrated neutrophils was known to recruit macrophages into the tissue from the circulation [1]. We also reported that estrogen induced recruitment of monocytes [2] (Supplementary Figure 2), although the functional consequence of this recruitment has not been looked at. Additionally, neutrophils depletion reduced mammary monocytes, albeit not to a statistically significant degree. Macrophages have been reported to be critical for cell death and adipocyte repopulation during mammary involution [3]. Whilst we did not investigate the role of estrogen-induced monocytes during mammary involution, estrogen is also known to regulate gene activity in peritoneal macrophages [4].</p><p>The possible involvement of mammary monocytes/macrophages in estrogen-induced adipocyte repopulation and LM-PCD have been discussed in the revised manuscript.</p><p>In Supplementary Figure 2 of the previous study estrogen significantly induced monocytes infiltration, but not F4/80 macrophages. Although it marginally (p=0.0538 for CD4 cells) reduced the percentage of CD4 and CD8 cells, this decrease is likely due to increases in the percentage of neutrophils and monocytes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Does Ly6G antibody efficiently deplete neutrophils, rather than masking the labeling of Gr1 antibody (for validation)?

Furthermore, neutrophils has been demonstrated to co-stain with both clone 1A8 anti-Ly6G and clone RB6-8C5 anti-Gr1 [5], suggesting that the two antibodies target different epitopes. In our hands through a number of experiments, Ly6G antibody consistently reduced blood and mammary neutrophils by more than 90%. Therefore, the use of Gr1 antibody clone RB6-8C5 to check for neutrophil depletion efficiency by Ly6G antibody (clone 1A8) is valid and reliable.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The possible coordinations between neutrophils and other immune cells (e.g. macrophages, monocytes), and their relative importance at different stages of mammary involution can be examined and discussed (see a previous summary PMID: 24952477).</p></disp-quote><p>This has been addressed above.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In addition, more evidences are needed to prove whether the recruitment of neutrophils depends on a positive-feedback loop of CXCL1 and CXCL2. Quality controls are needed for the application of inhibitors.</p></disp-quote><p>The involvement of CXCR2 signalling in neutrophil recruitment to tissues has been widely reported [6-9]. CXCR2 receives input from several chemokine ligand. In mice, CXCR2 ligands include CXCL1, CXCL2, CXCL3 and CXCL5 [10]. Our RNA-Seq analysis showed that estrogen up-regulated the expression of all four chemokines and neutrophil depletion abolished their upregulation (Figure 3A) Furthermore, we provide new data in Figure 3B that the upregulation of Cxcl2, Cxcl3, and Cxcl5 occurs in isolated neutrophils by qPCR analysis. We propose that the recruitment of neutrophils involves an autocrine mechanism, in which estrogen induces neutrophil release of chemokines which in turn recruit neutrophils through CXCR2 signalling.</p><p>We have revised the manuscript and according to this analysis. We also revised the model incorporating this new data.</p><p>As for the comment on a positive-feedback loop for estrogen-induced neutrophil recruitment, we agree that it is a logical and attractive deduction of our current data. Positive feedback refers to the mechanism in which a change triggers a response that enhances the change. It is logical to deduce that estrogen-induced upregulation of Cxcls in neutrophils (change) that causes neutrophil recruitment (response) would enhance Cxcl2 release (change) as more neutrophils are recruited. However, this would need a time course experiment to demonstrate an incremental increase of mammary neutrophils recruitment in response to estrogen overtime. This time course experiment would require a large number of mice (3 time points x 4 mice per treatment x 4 groups, at a minimum) and approval from institutional animal care and use committee. We would like to seek your understanding that we are unable to justify for this experiment to test a hypothesis that seems to be a logical deduction.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Another major concern is about estrogen-triggered mammary cell death. How do ERα, ERβ or death receptor-mediated signals contribute to this process?</p></disp-quote><p>To elucidate whether ERα or ERβ mediates the effect of E2B on various process of mammary involution, we evaluated the effect of ERα-specific agonist, (4,4',4''-(4-Propyl-[1H]-pyrazole-1,3,5-triyl) trisphenol (PPT) [11] and ERβ-specific agonist Diarylpropionitrile (DPN) [12]. Similar to the effect of E2B, ERα agonist PPT evidently increased the expression <italic>Ctsb</italic>, <italic>Bid</italic> and <italic>Tnf</italic> that are known to promote cell death (Figure 8A). PPT also consistently increased the protein levels of cleaved CTSB (sc-CTSB), cleaved CTSD (sc-CTSD), and cleaved CTSL (sc-CTSL and dc-CTSL) (Figure 8B), which are executioner proteases [13, 14]. In contrast, ERβ-specific agonist DPN did not have any effect on the gene expression of the death-inducing genes, or the activation of lysosomal proteases. These observations indicate that ERα mediates E2B-induced LM-PCD during mammary involution.</p><p>The results of PPT and DPN are described under the section “Estrogenic stimulation of mammary inflammation and mammary cell death is mediated by ERα”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Does estrogen-induced programmed cell death exclusively rely on lysosome leakage and related effector molecules? Have the authors tested the existence of other cell death modalities?</p></disp-quote><p>Estrogen-induced mammary cell death was evaluated at 48h post-weaning. Mammary involution in the first 48h is known as phase I (reversible phase) of mammary involution. In phase I, LM-PCD was found to be the major mechanism of mammary cell death [15]. The evidence obtained in this study also indicates that estrogen induces LM-PCD by inducing the expression of <italic>Ctsb</italic>, <italic>TNF</italic> and <italic>Bid</italic>, and the activation of CTSB, D and L.</p><p>Although we have not tested experimentally if estrogen induced other forms of cell death, we did look through the RNA-Seq data related to cell death and survival. We could not find any consistent pattern to suggest additional mechanism of estrogen-induced cell death. For example, we found that estrogen induced the expression of CRADD which is known to recruit Casp2 to promote cell apoptosis [16]. However, estrogen down-regulated Casp2 independent of neutrophils, which is inconsistent with the involvement of CRADD-Casp2 pathway in estrogen-induced cell death (Figure 5—figure supplement 1).</p><p>We also noticed that estrogen induces Ripk3 expression that is dependent on neutrophils (Figure 5—figure supplement 1), which we subsequently validated by qPCR. Ripk3 is an important modulator of necroptosis in which cells release reactive molecules like DAMPs (damage-associated molecular patterns) into the tissue triggering inflammation [17-19]. RIPK3 activation is important in the formation of neutrophil extracellular traps and the subsequent neutrophil death in venous thrombosis model [20]. It can be hypothesized that estrogen-induced upregulation of RIPK3 in neutrophils affects neutrophils survival, but this would require further evaluation.</p><p>We have added the following in the revised manuscript to lend support to the idea that estrogen-induced cells death is mainly mediated through LM-PCD: “Mammary involution in the first 48h is known as phase I (reversible phase) of mammary involution. In phase I, LM-PCD has been shown to be the major mechanism of mammary cell death, and it is independent of caspases 3, 6 and 7 [15]. [...] Hence, estrogen-induced increases of cytosolic cathepsins together with increase of <italic>Tnfα</italic> and <italic>Bid</italic> accelerate LM-PCD during mammary involution.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Does estrogen-induced cell death augment local inflammation and perhaps the accumulation of immune cell populations?</p></disp-quote><p>We have added the following in the Discussion:</p><p>“It is well known that dying cells release signalling molecules to stimulate inflammation and recruitment of phagocytic cells for the clearance of dying cells [21]. Likewise, estrogen-induced cell death may aggravates inflammation and immune cell recruitment. This may further contribute to neutrophil recruitment in response to estrogen in mammary involution model.”</p><p>We also added additional discussion under the section “Estrogen promotes LM-PCD during mammary involution”</p><p>“Mammary macrophages have also been shown to be important for mammary involution including LM-PCD [3]. Depletion of mammary macrophage in Macrophage Fas-induced apoptosis (Mafia) transgenic mice targeting CSF1R-expressing cells resulted in delayed mammary involution and loss of LM-PCD due to attenuated activation of Stat3. Since estrogen induced monocyte recruitment and is reported to regulate the transcriptional activity of macrophages [2, 4], we speculate that monocytes and macrophages played a part in estrogen-induced LM-PCD by heightening the proinflamamtory tissue environment, leading to further activation of estrogen-induced lysosomal proteases”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The authors may consider to rephrase/weaken some of their claims and reorder the display of some of their results.</p></disp-quote><p>We have gone through the manuscript to rephrase some of the writing.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>1) Dr Shengtao Zhou reported that ERβ has potent antitumor effects, which suppress lung metastasis by recruiting antitumor neutrophils to the metastatic niche. It is recommended to carefully address whether estrogen specifically target ERα or ERβ on post-weaning mammary cells and infiltrating neutrophils in this setting.</p></disp-quote><p>We added the following to the discussion “It should be recognized that ERβ has been reported to play a role in neutrophil regulation of tumour biology. Selective ERβ agonist LY500307 was found to reduce lung metastasis of triple-negative breast cancer cells [22]. This was associated with significant increase of infiltration of neutrophils in the lung. However, this was mediated by the up-regulation of IL-1β in cancer cells which promotes neutrophil infiltration to the metastatic niche. There was no evidence whether ERβ agonist regulated the phenotypes of neutrophils directly.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Perhaps a missing point is whether estrogen-induced mammary cell death subsequently cause inflammation (presumably augmenting neutrophil accumulation), since several cell death modalities has been associated to inflammation via the release of danger molecules.</p></disp-quote><p>This point has been addressed in revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Besides lysosome-mediated PCD, can estrogen induce other cell death modalities, such as pyroptosis, necroptosis, ferroptosis, which are all caspase 3/7/8-independent? It is important to make a clear conclusion.</p></disp-quote><p>This is addressed in revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Since the synthetic estrogen regulate the differentiation associated genes of fat cells and accelerated LM-PCD. Does estrogen affect lipid metabolic pathways? How does this metabolic remodeling affect cell death and differentiation of adipocytes and the function of neutrophils? By carefully going over the Seq data, the authors may add more important discussions.</p></disp-quote><p>GO analysis revealed that estrogen regulated genes in the category of &quot;Regulation of lipid metabolic process”. 67 genes are grouped in this category. We described and discussed the significance of top 5 most regulated genes in this category based on fold changes. A general impression is that the gene regulation by estrogen points to both pro- and anti-adipogenic effect.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>1) In addition to neutrophil, estrogen exposure also induced macrophage infiltration, while &quot;neutrophil&quot; deletion by using anti-Ly6G antibody obviously reduced the infiltration of macrophage (Figure 2—figure supplement 1). Therefore, the role of macrophage in Estrogen exposure-induced biological responses should be deeply determined.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that estrogen-induced increase in mammary monocytes (macrophages) may contribute to estrogen-induced involution. This point has been addressed above and in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Since anti-Ly6G antibody also reduced macrophage infiltration significantly, it is very likely macrophage play a pivotal role in Estrogen exposure-regulated gene expressions and cellular phenotypes. Therefore, the conclusion that 88% of estrogen-regulated genes are mediated through neutrophil is not solid. This point should be addressed by specific deletion of macrophage and neutrophil, individually.</p></disp-quote><p>Anti-Ly6G antibody reduced monocytes infiltration marginally (p&gt;0.05). Nonetheless, we also recognize the potential involvement of macrophages and infiltrating monocytes in estrogen-regulation of mammary involution and discuss as above. Our conclusion is “This 88% of the genes was regulated by estrogen either in neutrophils, or regulated as a result of neutrophil activities on other cells”, which include neutrophil-recruited immune cells such as monocytes. The effect of estrogen on the activity of macrophages and infiltrated monocytes was not investigated in this study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The source of CXCL1/CXCL2 upon estrogen exposure should be further investigated. In Figure 8, the authors indicated that CXCL1 and CXCL2 are produced by existing neutrophil. Further evidence to support this should be provided.</p></disp-quote><p>This point has been addressed in the early part of the letter and in the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Many biological and small molecule inhibitors, including anti-Ly6G antibody, PAQ (S100a9 inhibitor), CXCR2 antagonist SB225002, etc, have been frequently used in this study. However, the effects and specificity of some of these agents have not been well validated during the study. The use of genetic mice models for critical signaling pathways is highly suggested.</p></disp-quote><p>The specificity and efficacy of CXCR2 inhibitor SB225002 and the anti-Ly6G antibody clone 1A8 have been well-validated by other studies. Our data using these 2 reagents are consistent with those reported in the literature.</p><p>Paquinimod is a derivative of quinoline-3-carboxamide that has been shown to inhibit S100A9 activity through binding with S100A9 [23, 24]. The binding inhibits S100A9 dimerization or the formation of heterodimer with S100A8, thereby preventing the activation of RAGE or TLR4. However, reports on Paquinimod as an inhibitor of S100A9 in the context of neutrophils infiltration is not very well defined. In a study looking at the effect of Paquinimod on immune cell infiltration during sterile peritoneal inflammation, Paquinimod reduced necrotic tumour cell-induced accumulation of <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.sciencedirect.com.remotexs.ntu.edu.sg/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/monocyte">monocytes</ext-link> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.sciencedirect.com.remotexs.ntu.edu.sg/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/eosinophil">eosinophils</ext-link>, but not that of neutrophils [25]. Other study showed effectiveness of Paquinimod in inhibiting neutrophils-derived S100A8/A9-mediated inflammatory response, but not specifically on neutrophil infiltration [26, 27]. Contrary to our expectation, Paquinimod increased neutrophil infiltration and the expression levels of S100A8 and S100A9 in estrogen-treated mice (Figure 3—figure supplement 1). This suggests that the functional properties of Paquinimod have yet to be well characterized. The specificity of paquinimod during mammary involution require more evaluation. Bu we do not have the resources to conduct further experiments to understand why it behaved unexpectedly. We thought to include the data to benefit readers who may be interested in this unusual property of Paquiminod.</p><p>While we acknowledge the importance of validating the effect of S100A9 with genetic mice model, we did not have access to these mice to embark in these experiments for the current study. We moved on to characterize the involvement of CXCR2 using its chemical inhibitor SB225002.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Figure 5, The critical role of CTSB in the activation of CTSD/CTSL and induction of LM-PCD upon E2B treatment should be validated by downregulation of CTSB expression pharmacologically or genetically.</p><p>We thought about testing CTSB inhibitor CA-074ME but decided against it because it has already been shown to inhibit LM-PCD during mammary involution [15]. We believe that CTSB inhibitor will inhibit LM-PCD in our estrogen–treated mouse model, but it would not tell us whether it inhibits estrogen-induced LM-PCD or just the LM-PCD in general because they are the same process.</p><p>6) The data presented in Figure 7 based on the analysis in a single cell line is not reliable.</p><p>Since the observation of estrogen-induced cell death is novel under physiological condition, the purpose of the experiment in Figure 6 in MCF7-caspase3(+) cells was to show that estrogen can induce cell death when primed by certain proinflammatory factors such as TNFα. The results was reproducible from 3 independent experiments and hence proved that estrogen under certain pro-inflammatory condition can induce cell death.</p><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>I) The mechanism underlying estrogen-induced cell death needs to be further explored. For example, what kind of player(s) connects estrogen with cell death? Whether TNF-α plays a role in linking estrogen to cell death? Is there any enrichment of cell death genes associated with the estrogen treatment in RNA-Seq data? Why the artificial MCF-7/Caspase-3 cells were used? The results about MCF-7/Caspase-3 cells showed that estrogen promoted TNF-α-induced apoptosis, rather than lysosomes-associated cell death. Maybe the authors should try MCF-10A cells as the model.</p></disp-quote><p>The mechanism of estrogen-induced cell death is explained as the following:</p><p>“We propose the following model to explain how estrogen-induced <italic>Ctsb</italic> drives LM-PCD. First, increased gene expression and protein levels of CTSB lead to increased levels of activated CTSB due to heightened lysosomal activity in mammary cells with ongoing LM-PCD.

The parental MCF-7 cell line is caspase 3-negative and is not responsive to some apoptotic stimuli [33]. Caspase 3 expression sensitizes MCF-7 cells to apoptosis inducers [34], and is commonly used for studying cell death-related mechanisms. To ensure the model we use are sensitive to TNFα-induced cell death, we choose to use MCF7-caspase3(+). The result proved our hypothesis, but the mechanism of cell death in MCF7-caspase3(+) cells is not LM-PCD.</p><p>MCF-10A does not express estrogen receptor and hence is not suitable for the evaluation of estrogen’s effect.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>II) Based on the data on Figure 4, it is not so convincible to conclude that neutrophils are involved in adipocytes repopulation during mammary involution normally, please see also Issues#3. The authors need to re-consider the relationship between these data and the conclusion. Maybe they should re-describe these results or modify the conclusion.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that macrophages and monocytes may also be involved. We have addressed this point in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>III) The most interesting finding is that estrogen does not trigger the similar biological actions in age-matched nulliparous mammary tissue. However, this study does not figure out the molecular mechanism underneath the difference between the functions of estrogen in involutional and nulliparous mammary tissues. At least, the author should discuss about the potential possibilities.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer’s suggestion. Discussion of possible mechanisms and significance of estrogen’s plasticity on neutrophils is added in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Other issues:</p><p>1) Quantification in Figure 1B should indicate the fractions, for example, No. cells of total or area. The data in Figure 1C, except Csn2, were not described in the content, and these data should be associated with adipogenesis. As for Figure 1D, no any description was presented about Ly6G, and in fact, it was described in the second part of Results section. Supplemental Figure 2 was mentioned in the content before Supplemental Figure 1. The first part of results was very important for readers to understand the paper, but these problems confuse the readers.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for pointing them out.</p><p>In Figure 1B, the number of shed cells is the total of 5 random field per mouse. For CC3<sup>+</sup> cells, it is the average of CC3<sup>+</sup> cells of 5 random field per mice. The reason to present as total number of shed cells from 5 random fields is that it is harder to discern the shed cells with hyper-condensed nuclei and the number is small and more variable among different field. We though it is better to use the sum instead of the average. In contrast, identification of CC3<sup>+</sup> cells based on immunostaining is easier and there is less variation in different field so we took the average per mouse. The use of two quantification methods gave use more confidence in the data.</p><p>The data has now been put in order and described. We added description for Figure 1C and added more description for Figure 1D.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) &quot;E2B treatment alone without the antagonist (E2B+DMSO) lead to an expected 1.57-fold increase (p=0.0082) in mammary neutrophils as compared to the Ctrl+DMSO&quot;. Should &quot;1.57-fold&quot; be &quot;2.57-fold&quot; or something other? It is not the case based on the data in Figure 3Ci.</p></disp-quote><p>Again thank you for pointing out the mistake. The number have been corrected to 2.57 and 2.26, respectively.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) In Figure 4B, upon neutrophil depletion, Cebpb and Cebpd were already increased, which could limit their further enhancement when treated with E2B. As for Adig and Egr2, it seemed that they also apparently increased. In Figure 4D, the data had the similar problem to those in Figure 4B. No description about Figure 4E and 4F was found in the content. Overall, these data put it in question that estrogen-induced adipocyte repopulation is associated with the induction of adipogenic and tissue remodeling genes through neutrophils.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer’s interpretation of <italic>Cebpb</italic> and <italic>Cebpd</italic> data. Figure 4 has been now rearranged and described accordingly.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) &quot;This suggests that the up-regulation of Ctsb expression by E2B is a direct event independent of STAT3 activation&quot;. These data in Figure 5B could not demonstrate that Ctsb expression is the direct event of E2B. In Figure 5D, why the lysosomal pellet fractions showed no lysosomal proteins, such as catheptins. In Figure 5A, at least the protein level of TNF-α should be measured, because it was very important for the functions of E2B, based on the data in Figure 6.</p></disp-quote><p>Our interpretation is based on the following. First, STAT3 activation has been shown to induce cathepsin expression during mammary involution [35]. Although we did not detect an increase in p-STAT3 with estrogen treatment, we observed a significant increase in <italic>Ctsb</italic> expression in response to estrogen. This implies that <italic>Ctsb</italic> is up-regulated by mechanism other than Stat3. Second, <italic>Ctsb</italic> is a known estrogen target gene that is also induced in nulliparous mice (Figure 7). Therefore, we rationalize that estrogen induced <italic>Ctsb</italic> expression was independent of STAT3 activation.</p><p>Cathepsin was not detected in Figure 5D in the pellet (lysosomal) fraction because during mammary involution, there is increased lysosomal leakiness and cathepsins are all leaked to the cytosol [35]. Therefore, cathepsin was only detected in the supernatant fraction but not in the pellet fraction after sub-cellular fractionation.</p><p>We tried ELISA to detect TNF-α in mammary cell lysate. But the signals are too low to allow a reliable evaluation. On the other hand, the upregulation of TNF-α gene expression by estrogen has been consistent in different experiment settings including an experiment in our previous report [2].</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) In Figure 6, TNF induces p-STAT3 while Figure 5A shows E2 induces TNF expression (mRNA), but no p-STAT3 was increased in Figure 5B. The increased mRNA does not mean the increased protein. Please measure the TNFα proteins in Figure 5A (See Issue#4). The MCF-7/Casp3 model seems not to well support the conclusion. The data in Figure 6 are about typical apoptosis not the lysosomes-associated cell death involved in the functions of estrogen as revealed in this study.</p></disp-quote><p>The data in Figure 6 was meant to demonstrate that under an inflammatory condition, estrogen (which is more commonly known as a mitogen) can stimulate cell death. But we did not expect it to be via LM-PCD because MCF7-Caspase3(+) cells are different in many ways from the mouse involuting mammary tissue.</p><p><bold>Reference</bold></p><p>https://www.guidetopharmacology.org/GRAC/ObjectDisplayForward?objectId=69</p><p>1.
