system to study human diseases, an efficient methodology to generate precise point mutations at high efficiency is still lacking. Here we show that base editors can generate C-to-T point mutations with high efficiencies without other unwanted on-target mutations. In addition, we established a new editor variant recognizing an NAA protospacer adjacent motif, expanding the base editing possibilities in zebrafish. Using these approaches, we first generated a base change in the <italic>ctnnb1</italic> gene, mimicking oncogenic an mutation of the human gene known to result in constitutive activation of endogenous Wnt signaling. Additionally, we precisely targeted several cancer-associated genes including <italic>cbl</italic>. With this last target, we created a new zebrafish dwarfism model. Together our findings expand the potential of zebrafish as a model system allowing new approaches for the endogenous modulation of cell signaling pathways and the generation of precise models of human genetic disease-associated mutations.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>base editors</kwd><kwd>CRISPR/Cas9</kwd><kwd>animal models</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Zebrafish</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001665</institution-id><institution>Agence Nationale de la Recherche</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ANR-18-CE16 &quot;iReelAx&quot;</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Del Bene</surname><given-names>Filippo</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001665</institution-id><institution>Agence Nationale de la Recherche</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>[ANR-18-IAHU-0001</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Del Bene</surname><given-names>Filippo</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002915</institution-id><institution>Fondation pour la Recherche Médicale</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ECO20170637481</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rosello</surname><given-names>Marion</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004099</institution-id><institution>Ligue Contre le Cancer</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rosello</surname><given-names>Marion</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>UNADEV/AVIESAN</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Del Bene</surname><given-names>Filippo</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100011713</institution-id><institution>Worldwide Cancer Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>grant no. 0624</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mione</surname><given-names>Marina C</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>LILT -Trento</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Program 5 per mille</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mione</surname><given-names>Marina C</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Base editors, with improved specificity and expanded PAM sequence recognition, can be used in zebrafish for the rapid and efficient introduction of single base pair mutations.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>With the recent technological advances in precise gene editing, the use of zebrafish in genetic engineering studies has drastically increased in the last 5 years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Patton and Tobin, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Santoriello and Zon, 2012</xref>). The CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats)/Cas9 system is indeed a remarkably powerful gene-editing tool (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Sander and Joung, 2014</xref>) that enables the rapid and efficient generation of loss-of-function mutations in this animal model. This system relies on the specific binding of a sgRNA-Cas9 complex that initially interacts with DNA 20 base pair (bp) upstream of a NGG protospacer adjacent motif (PAM) sequence that triggers the Cas9 protein to introduce a double-strand break (DSB). This technique is nowadays widely used in zebrafish notably to produce knock-out alleles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hwang et al., 2013</xref>), and more recently, it has also been demonstrated that CRISPR/Cas9-mediated homology-directed repair (HDR) can be used to introduce exogenous DNA and single-nucleotide polymorphisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Prykhozhij et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Tessadori et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Wierson et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>Recently, a CRISPR/Cas9-based technology has been developed to precisely edit single bases of DNA without introducing DSBs in human cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Koblan et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Komor et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Komor et al., 2017</xref>). The method is based on the fusion of a Cas9-D10A nickase with a cytidine deaminase giving rise to a cytidine base editor (CBE). CBE converts C-to-T bases in a restricted window of 13–19 nucleotides (nt) upstream of the PAM sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). In zebrafish, a CBE was shown to work but with limited efficiencies, inducing less than 29% of gene editing and, in most cases, at least 5% of unwanted INDEL (insertion or deletion) mutations were also detected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Carrington et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Zhang et al., 2017</xref>). For these reasons, this editing strategy has not been so far favored by the zebrafish community. However, since this first generation of CBEs, several studies in cell culture have optimized and engineered new base editor variants with increased gene-editing efficiency reaching up to 90% without creating undesired INDEL mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Koblan et al., 2018</xref>). A recent study reported the use of a second-generation CBE to generate a zebrafish model of human ablepharon macrostomia syndrome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Zhao et al., 2020</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Efficient endogenous activation of Wnt signaling pathway and tumor suppressor genes targeting using BE4-gam in zebrafish.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic representation of the cytidine base editor technology.

Thus, base editing offers a complementary and powerful approach in zebrafish to introduce specific single-nucleotide variants into the zebrafish genome. Here based on these technological advances, we optimized these second-generation gene-editing tools in zebrafish. As reported in <italic>ex vivo</italic> studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Koblan et al., 2018</xref>), we tested different CBE variants and obtained highly efficient C-to-T conversion, reaching up to 91% efficiency without unwanted mutations and expanded base editing possibilities using a CBE variant recognizing the NAA PAM. Furthermore, compared to previous studies, here we used these tools to target Wnt signaling, thus proving that endogenous pathways can be modulated in their natural context. Finally, we demonstrated the power of this technology for introducing precise mutations in human cancer-associated genes with high efficiency in zebrafish and created a new fish model for dwarfism.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results|discussion"><title>Results and discussion</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>BE4-gam base editing for the endogenous activation of Wnt signaling pathway</title><p>To date, the main strategies used in zebrafish to study the constitutive activation of signaling pathways and to dissect their role during embryonic development or tumorigenesis were based on overexpressing mutated genes. To gain further insights and to complement these studies, an important requirement is to have the ability to maintain the endogenous genetic and regulatory contexts by generating mutations of endogenous genes <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p><p>To address this challenge, we decided to introduce an activating mutation in the <italic>ctnnb1</italic> gene coding for the key effector β-catenin of canonical Wnt signaling, a major signaling pathway during embryonic development which is activated in many cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Steinhart and Angers, 2018</xref>). It was previously shown that the mutation of the Serine33 of the human β-catenin protein into a Leucine prevents its degradation by the ubiquitin-proteasome system, leading to its stabilization and thereby to the constitutive activation of Wnt signaling pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hart et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Liu et al., 1999</xref>).</p><p>We first aimed at introducing this mutation in the genome of the zebrafish by using the Base Editor 4 fused to the gam domain (BE4-gam) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). This CBE was indeed one of the first variants of CBEs to show high efficiency of gene editing and fewer INDELs formation in cultured cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Komor et al., 2017</xref>). We injected the <italic>BE4-gam</italic> mRNA and synthetic <italic>ctnnb1 S33L</italic> sgRNA into one-cell stage <italic>Tg(7xTCF-Xla.Siam:GFP)</italic> zebrafish embryos to directly monitor the effect of the introduced mutation on the activity of the canonical Wnt signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Moro et al., 2012</xref>). Upon <italic>ctnnb1 S33L</italic> sgRNA injection, we observed an increase of GFP-positive cells at 1 dpf (n = 39/50 embryos) compared to the control embryos (n = 27 embryos) resulting from three independent experiments. By confocal imaging we quantified ectopic activation of the pathway in retinal progenitor cells and observed an average of 12 GFP-positive clones per retina, while GFP-positive cells were never detected in the retina of control injected <italic>Tg(7xTCF-Xla.Siam:GFP)</italic> embryos (n = 4 each) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>).

In addition, we also observed the conversion of another cytidine within the PAM [−19, –13 bp] window leading to a silent mutation (GAC-to-GAT (D)) in four of the eight analyzed embryos with up to 74% efficiency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><table-wrap id="table1" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title>Base-editing efficiency using different CBE variants.</title><p>Number of edited embryos randomly chosen after injection of <italic>CBE</italic> mRNA and sgRNA.

important developmental signaling pathways in their endogenous context, as we show here for Wnt signaling. Furthermore, several studies have implicated the S33L β-catenin mutation in tumorigenesis, making it possible to study the role of this oncogenic mutation in cancer development in zebrafish. In order to test the potential of CBE targeting in cancer modeling, we next decided to use it to target a series of tumor suppressor genes and oncogenes using the same editing strategy applied to endogenous β-catenin.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Base-editing strategies for the generation of human cancer mutations</title><p>Zebrafish is a powerful model system to study cancer genetics <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Cagan et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cayuela et al., 2018</xref>). However, a robust method for modeling cancer-associated mutations in zebrafish is still lacking to date. We decided to create predictable premature stop codons in tumor suppressor genes and to generate activating mutations in oncogenes of the RAS family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Li et al., 2018</xref>) in order to test the ability of CBEs to induce cancer-related mutations in zebrafish.</p><p>We first developed an automated script to rapidly detect codons allowing to generate nonsense mutations after a C-to-T conversion within the restricted PAM [−19, –13] bp editing window (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="scode1">Source code 1</xref>). Using this script, we designed a series of sgRNAs targeting in a selection of tumor suppressor genes. We induced the Q94* mutation in Tek in five of eight randomly chosen embryos, Q273* mutation in Bap1 in four of eight randomly chosen embryos and Q21* mutation in p53 in six of eight randomly chosen embryos as well as Q170* in p53 in seven of eight randomly chosen embryos by C-to-T conversions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D–G</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>). Among the different targeted mutations, the highest efficiency was achieved with the <italic>tp53</italic> tumor suppressor gene, for which we reached up to 86% of C-to-T conversion for the introduction of the Q170* mutation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>). To assess the presence of INDELs or unwanted mutations upon BE4-gam injections in our targets, we amplified, cloned, and sequenced all targeted loci. For <italic>tek</italic> 6 of 20, <italic>bap1</italic> 2 of 12, <italic>tp53</italic> (Q21*) 12 of 24, and lastly <italic>tp53</italic> (Q170*) 21 of 24 colonies showed precise C-to-T conversions, whereas all the other analyzed sequences were wild type, without any error or INDEL formation. Together these results show that, using BE4-gam, we efficiently targeted several genes implicated in tumorigenesis in zebrafish without generating any unwanted INDELs, unlike what was previously reported with the BE3 variant.</p><p>More recently, a new CBE variant, the ancBE4max, has been engineered and optimized in cell culture with increased efficiency compared to the classical BE4-gam, reaching up to 90% efficiency and very low rates of INDELs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Koblan et al., 2018</xref>). We therefore decided to use this new CBE variant to target the oncogenic mutation E62K in Kras and induce the creation of a Q8* stop codon in the Dmd tumor suppressor for which we did not obtain any C-to-T conversions or other unwanted changes using the BE4-gam in randomly chosen eight embryos for each condition (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>). By co-injection of <italic>ancBE4max</italic> mRNA with the <italic>kras E62K</italic> sgRNA, we were able to introduce the E62K mutation in four of seven randomly chosen embryos and we were able to reach up to 19% of editing efficiency in single embryo analysis. Another cytidine in the editing window was also converted and led to the generation of a silent mutation (CAG-to-CAA (Q)) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>). Similar to what we observed in the case of <italic>kras</italic> editing, we were able to obtain a Q8* mutation in the Dmd tumor suppressor in two of four randomly chosen embryos with up to 14% of editing efficiency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>).

The inserted PIM domain was codon optimized for zebrafish. Using this newly generated ancBE4max-<italic>Spymac</italic>Cas9, we were able to reproduce the human G13S mutation in Nras oncogene in zebrafish in 2 out of 4 randomly analyzed embryo with up to 19% of efficiency reached in single embryo analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>).

These results demonstrate that in addition to the classical NGG PAM it is now also possible to target NAA PAMs in zebrafish, thereby significantly expanding the range of cytidine bases that can be converted. For these new CBEs, we added a function in our script to choose the PAM recognized by the Cas9-D10A of the chosen CBE to generate the desired base editing (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="scode1">Source code 1</xref>).

With these efficient genetic tools that are now established in zebrafish, we have the possibility to rapidly test precise combinations of mutations identified in cancer patients.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Precise gene editing in the <italic>cbl</italic> tumor suppressor gene for the generation of human disease phenotypes in zebrafish</title><p>With the technological advances in CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing, zebrafish has become an even more attractive system for modeling human genetic diseases. Among the chosen loci to test the efficiency of the BE4-gam, we targeted the tumor suppressor gene encoding for Cbl, an E3 ubiquitin ligase, that is found mutated in Noonan syndrome patients presenting short stature and other bone malformations among several other phenotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Martinelli et al., 2010</xref>). In human, activating mutations in the <italic>fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3</italic>) gene are a leading cause of dwarfism achondroplasia and related dwarf conditions. Indeed, FGFR3 hyperactivation triggers intracellular signaling within the chondrocytes of the growth plate which terminates its proliferation and bone growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Harada et al., 2009</xref>). Interestingly, another study based on <italic>in vitro</italic> systems reported that some of these activating mutations in <italic>FGFR3</italic> disrupt c-Cbl-mediated ubiquitination that serves as a targeting signal for lysosomal degradation and termination of receptor signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cho et al., 2004</xref>). Using the CBE BE4-gam as previously described, we obtained up to 50% of gene-editing efficiency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>), with 80% of the analyzed embryos showing the expected editing (n = 10 randomly analyzed embryos). Four of 15 adults carried the Cbl W577* mutation in germ cells and one of these carriers transmitted it to 28% of its F1 offspring (44 of 153 analyzed fish carried the mutation). The target sequence was analyzed in the F1 embryos and no INDELs were found (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). The zygotic homozygous mutant fish (<italic>cbl<sup>−/−</sup></italic>) deriving from the incross of two heterozygous parents (<italic>cbl<sup>+/−</sup></italic>) did not develop any obvious phenotype and could be grown to adulthood. This could be due to the fact that in zebrafish, maternal factors stored as mRNAs and proteins in the egg can compensate for zygotic loss of function during embryonic stages. In order to obtain maternal-zygotic mutants (<italic>MZ cbl<sup>−/−</sup></italic>) that lacked wild-type <italic>cbl</italic> mRNAs and proteins provided by the mother, <italic>cbl<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mutant parents were incrossed. As controls, the <italic>cbl<sup>+/+</sup></italic> siblings of the <italic>cbl<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mutant fish were incrossed in parallel. Interestingly, 24% of the <italic>MZ cbl<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mutants displayed a significantly reduced overall growth and size by 3 months post-fertilization, while 100% of the progeny of the <italic>cbl<sup>+/+</sup></italic> sibling fish showed a normal body size (means: 2.7 cm for the wild-type controls and 1.96 cm for the dwarf <italic>MZ cbl<sup>−/−</sup></italic>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C,D</xref>). Furthermore, this dwarf phenotype was never observed in any of the fish derived from the incrosses of the wild-type stocks used to generate this mutant line, while it was observed in the progeny of two other crosses of the <italic>cbl<sup>−/−</sup></italic> line. Although we cannot formally exclude the presence of a distinct maternal zygotic mutation linked to the <italic>cbl<sup>W577*</sup></italic> allele, our data strongly support the role of Cbl W577* in the observed phenotype. Four germline mutations located in the RING domain of Cbl (Q367P, K382E, D390Y, and R420Q) have been previously identified and associated to Noonan syndrome and related phenotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Martinelli et al., 2010</xref>). Our results are in line with the growth defect phenotypes observed in these patients and directly implicate Cbl loss-of-function as a cause of bone malformations in an animal model. In addition, a point mutation in zebrafish Cbl (H382Y) has been implicated in myeloproliferative disorders. Unlike our mutant, <italic>cbl<sup>H382Y</sup></italic> mutant fish do not survive to adulthood, suggesting that the Cbl<sup>W577*</sup> premature stop reported here may have different consequences on the multiple functions of Cbl (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Peng et al., 2015</xref>). Although not lethal, it would be of interest to assess whether any hematopoietic defects are present in our <italic>MZ cbl<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mutants or whether this phenotype is only linked to the Cbl<sup>H328Y</sup> substitution found in the <italic>LDD731</italic> zebrafish mutant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Peng et al., 2015</xref>).

Another more recent study employed the ancBE4max variant in zebrafish with a slight difference of efficiency that might be due to the choice of the specific locus targeted, the synthesis of the sgRNA (homemade <italic>vs</italic> commercially synthetized) and the injection mode (yolk <italic>vs</italic> cell) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Carrington et al., 2020</xref>). More recently, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Zhao et al., 2020</xref> have shown similar efficiencies as we obtained in our study. To expand the gene-editing possibilities in this animal model, we established in addition a new editor variant recognizing the NAA PAM. Using these approaches, we first performed the endogenous and constitutive activation of Wnt signaling by introducing the S33L mutation in β-catenin. In addition, we demonstrated using these strategies that we were able to precisely target several cancer-associated genes for which so far only transgenic over-expressions or imprecise deletions were used to elucidate their functions.

Our approach could thus be applied in zebrafish for the precise modeling of complex combinations of cancer-causing mutations in adult animal models as currently possible by transgenic overexpression or somatic gene inactivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Callahan et al., 2018</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type (species) or resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Genetic reagent (<italic>Danio rerio</italic>)</td><td><italic>Tg(7xTCF-Xla.Siam:GFP)</italic></td><td>ZIRC</td><td>ZFIN ID:ZBD-ALT-110113–1</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td>pCMV_BE4-gam <break/>(plasmid)</td><td>Addgene</td><td>Addgene:#100806 <break/>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:Addgene_100806">Addgene_100806</ext-link></td><td/></tr><tr><td>Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td>pCMV_ancBE4max <break/>(plasmid)</td><td>Addgene</td><td>Addgene:#112094 <break/>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:Addgene_112094">Addgene_112094</ext-link></td><td/></tr><tr><td>Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td>pCS2+_ancBE4max-SpymacCas9 <break/>(plasmid)</td><td>This paper</td><td/><td>See Materials and methods</td></tr><tr><td>Commercial assay or kit</td><td>NEBuilder HiFi DNA Assembly Cloning Kit</td><td>New England Biolabs</td><td>Catalog# E5520S</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Commercial assay or kit</td><td>mMESSAGE mMACHINE T7 Ultra kit</td><td>Ambion</td><td>Catalog# AM1345</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Commercial assay or kit</td><td>mMESSAGE mMACHINE Sp6 kit</td><td>Ambion</td><td>Catalog# AM1340</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Commercial assay or kit</td><td>PCR clean-up gel extraction kit</td><td>Macherey-Nagel</td><td>Catalog# 740609.50</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Peptide, recombinant protein</td><td>Phusion high-fidelity DNA polymerase</td><td>ThermoFisher</td><td>Catalog# F-530XL</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Software, algorithm</td><td>SequenceParser.py</td><td>This paper</td><td/><td>See <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="scode1">Source code 1</xref></td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec id="s3-1"><title>Fish lines and husbandry</title><p>Zebrafish (<italic>Danio rerio</italic>) were maintained at 28°C on a 14 hr light/10 hr dark cycle.

revisions, shown below. We also include an acceptance summary that explains what the editors found interesting or important about the work.</p></boxed-text><p><bold>Acceptance summary:</bold></p><p>The manuscript by Rosello et al. represents a major advance in implementation of cutting-edge genome editing methodologies in the zebrafish. The study seeks to describe optimized tools for precise base editing in zebrafish and to demonstrate their effective application. Overall, this study demonstrates that cytosine base editing is an efficient and powerful method for introducing precise in vivo edits into the zebrafish genome, and will be of interest to scientists who use zebrafish and other genetic systems to model human development and disease.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Precise base editing for the in vivo study of developmental signaling and human pathologies in zebrafish&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Richard White as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Maura McGrail (Reviewer #1); Darius Balciunas (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential Revisions:</p><p>1) As you will see , all three reviewers are very supportive of the work. However, all have concerns about the clarity of presentation and discussion of the data, and offer some suggestions for how these aspects could be improved. Please see the individual reviews for details. These concerns should be straightforward to address.</p><p>2) Reviewer 1 suggests a number of studies in the literature that should be cited – please cite these studies or provide a response.</p><p>3) Please provide the additional details for quantitation and details of the protocols requested by reviewer 1.</p><p>4) There are some concerns over the dwarfism phenotype in the <italic>MZ cbl <sup>-/-</sup></italic> mutants. Please provide further genetic analysis to eliminate the possibility that this is a background mutation, or consider this possibility in your discussion. One suggestion from the reviewers is to cross a -/- female with a +/- male and see if the phenotype correlates with the genotype.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Abstract and Introduction</p><p>1) The Abstract opens with an emphasis on optimizing base editing in zebrafish, and then the application of this technology to examine signaling/cancer pathways and disease variants in human development and disease pathology. However, the results first demonstrate modeling wnt and cancer gene pathways with BE4 base editing, followed by testing an improved BE4 base editor ancBE4max, then on expanding base editor gene editing capability by altering PAM recognition, and ending with modeling human disease with BE4 base editing. The manuscript might flow better if all the BE4 data was presented, then the BE4-ancBE4max comparison, then the ancBE4maxSpmac. Possibly the authors had tried organizing the paper that way, but it didn't work well.</p><p>2) The Introduction should be edited to include citations of the latest advances in targeted integration and SNP introduction in zebrafish:</p><p>The recent publication by Zhao et al., An optimized base editor with efficient C-to-T base editing in zebrafish, December 2020 BMC Biology, should be cited in the Introduction. They reported a zAncBE4max cytosine base editor codon optimized for zebrafish, and showed it was more efficient than BE3 at precision editing at 6 loci. Zhao et al., also created a zebrafish model of human ablepharon macrostomia syndrome (AMS) using base editing to introduce the twist2 p.E78K variant. The authors could emphasize what is distinct about the current study, which is a direct comparison of BE4, ancBE4max, and ancBE4maxSpymac, in addition to the signaling pathway and disease modeling.</p><p>Please remove or edit the statement that targeted integration by HDR is not efficient in zebrafish. This is no longer the case. Efficient strategies for introduction of exogenous DNA and SNPs by HDR in the zebrafish germline has been rigorously demonstrated in the literature and should be cited: Efficient precision targeted integration of exogenous DNA directed by short homology was reported by Essner, McGrail and colleagues (Wierson et al., 2020); introduction of human tp53 SNP variants using oligonucleotide templates was reported by Berman and colleagues (Prykhozhij et al., 2018). The authors could suggest that base editing offers a complementary and powerful approach to introduce specific single nucleotide variants into the zebrafish genome, if alternative methods such as using oligonucleotide templates aren't effective at a particular locus.</p><p>Results and Discussion</p><p>1) Provide the complete spelling of BE4-gam.</p><p>2) Figure 1 The authors demonstrate highly efficient base editing with BE4-gam in 4 zebrafish cancer genes, with introduction of predictable, known cancer variants into each. It would be helpful to include the sequence of the entire target site with PAM for each gene in Figure 1.</p><p>Figure 1 B-C: The authors introduce the wnt pathway activating mutation TCA (Serine) to TTA (Leucine) into ctnnb1 B-catenin using cytidine base editor BE4-gam. To demonstrate activation of wnt signaling ctnnb1 base editing was done in the wnt pathway reporter line Tg(tcf:GFP), and the results indicate an increase in GFP signal in the developing retina at 1dpf. Figure 1B upper panel: The low contrast makes it difficult to see the images – they appear to be low magnification of the head/anterior region of the embryo. Quantification of the amount of GFP positive cells in control vs. ctnnb1 edited embryos or retina should be included, with the appropriate number of biological replicates noted.</p><p>Figure 1C shows EditR analysis of the frequency of base editing; no details on the number of embryos analyzed was included in the results although the information is in the methods (10 embryos analyzed). Since this is a techniques paper, it would be helpful to include details on how base editing was analyzed: the number of embryos, if they were analyzed singly or pooled, how the PCR amplicons were sequenced to generate sequence data for EditR analysis. The frequencies reported in Table 1 are a little misleading, since as the authors note EditR drops out samples below 5% editing efficiency. For example, 5/8 = 63%, but in reality 5/10 = 50%.</p><p>Figure 1 D-G The authors introduced nonsense C-T* mutations into three tumor suppressor genes with up to 86% efficiency. The sentence beginning &quot;This last result is …&quot; should be removed and replaced with an acknowledgement the similar efficiency reported by Zhao et al., 2020. Amplicons were cloned and sequenced, and the data show either precise C-T conversion or wildtype sequence without indels. But the data in the panels D-G indicates other changes at some frequency; some clarification of this difference would be helpful.</p><p>3) Figure 2. The BE4-gam base editor wasn't effective at introducing the oncogenic E62K mutation into Kras, or a Q8* nonsense mutation into the dmd tumor suppressor, so the authors tested the newer ancBE4max. It wasn't stated how it didn't work with BE4-gam, if it was a complete failure, or just indels were induced. Using the same sgRNAs ancBE4max was effective at introducing the edits at high efficiency. This is useful knowledge, if one base editor isn't working, the other could.</p><p>One of the most impactful and novel aspects of this study is the modification of ancBE4max to recognize a different PAM. The authors switched out the SpCas9 PIM domain (PAM-interacting motif) with Spymac PIM, which recognizes the PAM NAA. The data show relatively low efficiency of base editing at nras and tp53 (19% and 16%). Future work could optimize this base editor to increase efficiency.</p><p>4) Figure 3. Here the authors demonstrate efficient BE4-gam base editing in both somatic and germline targeting of the W577* mutation in the E3 ubiquitin ligase cbl. 4/15 adults carried the Cbl W577* in germ cells and transmitted it to 28% of their F1 offspring (44/153). Remarkably, all of the F1 offspring that inherited the precise W577* allele. Data from multiple loci is needed to obtain a frequency of germline transmission of precise base edited alleles.</p><p>24% of <italic>MZ cbl <sup>-/-</sup></italic> adults show a short stature phenotype in comparison to MZ clb <sup>+/+</sup> siblings, and the authors claim this is a new model of dwarfism. Without details on the genetics used to establish the cbl mutant line, it's unclear if the phenotype is linked to the base edited allele or is in the background. If the fish were inbred without first establishing outcrossed F2 generation adults, it's possible this is due to background mutations. More rigorous genetic analysis or inclusion of details would strengthen the validity of the disease model.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>My most significant concern has to do with the way editing data is described throughout the manuscript. To take a specific example, one might infer from Figure 1C (including figure legend) that substitution of Serine 33 for Leucine in b-catenin is &gt;70% efficient. But is it? Based on Supplementary Table 3, editing of C13 was only detected in 5/8 embryos analyzed (62.5%), with efficiencies of 73%, 40%, 25%, 16% and 11%. Thus, average editing efficiency in positive embryos is 33%. If one were to include negative embryos, editing efficiency would be ~19% – which is still very good but quite different from 70%. I believe editing efficiency ranges must be presented in the main figures, perhaps as dot charts.</p><p>Along the same lines, it is not clear how the embryo imaged in Figure 1B was selected. How many embryos were scored for ectopic activation of wnt signaling reporter and how many were found positive? To what extent (for example, what were the numbers of GFP-positive RPCs in each)? Does the photographed embryo represent &quot;best case&quot; or &quot;average&quot;?</p><p>Given that C to T base editors may mutate any Cs within the editing window, it is important to present data from Sanger sequencing of individual amplicons, similarly to data presented for tek Q94*, bap1 Q273*, tp53 Q21*, tp53 Q170* (Figure 1D-G) and cbl W577* (Figure 3B). What about the ctnnb1 S33L amplicon from Figure 1C? Do the desired change (73% efficiency) and the silent bystander substitution (74% efficiency) co-occur at random? If that were the case, one would expect ~50% of sequences with both changes and ~20% of sequences with either single change. Or do both changes co-occur at much higher than random probability, as Figure 3C suggests? This would be extremely important if the second change was not silent but introduced a missense or nonsense mutation. For those scenarios, perhaps embryo 2 and embryo 5 (Supplementary Table 3) are worth highlighting as C15 substitution is not observed in them? This applies to other edits where significant fraction of additional C-&gt;T substitutions is observed: kras (Figure 2A) and rb1 (Figure 2D).</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>I have only relatively minor suggestions to improve the clarity of presented data.</p><p>Figure 1B: The number of embryos with increased GFP/ total examined should be indicated in the legend.</p><p>Figure 1C-G. It took this reviewer a long time to understand how these figures worked. Once I did, I felt it was a clear way of showing the data. However, some additional description in the legend would have been very helpful for orientation. The ACTG in the top corner was initially mistaken for sequence, rather than a color code, which likely contributed significantly to my early confusion. It should also be made clearer that the numbers represent % at that site, and the box color coding system should be clearly stated.</p><p>Figure C-G. It is not clear exactly what this data is from. Is it one embryo, a pool of embryos? How many sequences analyzed? A general strategy for sequencing is discussed in the methods, but it would be helpful to know the specifics of the data presented in this figure for each mutant.</p><p>It is not clear whether the python script used for sgRNA design will be made available.</p><p>In Figure D, I am unclear how one can have wildtype +/+ siblings in a cross with maternal zygotic -/- mutants. Wouldn't the mother have to have been -/-?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.65552.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential Revisions:</p><p>1) As you will see , all three reviewers are very supportive of the work.

The BE4-gam base editor wasn't effective at introducing the oncogenic E62K mutation into Kras, or a Q8* nonsense mutation into the dmd tumor suppressor, so the authors tested the newer ancBE4max. It wasn't stated how it didn't work with BE4-gam, if it was a complete failure, or just indels were induced. Using the same sgRNAs ancBE4max was effective at introducing the edits at high efficiency. This is useful knowledge, if one base editor isn't working, the other could.</p></disp-quote><p>We only obtained non-edited sequences using the BE4-gam without INDELs for the Kras and Dmd genes. We clarified this point in the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>One of the most impactful and novel aspects of this study is the modification of ancBE4max to recognize a different PAM. The authors switched out the SpCas9 PIM domain (PAM-interacting motif) with Spymac PIM, which recognizes the PAM NAA. The data show relatively low efficiency of base editing at nras and tp53 (19% and 16%). Future work could optimize this base editor to increase efficiency.</p></disp-quote><p>This is indeed a very interesting point that will be the focus of future investigations.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Figure 3. Here the authors demonstrate efficient BE4-gam base editing in both somatic and germline targeting of the W577* mutation in the E3 ubiquitin ligase cbl. 4/15 adults carried the Cbl W577* in germ cells and transmitted it to 28% of their F1 offspring (44/153). Remarkably, all of the F1 offspring that inherited the precise W577* allele. Data from multiple loci is needed to obtain a frequency of germline transmission of precise base edited alleles.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that our claim about transmission rate was wrong and corrected our result description in the main text. We now clearly indicate that this result reefers to a single F1 fish and we agree that more data would be needed to make a general statement.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>24% of MZ cbl <sup>-/-</sup> adults show a short stature phenotype in comparison to MZ clb <sup>+/+</sup> siblings, and the authors claim this is a new model of dwarfism. Without details on the genetics used to establish the cbl mutant line, it's unclear if the phenotype is linked to the base edited allele or is in the background. If the fish were inbred without first establishing outcrossed F2 generation adults, it's possible this is due to background mutations. More rigorous genetic analysis or inclusion of details would strengthen the validity of the disease model.</p></disp-quote><p>The possibility that the dwarf phenotype comes from a background mutation was addressed through the generation of control fish that we obtained by keeping the wild-type siblings from the <italic>cbl<sup>+/-</sup></italic> incross. The <italic>cbl<sup>+/+</sup></italic> controls in Figure 3 are from the cross of these wild-type siblings, following the same procedure as for the <italic>MZcbl<sup>-/-</sup>.</italic> We never observed dwarf phenotypes in these <italic>cbl<sup>+/+</sup></italic> fish neither in the <italic>cbl<sup>+/-</sup></italic> and <italic>cbl<sup>-/-</sup></italic> fish.

It should be noted that we have now kept this <italic>cbl<sup>+/-</sup></italic> line for 5 generations in our fishroom in the same genetic background and the dwarf phenotype was only observed when <italic>MZ cbl<sup>-/-</sup></italic> embryos were raised. In addition, the dwarf phenotype was neither observed in our wildtype stocks from which the <italic>cbl <sup>-/+</sup></italic> line was derived.

We now discussed these data in our manuscript as suggested.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>My most significant concern has to do with the way editing data is described throughout the manuscript. To take a specific example, one might infer from Figure 1C (including figure legend) that substitution of Serine 33 for Leucine in b-catenin is &gt;70% efficient. But is it? Based on Supplementary Table 3, editing of C13 was only detected in 5/8 embryos analyzed (62.5%), with efficiencies of 73%, 40%, 25%, 16% and 11%. Thus, average editing efficiency in positive embryos is 33%. If one were to include negative embryos, editing efficiency would be ~19% – which is still very good but quite different from 70%. I believe editing efficiency ranges must be presented in the main figures, perhaps as dot charts.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the comment and for this reason we presented the efficiency we obtained in single embryos in the Table 2. In the text we are careful to indicate the efficiency is in the best case obtained and we state always state the number of embryos in which we observed editing at detectable levels.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Along the same lines, it is not clear how the embryo imaged in Figure 1B was selected. How many embryos were scored for ectopic activation of wnt signaling reporter and how many were found positive? To what extent (for example, what were the numbers of GFP-positive RPCs in each)? Does the photographed embryo represent &quot;best case&quot; or &quot;average&quot;?</p></disp-quote><p>Given the mosaic activation of Wnt signaling when using our approach, the rigorous quantification of GFP+ clones is only possible in the retina where the Tg(tcf:gfp) Wnt reporter line is not active at that stage. Overall in 3 independent experiments, we scored 39 embryos with increased GFP in the CNS and imaged 4 representative embryos at the confocal microscope in the retina for each condition. We observed an average of 12 GFP positive clones per retina while this was never detected in control injected Tg(tcf:gfp) embryos. These results are implemented in the main text and in the Figure 1B legend.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Given that C to T base editors may mutate any Cs within the editing window, it is important to present data from Sanger sequencing of individual amplicons, similarly to data presented for tek Q94*, bap1 Q273*, tp53 Q21*, tp53 Q170* (Figure 1D-G) and cbl W577* (Figure 3B). What about the ctnnb1 S33L amplicon from Figure 1C? Do the desired change (73% efficiency) and the silent bystander substitution (74% efficiency) co-occur at random? If that were the case, one would expect ~50% of sequences with both changes and ~20% of sequences with either single change. Or do both changes co-occur at much higher than random probability, as Figure 3C suggests? This would be extremely important if the second change was not silent but introduced a missense or nonsense mutation. For those scenarios, perhaps embryo 2 and embryo 5 (Supplementary Table 3) are worth highlighting as C15 substitution is not observed in them? This applies to other edits where significant fraction of additional C-&gt;T substitutions is observed: kras (Figure 2A) and rb1 (Figure 2D).</p></disp-quote><p>We agree these are important comments for which we reported all the raw data in Table 2. In general, in our hands the frequency of mutations in other C bases present in the editing window depends on their localization, with a highest efficacy for the base that are at the center of this window. As the reviewer correctly pointed out, in embryos 2 and 5, we observe only editing on the wanted C at position 13 with no editing of the C at position 15, suggesting that these are independent events.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>I have only relatively minor suggestions to improve the clarity of presented data.</p><p>Figure 1B: The number of embryos with increased GFP/ total examined should be indicated in the legend.</p></disp-quote><p>Given the mosaic activation of Wnt signaling when using our approach, the rigorous quantification of GFP+ clones is only possible in the retina where the Tg(tcf:gfp) Wnt reporter line is not active at that stage.

It took this reviewer a long time to understand how these figures worked. Once I did, I felt it was a clear way of showing the data. However, some additional description in the legend would have been very helpful for orientation.
