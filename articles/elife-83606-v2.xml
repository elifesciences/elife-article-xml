multiscale, and highly interconnected interactions. Atrial and ventricular septal defects are the most common forms of cardiac congenital anomalies in humans. Atrial septal defects (ASD) show an open communication between the left and right atria postnatally, potentially resulting in serious hemodynamic consequences if untreated. A milder form of atrial septal defect, patent <italic>foramen ovale</italic> (PFO), exists in about one-quarter of the human population, strongly associated with ischaemic stroke and migraine. The anatomic liabilities and genetic and molecular basis of atrial septal defects remain unclear. Here, we advance our previous analysis of atrial septal variation through quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping of an advanced intercross line (AIL) established between the inbred QSi5 and 129T2/SvEms mouse strains, that show extremes of septal phenotypes. Analysis resolved 37 unique septal QTL with high overlap between QTL for distinct septal traits and PFO as a binary trait. Whole genome sequencing of parental strains and filtering identified predicted functional variants, including in known human congenital heart disease genes. Transcriptome analysis of developing septa revealed downregulation of networks involving ribosome, nucleosome, mitochondrial, and extracellular matrix biosynthesis in the 129T2/SvEms strain, potentially reflecting an essential role for growth and cellular maturation in septal development. Analysis of variant architecture across different gene features, including enhancers and promoters, provided evidence for the involvement of non-coding as well as protein-coding variants. Our study provides the first high-resolution picture of genetic complexity and network liability underlying common congenital heart disease, with relevance to human ASD and PFO.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>quantitative trait loci</kwd><kwd>genomics</kwd><kwd>cardiac congenital defects</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group

sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Congenital heart disease (CHD) is common with a neonatal incidence of 0.8–1%, placing an enormous burden on affected patients, families, and healthcare systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">van der Linde et al., 2011</xref>). High throughput sequencing has identified abundant examples of monogenic syndromic and non-syndromic forms of CHD; however, the majority represent complex multifactorial conditions of unknown etiology, with a significant role for polygenic disease, de novo mutations, and gene-environment interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Sifrim et al., 2016</xref>). Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified a small number of common CHD risk alleles, likely those of the largest effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Lahm et al., 2021</xref>); however, for the majority of clinical subcategories, none have been identified thus far.</p><p>Development of the four-chambered mammalian heart leads to the permanent separation of the systemic and pulmonary circulations through septation of common atrial and ventricular chambers. Septation co-evolved with air-breathing and involves the convergence of myogenic and non-myogenic tissues at the valvuloseptal apparatus of the atrioventricular (AV) junction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Moorman and Christoffels, 2003</xref>). This process is genetically vulnerable as septation defects occur commonly in the human CHD spectrum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Gruber and Epstein, 2004</xref>).</p><p>During fetal life, the inter-atrial septum functions initially as a one-way ‘flap valve’ to help divert systemic blood away from the pulmonary circulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Regulatory networks generated at the boundaries between different cardiac progenitor fields define the programs for septal development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">De Bono et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Rana et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Steimle et al., 2018</xref>). Initially, a muscular <italic>septum primum</italic> grows inwards from the atrial roof (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Anderson et al., 2003</xref>) associated with a mesenchymal cap at its leading edge. The <italic>septum primum</italic> cap and an additional mesenchyme at its base called the dorsal mesenchymal protrusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Burns et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Webb et al., 1998</xref>), then fuse with mesenchyme at the AV complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Deepe et al., 2020</xref>). Before its closure, the upper edge of the <italic>septum primum</italic> becomes fenestrated by apoptosis, forming a left-right communication termed the <italic>ostium secundum</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Anderson et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Moore and Persaud, 1998</xref>). A <italic>septum secundum</italic> forms as an infolding of the dorsal atrial wall in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Anderson et al., 2003</xref>) or as a specific muscular ridge in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Briggs et al., 2012</xref>), leaving an additional, prominent and offset interatrial communication termed the <italic>foramen ovale</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Burns et al., 2016</xref>), completing the flap valve apparatus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Atrial septal morphology in normal adult and congenital heart disease.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic of human fetal heart highlighting inter-atrial septal structures.

Our previous study of inbred mouse strains revealed significant variation in atrial septal anatomy correlating with PFO and ASA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Biben et al., 2000</xref>), with a genetic background as a major determinant. We established quantitative parameters of septal status including length of the <italic>septum primum</italic> (flap valve length; FVL), orthogonal width of the <italic>foramen ovale</italic> (FOW), and width of the open corridor in PFO (crescent width; CRW) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B and C</xref>). We found that mean FVL was strongly negatively correlated with the prevalence of PFO across a variety of genetic backgrounds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Biben et al., 2000</xref>) and, collectively, short FVL, large FOW, and large CRW were all strongly associated with PFO risk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Kirk et al., 2006</xref>). All traits were influenced by mutation of the cardiac homeodomain transcriptional master-regulator NKX2-5, pathogenic variants in which are strongly causative for ASDII in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Biben et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Schott et al., 1998</xref>). We performed a QTL analysis with an F2 design using QSi5 and 129T2/SvEms strains, representing mice with extremes of atrial septal phenotypes, identifying seven significant (logarithm of odds (LOD) &gt;4.3) and six suggestive (LOD &gt;2.8) QTL affecting quantitative septal traits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Kirk et al., 2006</xref>), indicating a complex genetic basis for atrial septation defects in inbred mice. The F2 design used in our previous study has the power to detect the most significant QTL underlying complex traits, but confidence intervals are usually large, and each may reflect the effects of multiple loci and can contain hundreds of potential candidate genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Darvasi et al., 1993</xref>). Therefore, increasing recombination has become the focus of fine mapping approaches including the use of advanced intercross lines (AIL), generated by intercrossing inbred strains with extreme phenotypes across 10 or more generations to increase chromosomal recombination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Darvasi and Soller, 1995</xref>). A similar rationale underlies the establishment of multi-parental recombinant inbred strains, which capture &gt;90% of common genetic diversity among mouse species, used recently to study complex cardiovascular disease traits in adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Salimova et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Here, we advance our understanding of genetic complexity underlying atrial septal variation in inbred QSi5 and 129T2/SvEms mouse strains.

We also sequenced the genomes of the AIL parental strains and integrated variant analysis with transcriptome data from dissected atrial septa at different developmental stages in parental strains. Our results provide the first high-resolution picture of genetic complexity underpinning atrial septal variation in the mouse model, allowing the identification of QTL with high impact, candidate genes, and gene regulatory network perturbations that may have relevance to human PFO and ASD.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Selection of AIL mice - atrial septal phenotypes</title><p>In our previous F2 study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Kirk et al., 2006</xref>), adult QSi5 and 129T2/SvEms parental mice and F2 mice were scored for PFO as a binary trait, and three quantitative anatomical parameters of the inter-atrial septum (FVL, FOW, and CRW) that were found to be associated with PFO (see Methods, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Biben et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Kirk et al., 2006</xref>).

However, since this parameter was constrained to cases of PFO, for QTL analysis we considered only CRW (crescent width), defined as the length of the prominent crescent irrespective of the presence of PFO (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Kirk et al., 2006</xref>). Whereas there was a strong statistical effect of PFO on CRW in the F2 study (p&lt;0.001) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Kirk et al., 2006</xref>), this was lost in the F14 cohort (p=0.069) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). An additional observation was that mean CRW was positively associated with the risk of PFO in the F2 cohort, whereas in the F14 study longer CRW was associated with lower PFO prevalence (negative association). For these reasons and because CRW remains an ill-defined anatomical parameter, we did not consider this trait in selecting mice with extremes of phenotype in either the F2 or F14 study. However, post-hoc analysis for CRW QTL in the F2 study revealed a significant QTL on MMU7 (LOD = 4.58) and a suggestive one on MMU3 (LOD = 3.49) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Kirk et al., 2006</xref>).

However, the possibility that FVL and FOW QTL could be explained by variation in HW or BW has not been formally excluded. Thus, prior to the analysis of AIL mice, we performed a retrospective linkage analysis for HW and BW on F2 data. The HW of F2 mice was initially adjusted for factors with significant effects (age, sex, and BW) and we used the same LOD score criteria as in the F2 study (4.3 for significant and 2.8 for suggestive linkage) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Lander and Kruglyak, 1995</xref>).

Interestingly, the majority of these (15/18) were for FOW, with seven being normal and eight being cryptic QTL. Normal and cryptic QTL are anticipated to interact additively or in more complex ways in parental strains and individual mice, which may show phenotypes more extreme than parental strains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Kirk et al., 2006</xref>). The effect sizes of FVL QTL were somewhat smaller, individually 0.3–9% of the difference between parental means, with the majority (12/15) being normal QTL.

Then, to gauge the impact of the loss of interaction with SMURF1, we replaced tyrosine 279 of the hSMAD6 PPXY domain, predicted to be essential for SMURF1 binding, with alanine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Sangadala et al., 2007</xref>). Relative to WT, the Y279A variant slightly reduced SMAD6 repression at baseline, and the change was greater after BMP4 stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>). The R281P hSMAD6 variant (equivalent to R282P in mouse), also showed a slight reduction in repression similar to Y278A at baseline, however, the reduction was eliminated after BMP4 stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>), suggesting an alternative mechanism to simply loss of SMURF1 binding. To take a different approach, we tested the poly-ubiquitination status of the above hSMAD6 variants using co-immunoprecipitation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref>). After transfection of FLAG-tagged hSMAD6 vectors into HEK293T cells and treatment with proteosome inhibitor MG132 or DMSO control, lysates were precipitated using a FLAG antibody and ubiquitination of hSMAD6 detected by western blotting. In the presence of MG132, poly-ubiquitinated hSMAD6 WT, R281P, and Y279A were readily detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref>). Ubiquitination of G471S was lower, perhaps because ubiquitination depends on interaction with an R-SMAD.

The E14.5 network was driven predominantly by genes downregulated in 129T2/SvEms compared to QSi5 septa, i.e., the strain with the highest prevalence of PFO and most disadvantageous septal traits (shortest FVL, largest FOW). Highly connected sub-networks contained genes involved in biosynthetic and signaling pathways and macromolecular machines, including nucleosomes, ribosomes, mitochondria, and extracellular matrix (ECM) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D</xref>).

To explore the relationship between QTL variants and DEGs further, we assessed the enrichment of variants (129T2/SvEms vs QSi5) within and around DEGs underlying QTL relative to genomic features (enhancers, promoters, 5′UTRs, exons, introns, and 3′UTRs), comparing to variant distribution in non-DEGs. Enhancers were defined as regions showing enhancer histone (H) marks (H3K4me1<sup>+</sup> and/or H3K27ac<sup>+</sup>; H3K4me3<sup>−</sup>) within regions covering 50 Kb-250 Kb upstream and downstream of the transcriptional start site (TSS) for genes expressed in mouse embryonic stem cell-derived cardiac progenitor cells and cardiomyocytes, and whole E14.5 fetal hearts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Wamstad et al., 2012</xref>).

PFO and ASD are examples of complex binary traits of medical significance. One model for complex binary traits assumes an underlying continuous but unobservable variable (termed liability) with a threshold above which an individual expresses a phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Falconer, 1965</xref>). Quantitative parameters act as proxies for the assumed liabilities and significantly increase the power of QTL detection. Comparing F2 and AIL designs with identical parameters including sample size and marker density, the predicted confidence intervals of AIL QTL are <italic>t</italic>/2 times smaller than those of F2 QTL, where <italic>t</italic> is the number of AIL generations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Darvasi and Soller, 1995</xref>). This indicates that AIL is a powerful method for precise localization of QTL and also separation of linked QTL identified by an F2 design.</p><p>We previously mapped QTL underlying quantitative parameters of the atrial septum using an F2 intercross design and here applied the AIL approach for confirmation and fine mapping. The cascade breeding program generating the F14 AIL resource from 48 breeding pairs per generation came close to the practical optimum (100 animals produced per generation) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Darvasi and Soller, 1995</xref>). From seven F2 QTLs included in our AIL study, at least six were confirmed and substantially narrowed, whereas five F2 QTLs resolved into multiple peaks, and additional QTLs were discovered. Overall, 37 significant atrial septal QTLs were documented.</p><p>Among the three quantitative parameters studied here, FVL and FOW showed a similar pattern of linkage on most of the chromosomes. This is a new finding that was not evident in the F2 study. Furthermore, independent analysis of PFO as a binary trait strongly supported results for FVL and/or FOW on most chromosomes. As noted, of the traits analyzed, FVL has a larger variation between parental strains (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Kirk et al., 2006</xref>) and shows a stronger negative correlation to PFO prevalence among several inbred and mutant strains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Biben et al., 2000</xref>), as well as in both F2 and F14 mice. Collectively, these data suggest that many QTLs affect the formation of the primary and secondary atrial septa in common, and that FVL is a robust indicator for atrial septal morphology and risk of PFO.</p><p>CRW did not show a significant correlation to PFO in the AIL data and was, therefore, not found to be a satisfactory surrogate for the size of the open corridor in cases of PFO (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Biben et al., 2000</xref>). Nonetheless, we found five significant QTLs for CRW, only one of which overlapped with QTL for the other traits, suggesting that CRW is determined largely by different genetic elements to those governing FVL and FOW. As CRW is measured along the lower boundary of the apoptotic domain that generates the <italic>ostium secundum</italic> in septal development, it may relate to tissue remodeling subsequent to the apoptotic process.</p><p>As septal parameters may be influenced by heart size, we performed a linkage analysis for normalized HW across MMU11, where a significant QTL was discovered retrospectively in the F2 data, and indeed across all other chromosomal regions for which markers were selected. We confirmed and refined the position of the HW QTL on MMU11, and detected HW QTL on MMU2, MMU4, MMU9, and MMU13. Of these, only MMU2 has previously been linked with HW (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Rocha et al., 2004</xref>). Inter-trait correlation and linkage results showed that HW influences quantitative septal parameters in both F2 and F14 studies, but only in a relatively minor way (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). Importantly, HW and atrial septal morphology QTL showed limited overlap. We propose that HW is mostly determined by ventricular chamber growth as an independent parameter to the development of ‘primary’ myocardial components of the early heart tube, which have a lower proliferative index (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Moorman and Christoffels, 2003</xref>), and that of the mesenchymal and cushion components, that contribute to the formation of the inter-atrial septum.</p><p>Overall, we conclude that septal morphological variation and risk of PFO have a complex genetic basis in inbred strains of mice. Given that the analysis was restricted to the previously found QTL and the selected markers covered only a limited part of the genome, it is likely that the genetic complexity underpinning septal defects in the two inbred strains under study is even greater than revealed here. It is noteworthy that the two inbred lines in this study were previously selected for independent traits. For example, the QSi5 strain, used here because of its low PFO risk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Kirk et al., 2006</xref>), was bred for numerous traits related to high fecundity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Holt et al., 2004</xref>) and whereas this has facilitated the generation of &gt;1000 mice required for the AIL study, the genetic diversity that contributes to variation in atrial septal morphology may be limited by the prior genetic selection. High genetic complexity underpinning variation in atrial septal morphology may be expected, given the diverse lineage origins, tissue contributions, and morphogenetic networks contributing to septal structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Anderson et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">De Bono et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Deepe et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Rana et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Steimle et al., 2018</xref>). Extrapolating to the diverse outbred human population, we might conclude that potentially many hundreds of variants contribute to atrial septal dysmorphology, consistent with estimates of the number of inherited and de novo mutations discovered to date contributing to CHD more broadly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Jin et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>To create a list of protein-coding genes that could potentially contribute to differences in atrial septal morphology in inbred strains of mice, we sequenced the whole genomes of parent strains and then filtered for genes that lie under QTL (1-LOD drop-off), were expressed in the developing inter-atrial septal septum, and carried variants predicted to be pathogenic. The total list comprised 61 genes carrying 92 variants, resulting in an average of ~2.5 candidate protein-coding variants per QTL. Most of these genes lay within regions of high SNP density and 26% of them carried multiple variants. We further filtered for genes that overlapped the MGI list of mouse genes associated with cardiovascular phenotypes, and a curated known and emerging human CHD gene list (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alankarage et al., 2019</xref>). Eight genes (<italic>Cybrd1</italic>, <italic>Dst</italic>, <italic>Fxn</italic>, <italic>Lrp2</italic>, <italic>Mcam</italic>, <italic>Pgbd1</italic>, <italic>Sik3</italic>, <italic>Smad6</italic>) overlapped with curated lists. The detailed role of most of these genes in septal development has not been elucidated. Our follow-up study of the SMAD6 linker region variant R282P demonstrated a hyper-ubiquitinated state for this critical regulator of BMP signaling. The full mechanism and in vivo significance remain to be determined, noting that hyper-ubiquitination, in addition to affecting SMAD6 stability in vivo, could inhibit additional regulatory processes or interactions occurring across the linker region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Sapkota et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Xu et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Extending genome analyses, we determined the transcriptome of atrial septal regions of both strains at three developmental time points and calculated DEGs. By far the most significant <italic>STRING</italic> protein network for DEGs was at E14.5, with subnetworks with high connectivity associated with growth-related macromolecular cellular structures including nucleosomes, ribosomes, mitochondria, and ECM. Virtually all associated genes were downregulated in the 129T2/SvEms strain (showing less robust septal characteristics). Our findings suggest that there is a general septal growth and maturation deficit involving multiple septal components in the 129T2/SvEms strain at a relatively late stage (E14.5) of septal development. This idea is supported by the correlations between FVL and FOW (reflecting the development of the <italic>primum</italic> and <italic>secundum</italic> septa, respectively) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Kirk et al., 2006</xref>) and the strong concordance between QTL for individual septal traits and PFO discovered in this work. We hypothesize that differences in quantitative septal traits and PFO prevalence that we documented previously in an inbred, hybrid, and mutant strains of mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Kirk et al., 2006</xref>), relate in part to degrees of septal growth and maturation, and that higher septal growth and maturation facilitates better fusion of the <italic>septum primum</italic> and <italic>secundum</italic>. Careful elucidation of the differential growth parameters of septal components in parent strains across time may provide further support for this model.</p><p><italic>STRING</italic> networks identified three potential hub drivers of this depressed biosynthetic state in the 129T2/SvEms strain - genes for Ubiquitin c, and kinases AKT and PKA. Many genes encoding targets of these kinases were also up- or downregulated, potentially a network adaptation. We propose that variants in the 129T2/SvEms parent strain depress growth-related signaling pathways (including BMP, AKT, PKA, and SRC) and associated ubiquitin-related quality control processes, impacting septal growth and morphogenesis independently of chamber growth. In this light, it is interesting that CHD and cancer risk genes have recently been correlated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Morton et al., 2021</xref>). This could be a focus area for further investigation.</p><p>Our analysis of variant architecture under QTL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>) showed that variants (129T2/SvEms vs QSi5) were over-represented in differentially expressed atrial septum-expressed genes located under QTL across multiple gene features including enhancers, promoters, 5′-UTRs and introns. These data suggest a direct mechanistic link between the presence of non-coding (including cis-regulatory) as well as coding region variants in the differential expression of septal genes underlying QTL. This would represent a significant departure from a reductionist model whereby a single variant accounts for the impact of each QTL. Cis-regulatory variants are, therefore, candidate drivers of network perturbations revealed by <italic>STRING</italic> analysis.</p><p>Our results are consistent with Fisher’s 'infinitesimal' model whereby many loci (theoretically an infinite number) could each contribute to a small part of the liability for common disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Fisher, 1919</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Norton and Pearson, 1976</xref>), and also GWAS analysis of human disease that most often detect common risk loci of small effect. However, as in our previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Kirk et al., 2006</xref>), individual septal QTL can have significant effect sizes, demonstrating the power of the AIL approach to discern alleles of major impact. Indeed, all five predicted pathogenic coding variants highlighted in this study, including the <italic>Smad6</italic> variant, lay under QTL of moderate to high effect size (5.68–65%). It is possible that a limited number of high-impact variants are responsible for septal defects in certain AIL mice. This type of polygenic inheritance has been demonstrated recently in a human cardiomyopathy family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Gifford et al., 2019</xref>). Such variants may prove to have causative or modifying effects on atrial septal defects in humans, as exemplified by <italic>SMAD</italic>6.</p><p>Several findings speak to the complex genetic landscape of PFO. It is interesting that twelve out of the 37 QTL detected were cryptic QTL, with many being of moderate to large effect size (~5–70%; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>). Thus, cryptic QTL is frequently detected and individually appear to provide strong buffering effects against septal defects. Cryptic QTL has been detected commonly in other animal and plant QTL studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Rieseberg et al., 1999</xref>). The mechanisms of their action would be interesting to identify as they may reveal pathways that protect against CHD more broadly.</p><p>A further complexity is that, of five genes carrying predicted pathogenic variants highlighted in this study, four were found in the unexpected strain. For example, <italic>Cep164</italic> lies under a cryptic QTL (protective), whereas predicted pathogenic variants in <italic>Cep164</italic> were found in the 129T2/SvEms strain (showing worse septal status). The inverse can also apply – for example, <italic>Lrp2</italic> lies under a normal QTL, but variants were found in the QSi5 strain. Such findings suggest highly complex interactions within and between individual QTLs. As noted, 26% of predicted pathogenic genes, some known to be involved in heart development, carried multiple predicted pathogenic variants (<italic>Cep164</italic> carried seven). It would be reasonable to imagine that these alleles are null or have major impacts on gene function. Genetic compensation may also buffer the impact of such variants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">El-Brolosy et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Our results provide the first high-resolution picture of genetic complexity and multilayered network liabilities underpinning atrial septal variation in a mouse model. Elucidating the impacts of genetic variants under QTL at the individual gene level would be a daunting task; however, understanding higher level network control of septal development underpinning observed defects in septal macromolecular synthesis pathways is an important cardiac developmental systems genetics problem, which may have relevance to other congenital dysmorphologies. Our quantitative model offers opportunities to study the interface between genetic, environmental, and epigenetic inputs to common CHD and potentially other diseases in greater detail.</p></sec><sec

ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Biben et al., 2000</xref>). QSi5 is an inbred mouse strain that was bred from outbred Quackenbush Swiss mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Holt et al., 2004</xref>) at the University of Sydney, Sydney NSW, and was maintained as a breeding colony once established. QSi5 mice are also available from the Jackson Laboratory (strain 027001). As parental strains in our F2 study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Kirk et al., 2006</xref>), 129T2/SvEms and QSi5, they were selected based on having extreme values for mean FVL and prevalence of PFO, two indicators of atrial septal morphology which are strongly negatively correlated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Biben et al., 2000</xref>). 129T2/SvEms had the highest prevalence of PFO (75%) and shortest FVL (mean = 0.6 mm) among inbred strains and multiple crosses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Biben et al., 2000</xref>). QSi5 had the longest FVL (mean = 1.13 mm) and among the lowest prevalence of PFO (4.5%).</p><p>We randomly inter-crossed the original F2 mice for 12 further generations. The F2 mice were bred to produce 48 male and female pairs which were then stocked in 48 separate cages. We inter-crossed the mice in each cage to generate F3 mice. For the F3 × F3 and subsequent crosses, a cascading scheme was used in which a female mouse from one cage would be mated with a male mouse from the next cage. This breeding design, in which each pair contributes exactly two offspring (one male and one female) to the next generation doubles the effective population size and reduces the random changes in allele frequency due to random genetic drift over the 10 generations. Animals were bred and housed under Animal Care and Research Ethics approvals N00/4-2003/1/3745, N00/4-2003/2/3745 and N00/4-2003/3/3745 from the University of Sydney.</p></sec><sec id="s4-1-2"><title>Dissection and measurements</title><p>In total, 1003 AIL F14 mice were dissected. Of these, 933 had complete phenotypic data (475 males and 458 females). Phenotyping of each mouse including initial and fine dissections, determination of PFO status, and measurement of septal features, were all performed on the same day. As in the F2 study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Kirk et al., 2006</xref>), the thoracic organs including the heart, lungs, and mediastinum were initially dissected <italic>en bloc</italic> and stored in PBS. A tail biopsy was also taken from each mouse and snap-frozen for DNA extraction.</p><p>The following steps were performed under a Leica MZ8 dissecting microscope. The mediastinal organs were removed to expose the atria. Subsequently, the left atrium was opened to expose the atrial septum. We detected PFO by pressurization of the right atrium. The right-to-left passage of blood (or injected Orange G dye) across the inter-atrial septum indicated the presence of PFO. Measurement of septal features including FVL, FOW, and CRW was performed using an eyepiece graticule. FVL was defined formally, as in our previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Kirk et al., 2006</xref>), as the length of the flap valve from the edge of the crescent (proximal rim of the <italic>ostium secundum</italic>) to the distal rim of the fossa ovalis. The maximum width of the <italic>foramen ovale</italic> (<italic>foramen ovale</italic> width; FOW) was measured perpendicular to the FVL. Crescent width (CRW) was defined as the maximum width of the prominent crescent-shaped ridge, representing the proximal rim of the <italic>ostium secundum</italic> and edge of the flap valve as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Kirk et al., 2006</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-1-3"><title>Normalization</title><p>A general linear model (PASW Statistics 18) was used to analyze the effect of various covariates on the traits of interest (FVL, FOW, and heart weight; HW) considering a p-value of &lt;0.05 as significant (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp9 supp10 supp11 supp12 supp13">Supplementary files 9-13</xref>). FVL and FOW were significantly affected only by HW (p=0.002 and p=0.028, respectively) and the effect of other covariates including sex, age, body weight (BW), and coat color was not significant. However, we did not adjust for HW since QTL relevant to HW may also influence atrial septal morphology. On the other hand, HW was significantly affected by sex (p&lt;0.001), age (p=0.032), BW (p&lt;0.001), and coat color (p=0.042). Therefore, prior to sample selection and further analysis, HW was normalized for age, sex, and BW, although not for coat color so as to avoid missing QTL linked to coat color genes.</p></sec><sec id="s4-1-4"><title>Sample selection</title><p>Selective genotyping of extreme phenotypes is an efficient method to increase the power of QTL mapping (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Lander and Botstein, 1989</xref>). However, the benefits of this method decline with an increasing number of uncorrelated or weakly correlated traits. The focus of our study was to fine-map QTL underlying the main highly correlated traits (FVL and FOW) and a peripheral trait of HW. We did not consider CRW as a basis for sample selection since it was a less defined anatomical structure and, unlike FVL and FOW, it was not associated with PFO (see Results). For each trait (FVL, FOW, and HW), we selected approximately 100 F14 animals with extreme phenotypes. Given the overlap between the extreme phenotypes from different traits, 237 mice were selected by this method. To compensate for biases in selective genotyping in this study, the selection of extreme phenotypes was combined with a degree of random selection. Therefore, 163 mice were also selected randomly giving a total sample of 400 mice. The same number of males and females were selected from the breeding cages. Thus, the selected mice gave as equal as possible representation of males, females, and breeding cages.</p></sec><sec id="s4-1-5"><title>Marker selection</title><p>We searched genotype data from the Mouse HapMap project for potential informative single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) between 129T2/SvEms and QSi5 strains. In total, a set of 135 markers with an average interval of 2 centimorgans (cM) was selected to genotype genomic regions including the significant QTL from the F2 study (three QTL for FVL and three for FOW) and one QTL for HW (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp14">Supplementary file 14</xref>). In addition, a suggestive QTL for FOW on MMU9 (LOD = 3.43) was included in the AIL study as its peak covered the known ASD/VSD gene <italic>Tbx20</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Kirk et al., 2006</xref>). Fifteen extra markers were chosen to cover the whole peak of this QTL.

The method used was initially developed for an F2 design, but modified for an AIL using the methods described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Darvasi and Soller, 1995</xref>. Given the density of selected markers and the size of the genomic region covered by markers, a LOD score of 2 was set as the threshold level of significance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Lander and Botstein, 1989</xref>).</p><p>We used the 1-LOD drop-off to estimate the confidence interval of each QTL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Lander and Botstein, 1989</xref>). However, in some cases, two significant peaks were located close together and overlapped in the 1-LOD drop-off intervals. To determine whether these peaks reflected the same underlying QTL or identified the presence of independent QTL, we re-ran the linkage analysis using a model in which the marker closest to the higher peak was included as a fixed term (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>), effectively a simplified form of composite interval mapping but applied in a maximum likelihood framework (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kearsey and Hyne, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Wu and Li, 1994</xref>). Disappearance of the lower peak would indicate that two peaks represented a single QTL. On the other hand, if the lower peak remained significant, two peaks would represent two separate QTLs.</p><p>We have previously developed a QTL program in R to perform linkage analysis for PFO as a binary trait (presence or absence) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Moradi Marjaneh et al., 2012</xref>).

The additive effect for each QTL (a.qtl) was defined as the effect of one copy of the Q (QSi5) allele and calculated as (mean.QQ - mean.qq)/2 where mean.QQ is the phenotypic mean for genotype QQ and mean.qq is the phenotypic mean for genotype qq (129T2/SvEms allele). The dominance effect (d.qtl) for each QTL was defined as the difference between the mean.Qq (phenotypic mean for genotype Qq) and the midpoint between the qq and QQ means. Therefore, if d.qtl &gt;0, allele Q is (partially) dominant as Qq is moved towards QQ and if d.qtl &lt;0, allele q is (partially) dominant as Qq is moved towards qq. Attributable phenotypic variance for each QTL is the additive effect of the QTL, expressed as a percentage of the difference between parental means for that trait.</p></sec><sec id="s4-1-8"><title>Conversion of genetic maps</title><p>We previously defined the genetic positions of the F2 markers using an older mouse genetic map developed by the Whitehead Institute and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Dietrich et al., 1996</xref>).

Variants were filtered for genes expressed in the septal time course RNA-seq (see below), where a gene was defined as expressed if it had a counts-per million (CPM) &gt;1 in at least two samples. They were then converted to mm10/GRCm39 coordinates and submitted to the Ensembl Variant Effect Predictor (VEP) tool (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">McLaren et al., 2016</xref>). Based on VEP annotations, variants were classified as high-impact (VEP impact classification of ‘HIGH’), deleterious missense (<italic>SIFT</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Ng and Henikoff, 2003</xref>) ‘deleterious’ prediction), or non-high-impact deletions. High-impact variants were manually inspected in IGV and filtered out if the ‘HIGH’ impact classification was deemed inaccurate (for example, cases where an adjacent variant negated a predicted stop gain or a substitution was incorrectly called as a deletion). Finally, the list of high-confidence potential-pathogenic variants was filtered for variants falling within QTL coordinates (LOD &gt;1).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Transcriptome analysis of cardiac interatrial septum in mice</title><p>Microdissection of the atrial septum region was performed on embryos from mouse strains (QSi5, 129T2/SvEms) at E12.5, E14.5, and E16.5 (six septa per mouse strain per time point). Embryos were dissected from the uterus in ice-cold PBS under a dissecting scope (Leica MZ8) using micro-tweezers. Once the heart was harvested from the embryo and the pericardial membrane removed, the atrial and ventricular regions were separated. Then, the atrial appendages were removed from the atrial part and the remaining mesenchymal tissue from the atrioventricular canal was further trimmed. The remaining tissue, containing the atrial septum, was stored at –80 °C in RNAlater solution (Ambion). Total RNA was purified using miRNeasy Micro Kit (Qiagen). Two technical replicates per mouse strain per time point were created by pooling RNA from three dissected septa each.</p><sec id="s4-3-1"><title>RNA sequencing and data analysis</title><p>RNA libraries were made using TruSeq stranded RNA Library Preparation Kit (Illumina) and sequenced on a HiSeq2500 Illumina sequencer to a depth of ~23 million paired-end reads per sample.

Accession numbers for histone mark data were: H3K4me1 – ENCSR000CDL; H3K27ac – ENCSR000CDK; HK4me3 – ENCSR000CDM. Variant enrichment within each feature was defined as the proportion of variants that overlapped the feature, with normalization for the proportion of coverage of the feature within the QTL 1-LOD drop-off. To test the significance of the enrichment, background controls were generated by permuting each genomic feature of DEGs and non-DEGs under QTL, respectively, by randomly selecting matched size blocks (according to the tested property) under QTL regions. This process was repeated 1000 times using bedtools shuffle (version 2.25.0). For each genomic feature, the DEG/non-DEG regions were excluded from the pool of regions used to generate random interval sets. The overlap of the variants and genomic features of DEGs and non-DEGs under QTL was compared to the mean overlap for 1000 random interval sets and empirical p-values were calculated by dividing the number of random interval sets showing equal or greater overlap than the observed by 1000.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Code availability</title><p>The codes used to perform linkage analysis

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and David James as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>All three reviewers judged this to be a comprehensive, well-designed study that will enhance our understanding of the genetics of septal defects. The reviewers' comments related primarily to the presentation of the results, in several cases requesting a further discussion of the limitations of the findings.</p><p>Reviewer 1 suggests that functional validation would greatly strengthen the manuscript. While I agree, the present results are very substantial and do provide a better overall understanding of the complexity of the trait in addition to candidates and hypotheses for future studies.</p><p>Reviewer 2 had several criticisms. I felt that points 2, 3, and 10 should be addressed, and I would be interested to know how the authors feel about all of the points. Some of the suggestions, such as the identification of rare variants that have arisen since during the development of the advanced intercross lines (point 5) would be very difficult, but the authors might expand on the point in the discussion.</p><p>Reviewer 3 also had several comments. Points 1 and 2 should be addressed. Points 3 – 5 deal with additional transcriptomic and functional analyses. I think the suggestions are excellent and the analyses would strengthen the paper, but given the extensive analyses reported I do not want to insist on additional experiments. The authors should, however, discuss these points in terms of limitations.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>A limitation of the study in its current form is that it does not develop an experimental example of using the data set on gene regulation network analysis in Figure 7-8 to make predictions and then test them. For example, the author discusses changes to ubiquitin C, a prominent down-regulated hub gene. However, the functional significance of these predicted interactions is not experimentally tested. To demonstrate that one or more of these genes (Znrf3, Ube4a, Akt1, and Prkaca) are directly involved in the developing atrial septum would significantly increase enthusiasm for the paper.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1. The AIL analysis was limited to QTL previously found in F2 analysis, where the selected markers covered only a limited part of the genome. WGS and RNA seq were utilized to validate QTL genes of known role in CHDs, missing an important opportunity for identifying new QTL and novel gene discovery in PFO/CHDs.</p><p>2. Authors stated that &quot;the possibility that FVL- and FOW- QTL could be explained by variation in HW or BW has not been formally excluded. Markers of normalized heart weight were included in AIL, like MMU11&quot;. However, in [Table 1] HW and BW were listed as independent traits. The manuscript would benefit from using HW/BW ratio and examining HW/BW association with PFO parameters, instead of using HW and BW separately as independent traits.</p><p>Furthermore, SEX and Age were not included. Adding these co-variants in their comparison between F2 and F14 in Table 1 would be important.</p><p>3. Page 13. Line 231: &quot;The AIL results for each chromosome of quantitative traits and binary PFO are compared in figure 3&quot;. The cited figure should be [figure 4] instead of [figure 3], or [both Figure 3 and figure 4].</p><p>4. page 16, lines 277-280. &quot;MMU9 QTL is a suggestive QTL [LOD=3.4] that was identified in F2 study and resolved into 4 QTL in the current F14 study [Figure 3 E and Figure 4 E], with significant overlapping FOW, FVL, and PFO peaks. Importantly, TBX20, a cardiac transcription factor gene involved in septal defects, is located within the 1-LOD region of the first QTL&quot;. However, only synonymous variants were found in TBX20 (based on WGS analysis) (page 20, line 368).</p><p>Given the importance of TBX20 in PFO and the suggestive data, it is worthy to list TBX20 variants and examine/discuss potential miss-classification of these variants, or potential cryptic splice site variants in TBX20 that could be missed on initial pipeline analysis.</p><p>5. Page 19. Line 340-341: &quot;regions with low SNP density may contain rare variants that have arisen since establishment of the parent strains&quot;.</p><p>I. Why were these potentially rare variants dismissed in the current manuscript?</p><p>II. Since the prevalence of PFO in F14 increased by ~ 2 folds, compared to F2, it would be important to include the rare variants (Homozygous or heterozygous) that might have arisen since the establishment of parental strains, and ca potentially have large effects to explain the increased prevalence at F14.</p><p>6. How did the filtered deleterious variant segregate with extreme PFO phenotypes? Can they explain the higher prevalence of PFO in 129T2/SvEms (high PFO) compared to the QSi5 (low PFO) mouse strain?</p><p>7. Majority of the highlighted genes, including LRP2, SMAD6, and SIK3, are affected with 1 or 2 deleterious variants, suggesting a potential monogenic effect caused by rare variants.</p><p>I would recommend listing the minor allele frequency (MAF) of these variants and other characteristics of the variants (variant type, Sift Score, Splice prediction) in a new summary Table.</p><p>8. SMAD6 variant. The gene was identified in the QSI5-QTL (this strain exhibits low PFO). Based on the functional evidence (cell culture), this variant is damaging and may alter SMAD6 function in several ways.</p><p>I. Based on the data and discussion, it is difficult to tell whether the SMAD6 variant is contributing or protective in the PFO phenotype.</p><p>II. Again, this seems to be a monogenetic effect.</p><p>III. How does SMAD6, or its downstream effectors, contribute to the interactome network of E14.5? is it expressed in the Atrial septum during development? Does the variant influence network interactions?</p><p>9. Page 27. figure 7. PCAs for coding vs noncoding. The noncoding transcript showed a different pattern of variation (strain vs developmental stage). Since they were not included in the downstream analysis, I would suggest removing Figure 7B from the current manuscript.</p><p>10. Transcriptome analysis/Network analysis [fig7.E, Figure 8]. Adding genes affected with variants to network analysis of the DEGs may confound network structure, as no evidence was shown to support the impact of variants on their gene expression. Instead, I would suggest the following:</p><p>I. Discuss why E14 revealed the highest # of DEGs and more significant networks.</p><p>II. What was the expression status of genes with pathogenic variants that were expressed at each time point?</p><p>III. The finding that DEGs in QTL regions were enriched in pathogenic variants led to the speculation of the functional impact of some QTL on septal traits will involve collective effects of multiple variants (polygenic effect). However, the role of the list of genes carrying pathogenic variants in septum morphology has not been examined mechanistically, including smad6, in vivo. Therefore the evidence does not support the conclusion.</p><p>IV. Page 36. Line 645-654. Variants overlapping with the noncoding element.</p><p>What is the significance of this finding? Any further evidence of deleterious impact or causality?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1. In Figure 6, the authors filter a large number of identified variants between the AIL parental strains using a logical pipeline. The authors ultimately intersected potentially pathogenic variants under septal QTL regions with genes according to prior association with cardiovascular phenotypes (Mouse Genome Informatics; MGI) or link to human CHD from a curated list of high-confidence and emerging CHD genes. Were CHD or MGI genes enriched under QTL regions?</p><p>2. The examples of high-impact variants are highly subjective other than smad6, which the authors validate. The caveats underlying the description of unvalidated specific variants should be more explicitly noted, as few if any of them have been directly implicated in atrial septation.</p><p>3. Figure 8 – RNA-seq is performed beginning at E12.5, after the formation of the PAS, MC, and DMP. Thus, it is probably most appropriate to limit the implication of genes differentially expressed between the two mouse strains at these later time points to the formation of the septum secundum. While the formation of the SS is critical for FO closure, the limited applicability of the RNA-seq data for descriptions of atrial septation should be mentioned. Alternatively, the authors could perform additional RNA-seq experiments beginning around E9.5 in the pSHF and common atrium to include genes associated with all atrial septum structures as they form, or obtain and analyze previously published RNA-seq data from these regions.</p><p>4. The authors' analysis of the atrial septum transcriptome data jumps quickly to considering stain-specific DEGs. However, this is the first transcriptional profiling of the later stages of the atrial septum, as far as I know. A more considered baseline analysis should be performed before jumping into the strain-specific analysis. What does the transcriptome alone say about atrial septation? How does the atrial septum transcriptome compare to the atrial free wall or other regions of the heart (by comparison with RNA-seq from the authors or others)? How do the pathways that are septum-enriched compare to those uncovered in the stain-specific septum analysis?</p><p>5. Figures 7 &amp; 8 – the authors implicate the BMP, ubiquitination, Akt, and PKA pathways in PFO based on gene expression differences between 129T2/SvEms and QSi5 mouse lines from E12.5-E16.5. These findings would be greatly strengthened if the authors could demonstrate functional differences in the activities of these pathways in atrial septum tissues in vivo at these time points. This would not be necessary for the publication of this already detailed manuscript and could be discussed as an avenue for follow-up.</p><p>6. The observation that differentially expressed QTL genes are enriched for genomic variants is an important observation. The authors used a very conservative relationship between candidate regulatory regions and genes, described as &quot;within 50kb upstream of the transcriptional start site of relevant genes&quot;. Given that enhancers demonstrate no directional bias, their capture could be increased to include regions both upstream and downstream of a gene's TSS. Also, 50kb is quite conservative, and their capture may be increased by enlarging the considered regions to 100 or 250 kb. Given the conclusion that there is a &quot;strong mechanistic link between variant architecture and differential expression of genes under QTL&quot;, the authors should present the gene sets and pathways that are enriched in this analysis.</p><p>7. Figure 10 – The authors could consider an analysis of variant conservation between human and mouse to this figure to interrogate the relevance of identified loci for human ASD/PFO. For variants in and around DEGs underlying QTL, what proportion in coding regions are conserved? What proportion in non-coding regions?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.83606.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>A limitation of the study in its current form is that it does not develop an experimental example of using the data set on gene regulation network analysis in Figure 7-8 to make predictions and then test them.

Beyond our in vitro analysis of the <italic>Smad6</italic> variant, we agree that additional testing of DEGs and genes carrying predicted pathogenic variants would be desirable to determine their unique contribution to atrial septal development in mouse and whether they contribute to septal defects in humans. However, I am sure the reviewers appreciate, this would require analysis of possibly many individual variants or groups of variants genetically (for example using CRISPR/Cas9). Furthermore, whereas it seems evident that biosynthetic processes affecting mitochondria, ribosomes, ECM, chromatin and ubiquitin-related processes underpin differences in atrial septal development between founder strains (a primary finding of this paper), it is not immediately obvious which individual genes are the hub driver genes that would be the most appropriate candidates for genetic manipulation. Furthermore, whereas downregulation of ubiquitin or kinases AKT and PKA, and a host of their target genes, may contribute to the defects, manipulating these genes will likely have broad and general effects on atrial cell viability, proliferation and/or interactions, and the complex interactions between variant pathways would be lost. Unravelling higher level network control would certainly be a worthy problem in cardiac system genetics, potentially relevant to other diseases involving disrupted morphogenesis; however, as noted by the handing editor, such studies are well beyond the scope of this current paper. We have added a note to the last paragraph of the Discussion (line 756) to acknowledge these issues:</p><p>“Our results provide the first high-resolution picture of genetic complexity and multilayered network liabilities underpinning atrial septal variation in a mouse model. Elucidating the impacts of genetic variants under QTL at the individual gene level would be a daunting task; however, understanding higher level network control of septal development underpinning observed defects in septal macromolecular synthesis pathways is an important cardiac developmental systems genetics problem, which may have relevance to other congenital dysmorphologies.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>1.

The approach taken was partly dictated by efficiencies of time and funding. The lost opportunity notwithstanding, we would argue that the approach led to important discoveries underpinning atrial septal defects, such as the strong concordance of PFO and atrial septal traits (not evident in the F2 study), the compelling protein network associated with DEGs suggesting defects in biosynthesis of macromolecular structures, and findings related to variant distribution and gene architecture.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. Authors stated that &quot;the possibility that FVL- and FOW- QTL could be explained by variation in HW or BW has not been formally excluded. Markers of normalized heart weight were included in AIL, like MMU11&quot;. However, in [Table 1] HW and BW were listed as independent traits.

Adding these co-variants in their comparison between F2 and F14 in Table 1 would be important.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for these interesting comments. Please note that in our previous paper on F2 mice (Kirk et al., 2006), QTL for atrial septal traits persisted after normalisation for HW, BW, sex, age, day of dissection, and coat colour. Whereas these parameters contributed to septal traits in both F2 and F14 mice, the effects were small and HW had no impact on PFO. Specifically, in the current study, the correlation coefficients (r) for comparisons between HW and BW, and septal traits, were very low (0.005 – 0.13) (Supplementary File 2). Note also that our analysis of HW QTL in F2 and F14 mice was determined after normalisation for age and sex. Importantly, our mapping results showed that HW and BW QTL were largely different from QTL for septal traits. Thus, with the caveat that mapping was not genome-wide in the F14 study, we can be very confident that QTL septal traits are not a function of variation in HW or BW. This is a very important result and, as we mention in the Discussion, HW QTL likely relates to ventricular growth as an independent parameter to development of the “primary” myocardial component of the heart from which the atrial septum derives.</p><p>We did not analyse the relationship between HW/BW ratio and PFO, nor use HW/BW ratio in QTL mapping. With respect, we do not think this effort is justified for several reasons. First, as noted above, there is only a weak contribution of HW and BW to septal traits. Furthermore, HW and BW are generally well correlated in mammals, except in pathology where there is adaptive hypertrophy and/or inflammation. The correlation coefficient between HW and BW in F14 mice was 0.64 (p&lt;0.001; Supplementary File 2). Thus, for HW/BW ratios, these parameters will tend to cancel each other out.</p><p>To explain our initial interest in HW and BW further, QSi5 mice, which show a low prevalence of PFO (4.6%), were originally bred because they were highly fecund and showed rapid grow. Thus, they had considerably higher BW and HW than 129T2 mice. It seemed possible that genes (and even environmental factors) influencing overall growth rate would affect the size of the heart and that this would create “noise” in the specific septal traits such as FVL and FOW, which correlate with PFO. Thus, HW and BW were included in analyses of the septal traits not because we were interested in them per se, but because we wished to quantify their influences, hoping to formally exclude them as a trivial source of septal variation. Specifically, we wanted normalised measures of FVL, FOW etc independent of variation in HW and BW. After retrospective analysis of QTL for HW in F2 data revealed a number of HW (and BW) QTL, it was simple enough also to include HW as a variable in selection of F14 mice for QTL analysis of septal traits. This analysis of HW QTL allowed us to show that they largely do not overlap with FVL and FOW QTL, providing much stronger evidence that HW is not a significant confounder in our analysis of the genetic basis of atrial septal defects in 129T2 mice.</p><p>Finally, our quantitative genetics team (CM, ICAM, PCT) point out that most statisticians would shy away from using ratios rather than adjusted values in QTL analyses. That is, there is no real certainty that having a term β×HW/BW in the model would capture variation any better than β<sub>1</sub>×HW + β<sub>2</sub>×BW, particularly because the point is to adjust for the source of variation in estimating QTL effects, as noted above, not to explore the underlying functional form of any relationship. There is a long history of objections by statisticians to the use of ratios going back to Pearson (1897), with Kronmal 1993 (https://doi.org/10.2307/2983064) and Curran-Everett 2013 (https://doi.org/10.1152/advan.00053.2013) providing theoretical justifications.</p><p>In summary, whereas differential growth between mouse strains is clearly an interesting topic, and may have translational relevance in animal breeding, this is not the topic of this paper and would represent an unhelpful distraction from the primary focus of this work on septal traits. We hope this is acceptable to the reviewers. We have, however, clarified further specifically why HW and BW were of interest in the Results section “Selection of AIL mice – heart weight and body weight phenotypes” (line 198):</p><p>“Given that QSi5 mice were originally selected for their high fecundity and growth, it was evident that the quantitative septal parameters under study might be influenced by heart size and mass (Table 1) (Kirk et al., 2006), and indeed both FVL and FOW were significantly correlated with HW in both F2 and F14 cohorts, albeit that the effects were small (Supplementary File 2) (Kirk et al., 2006) and HW had no influence the likelihood of PFO.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3.

We have modified the text first to be more specific about the number of variants detected across the <italic>Tbx20</italic> gene, which we now list in a new Supplementary File 5. There were 321 variants in total – only 3 were exonic variants and these were synonymous as previously indicated. The rest were intronic; however, the <italic>VEP</italic> tool that we used for variant classification detected no variants overlapping known splice motifs and no cryptic splice motifs. We reran the analysis using <italic>Spliceogen</italic>, a recently described tool pipeline that integrates some of the best performing models for splice motif prediction and achieved the same results. Again, no splicing defects were detected. <italic>Spliceogen</italic> provides a ranking for cryptic donor/acceptor sites, however, these do not reflect real probabilities. We therefore analysed splice junctions detected in the RNA-seq but did not find confident differences between the strains. In addition, we used <italic>Salmon</italic> to map <italic>Tbx20</italic> isoforms and perform differential expression analysis, but this approach also did not reveal differences in <italic>Tbx20</italic> isoforms between strains. For future reference, all the above outputs are given in Supplementary File 5. We have updated the methods and inserted the following in the manuscript (line 383):</p><p>“For the Tbx20 gene on MMU9, a total of 321 variants were detected (Supplementary File 5); however, only three were exonic and these were synonymous.

We reran the analysis using Spliceogen (<italic>Monger et al., 2019</italic>) and again no splicing defects were detected. Spliceogen provides rankings of possible cryptic splice sites (Supplementary File 5), however, these do not reflect actual probabilities. Therefore, we analysed splice junctions detected in RNA-seq data from the developing septum (see below) but did not find splice site differences for Tbx20 between parental strains. We also mapped Tbx20 transcript isoforms with Salmon (<italic>Patro et al., 2017</italic>) and performed differential expression analysis, again yielding no differences in isoform expression between strains (Supplementary File 5).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5.

Why were these potentially rare variants dismissed in the current manuscript?</p><p>II. Since the prevalence of PFO in F14 increased by ~ 2 folds, compared to F2, it would be important to include the rare variants (Homozygous or heterozygous) that might have arisen since the establishment of parental strains, and ca potentially have large effects to explain the increased prevalence at F14.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for these comments. We think that use of the term “rare variants” when referring to variants that might have arisen in low SNP density regions since the establishment of the parental strains is confusing because it is generally used to refer to variants with low MAF in humans. However, they will be “rare” in the sense that if they did arise in the germline, they would tend to be lost by genetic drift. We neglected to acknowledge that they might also arise in regions of high SNP density as well. We have corrected this by referring to them as simply “variants” (line 352) and we have also modified the text to acknowledged that variants that have arisen since establishment of parental strains could in principle also contribute to septal defects:</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>“Regions with a high rate of polymorphism between parental strains (spanning nearly one-third of the genome but harboring more than 95% of the genetic variation) can significantly reduce the regions of interest underlying QTL (Wade et al., 2002), albeit that regions with high or low polymorphism may also carry variants that have arisen since the establishment of parent strains (Bloom et al., 2019). Although these would be rare, they could, in principle, also contribute to septal variation.”</p></disp-quote><p>Please note that in filtering for pathogenic coding variants, variants lying within regions of low SNP density were not excluded. Predicted pathogenic variants shown in Figures 6A,B are annotated with respect to their presence in high (starred) or low SNP density regions. We have now indicated in the text also the number and percent of filtered variants which lie in high density SNP regions (84/92; 91.3%; line 380) and the status of each variant is now also indicated in Supplementary File 4.</p><p>The 2-fold increase in PFO prevalence in F14 mice compared to F2 mice is interesting; however, the most obvious explanation for this is genetic drift during the cascade breeding of F14 mice. We think the increased PFO prevalence is unlikely to relate specifically to variants that have arisen since establishment of the parental strains for the reasons above and we have not attempted to focus specifically on such variants – we don’t believe that there is any a priori reason for doing this. As noted, predicted pathogenic variants in high (starred) and low density SNP regions are shown in Figure 6A,B.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. How did the filtered deleterious variant segregate with extreme PFO phenotypes? Can they explain the higher prevalence of PFO in 129T2/SvEms (high PFO) compared to the QSi5 (low PFO) mouse strain?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this comment. It is in fact difficult to say whether filtered variants “explain” the extreme PFO phenotypes, noting that cis-regulatory variants will likely be extremely important also, as we highlight later in the manuscript. Nonetheless, reflecting on the Reviewer’s comment, we reexplored the effect sizes for QTL under which the high-confidence pathogenic variants highlighted in the text lay (i.e. those predicted pathogenic <italic>and</italic> overlapping curated MGI and CHD lists). These variants were selected based principally on due diligence of the predicted impact of the variants (or multiple variants) and/or the involvement of the relevant gene in heart development and/or disease. We discovered that QTL for most highlighted variants had large effect sizes (<italic>Cep164</italic>: 65%; <italic>Dst</italic>: 5.68%; <italic>Sik3</italic>: 65%; <italic>Lrp2</italic>: 30%; <italic>Smad6</italic>: 58%). However, we noted that all bar one of these variants were associated with cryptic QTL (i.e. protective of septal defects), including the <italic>Smad6</italic> variant. We also found that variants were often found in the unexpected strain give the direction (normal or cryptic) of the QTL. This highlights that there are highly complex interactions between alleles within and between QTL in parental strains and in individual AIL mice. At this stage, we prefer not to make assumption about the network model, which contains multiple interacting elements, albeit a default model where one variant is responsible for each QTL, seems naïve. We feel that trying to segregate highlighted variants with extremes of phenotypes will likely lead us for the moment down an unproductive path. To provide more clarity in the text and follow on from the new findings, we have indicated in the Results section the effect size of the QTL under which the highlighted variants lay (pages 18-20) and added a section in the Discussion about possible implications of our findings for the genetic model (pages 33-34).</p><p>“Our results are consistent with Fisher's 'infinitesimal' model whereby many loci (theoretically an infinite number) could each contribute to a small part the liability for common disease (<italic>Fisher, 1918</italic>), and also GWAS analysis of human disease that most often detect common risk loci of small effect. However, as in our previous study (<italic>Kirk et al., 2006</italic>), individual septal QTL can have significant effect sizes, demonstrating the power of the AIL approach to discern alleles of major impact. Indeed, all five predicted pathogenic coding variants highlighted in this study, including the Smad6 variant, lay under QTL of moderate to high effect size (5.68-65%). It is possible that a limited number of high impact variants are responsible for septal defects in certain AIL mice. This type of polygenic inheritance has been demonstrated recently in a human cardiomyopathy family (<italic>Gifford et al., 2019</italic>). Such variants may prove to have causative or modifying effects on atrial septal defects in humans, as exemplified by SMAD1.</p><p>Several findings speak to the complex genetic landscape of PFO. It is interesting that twelve out of the 37 QTL detected were cryptic QTL, with many being of moderate to large effect size (~5-70%; Supplementary File 3). Thus, cryptic QTL are frequently detected and individually appear to provide strong buffering effects against septal defects. Cryptic QTL have been detected commonly in other animal and plant QTL studies (<italic>Rieseberg et al., 1999</italic>). The mechanisms of their action would be interesting to identify as they may reveal pathways that protect against CHD more broadly.</p><p>A further complexity is that, of five genes carrying predicted pathogenic variants highlighted in this study, four were found in the unexpected strain. For example, Cep164 lies under a cryptic QTL (protective), whereas predicted pathogenic variants in Cep164 were found in the 129T2/SvEms strain (showing worse septal status). The inverse can also apply – for example, Lrp2 lies under a normal QTL, but variants were found in the QSi5 strain. Such findings suggest highly complex interactions within and between individual QTL. As noted, 26% of predicted pathogenic genes, some known to be involved in heart development, carried multiple predicted pathogenic variants (Cep164 carried seven). It would be reasonable to imagine that these alleles are null or have major impacts on gene function. Genetic compensation may also buffer the impact of such variants (<italic>El-Brolosy et al., 2019</italic>).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7. Majority of the highlighted genes, including LRP2, SMAD6, and SIK3, are affected with 1 or 2 deleterious variants, suggesting a potential monogenic effect caused by rare variants.</p><p>I would recommend listing the minor allele frequency (MAF) of these variants and other characteristics of the variants (variant type, Sift Score, Splice prediction) in a new summary Table.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that the function of genes predicted as pathogenic and carrying multiple variants may be severely compromised. See response to Comment 6 above. Please note that the general classification of variants (High Impact; Deleterious [SIFT]; non-frameshift deletion) is recorded in Supplementary File 4.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8. SMAD6 variant. The gene was identified in the QSI5-QTL (this strain exhibits low PFO).

Again, this seems to be a monogenetic effect.</p><p>III. How does SMAD6, or its downstream effectors, contribute to the interactome network of E14.5? is it expressed in the Atrial septum during development?

We clarify this at the end of the <italic>Smad6</italic> section on page 23:</p><p>“Because the Smad6 variant lies under a cryptic QTL of high effect (58%) and is seen in the QSi5 strain (with robust septal qualities), it is an excellent candidate for being protective against atrial septal defects. We confirmed Smad6 expression in the developing interatrial septum (see below).”</p><p>It is unclear precisely how the variant will affect SMAD6 function (and therefore control of the BMP pathway) in vivo, noting that it still has repressive activity on the BMP pathway assay in vitro. However, it is possible that it may be an allele of strong effect (we avoid the term “monogenic” as it would be difficult to claim this, even for alleles of strong effect). We currently don’t know how it affects the differential expression of septal genes between strains and associated protein:protein interaction networks.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9.

Discuss why E14 revealed the highest # of DEGs and more significant networks.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for challenging us with this question. It is possible that the most significant STRING network of DEGs between strains occurs at E14.5 (subnetworks for macromolecular synthesis of mitochondria, chromatin, ribosomes and ECM) because changes relate to growth and maturation of septal components at a relatively later stage of septal development rather than to specific (earlier) steps of septal component specification. This notion would be supported by the fact that there is strong overlap between QTL for FVL, FOW and PFO, and other findings. We have made a comment to this effect in the Discussion on page 32 (line 694):</p><p>“By far the most significant STRING protein network for DEGs was at E14.5, and subnetworks with high connectivity relating to macromolecular cellular structures including nucleosomes, ribosomes, mitochondria and ECM, were detected. Virtually all associated genes were downregulated in the 129T2/SvEms strain (showing less robust septal characteristics). Our findings suggest that there is a general septal growth and maturation deficit involving multiple septal components in the 129T2/SvEms strain at a relatively late stage (E14.5) of septal development. This idea is supported by the correlations between FVL and FOW (reflecting development of the primum and secundum septa, respectively) (Kirk et al., 2006) and the strong concordance between QTL for individual septal traits and PFO discovered in this work. We hypothesise that differences in quantitative septal traits and PFO prevalence that we documented previously in inbred, hybrid and mutant strain of mice (Kirk et al., 2006), relate in part to degrees of septal growth and maturation, and that higher septal growth and maturation facilitates better fusion of the septum primum and secundum. Careful elucidation of the differential growth parameters of septal components in parent strains across time may provide further support for this model.”</p><p>We think this is an important hypothesis that integrates diverse findings and so we have incorporated a brief reference to it in the Abstract.</p><p>“Transcriptome analysis of developing septa revealed downregulation of networks involving ribosome, nucleosome, mitochondrial and extracellular matrix biosynthesis in the 129T2/SvEms strain, potentially reflecting an essential role for growth and cellular maturation in septal development.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>II.

The finding that DEGs in QTL regions were enriched in pathogenic variants led to the speculation of the functional impact of some QTL on septal traits will involve collective effects of multiple variants (polygenic effect).

Therefore the evidence does not support the conclusion.</p><p>IV. Page 36. Line 645-654. Variants overlapping with the noncoding element.</p><p>What is the significance of this finding?

We address the substantial challenges in doing so in our response to Reviewer 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>1. In Figure 6, the authors filter a large number of identified variants between the AIL parental strains using a logical pipeline. The authors ultimately intersected potentially pathogenic variants under septal QTL regions with genes according to prior association with cardiovascular phenotypes (Mouse Genome Informatics; MGI) or link to human CHD from a curated list of high-confidence and emerging CHD genes. Were CHD or MGI genes enriched under QTL regions?</p></disp-quote><p>We in fact made an error in our reporting in the Results section on how many of the filtered (predicted pathogenic) variants overlapped with the curated MGI and CHD lists of pathogenic genes. We have now corrected this and, as shown in the Venn diagrams of Figure 6C,D, eight predicted pathogenic genes overlapped the MGI/CDH lists. We list these in the text on page and again in the Discussion on page. As requested, we tested whether curated genes were overrepresented under QTL (relative to non-QTL, atrial-expressed genes), and they were not. This does not diminish their potential involvement in atrial septal traits; however, this has not been tested.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2.

Figure 8 – RNA-seq is performed beginning at E12.5, after the formation of the PAS, MC, and DMP. Thus, it is probably most appropriate to limit the implication of genes differentially expressed between the two mouse strains at these later time points to the formation of the septum secundum. While the formation of the SS is critical for FO closure, the limited applicability of the RNA-seq data for descriptions of atrial septation should be mentioned. Alternatively, the authors could perform additional RNA-seq experiments beginning around E9.5 in the pSHF and common atrium to include genes associated with all atrial septum structures as they form, or obtain and analyze previously published RNA-seq data from these regions.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for raising this. First, we have corrected out statement in the Introduction, where we had indicated that the <italic>septum secundum</italic> was an infolding of the dorsal atrial myocardium (as was described in human hearts). We realise now that the situation in mouse is different and that the <italic>septum secundum</italic> is a true septum (muscular ridge). We have clarified this in the Introduction on line 91:</p><p>“A septum secundum forms as an infolding of the dorsal atrial wall in humans (Anderson et al., 2003) or as specific muscular ridge in mice (Briggs et al., 2012), leaving an additional, prominent and offset interatrial communication termed the foramen ovale (Burns et al., 2016), completing the flap valve apparatus (Figure 1A).”</p><p>The Reviewer is correct in stating that at the earliest timepoint analysed (E12.5), the septum primum mesenchymal cap has already fused with the atrioventricular canal cushion, and the <italic>ostium secundum</italic> has already formed (Briggs et al., 2012). We have clarified this in the text on line 497:</p><p>“At the earliest time point, E12.5, the thin septum primum has already fused with the AV septum via its mesenchymal cap, and the ostium secundum has been created by cell death; thus, transcriptome changes across the three stages analysed may reflect prior changes during septum primum formation, as well as formation of the septum secundum, septal growth and remodelling.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. The authors' analysis of the atrial septum transcriptome data jumps quickly to considering stain-specific DEGs. However, this is the first transcriptional profiling of the later stages of the atrial septum, as far as I know. A more considered baseline analysis should be performed before jumping into the strain-specific analysis. What does the transcriptome alone say about atrial septation? How does the atrial septum transcriptome compare to the atrial free wall or other regions of the heart (by comparison with RNA-seq from the authors or others)? How do the pathways that are septum-enriched compare to those uncovered in the stain-specific septum analysis?</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for this comment and we agree that deeper analysis of this data set could be fruitful. However, we have not undertaken such analyses so as not to distract from the main points of this already dense paper.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. Figures 7 &amp; 8 – the authors implicate the BMP, ubiquitination, Akt, and PKA pathways in PFO based on gene expression differences between 129T2/SvEms and QSi5 mouse lines from E12.5-E16.5. These findings would be greatly strengthened if the authors could demonstrate functional differences in the activities of these pathways in atrial septum tissues in vivo at these time points. This would not be necessary for the publication of this already detailed manuscript and could be discussed as an avenue for follow-up.</p></disp-quote><p>We have made a comment to this effect in the Discussion on line 711:</p><p>“We propose that variants in the 129T2/SvEms parent strain depress growth-related signalling pathways (including BMP, AKT, PKA and SRC) and associated ubiquitin-related quality control processes, impacting septal growth and morphogenesis independently of chamber growth.

This could be a focus area for further investigation.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. The observation that differentially expressed QTL genes are enriched for genomic variants is an important observation. The authors used a very conservative relationship between candidate regulatory regions and genes, described as &quot;within 50kb upstream of the transcriptional start site of relevant genes&quot;. Given that enhancers demonstrate no directional bias, their capture could be increased to include regions both upstream and downstream of a gene's TSS. Also, 50kb is quite conservative, and their capture may be increased by enlarging the considered regions to 100 or 250 kb. Given the conclusion that there is a &quot;strong mechanistic link between variant architecture and differential expression of genes under QTL&quot;, the authors should present the gene sets and pathways that are enriched in this analysis.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now expanded the analysis to include enhancer bin sizes of 50Kb (as used previously), 100Kb, 200Kb and 250Kb. For this new analysis, the definition of a bin was modified to include enhancers detected within regions (e.g. 50Kb) upstream and downstream of the transcriptional start site. The over-representation of variants in enhancers of DEGs under QTL fell within the p&lt;0.05 threshold for all bin sizes. Please note that we detected an error in the previous version of the manuscript with respect to the labelling of one of the histone mark files we referenced (Wamstad et al., 2012) – the correct accession number is now indicated in Materials and methods. Results are presented in Figure 10—figure supplement 2 and we wrote into the text as follows (line 579):</p><p>“After permutation testing, we observed a significant enrichment of variants relative to expected in enhancers, promoters, 5UTRs and introns for DEGs underlying QTL (Figure 10). Non-DEGs showed significant depletion of variants in exons. DEGs and non-DEGs showed similar normalised variant count distributions across features (Figure 10—figure supplement 1), indicating that DEGs were not substantially skewed towards genes with high variant density. Likewise, variants were not focused on any specific gene class (Supplementary File 8). The over-representation of variants was consistent when candidate cardiac enhancers near DEGs were considered even up to 250Kb from the TSS (Figure 10—figure supplement 2A), noting however that most enhancers were found within the 100Kb window (Figure 10—figure supplement 2B). Interestingly, DEGs had approximately 60-80% more enhancers than non-DEGs, consistent with their higher levels of expression, irrespective of septal stage or strain (Figure 10—figure supplement 2C-E).”</p><p>With regards to “presenting the gene sets and pathways that are enriched in this analysis”, thank you for this suggestion. This is of course difficult because of the statistical nature of the tests. However, we ranked DEGs under QTL based on the variant density or binary variant status across enhancers, promoters, 5’UTRs and/or exons, and applied <italic>fgsea</italic> to the ranked gene lists to identify whether there was enrichment of GO terms. However, there were no significant GO terms identified. We did not proceed further with this approach.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7.
