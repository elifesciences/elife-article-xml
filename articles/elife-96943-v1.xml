ligands largely remains to be explored. Rapid alkalinisation factors (RALFs) are extracellular peptide hormones that play pivotal roles in various physiological processes. Here, we address a crucial connection between the de-methylesterification machinery of the cell wall component pectin and RALF1 activity. Pectin is a polysaccharide, contributing to the structural integrity of the cell wall. Our data illustrate that the pharmacological and genetic interference with pectin methyl esterases (PMEs) abolishes RALF1-induced root growth repression. Our data suggest that positively charged RALF1 peptides bind negatively charged, de-methylesterified pectin with high avidity. We illustrate that the RALF1 association with de-methylesterified pectin is required for its FERONIA-dependent perception, contributing to the control of the extracellular matrix and the regulation of plasma membrane dynamics. Notably, this mode of action is independent of the FER-dependent extracellular matrix sensing mechanism provided by FER interaction with the leucine-rich repeat extensin (LRX) proteins. We propose that the methylation status of pectin acts as a contextualizing signalling scaffold for RALF peptides, linking extracellular matrix dynamics to peptide hormone-mediated responses.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>cell wall</kwd><kwd>growth factors</kwd><kwd>peptide hormones</kwd><kwd>signalling</kwd><kwd>pectin</kwd><kwd>RALF</kwd><kwd>rapid alkalinisation factor</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>A. thaliana</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>426849454</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rodriguez-Franco</surname><given-names>Marta</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>499026372</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kleine-Vehn</surname><given-names>Jürgen</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002428</institution-id><institution>Austrian Science Fund</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id award-id-type="doi">10.55776/P33044</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kleine-Vehn</surname><given-names>Jürgen</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>470007283</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kleine-Vehn</surname><given-names>Jürgen</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CIBSS - EXC-2189 Project ID 390939984</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Barbez</surname><given-names>Elke</given-names></name><name><surname>Kleine-Vehn</surname><given-names>Jürgen</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The methylation status of pectin acts as a critical signalling scaffold for RALF peptides, linking extracellular matrix dynamics to peptide hormone-mediated regulation of plant root growth.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Plants perceive various external signals, but how signals interact with the extracellular matrix is poorly understood. Pectin is a heteropolysaccharide, primarily composed of galacturonic acid units, contributing to the mechanical strength and integrity of the cell wall. Pectin (homogalacturonan) plays a vital role in growth control with an emerging role in signalling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Wolf, 2022</xref>). In the cell wall, PMEs catalyse the removal of methyl groups from the initially esterified pectin, giving rise to negatively charged carboxylic acid groups and altering the interaction of pectin with various extracellular components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Peaucelle et al., 2008</xref>). Here, we address how the methylation status of pectin in the extracellular matrix contributes to the integration of RALFs, which are extracellular cysteine-rich plant peptide hormones. RALF peptides are involved in multiple physiological and developmental processes, ranging from organ and pollen tube growth to the modulation of immune responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Stegmann et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abarca et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Mecchia et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Geldner et al., 2009</xref>). <italic>Catharanthus roseus</italic> receptor-like kinase 1-like (CrRLK1L) are transmembrane proteins with an extracellular domain, consisting of two adjacent malectin-like domains, for RALF signal perception and a cytoplasmic kinase domain for intracellular signal transduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Escobar-Restrepo et al., 2007</xref>). Feronia (FER) is currently the best characterized CrRLK1L, contributing to the above-mentioned developmental programs as well as the integration of environmental cues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Feng et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Gigli Bisceglia et al., 2022</xref>). On a cellular level, RALF binding to FER leads to rapid apoplastic (extracellular) alkalinisation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Haruta et al., 2014</xref>), which modulates cell wall properties, ion fluxes, and enzymatic activities, thereby influencing cellular expansion rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Haruta et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Barbez et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Dünser et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Dünser and Kleine-Vehn, 2015</xref>). Besides its role in apoplastic pH, CrRLK1Ls play a role in cell wall sensing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hématy et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Höfte, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Shih et al., 2014</xref>) and can bind to extracellular pectin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Feng et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Lin et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Liu et al., 2024</xref>). The FER-dependent cell wall sensing mechanism involves the direct interaction with the extracellular leucine-rich repeat extensinsLRXs in roots (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Dünser et al., 2019</xref>), suggesting that LRXs provide a physical link between FER and the cell wall (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Herger et al., 2019</xref>). On the other hand, root, as well as pollen-expressed LRX proteins, also bind to RALF peptides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Mecchia et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Dünser et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Moussu et al., 2020</xref>), but its contribution to mechanochemical sensing and/or growth control is largely unknown in roots. Here, we show that the PME-dependent de-methylesterification status of pectin defines the FER-dependent perception of RALF1, contributing to extracellular regulation of pH, cell wall and plasma membrane remodelling, control of receptor endocytosis as well as organ growth in roots. Our data suggest that negatively charged, de-methylesterified pectin binds to positively charged RALF1 peptides with low affinity but high avidity. Interference with the de-methylesterification of pectin, out-titrating RALF1 with small charged, de-methylesterified pectin fragments, as well as the disruption of the positive charges in RALF1, abolishes the RALF1 activity in roots. We accordingly propose that the RALF interaction with de-methylesterified pectin at the root surface is crucial for its FER-dependent perception in roots. Even though root-expressed LRX proteins are strictly required for the FER-dependent mechano-sensing in roots, the LRX proteins are not essential for RALF perception in roots (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Dünser et al., 2019</xref>). We moreover show here that LRX proteins do not contribute to the integration of RALF-pectin signalling in roots. In conclusion, we report on the crucial contribution of pectin de-methylesterification, for FER-dependent RALF peptide hormone signalling in root growth control. Our work proposes that pectin acts as a context-dependent extracellular signalling scaffold, contributing to signalling dynamics at the plasma membrane.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results|discussion"><title>Results and discussion</title><p>The application of RALF1 peptides induces strong repression of main root growth in <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Haruta et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and B</xref>), which we initially used here as a bioassay to visualise RALF1 activity. To assess if the de-methylesterification status of pectin may impact peptide signalling, we pharmacologically interfered with the de-methylesterification of pectin, using epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG). EGCG is a natural inhibitor of PME activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Lewis et al., 2008</xref>) and its application lowered main root growth but its co-treatment markedly interfered with the RALF1-induced reduction in root growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and B</xref>). In contrast, the structurally similar epicatechin (EC) is not an inhibitor of PMEs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Lewis et al., 2008</xref>) and did not block RALF1-induced root growth repression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C and D</xref>). In agreement, EGCG but not EC application reduced the labelling of de-methyl esterified pectin in roots (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E and F</xref>) as visualised by the fluorescent probe COS<sup>488</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Mravec et al., 2014</xref>). This set of data suggests that the EGCG-induced interference with PME activity correlates with reduced RALF1 responses in roots. To consolidate this assumption, we employed the overexpression of PECTIN METHYLESTERASE INHIBITOR 3 (<italic>PMEI3</italic>), which is well characterised to interfere with PME activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Peaucelle et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Xu et al., 2022</xref>) and accordingly also reduced the extracellular de-methylesterification of pectin in epidermal root cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G and H</xref>).

To test the specificity of this effect, we subsequently used the peptide flagellin22 (flg22). The flg22 peptide is derived from the N-terminus of bacterial flagellin and is known to elicit root growth repression via the innate immune receptor flagellin sensitive2 (FLS2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Chinchilla et al., 2007</xref>). EGCG treatments were not able to suppress, but instead additively enhanced the FLG22-induced root growth repression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1K and L</xref>), suggesting a rather specific effect of PME inhibition on balancing RALF1 activity.</p><p>Next, we addressed how PME activity affects RALF1-dependent root growth control. FER-dependent perception of RALF peptides may affect cell wall integrity and it is hence conceivable that the pharmacological and genetic interference with extracellular PME activity could counterbalance some extracellular effects of RALF1 signalling. Using electron microscopy, we indeed observed a RALF1-induced effect on cell wall integrity, showing swollen cell walls, but also revealed plasma membrane invaginations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A and B</xref>). These pronounced RALF effects were, to our knowledge, never reported and hence we confirmed these effects independently, using live cell confocal imaging. RALF1-induced invaginations of plasma membrane markers, such as Low-Temperature inducible protein 6b (LTi6b) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>) and Novel Plant SNARE 12 (NPSN12) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>), were readily detectable.

To assess if PME activity affects the extracellular perception of RALF1, we next investigated the ligand-induced cellular dynamics of its receptor FER. An early event of receptor-mediated signalling often involves the ligand-induced endocytosis of the receptor as has been previously demonstrated for the RALF1-receptor FER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Yu et al., 2020</xref>). Therefore, we next tested whether the RALF1 ligand-induced endocytosis of FER is altered upon changes in the methylation status of pectin. In agreement with previous reports, we observed the RALF1-induced internalisation of functional <italic>FER::FER-GFP</italic> in epidermal root cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F and G</xref>). On the other hand, the ligand-induced internalisation of FER-GFP was abolished when we pharmacologically or genetically suppressed PME activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F–J</xref>). These findings propose that the PME activity is required for the earliest events of RALF1 perception by FER in roots.</p><p>To test the specificity of this observation, we used another RALF peptide called RALF34, which is a ligand of CrRLK1L theseus1 (THE1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Gonneau et al., 2018</xref>). Similar to RALF1, the application of RALF34 induced the internalisation of FER-GFP, which was fully suppressed when PME activity was inhibited (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). Therefore, we assume that several RALF peptides display the same or similar signalling modalities.</p><p>RALF peptides are positively charged (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abarca et al., 2021</xref>). Hence, it is hence conceivable that the association of positively charged RALF1 peptides with de-methylesterified, negatively charged pectin is required for its FER-dependent perception. To indirectly assess if RALF1 peptides bind de-methylesterified pectin, we tested if RALF1 peptides bind fragments of de-methylesterified oligogalacturonides (OGs).</p><p>We initially assessed potential OG binding to RALF1, using the RALF1 impact on root cells as a bio-assay. The addition of high levels of free, de-methylesterified OGs into the media did not visibly affect the cell wall or FER endocytosis on its own (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A–D</xref>). On the other hand, free OGs in the medium strongly interfered with RALF1-induced cell wall swelling and FER receptor endocytosis in roots (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A–D</xref>). This effect was concentration-dependent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A and B</xref>), suggesting that excess of de-methylesterified OGs in the medium can bind and out-titrate RALF1 peptides and thereby limit the RALF1 activity at the root surface.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Rapid alkalinisation factor (RALF) peptides associate with de-methylesterified oligogalacturonides.</title><p>(<bold>A, B</bold>) RALF1-induced internalisation of <italic>FER::FER-GFP</italic> in late meristematic epidermal root cells of 6-day-old seedlings treated for 3 hr with a concentration series of 0.5, 1, and 1.5 µM RALF1 compared to solvent control and co-treated with oligogalacturonides (OGs) with a chain length of 25–50 (OG<sup>25-50</sup>; 50 mg/mL).

The equilibrium dissociation constant (Kd) in the range of 105 nanomolar (nM) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>) suggests a physiologically relevant binding affinity. Notably, we, however, observed an initial OG association to RALF1 with a constant (K<sub>on</sub>) in the micromolar (µM) range, but the dissociation kinetics revealed a remarkably slow rate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C and D</xref>). This is indicative of relatively low affinity at the individual RALF1-OG binding event level but multiple intermolecular binding events may eventually lead to a high accumulative binding strength. We hence propose that RALF1 peptides and de-methylesterified OGs undergo low affinity but high avidity binding assemblies. This finding complements recent data, indicating that the binding of RALF peptides and de-methylesterified OGs leads to phase separation in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Liu et al., 2024</xref>).</p><p>RALF1 contains in total eight positively charged amino acids (three lysine (K) and five arginine (R)) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2A, B</xref>). This is reminiscent of the well-characterised de-methylesterified pectin-binding protein polygalacturonase-inhibiting protein (PGIP), which binds to de-methylesterified pectin through a positively charged binding site formed by clustered residues of lysine (K) and arginine (R) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Spadoni et al., 2006</xref>). Notably, the LRX8-RALF4 complex binds de-methylesterified OGs in a charge-dependent manner in pollen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Moussu et al., 2023</xref>). To address the positive charges in RALF1, we synthesized a RALF1-like peptide by substituting the K and R residues (<italic>RALF1<sup>-KR</sup></italic>). Thereby, we created a slightly negatively charged peptide in the pH range of the cell wall (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2A, C</xref>). <italic>RALF1<sup>-KR</sup></italic> peptides are not bioactive, because they did neither affect root growth, nor cell wall integrity, nor did they induce the ligand-induced endocytosis of FER in epidermal root cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2D–I</xref>). These findings suggest that the positively charged residues in RALF1 are essential for its activity in roots. Even though we cannot rule out that <italic>RALF1<sup>-KR</sup></italic> affects several characteristics of RALF1 signalling, we used this non-charged peptide to test if these residues affect the RALF1 binding to de-methylesterified pectin. Using our in vitro system, we did not observe <italic>RALF1<sup>-KR</sup></italic> binding to de-methylesterified OGs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2J</xref>), proposing that RALF1 and OGs indeed interact in a charge-dependent manner.</p><p>The LRX-RALF complex and its interaction with pectin exert a condensing effect on the cell wall in pollen and root hairs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Moussu et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Schoenaers et al., 2024</xref>). Moreover, LRX proteins also bind and link FER with a cell wall-sensing mechanism in roots (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Dünser et al., 2019</xref>). Nevertheless, LRX function in root growth appears to be independent of FER-dependent RALF signalling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Dünser et al., 2019</xref>). Hence, we next tested if LRX proteins are required for the joint RALF1/pectin-dependent signalling in roots. We observed that RALF1 applications still induced cell wall alterations in <italic>lrx1 lrx2 lrx3 lrx4 lrx5</italic> quintuple mutant roots (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A–D</xref>).

These findings confirm our previous assumptions that LRX proteins are not essential for the RALF activity in roots (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Dünser et al., 2019</xref>) and, moreover, reveal that LRX proteins are also not required for the PME-dependent control of RALF1 signalling in roots.</p><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Leucine-rich repeat extensin (LRX) proteins are not essential for the pectin methyl esterase (PME)-dependent activity of rapid alkalinisation factor1 (RALF1).</title><p>(<bold>A, B</bold>) Confocal microscopy images (<bold>A</bold>) and quantification (<bold>B</bold>) representing the average cell wall width per root under different treatments shown in (<bold>A</bold>), of 6-day-old roots of wild-type seedlings, treated in a liquid medium with 1 µM RALF1 and/or 50 µM EGCG as well as solvent control for 3 hr.

We hence conclude that the methylation status of pectin provides a conceptualising input to RALF peptide hormone signalling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5I and J</xref>).</p><p>Concluding remarks:</p><p>Intriguingly, the exogenous application of RALF1 does not only affect cell wall characteristics but also induces prominent plasma membrane protrusions into root epidermal cells. Plasma membrane invagination is a highly controlled process and often relates to plant endosymbiotic events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Su et al., 2023</xref>). The developmental importance of this RALF1 effect remains to be addressed but could pinpoint pectin signalling playing a central role in the structural coordination of cell wall and plasma membrane dynamics. Most importantly, we reveal an essential function of the cell wall component pectin for RALF1 peptide signalling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5I and J</xref>). We illustrate that the pharmacological and genetic interference with PME activity specifically abolishes RALF1, but not flg22 peptide, activity in roots. We conclude that PME activity is required for all hallmarks of RALF1 signalling, including the rapid alkalinisation of the cell wall and the ligand-induced endocytosis of FER. We hence propose that the generation of de-methylesterified, negatively charged pectin in the cell wall is required for the FER-dependent perception of positively charged RALF1 at the root cell surface. We show that RALF1 binds in a charge-dependent manner to de-methylesterified OGs in vitro and that the application of free OGs can out-titrate RALF1 peptides in the medium. Our in vitro data proposes low affinity but a high avidity binding of OGs and RALF1. This interaction mechanism could be key in the spatial enrichment of RALF peptides at the root surface because receptor interactions at the plasma membrane could contribute to the accumulated strength of multiple binding interactions. In agreement, after we pre-printed a previous version of this manuscript (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Rößling et al., 2023</xref>), Moussu and colleagues proposed that the LRX8-RALF4 complex and its charge-dependent binding of de-methylesterified OGs controls extracellular condensations in pollen tubes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Moussu et al., 2023</xref>). The contribution of FER signalling remains unknown in this process, but a similar structural mechanism defines root hair growth in a FER-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Schoenaers et al., 2024</xref>). Within the main root, the RALF peptide binding to de-methylesterified pectin was suggested to be sufficient to lead to its extracellular phase separation, subsequently inducing the clustering of FER receptors in the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Liu et al., 2024</xref>). It remained, however, unknown if LRX proteins are implied in this root organ growth response. LRX proteins directly interact with FER and thereby contribute to cell wall sensing in roots (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Dünser et al., 2019</xref>). Notably, LRX proteins are not required to sense RALF1 in roots (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Dünser et al., 2019</xref>) and also the inhibition of PMEs still represses RALF1 activity in <italic>lrx1 lrx2 lrx3 lrx4 lrx5</italic> quintuple mutant roots. These findings suggest an LRX-independent mode of action in the FER-RALF1-pectin signalling mechanism. Our findings (this study and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Dünser et al., 2019</xref>) pinpoint distinct FER- and RALF-dependent roles of LRX proteins. Considering that LRX8-RALF4-pectin interaction contributes to wall integrity and pollen tube expansion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Moussu et al., 2023</xref>), distinct modes of cell wall integrity control may be also in place in root cells and tip-growing pollen tubes.</p><p>Based on our findings, we envision that negatively charged, de-methylesterified pectin could function as a signalling scaffold for positively charged RALF peptides, which seems crucial for its signalling via the FER receptor. It needs to be seen how precisely the RALF binding to homogalacturonan affects its interaction with FER receptors. Here it is noteworthy that the pectin sensing function of FER is physically separated from the RALF binding domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gronnier et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p>The impact of de-methylesterified pectin on RALF signalling could also lead to self-emerging feedback properties because high extracellular PME activity is expected to strongly acidify the apoplast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Wolf et al., 2009</xref>), which in turn would be counteracted by the de-methylesterified pectin-induced activation of RALF peptides and its consequences on apoplast alkalinisation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Haruta et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Barbez et al., 2017</xref>; this study). The here uncovered mechanism links the pectin-related cell wall status with RALF peptide hormone signalling. A scaffold protein can tether signalling components, enhancing the efficiency and specificity of cellular signalling pathways by acting as a structural framework. In analogy, we propose that pectin functions in a PME-dependent manner as a tunable extracellular signalling scaffold.</p></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s3-1"><title>Plant material and growth conditions</title><p>All experiments were carried out in <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>, ecotype <italic>Col-0</italic>.

But according to expression data and the study from Abarca et al., 2021, RALF1 is not the only peptide expressed in the root and also having an impact in root growth effect. Similarly, looking at the primary sequence from RALF1 it does not differ much chemically from other RALFs such as RALF33, RALF23, RALF22, etc. So, does the cell wall pectin methylation status also have an impact on the effect of other RALFs on root growth or is that specific of RALF1?</p><p>(b) In addition, is the internalization of FER depending only on RALF1 upon the methylation status of cell wall pectins? Or can other RALFs cause a similar effect potentially?</p><p>(c) The authors propose that RALF1 associates with deesterifed pectin, through electrostatic interactions. To do that they perform Biolayer interferometry assays using a buffer with pH 7.4. Is that a relevant pH at the cell wall? Is possible that the authors thought that this may not change the charges of R and K residues, however, it will affect the overall charge of the peptide given the fact that it contains quite some N and Q in the exposed surface. The authors may want to consider that.</p><p>(d) Moreover, the authors do not use their peptide RALF1KR, suggested as a peptide not binding OGs, as a control in their OG binding assays. That biochemical experiment should also be included to validate their results and conclusions.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank reviewer #1 for these comments. In this work, we focused on RALF1 but the majority of AtRALF peptides, when applied exogenously as synthetic peptides, induce RALF1like effects in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> (Abarca et al., 2021; PMID: 34608971). Moreover, all RALF peptides display clusters of R and K residues and are negatively charged (Abarca et al., 2021; PMID: 34608971). In comparison to RALF1, we now also use RALF34 because it was suggested to interact also via the <italic>Catharanthus roseus</italic> receptor-like kinase 1-like (CrRLK1L) THESEUS1 (THE1). Notably, RALF34 also induced the internalization of FER-GFP. Moreover, the interference with PME also disrupted this activity of RALF34. Therefore, we assume that other RALF peptides display the same or similar signalling modalities. Nevertheless, it remains to be addressed if all RALF family members require PME activity.</p><p>We appreciated these comments and incorporated this aspect in the revised version of the manuscript. The pH was chosen for technical reasons associated with the used BLI buffer. As requested, we also included the RALF1-KR peptide in our OG binding assays. Under these conditions, the mutated peptides were not able to interact with the OGs anymore. Accordingly, we conclude that the K and R residues in RALF1 are crucial for its binding to demethylesterified OGs.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(e) Another important aspect is regarding their design RALF1KR mutant and its effect in planta. The authors report the following: &quot;RALF1-KR peptides are not bioactive, because they did neither affect root growth, nor cell wall integrity, nor did they induce the ligand-induced endocytosis of FER in epidermal root cells (Figure 5D-I). These findings suggest that the positively charged residues in RALF1 are essential for its activity in roots.&quot; According to the structure published by Xiao at el. 2019, the R in the alpha helix from RALF peptides (YISYQSLKR... in RALF1 seq) is directly involved in the interaction with LLGs. So, a mutation in that R may impair the interaction of RALF1 with LLG and therefore the complex formation with FER. So, it is well possible that the effect that the authors are seeing on FER signaling and endocytosis, using this peptide variant, may not be due to the impaired capacity of the peptide to bind deesterified pectin but to not be able to be sensed by the membrane complex directly. To verify that the authors should test, either biochemically or by CoIP in planta, that their RALF1KR variant can still be perceived by the LLG-FER complex.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with reviewer #1 and do not doubt that the positive charges in RALF1 likely interact with several entities. The respective sites were also covered in Liu et al., 2024 (Cell). It would be interesting to understand how the charge-dependent interaction with pectin modulates the RALF binding to the LLG-FER complex, but these experiments are beyond the scope of this manuscript. We confirmed that the negative charges in RALF1 are essential for OG binding as well as for its bioactivity. We however do not rule out that they bear additional structural functions beyond pectin binding. We clarified this aspect in the revised version. It is conceivable that the pectin and receptor complex binding of RALF1 is molecularly and mechanistically related.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(f) The authors propose in this study that this effect of RALF1-pectin mode of action on FER is independent from LRXs. That is a very interesting observation which also aligns with similar observations from other independent studies (Moussu et al., 2020; Schoenaers et al. Nat Plants, 2024; Franck et al., 2018). However, that seems to be in conflict with the previous mode of action that the authors had described in Dunser et al., 2019. In that last study the authors had described that FER constitutively interacts with LRX proteins in a direct way to sense cell wall changes. In my view the authors do not critically elaborate to explain these two contradicting results, which are key to understand the mode of action they are describing. This relevant aspect should be addressed more in depth by the authors in their discussion.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the comment. We do not see that our findings contradict our previous work (from Dünser et al., 2019). There we concluded that LRX and FER directly interact to sense cell wall characteristics. However, the loss of <italic>LRX</italic> function abolished the cell wall sensing mechanism, but the respective loss-of-function and dominant negative lines were still able to detect RALF peptides. We hence proposed that the LRX/FER function is at least partially independent of the FER function in RALF perception. This is in agreement with our current study where we conclude again that FER shows LRX-dependent but also -independent modes of action.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Minor</p><p>(g) In the introduction (first page), the authors write the following sentence: &quot;RALF peptides are involved in multiple physiological and developmental processes, ranging from organ growth and pollen tube guidance to modulation of immune responses (Stegmann et al., 2017; Abarca et al., 2021)&quot;. RALFs are not involved in pollen tube guidance but pollen tube growth.</p><p>So, that should be changed in the Introduction sentence. Also, in addition, the authors could cite additional references here to support the sentence such as Mecchia et al., 2017 or Ge et al. , 2017, in addition.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for pointing this out and we apologize for our flaw. We corrected the statement in the revised version of the manuscript and added the citations as requested.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(h) The new study of Schoenaers et al.

As ethanol inducible systems can be rather leaky, it would not be surprising if PME activity would be reduced even without induction, but maybe this would warrant testing whether PMEI3 is actually overexpressed and/or whether PME activity is decreased. On a similar note, the PMEI5ox plants do not appear to show the typical phenotype described for this line. I personally don't think these lines are necessary to support the study. Short-term interference with PME activity (such as with EGCG) might be more meaningful than life-long PMEI overexpression, in light of the numerous feedback pathways and their associated potential secondary effects. This might also explain why EGCG leads to an increase in pH, as one would expect from decreased PME activity, while PMEI expression (caveats from above apply) apparently does not (Fig 3A-D).</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with reviewer #2. The PMEI3ox line from Peaucelle et al., 2008 is ethanolinducible, but we observed a strong phenotype (at seedling and adult stage) without ethanol induction. We performed all experiments (root growth assays and confocal observations) with as well as without induction using ethanol, leading to similar results. We concluded from that, that the line is either leaky or that overexpression of PMEI3 is already induced upon seed sterilisation with ethanol. Accordingly, we did not intend to use the lines as acute inhibition of PME but rather used the lines to genetically confirm our data derived from acute pharmacological inhibition. We do show in Figure 1G that the levels of de-methylesterified pectin is decreased in the PMEI3ox mutant compared to WT seedlings. It is exactly this alteration that we are exploiting to assess the necessity of charged pectin for RALF1 signalling. Since the apoplastic pH in the PMEI3ox line is not altered compared to WT, we can conclude that the observed effect on RALF1 signalling is entirely due to the altered pectin charge.</p><p>We would like to note that the PMEI5ox line indeed shows the reported root-bending phenotype when grown on plates. We started to perform RALF application assays in liquid medium, because EGCG does not show activity on MS plates. Moreover, it allows us to perform the assays with low amounts of synthetic peptides. The seedling images in our root growth assay might be hence misleading since the assay was done in liquid MS medium and the seedlings were carefully straightened on MS plates before imaging. This transfer makes it difficult to observe the root-bending or -curling phenotype, which is typical for PMEI5ox.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>At least at first sight, the observation that OGs are able to titrate RALF from pectin binding seems at odds with the idea of cooperative binding with low affinity, leading to high avidity oligomers. Perhaps the can provide a speculative conceptual model of these interactions?</p></disp-quote><p>We added a high concentration of OGs in the media and observed a strong repression of RALF1 activity at the root surface. We assume the OGs form oligomers with RALF peptides in the media, preventing them from penetrating the roots.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>I could not find a description of the OG treatment/titration experiments, but I think it would be important to understand how these were performed with respect to OG concentration, timing of the application, etc.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for pointing this out.

May also be worth mentioning that the previously described pectin sensing function of FER is physically separated from the RALF binding domain (Gronnier et al., 2022)</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your constructive comments. We followed your suggestions and further improved the discussion in the revised version of our manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the Authors):</bold></p><p>(1) The authors claim that pectin is something like an extracellular signaling scaffold. In other fields, signalling scaffold refers to proteins that tether the signalling components and regulate/are involved in the signal transduction. Here, pectin is a cell wall structural component whose molecular status is sensed and perceived rather than a functional signaling component. To me, it is FERONIA to be called a signalling scaffold in this case. However, this is my view, and the authors may present their concept.</p></disp-quote><p>RALF peptides as well as FERONIA bind to de-methylesterified pectin, which is essential for its signalling output. Albeit not being a protein, we propose that pectin functions like a scaffold tethering both signalling components and thereby enabling signalling. FERONIA has been indeed also proposed to function as a scaffold when tethering other signalling components.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) I have no problem with authors using the more general term pectin instead of homogalacturonan throughout the text. Still, authors should, at some point in the text, specify that by pectin, they mean homogalacturonan; the authors did not analyze other pectic types on binding.</p></disp-quote><p>We followed your suggestion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) The authors show that RALF1 binds to OGs with a high avidity. Given the fact that OGs released from homogalacturonan upon pathogen infection are Damage-Associated Molecular Patterns (DAMPs), this opens the possibility that this particular activity of RALF1 might actually function in modulation of immune response. I suggest that authors should not exclude this possibility.</p></disp-quote><p>We fully agree to this possibility for FER-dependent signalling.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) Are there any indications that a similar mechanism can be extrapolated to other FERONIA homologs, such as THESEUS or HERCULES? Although it is not essential to comment, I think this could enrich the discussion.</p></disp-quote><p>This is a highly interesting research question, which we may follow up in our upcoming studies. RALF34, which is considered a ligand for THESEUS, also induced FER internalization, which was also sensitive to PME inhibition. While this requires further investigation, this finding hints at a common mechanism for FER- and THE-dependent RALF peptides.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) I suggest using the model scheme currently in the supplement as a main figure to provide an immediate accessible summary of the findings.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the suggestion to add the summary scheme in the main figures.
