Here, we profiled global mRNA translation dynamics in the mouse primary macrophage-mediated inflammatory response and identified hundreds of differentially translated mRNAs. These mRNAs’ 3’UTRs have enriched binding motifs for several RNA-binding proteins, which implies extensive translational regulatory networks. We characterized one such protein, Zfp36, as a translation repressor. Using primary macrophages from a Zfp36-V5 epitope tagged knock-in mouse generated by CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome editing, we found that the endogenous Zfp36 directly interacts with the cytoplasmic poly(A)-binding protein. Importantly, this interaction is required for the translational repression of Zfp36’s target mRNAs in resolving inflammation. Altogether, these results uncovered critical roles of translational regulations in controlling appropriate gene expression during the inflammatory response and revealed a new biologically relevant molecular mechanism of translational repression via modulating the cytoplasmic poly(A)-binding protein.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.27786.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.27786.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.27786.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>DNA sequences called genes produce RNA molecules, some of which (the “messenger RNAs”) go on to be ‘translated’ to make proteins. This gene activity enables cells to react to their surroundings. For example, immune cells called macrophages produce hundreds of RNA molecules and proteins as part of an inflammatory response that defends the body against an infection. However, many of these molecules can also damage healthy tissue, so many layers of regulation control when, and how much of, these molecules are made.</p><p>There are several ways to control how many proteins a cell produces. For example, cells might regulate how many messenger RNA molecules (also called mRNAs for short) are produced from a gene, or control how many proteins are translated from those mRNA molecules. Previous studies of how inflammatory responses are regulated have largely focussed on how mRNA production is controlled. Much less is known about the role that regulating mRNA translation has on the inflammatory response.</p><p>By studying mouse macrophages, Zhang, Chen et al. have now identified hundreds of proteins whose production is regulated during an inflammatory response by controlling their translation from mRNA molecules. A group of RNA-binding proteins produced by the macrophages perform this regulation. Further observation revealed that a particular RNA-binding protein called Zfp36 prevents the translation of several important mRNAs, thereby helping to end an inflammatory response.</p><p>Zhang, Chen et al. then genetically engineered mice to produce a version of Zfp36 that has a ‘tag’ attached to it that makes the protein easier to detect. Studying the activity of Zfp36 in these mice revealed that this RNA-binding protein works by interacting with another protein that normally binds to structures known as poly(A) tails at the end of the mRNA molecules.</p><p>Zhang, Chen et al. believe that similar genetic engineering approaches could help researchers to study how other RNA-binding proteins work in living animals. In addition, by better understanding how inflammatory responses are regulated it may be possible to investigate new ways of treating conditions where this response is prolonged, such as in autoimmune disorders like rheumatoid arthritis.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.27786.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.27786.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>translational control</kwd><kwd>RNA-binding protein</kwd><kwd>inflammatory response</kwd><kwd>post-transcriptional regulation</kwd><kwd>poly(A) tail binding protein</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100007048</institution-id><institution>Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hu</surname><given-names>Wenqian</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000050</institution-id><institution>National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R00HL118157</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hu</surname><given-names>Wenqian</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01GM102515</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhang</surname><given-names>Shaojie</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The RNA-binding protein, Zfp36, which is critical for resolving inflammation, inhibits the production of proinflammatory cytokines via modulation of the cytoplasmic poly(A)-binding protein.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>eLife Digest</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Precise generation of gene products is essential for cells to mount proper responses to physiological and pathological stimuli. This accuracy is achieved by multiple layers of regulations that occur synchronously at different steps of gene expression, including transcription, splicing, translation, mRNA stability, and protein modification and degradation. Importantly, malfunction of these regulatory circuits contributes to many pathological conditions. Thus, characterizing the regulatory networks controlling gene expression is of both biological and clinical significance.</p><p>Macrophages are an important type of innate immune cell involved in both detecting exogenous and endogenous danger signals and initiating proper immune responses (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Medzhitov and Janeway, 2000</xref>). These danger signals are recognized as pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) by pattern-recognition receptors (PRRs). PAMPs are molecules that are absent in host cells but broadly shared by pathogens. For example, macrophages can detect bacterial infection by recognizing bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a cell membrane component present in gram-negative bacteria, by a PRR, toll-like receptor 4. This recognition activates signaling transduction cascades that result in rapid expression of inflammatory response genes to control infection. Many gene products from the inflammatory response, such as the proinflammatory cytokine TNF (tumor necrosis factor alpha), however, are also toxic to healthy tissues (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kalliolias and Ivashkiv, 2016</xref>). Thus, the expression of these inflammatory genes is tightly controlled by multiple regulatory circuits to maintain a delicate balance between managing infection/injury and damaging normal tissues (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hanada and Yoshimura, 2002</xref>). Critically, malfunction of these regulations can result in pathologic inflammation that is associated with a wide variety of human diseases, including obesity, cardiovascular and neurodegenerative diseases, and cancer (Reviewed in<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kotas and Medzhitov, 2015</xref>). Thus, characterizing regulatory programs in the inflammatory response will both reveal fundamental mechanisms of gene expression and provide insights into inflammation-associated diseases.</p><p>Previous studies have identified multiple programs controlling mRNA production and degradation in macrophage-mediated inflammatory responses (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Carpenter et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Medzhitov and Horng, 2009</xref>). For example, stimulation of PRRs by PAMPs can activate several transcription factors, such as nuclear factor-κB, interferon-regulatory factors, and CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein-δ, which results in the rapid induction of inflammatory response genes. These genes include both cytokines (e.g. TNF) to control infection and negative regulators of inflammatory signaling pathways (e.g. suppressors of cytokine signaling proteins) to limit the detrimental effects of inflammation. Besides transcriptional regulations, inflammatory response genes are also subject to controls at the mRNA stability level. The 3’-untranslated regions (UTRs) of many inflammatory cytokine mRNAs have sequence motifs, such as AU-rich elements (AREs) and constitutive decay elements (CDE) that can promote rapid mRNA degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Garneau et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Stoecklin et al., 2003</xref>). These mRNA decay mechanisms help to prevent sustained expression of potentially harmful cytokines, thereby contributing to resolving inflammation. Together, these regulations at the mRNA production and degradation levels ensure appropriate transcriptomic responses during inflammation.</p><p>In eukaryotic cells, mRNA degradation is intimately linked with mRNA translation (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Roy and Jacobson, 2013</xref>). Interestingly, temporal regulation of translation and mRNA decay is an important mechanism of inhibiting gene expression. For example, certain microRNAs down-regulate the expression of their target mRNAs by first inhibiting translation and then promoting mRNA degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bazzini et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Djuranovic et al., 2012</xref>). Compared to our knowledge of mRNA stability regulations, our understanding of mRNA translational control during the inflammatory responses, however, is still very limited. Recent observations from activated macrophage-like cell lines indicate that several mRNAs are differentially translated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Schott et al., 2014</xref>), which implies important roles of controlling mRNA translation during the inflammatory response. The <italic>trans</italic>-acting factors regulating the translation of these mRNAs, however, are still largely unknown.</p><p>In this study, we explored translational regulation of the inflammatory response mediated by mouse primary bone-marrow-derived-macrophages (BMDMs). Using ribosome profiling, we identified hundreds of differentially translated mRNAs. Interestingly, the 3’UTRs of these mRNAs have significantly enriched binding motifs for several RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) expressed in the activated BMDMs, which suggests widespread mRNA translational regulatory networks. We functionally characterized one such RBP, Zfp36, which is required for resolving inflammation, as a translational repressor. Using primary BMDMs from a V5-epitope tag knock-in mouse generated by CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome editing, we identified the target mRNAs of the endogenous Zfp36 by CLIP-seq (cross-linking immunoprecipitation followed by high-throughput sequencing). Moreover, using quantitative proteomics, we found that the endogenous Zfp36 predominantly interacts with the cytoplasmic poly(A)-binding protein (Pabpc1) in an RNA-independent manner in primary activated BMDMs. Critically, this interaction is required for the translational repression of the Zfp36 target mRNAs, including the mRNAs encoding several important proinflammatory cytokines, in the activated BMDMs. Collectively, these results highlight critical roles of translational regulations in controlling appropriate gene expression during the inflammatory response and reveal a new biologically relevant molecular mechanism of translational repression via modulating Pabpc1.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Global translational profiling during the macrophage-mediated inflammatory response</title><p>We used the response of mouse primary BMDMs to LPS as a model to study translational regulations in inflammation, because this is one of the best-characterized inflammatory responses (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Medzhitov and Janeway, 2000</xref>). Specifically, mouse primary BMDMs were treated with 100 ng/ml LPS and collected at 0, 1, 2, 4, and 6 hr after LPS stimulation. Cells harvested at each time point were split into two fractions, which were subjected to either RNA-seq or ribosome profiling (Ribo-seq) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). In RNA-seq, ribosomal-RNA-depleted total RNAs were randomly fragmented, followed by directional cloning for sequencing. In Ribo-seq, the ribosome-protected mRNA fragments (RPFs) were isolated by sucrose-density gradients and then subjected to directional cloning and sequencing. The resulting reads were then aligned to a well-annotated mouse transcriptome, with more than 300 million reads mapped in total. Thereby, we profiled mRNA expression and the ribosome-mRNA association in parallel during the BMDM-mediated inflammatory response.<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.27786.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Global translation profiling of mouse primary BMDM-mediated inflammatory response.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Workflow of parallel ribosome and RNA profiling during the BMDM-mediated inflammatory response.

Moreover, the following fundamental features of translation can be captured at single-nucleotide resolution from these data. First, the RPFs precisely delineate known coding sequences (CDSs) and their exons, with 12-nt and 15-nt offsets upstream of the translation start codons and termination codons, reflecting known distances from RFP 5’-termini to the P- and A- site codons, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Second, the RPFs have 3-nt codon periodicity, a key feature of translocating ribosomes, but the RNA-seq reads do not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Third, the RPFs are highly specific to CDS regions compared with the RNA-seq reads (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Collectively, these observations indicate good data quality for global analysis of translational regulation in the inflammatory response.</p><p>To identify differentially translated mRNAs in the inflammatory response, we calculated the apparent translation efficiency (TE) for each mRNA expressed above a threshold (FPKM ≥10) at each time point. Here, we defined the apparent TE as the enrichment of RPFs over RNA-seq reads in the CDS regions. We found 724 mRNAs with significant (empirical p&lt;0.05) TE changes across the five time-points during the LPS treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>). Gene ontology analysis revealed that these mRNAs are involved in diverse pathways (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>), including the TNF and NF-kB signaling pathways that are critical in inflammatory responses. Indeed, <italic>TNF</italic> mRNA, encoding the essential inflammatory cytokine TNF, is translationally regulated. This mRNA is transcriptionally induced from 0 to 1 hr upon LPS stimulation and then decreases from 1 to 2 hr, and the mRNA level stays relatively stable untill 6 hr post-stimulation. The RPFs of <italic>TNF</italic> mRNA, however, decreases significantly from 1 to 6 hr, with few <italic>TNF</italic> RPFs at 6 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>), which indicates <italic>TNF</italic> mRNA is translationally repressed in the late stages of inflammation. Indeed, the apparent TE of <italic>TNF</italic> mRNA in the BMDMs had a significant decrease from 1 hr to 6 hr post LPS stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3A</xref>). To further confirm this result, we performed polysome analysis followed by qRT-PCR to monitor the distribution <italic>TNF</italic> mRNA across the sucrose gradient (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3B</xref>). Compared with <italic>TNF</italic> mRNA at the 1 hr time point, the <italic>TNF</italic> mRNA had a significant shift from the polyribosome region to the mRNP region on the sucrose gradient at 6 hr post the LPS treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3B and C</xref>), indicating that this transcript was translationally repressed. Importantly, the distribution of a control mRNA, <italic>Gapdh</italic> mRNA, did not change between the 1 hr and the 6 hr time points (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3C</xref>), which indicates the specificity of the translational repression on the <italic>TNF</italic> mRNA.

Next, from this list of RBPs, we chose those that are expressed (FPKM ≥10) in BMDMs, which resulted in a group of RBPs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>) that may be potential translational regulators in the inflammatory response. Among these RBPs are several known translational regulators, such as Pcbp1, Pcbp2, and Cpeb4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hu et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Makeyev and Liebhaber, 2002</xref>), which supports the validity of this approach.</p><p>Here, we focused on Zfp36 (TTP), an ARE(AU-rich element)-binding protein, for several reasons. First, genetic studies in mouse indicated that Zfp36 is required to resolve inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Taylor et al., 1996</xref>). Second, Zfp36 is abundantly expressed in activated BMDMs (FPKM &gt;200). Third, although Zfp36 was characterized to promote target mRNA degradation (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Brooks and Blackshear, 2013</xref>), its role in mRNA translational control is not well understood in primary BMDMs.</p><p>To test whether Zfp36 can regulate mRNA translation, we performed the tethering experiments, which allow us to determine the function of a target RBP without knowing its substrate mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Coller and Wickens, 2007</xref>). Specifically, using the robust and specific interaction between the bacteriophage λN polypeptide and the BoxB RNA motif, we tethered a λN-Zfp36 fusion protein to the 3’UTR of a firefly luciferase (FLuc) mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>).

Although useful mechanistic insights can be obtained, there are three caveats in interpreting these previous results: (1) cell lines may not represent the corresponding primary cells; (2) proteins binding to the overexpressed Zfp36 may not interact with the endogenous Zfp36; and (3) for many identified interactions, their effect on gene expression are still unknown. Similar limitations also apply to the mRNA targets identified in Zpf36-overexpressing macrophage-like and nonmacrophage cell lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Mukherjee et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Tiedje et al., 2016</xref>). One significant technical challenge of studying the endogenous Zpf36, however, is the unavailability of IP-grade antibodies for specific and efficient Zfp36 isolation.</p><p>To characterize the endogenous Zfp36-mediated regulation of gene expression in a biologically relevant setting and to overcome the technical obstacles, we created a V5-epiptope tag knock-in mouse using CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome editing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Specifically, a sgRNA targeting a genomic site near the stop codon region of the Zfp36 locus was coinjected into mouse zygotes with the Cas9 enzyme and an oligonucleotide containing a 51-nt V5-epitotpe tag with a ~ 60 nt homologous arm on each side of the V5 sequence. The double-stranded DNA break generated by the Cas9 facilitated in-frame knock-in of the V5-epitope tag via homologous recombination. The genetically modified zygotes were transferred into foster mouse mothers, and the Zfp36-V5 knock-in allele in the resulting mice was monitored by PCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). We genetically purified this Zfp36-V5 knock-in allele via backcrosses. The homozygous Zfp36-V5 mice were born in the predicted Mendelian ratio from heterozygous matings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Moreover, unlike Zfp36-deficient BMDMs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Taylor et al., 1996</xref>), BMDMs from the Zfp36-V5 mice have the same response to LPS as those from wild-type mice in terms of inflammatory cytokine induction and Zfp36 expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>), which indicates that the Zfp36-V5 in the knock-in mice is expressed at the same endogenous level as Zfp36 is in wild-type mice. Furthermore, the Zfp36-V5 mice are phenotypically indistinguishable from the wild-type mice. These observations are consistent with the notion that the 51-nt V5-tag knock-in sequence neither alters the Zfp36 promoter nor changes the regulatory elements in the 3’UTR.<fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.27786.008</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Generation of a Zfp36 V5-epitope tag knock-in mouse for mechanistic studies on the endogenous Zfp36.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Workflow for generating a Zfp36-V5 knock-in mouse via CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome editing.

Specifically, BMDMs from the Zfp36-V5 mice were harvested after 4 hr of LPS stimulation, when Zfp36-V5 is abundantly expressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref>). The Zfp36 and its associated proteins were IPed using the V5 antibody or IgG as control. Due to Zfp36’s RNA-binding ability, the IP was performed with RNaseA, which disrupts RNA-mediated interactions, so that only protein-protein interactions can be isolated. The IPed proteins were subject to tandem mass-tag (TMT)-based quantitative proteomic analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Thompson et al., 2003</xref>) to identify the proteins specifically associated with Zfp36 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). In this method, the proteins isolated by the V5 antibody or IgG were digested by trypsin. The resulting peptides from each sample were labeled with a different isobaric mass tag, followed by pooling together for mass spectrometry (isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantification, iTRAQ) identification and quantification. The unique mass tag of each sample enables comparison of the abundance of the identified proteins in the V5 IP versus the IgG control samples.

First, we performed IPs in stimulated BMDMs from the Zfp36-V5 mice and wild-type mice with or without RNaseA using the V5 antibody. Endogenous Pabpc1 was detected by Western blot in the IP samples from the Zfp36-V5 BMDMs in an RNaseA-insensitive manner but not in that from the wild-type BMDMs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). Importantly, Gapdh, an abundant cytoplasmic protein, was not detected in the IP samples, which indicates the specificity of the IPs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). This result showed that the endogenous Zfp36-Pabpc1 interaction is not mediated by RNA. To further confirm that the interaction between these two RBPs is RNA-independent and to rule out the possibility that this interaction is mediated by the V5 tag, we performed IPs in 293 T cells expressing an HA-tagged Pabpc1 with either a FLAG-tagged Zfp36 or a FLAG-tagged RNA-binding-deficient Zfp36 mutant (Zfp36[F118N]) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Lai et al., 2002</xref>). We found that the HA-tagged Pabpc1 was specifically co-IPed with both the wild-type and the mutant Zfp36 in the presence of RNaseA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). To further rule out the possibility that the Zfp36-Pacbpc1 interaction is mediated by poly(A) sequences that RNaseA cannot degrade, we performed the IP experiment with RNAse1, which degrades RNA in a non-sequence-specific manner. We found that Zfp36 still interacted with Pabpc1 under this condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). Collectively, these experiments revealed that the Zfp36-Pabpc1 interaction is truly RNA-independent. Since Pabp1c is the most abundant Zfp36-associated protein identified by the quantitative proteomics, it argues that the endogenous Zfp36-Pabpc1 interaction is a direct interaction in the activated BMDMs.</p><p>To define a minimal region on Zfp36 that can specifically interact with Pabpc1, we performed structure-function mappings. In detail, a series of FLAG-tagged Zfp36 truncations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>) were coexpressed in 293 T cells with an HA-tagged Pabpc1 for co-IP, respectively. We took two steps to ensure that the identified interaction is RNA-independent. First, all the Zfp36 truncations had the F118N mutation (Zfp36-m), which abolishes RNA-binding ability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Lai et al., 2002</xref>). Second, the IPs were performed with RNaseA. This analysis resulted in a minimal region from amino acids 39 to 196 on Zfp36 (Zfp36-mF) that can be stably expressed and specifically interacts with Pabpc1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Zfp36-mediated translational repression is dependent on Pabpc1</title><p>To test whether the Zfp36-Pabpc1 interaction is required for the Zfp36-mediated translational repression, we performed two experiments.

The protein-free regions of RNAs were digested by RNase1 in the cell lysate. Then, the Zfp36 and its associated RNA fragments were IPed by the V5 antibody.

We then examined the distribution of seven Zfp36 target mRNAs across the gradient. These mRNAs are abundantly expressed and have strong Zfp36-binding peaks within their 3’UTRs. Upon weakening the Zfp36-Pabpc1 interaction, all seven of the Zfp36 target mRNAs had significant shifts from the mRNP region, which is devoid of translocating ribosome, to the polyribosome region, where active translation occurs, on the sucrose gradient (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>).

IRES elements are structured RNAs present in many viruses that can position and activate eukaryotic translation initiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Fraser and Doudna, 2007</xref>). Importantly, compared with canonical translation, different viral IRES elements require different subsets of translation initiation factors. Thus, by examining the sensitivity of various IRES-mediated translations to Zfp36, we aimed to dissect which step(s) of translation are repressed by Zfp36. Here, we used two IRES elements: the hepatitis C virus (HCV) IRES, which requires all the initiation factors except eIF4G and eIF4E for translation initiation, and the cricket paralysis virus (CrPV) IRES, which only needs the 40S ribosome subunit for translation initiation. These two IRES elements were inserted between an FLuc CDS and a renilla luciferase (RLuc) CDS on the bicistronic reporter, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). Thus, FLuc translation is controlled by the canonical cap-dependent translation, whereas RLuc is translated by IRES-mediated translation. In addition, the BoxB RNA motifs in the 3’UTR of the reporter enable specific tethering of either Zfp36 or a control protein (GFP) on the bicistronic reporter mRNAs using the λN polypeptide. When Zfp36 was tethered, the reporter mRNA levels did not change compared with those of GFP tethering (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). Interestingly, however, both the FLuc and the RLuc luciferase activities were significantly decreased in either the HCV-IRES reporter or the CrPV-IRES reporter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). Since the 40S ribosome subunit is the only factor needed by the CrPV IRES element to initiate translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Fraser and Doudna, 2007</xref>), these results strongly argue that Zfp36 either interferes with 40S ribosome subunit recruitment during translation initiation or inhibits the events at or after the 60S subunit joining step during mRNA translation. Interestingly, Pabpc1 also regulates these steps in facilitating mRNA translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Mangus et al., 2003</xref>).

Previous studies identified two two layers of regulation at the transcriptomic level. First, in the early stage of inflammation, several critical transcriptional factors are activated to rapidly produce mRNAs of inflammatory response genes (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Medzhitov and Horng, 2009</xref>). Second, in the late stage of inflammation, mRNA stability regulatory circuits promote the degradation of mRNAs of many inflammatory cytokines thus preventing overproduction of cytokines that are potentially toxic to normal tissues and thereby contributing to resolving inflammation (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Carpenter et al., 2014</xref>). Using parallel ribosome profiling and RNA-seq, here we identified hundreds (724) of differentially translated mRNAs in the primary BMDM-mediated inflammatory response. We think that this number may be an underestimate of mRNAs regulated at the translation level due to rapid degradation of translationally repressed mRNAs. In contrast to a few unique biological systems, such as oocytes, in which mRNA decay activity is minimal, in most somatic cells it is challenging to fully identify all the translationally regulated mRNAs at a steady state due to efficient and dynamic mRNA degradation. Nonetheless, among the 3’UTRs of the differentially translated mRNAs we identified, there are significantly enriched binding motifs of several RNA-binding proteins expressed in the activated BMDMs. These matched <italic>cis</italic>-elements and <italic>trans</italic>-acting factors strongly argue for the presence of translational regulatory networks during the inflammatory response.</p><p>Zfp36 is an important factor we characterized in these translational regulatory networks. Previous studies from multiple labs indicate that Zpf36 not only is an inducer of mRNA degradation by recruiting mRNA decay factors, such as mRNA deadenylases and decapping factors (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Brooks and Blackshear, 2013</xref>), but also can function as a translational silencer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Brooks and Blackshear, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Franks and Lykke-Andersen, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Qi et al, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Tao and Gao, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Tiedje et al., 2016</xref>). Based on the results predominantly from cell lines and overexpression systems, multiple mechanisms of Zfp36-mediated translational repression have been proposed. For example, Zfp36 can repress target mRNA translation via interacting with the translation initiation factor 4E2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Tao and Gao, 2015</xref>), binding the mRNA decapping activator RCK/p54 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Qi et al, 2012</xref>), recruiting the 4EHP-GYF2 cap-binding complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fu et al., 2016</xref>), and delivering target mRNAs to processing bodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Franks and Lykke-Andersen, 2007</xref>). Here, we focus on how endogenous Zfp36 regulates gene expression in mouse primary BMDMs. Using a knock-in mouse with a V5 epitope tag sequence inserted in-frame near the stop codon of Zfp36, we found that Pabcp1, the cytoplasmic poly(A) tail binding protein, is the most abundant RNA-independent binding partner with the Zfp36 in primary activated BMDMs. Critically, the Zfp36 expressed in the knock-in mouse is at its endogenous level, because the 51-nt knock-in V5 tag sequence neither changes the Zfp36 promoter nor eliminates the regulatory elements in the 3’UTR. Thus, this Zfp36-Pabpc1 interaction is an endogenous protein interaction in activated BMDMs. Surprisingly, however, we did not detect any mRNA decay factors or the previously identified proteins involved in translational repression in our quantitative proteomic analysis on endogenous Zfp36. How can this result be reconciled with previous findings on the proteins associated with Zfp36?</p><p>We think that this difference can be explained by the several possibilities. First, previous observations of the interactions between Zfp36 and mRNA decay factors and translational regulators were predominantly from the experiments of Zfp36 overexpression in cell lines, followed by either Co-IP or IP and mass spectrometry; or yeast two-hybrid screens (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Brooks and Blackshear, 2013</xref>). These results indicate that Zfp36 can interact with those factors. Our study, however, we focused primarily on the protein(s) that interact with endogenous Zfp36 in primary activated BMDMs. The differences in both the biological setting and the Zfp36 expression levels may contribute to the different results. Second, it is also possible that the interaction between Zfp36 and mRNA decay factors is transient and beyond detection by the quantitative proteomics we used. Consistent with this notion, mRNA decay is a highly dynamic process. Once the mRNA is destroyed, the decay factors will be released and assemble on the next transcript. Thus, it is likely that Zpf36 binds to the mRNA decay factors within a very specific time window during the life of the target mRNAs, whereas the proteins we identified are steady-state partners that interact with endogenous Zfp36 in primary activated BMDMs.</p><p>The Pabpc1-interacting region on Zfp36 overlaps with its RNA-binding domain. Critically, we confirmed that the Zfp36-Pabpc1 interaction is not mediated by RNA. Interestingly, the Pabpc1-interacting domain (in the middle) and the domains that can interact with mRNA decay factors (at the N-terminus and the C-terminus) are located in different regions on Zfp36. This observation suggests that Zfp36’s binding to Pabcp1 to repress mRNA translation (which is characterized in this study) and recruiting decay factors to promote mRNA degradation (which is described in the literature (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Brooks and Blackshear, 2013</xref>) are two different steps. Considering that mRNA translation repression can accelerate mRNA degradation (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Coller and Parker, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Richter and Coller, 2015</xref>), we speculate that these two steps are intimately related and may occur in a sequential order in the Zfp36-mediatd regulation of gene expression. Thus, we propose the following model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>): once bound to target mRNAs, Zfp36 interacts with Pabpc1 to attenuate translation; then mRNA decay factors are recruited to destroy the transcripts. Thereby, Zfp36 facilitates the transition of its target mRNAs from a translation-competent state in the initial stage of inflammation to a degradation-prone state in the late stages of the inflammatory response. Since many Zfp36 target mRNAs are proinflammatory cytokines, such as <italic>TNF</italic>, we speculate that this Zfp36-mediated transition of its target mRNAs from an active state to an inactive state of protein production facilitates resolving inflammation.</p><p>Targeting poly(A)-binding proteins by sequence-specific RBPs to repress mRNA translation is a new mechanism of translational control. Unlike our knowledge of regulating mRNA translation through the classical translational initiation factors, such as eIF4E and eIF4G, our understanding of modulating translation via Pabpc1 is very limited. Here, we determined that the Zfp36-Pabpc1 interaction is required for the Zfp36-mediated translational repression in primary activated BMDMs. Using reporter assays, we found that Zfp36 represses translation at either late stage(s) of initiation or postinitiation step(s). This result is consistent with Pabpc1’s roles in translation by enhancing ribosome recruitment to the mRNA at both the 40S ribosome subunit recruitment step and the 60S subunit joining step (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Kahvejian et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Mangus et al., 2003</xref>). Thus, we speculate that Zfp36 represses mRNA translation by compromising Pabpc1’s ability to maintain mRNA in a translation-competent state. Interestingly, Pabpc1 functions at the interface of controlling mRNA translation and stability by protecting mRNA from deadenylases and stimulating mRNA translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Mangus et al., 2003</xref>). These unique functions make Pabpc1 an ideal target for shutting down gene expression posttranscriptionally. We think that in the activated BMDMs, through modulating Pabpc1, Zfp36 can rapidly inhibit the translation of its target mRNAs and promote their degradation to resolve inflammation.</p><p>Among the 280 Zfp36 target mRNAs identified by CLIP-seq in the activated BMDMs, we noticed that not every one is translationally repressed during the inflammatory response (the differentially translated genes in the <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplemental file 1</xref> versus the mRNAs listed in the <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3-data">Supplemental file 3</xref>). This can be explained by several possibilities. First, it is possible that multiple RBPs can bind on the same mRNA, and the ultimate fate of the transcript is determined by the combinatory functions of all the associated proteins. Indeed, besides Zfp36, we also predicted several other RBPs as potential translation regulators. Thus, it would be interesting to explore the functional interactions between Zfp36 and other RBPs that can regulate the same transcripts. These results will provide insight into how Zfp36’s activity is antagonized or stimulated during the inflammatory response. Second, not every Zfp36’s binding event may result in expression changes of the target mRNAs. Third, when we determined the differentially translated mRNAs during the inflammatory response, we focused on the mRNAs with the expression levels ≥ 10 FPKM at all the time points. We set this threshold because the apparent TEs (Ribo-seq divided by RNA-seq) of lowly expressed mRNAs have large variations between the two biological replicate samples. Although have high expression levels at late time-points in the inflammatory response, some of the Zfp36 target mRNAs, such as the <italic>IL-6</italic> mRNA and the <italic>IL-1b</italic> mRNAs, are expressed at low level (&lt;10 FPKM) at 0 hr. Thus, these transcripts are excluded from the list of the identified differentially translated mRNAs.</p><p>It is important to mention that the mechanistic insights we obtained regarding Zfp36-mediated regulation of gene expression are different from previous studies in Zfp36 overexpressed cell lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Franks and Lykke-Andersen, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Qi et al, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Tao and Gao, 2015</xref>). The Zfp36-V5 knock-in mouse allowed us to focus on the endogenous Zfp36 in primary innate immune cells, making the molecular mechanisms from this study biologically relevant. We believe similar approaches can be applied to characterize molecular mechanisms of other RBPs that lack high-quality antibodies under biologically relevant settings.</p><p>In summary, our study revealed widespread translational regulations of the primary macrophage-mediated inflammatory response. We found that Zfp36, a critical RBP for resolving inflammation, mechanistically functions as a translation repressor by targeting the poly(A)-tail binding protein, Pabpc1, to inhibit proinflammation gene production. Besides Zfp36, we also identified additional RBPs that may be involved in translational regulatory networks during the inflammatory response. Future functional and mechanistic characterization of these RBPs will provide novel insights into gene expression in the innate immune response.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Material and methods</title><p>The plasmids, oligos, antibodies, chemicals used in this study are listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4-data">Supplementary file 4</xref>.</p><sec id="s4-1"><title>Zfp36-V5 knock-in mouse</title><p>The Zfp36-V5 knock-in mouse was generated via CRISP/Cas9-mediated genomic editing using the protocols described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Wang et al., 2013</xref>).

The resulting supernatant was loaded onto a 5–50% (w/v) linear sucrose-density gradient and centrifuged at 39,000 rpm (260,000 g) for 2 hr at 4°C in a Beckman SW-41Ti rotor. The gradient was fractionated using a Gradient Station (BioComp) with an ultraviolet detector (Bio-Rad EM-1). RNA from each collected fraction was isolated using the method described above.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Computational analysis</title><sec id="s4-7-1"><title>Ribo-seq and RNA-seq analysis</title><p>The Ribo-seq and RNA-seq reads were trimmed by using fastq_quality_trimmer of the FASTX-Toolkit (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://hannonlab.cshl.edu/fastx_toolkit/index.html">http://hannonlab.cshl.edu/fastx_toolkit/index.html</ext-link>). The resulting reads were aligned to reference rRNA, tRNA and mitochondrial DNA sequences by using Bowtie v.1.1.1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Langmead et al., 2009</xref>) with ‘--un’ parameter to keep the unmapped reads. The per-processed RNA-seq reads were mapped by TopHat v2.1.1 to the mm10 reference genome with Refseq annotations by using parameters ‘--min-anchor 5 --segment-length 20 --read-mismatches 1 –no-novel-juncs’. The reads count of RNA-seq and Ribo-seq were calculated by using HTseq with parameters ‘-a 10 m union’. The raw reads counts were normalized as Reads Per Kilobase of transcript per Million mapped reads (RPKM). Only genes with RPKM greater than 10 at all the stages in RNA-seq and Ribo-seq were retained. The reproducibility between the RFP of replicates was visualized and checked by R package ‘corrplot’ and ‘pysch’.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7-2"><title>Codon periodicity analysis</title><p>Codon periodicity of Ribo-seq and RNA-seq reads was assessed for known mRNAs in Refseq mm10 annotations. For annotations, only AUG-initiated CDSs were considered. Only the mapping sites of uniquely and perfectly aligned 28nt RFPs were selected to form bed files. The overlap between the mapping sites and CDS annotation was calculated by using the intersectBed function of bedtools.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7-3"><title>Translation efficiency analysis</title><p>Gene-level translation efficiency between each pair of adjacent stages was quantified by using the Babel analytical method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Olshen et al., 2013</xref>). Genes with empirical p-values&lt;0.05 at any of the stages were considered to have differentially regulated translation efficiency. The translation efficiency at each stage was calculated as the ratio of normalized RPF density (RPKM) to the normalized RNA-seq reads density. The differentially translated genes were grouped by the ‘Direction’ in Babel output at the stage with minimum p-value. The translation efficiency of grouped genes was visualized as heat map using ‘heatmap’ R package with ‘scale=row’ parameter.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7-4"><title>RNA-binding protein motif enrichment analysis</title><p>The inferred RNA-binding proteins motifs of Mus musculus from CISBP-RNA Database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://cisbp-rna.ccbr.utoronto.ca/">http://cisbp-rna.ccbr.utoronto.ca/</ext-link>) were used as the motifs database in the searching. The 3'UTR sequence of the longest CDS of mRNAs with differentially regulated TE was used as the sequence database. FIMO tool in the MEME Suite was used to search the occurrences of the motifs in the sequence database with the parameter ‘--norc’ to ignore the reverse complement DNA strand. Zero-order background files for the motif searching were generated by fasta-get-markov tool in the MEME Suite. Ten shuffled copies were generated by using the fasta-shuffle-letters function in MEME Suite preserving the base composition and sequence length, then scanned by using FIMO with the same parameters. For each motif separately, Fisher's exact test was performed to estimate the odds ratio and the empirical p-value of enrichment. The motifs with false discovery rate adjusted p-values&lt;0.05 were considered as significantly enriched.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7-5"><title>CLIP-seq analysis</title><p>The CLIP-seq reads were quality-checked by using FastQC (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/">http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/</ext-link>). The reads mapped to rRNA, tRNA and mitochomdrial DNA sequences using Bowtie were removed from datasets. The resulting reads were mapped to the mm10 genome by using STAR with the parameters suggested in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Van Nostrand et al., 2016</xref>). Piranha (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Uren et al., 2012</xref>) was used to call peaks from the two replicates over the input control datasets with parameters ‘-b 50 s -p 0.01’. The peaks were merged using mergePeaks function in HOMER if the distance between peak centers is less than or equal to 100nt. The merged peaks were then annotated by annotatePeaks tool in HOMER to the mm10 RefSeq mRNAs. The RNA sequences of the resulting peaks were obtained using getfasta (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://bedtools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/content/tools/getfasta.html">http://bedtools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/content/tools/getfasta.html</ext-link>) in bedtools with parameter ‘-s’. MEME was used to search for motifs in the sequences of Clip-seq peaks with parameter ‘-w 8’. The GO term analysis of the mRNAs with Clip-seq peaks was performed by Enrichr (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://amp.pharm.mssm.edu/Enrichr/">http://amp.pharm.mssm.edu/Enrichr/</ext-link>).</p></sec></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Dr. Juan R Alvarez-Dominguez for critical comments and Dr. Alyssa Quiggle for English editing on this manuscript.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by James Manley (Senior Editor) and three reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal his identity: Georg Stoecklin (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Zhang et al. analyze changes in mRNA translation during macrophage activation, and examine the mechanism by which the AU-rich element (ARE)-binding protein Zfp36 suppresses translation. Through an elegant knock-in strategy, they generate mice expressing V5-tagged Zfp36 from the endogenous locus. This allows them to identify under physiological conditions in primary bone-marrow derived macrophages both RNA targets of endogenous Zfp36 by CLIP, and protein interaction partners of endogenous Zfp36 by IP/MS. While the CLIP results confirm the known binding site and targets of Zfp36, the mass spec results suggest that Zfp36 interacts through a protein-protein interaction with Pabpc1, the major cytoplasmic poly-A RNA binding protein. The authors further narrow down the interacting region as the double zinc finger domain of Zfp36 with some flanking sequence on both sides. Based on a deletion mutant of Zpf36 that does not interact with Pabpc1, they propose that Zfp36 suppresses the translation of target mRNAs via its interaction with Pabpc1. This results it corroborated by overexpression of a Zfp36 fragment that reduces the interaction of endogenous full-length Zfp36 with Pabpc1.</p><p>The study shows potential for progressing the field of cytoplasmic regulation of gene expression. The mouse knock-in approach has pioneering character and should inspire other researchers in the field. Yet, there are some unresolved mechanistic issues that would need to be addressed before publication in <italic>eLife</italic>. Also, there appears to be a substantial lack of scholarship in terms of citing earlier work.</p><p>The principal evidence for the proposed mechanism is a Zfp36 mutant (mF) that contains large deletions of the N- and C-termini. This mutant is not specific for Pabpc1, and based on published reports will also be deficient for many other interactions. Deletion of the N-terminus will abolish binding of GYF2/4EHP, which was reported to mediate translational silencing of TTP targets. Deletion of the C-terminus will abolish binding to the Ccr4-Not complex, which may also mediate translational silencing given its role in the translational repression of miRNA-bound mRNAs. Hence, the Zfp36-mF mutant is by no means specific, and does not prove that binding of Pabpc1 is critical for mediating translational suppression. Given the known role of Pabpc1 as a general enhancer of translation, it is difficult to conceive how it would act as a translational suppressor when bound to Zpf36. A key experiment the authors could carry out is an in vitro translation assay, where recombinant Zfp36 would specifically suppress translation of an ARE-containing mRNA only upon addition of recombinant Pabpc1, or fail to do so upon depletion of endogenous Pabpc1. Another experiment that would provide some additional support for the proposed mechanism (though not as conclusive as the in vitro translation assay) is if tethering of the Zfp36-mF deletion mutant would be sufficient to cause translational suppression. This mutant most likely does not interact with GYF2/4EHP or the Ccr4-Not complex, although it may still bind other proteins in addition to Pabpc1.</p><p>The role of Zfp36 as a translational silencer (in addition to its role as an inducer of mRNA degradation) has been reported previously, through the work of the Gaestel, Brooks and Lykke-Andersen labs. The authors fail to mention any of these studies, which is, at best, careless. The authors need to quote these publications adequately and discuss their findings in the light of these previous studies.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.27786.024</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>[…] The study shows potential for progressing the field of cytoplasmic regulation of gene expression.

Importantly, perturbation on Pabpc1 may have pleiotropic effects to the cell. In the manuscript, we addressed the question via an system through modulating the poly(A) tail of a reporter mRNA. Specifically, we first generated an mRNA <italic>without</italic> the poly(A) tail by replacing the SV40 polyadenylation signal (SV40pA) on the FLuc reporter with a sequence from the 3’ end of MALAT1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). Previous studies by Wilusz et al., 2012 showed that fusing the 3’ end sequence of MALAT1 can result in a poly(A) minus transcript stably present in the cytoplasm in mammalian cells. Indeed, when we fractionated the mRNAs via an oligod(T) column, we found that the Fluc mRNA with the 3’end MALAT1 sequence is predominantly in the poly(A) minus fraction, which is similar to the histone2ab mRNA, a known poly(A) minus transcript, but different from the Gapdh mRNA, a poly(A)+ transcript (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). This result indicated that the Fluc-5BoxB-MALAT1 transcript we generated is a truly poly(A) minus mRNA. Next, we performed the tethering assay on this poly(A) minus transcript. We found that when tethered, Zfp36 fails to inhibit the translation of this poly(A) minus transcript (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). This result is different from tethering Zfp36 to a poly(A) plus transcript (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A and B</xref>). Collectively, these observations indicate that Zfp36-mediated translational repression is dependent on the presence of the poly(A) tail.</p><p>We realize that although seems obvious, the poly(A) minus Fluc-5BoxB-MALAT1 transcript is devoid of Pabpc1 was still an assumption. To directly determine that Pabpc1 is not associated with the poly(A) minus Fluc-5BoxB-MALAT1 transcript we generated, we performed additional experiments. Specifically, we introduced a HA-Pabpc1 expressing plasmid with either the FLuc-5BoxB-SV40pA reporter or the Fluc-5BoxB-MALAT1 reporter into 293T cells. Then we performed IP on the HA-Pabpc1 from the transfected 293T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>) followed by qRT-PCR to determine whether the poly(A) minus Fluc-5BoxB-MALAT1 transcript is associated with Pabcp1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). We found that the Pabpc1 binds the poly(A)+ transcripts, such as the Gaphd1 mRNA and the FLuc-5BoxB-SV40pA transcript, but not the poly(A)- transcripts, such as the Histone2AB mRNA and the Fluc-5BoxB-MALAT1 transcript (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). This experiment indicated that the FLuc-5BoxB-MALAT1 transcript is indeed devoid of Pabpc1. Since Zfp36 repressed the translation of the FLuc-5BoxB-SV40pA transcript (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>) but not that of the FLuc-5BoxB-MALAT1 transcript (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>), we conclude that Zfp36-mediated translation is dependent on Pabpc1.</p><p>In the manuscript, we identified the Zfp36-mF mutant because we wanted to use a minimal Zfp36 fragment that can be stably expressed and interacts with Pabpc1. Thereby, when over-expressed, this Zfp36 fragment can attenuate the endogenous Zfp36:Pabpc1 interaction. The Zfp36-mF fragment suits well for this purpose. As the reviewers described, the Zfp36-mF lacks both the N- and C-termini that interact with previous characterized translational repressors (GYF2/4EHP and Ccr4-Not complex, respectively). Thus, when over-expressed, the Zfp36-mF attenuates the endogenous Zfp36:Pabpc1 interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A-C</xref>), but not the potential interactions of the endogenous Zfp36:GYF2/4EHP or Zfp36:Ccr4-Not complex. Therefore, the specific translational up-regulation of Zfp36 target mRNAs caused by Zfp36-mF over-expression is due to the disruption of the Zfp36:Pabpc1 interaction but not the potential Zfp36:GYF2/4EHP or Zfp36:Ccr4-Not complex interactions. These results support our conclusion that the Zfp36:Pabpc1 interaction is functionally important for Zfp36-mediated translational repression.</p><p>Pabpc1 promotes mRNA translation in multiple steps. Our data indicate that the translational repression mediated by Zfp36 is dependent on Pabpc1. We speculate that Zfp36 represses its target mRNA translation by compromising Pabpc1’s ability to maintain mRNA in a translation-competent state.</p><p><italic>The role of Zfp36 as a translational silencer (in addition to its role as an inducer of mRNA degradation) has been reported previously, through the work of the Gaestel, Brooks and Lykke-Andersen labs.
