Many <italic>Enterobacteriaceae</italic> express type 1 pili, a pre-adapted virulence trait, to invade host epithelial cells and establish persistent infections. However, the molecular mechanisms and strategies by which bacteria actively circumvent the immune response of the host remain poorly understood. Here, we identified CD14, the major co-receptor for lipopolysaccharide detection, on mouse dendritic cells (DCs) as a binding partner of FimH, the protein located at the tip of the type 1 pilus of <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>. The FimH amino acids involved in CD14 binding are highly conserved across pathogenic and non-pathogenic strains. Binding of the pathogenic strain CFT073 to CD14 reduced DC migration by overactivation of integrins and blunted expression of co-stimulatory molecules by overactivating the NFAT (nuclear factor of activated T-cells) pathway, both rate-limiting factors of T cell activation. This response was binary at the single-cell level, but averaged in larger populations exposed to both piliated and non-piliated pathogens, presumably via the exchange of immunomodulatory cytokines. While defining an active molecular mechanism of immune evasion by pathogens, the interaction between FimH and CD14 represents a potential target to interfere with persistent and recurrent infections, such as urinary tract infections or Crohn’s disease.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>microbe</kwd><kwd>pathogenesis</kwd><kwd>immunity</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>E. coli</italic></kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000781</institution-id><institution>European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CoG 724373</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sixt</surname><given-names>Michael</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002428</institution-id><institution>Austrian Science Fund</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>FWF P29911</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sixt</surname><given-names>Michael</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004955</institution-id><institution>Österreichische Forschungsförderungsgesellschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>FEMtech 868984</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Glatzova</surname><given-names>Ivana</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection, and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>By binding with their type 1 pili to the cell surface receptor CD14, pathogenic <italic>E. coli</italic> suppress the capacity of dendritic cells to activate T cells.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Cells of metazoan organisms constantly interact with a wide diversity of bacterial species that populate the host organism internally as well as externally. Therefore, the host immune response is faced with a non-trivial problem – accommodate beneficial commensals while at the same time remove harmful pathogens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hooper and Macpherson, 2005</xref>). The difficulty of this task lies in the fact that most of the molecular patterns, such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or surface organelles such as pili and flagella, are conserved between commensal and pathogenic bacteria. The main difference between commensal and pathogenic strains is the ability of the latter to hijack host cell functions for their own benefit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Magalhaes et al., 2007</xref>). Consequently, the host immune system uses complex discrimination strategies, such as spatial compartmentalization of the receptors recognizing pathogen signatures and concurrent sensing of molecular patterns associated with host damage. The discrimination ability of the host is not always perfect, as pathogens can persist asymptomatically in the host for long periods of time or cause symptomatic acute or chronic infections in some individuals, but not in others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Grant and Hung, 2013</xref>). For example, the commensal bacterium <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, one of the main residents of the mammalian intestine, occasionally causes clinical infections, especially when the bacteria acquire virulence traits and thus manage to populate extraintestinal host niches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Magalhaes et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Leimbach et al., 2013</xref>). Usually disease progression does not pose a dead end to such opportunistic pathogens, since bacteria are shed in high numbers during the infection, allowing the pathogen to populate new environments, a new host, or even recolonize their original host niche – the intestine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Donnenberg, 2013</xref>).</p><p>In principle, any commensal <italic>E. coli</italic> has the potential to evolve into a pathogen by acquiring virulence traits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Wirth et al., 2006</xref>). Those traits can be either adapted, namely evolved specifically to increase the fitness of a pathogen during the infection, or pre-adapted, meaning even though they increase the fitness of the pathogen, they were originally evolved for a non-virulent function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Donnenberg, 2013</xref>). Examples of adapted traits are the acquisition of pathogenicity islands through horizontal gene transfer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Oelschlaeger et al., 2002</xref>) or pathoadaptive mutations, such as changes in the LPS, flagellum or pili components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Weissman et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Donnenberg, 2013</xref>). A prime example of a pre-adapted trait are type 1 pili. Both commensal and pathogenic <italic>E. coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Shawki and McCole, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Croxen and Finlay, 1999</xref>), but also other <italic>Enterobacteriaceae</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Struve et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Kolenda et al., 2019</xref>), use type 1 pili to adhere to host cells in their respective ecological niches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Spaulding et al., 2017</xref>). Type 1 pili undergo a constant and reversible change in their expression due to phase variation which allows populations of isogenic bacteria to exhibit controlled genotypic and phenotypic variation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bayliss, 2009</xref>). In the case of type 1 pili, site-specific recombinases place the <italic>fimA</italic> promoter either in the phase-ON or phase-OFF orientation, resulting in piliated or non-piliated bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Schilling et al., 2001</xref>). Uropathogenic <italic>E. coli</italic> (UPECs) have mastered the use of phase variation as a remarkable genetic mechanism of plasticity for their advantage, since type 1 pili expression is tightly regulated by the host environment. For example, growing UPECs in vitro in human urine locks expression in the phase-OFF state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Greene et al., 2015</xref>), whereas adhesion to host cells has been shown to lock expression in the phase-ON state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Greene et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Lim et al., 1998</xref>). Phase variation greatly adds to the virulence and fitness of UPECs by generating heterogeneity among the bacterial population where individual cells switch back and forth between the type 1 piliated and non-piliated phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bayliss, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Wright et al., 2007</xref>). Type 1 pili are necessary for the persistent and therefore recurring infection of the bladder (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Hunstad and Justice, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Wright et al., 2007</xref>), but also for other persistent bacterial infections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Shawki and McCole, 2017</xref>).</p><p>Several mechanisms are known to contribute to persistent or recurring infections, one of which is the residing of pathogenic bacteria within a protected niche (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Grant and Hung, 2013</xref>). Such niches can be physical structures when the pathogen invades host cells to hide from the immune response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Grant and Hung, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Donnenberg, 2013</xref>). For example, UPECs invade host epithelium cells in the bladder using type 1 pili, propagate intracellularly and compromise the host defense barriers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Hunstad and Justice, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Martinez et al., 2000</xref>). Strikingly, also the host immune response may unintentionally create protected niches. For example, bladder residing macrophages sequester UPECs before antigen-presenting cells, such as dendritic cells (DCs), come into action (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Mora-Bau et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>DCs are the key cell type connecting the innate and adaptive immune response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Mellman and Steinman, 2001</xref>). Distinct subtypes of DCs, expressing different surface receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Merad et al., 2013</xref>), reside in every tissue of the host and DCs were also identified at the epithelial junction of the bladder (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Schilling et al., 2003</xref>). In response to an infection, these resident DCs together with newly recruited inflammatory DCs, sense and ingest pathogens. Subsequently, they start to secrete immune-modulatory cytokines and migrate from the site of infection to the draining lymph nodes where they present acquired and processed antigens to T cells, thus triggering the adaptive immune response. However, even if the host immune system manages to detect the pathogen, eradication of the infection is not guaranteed. Pathogens utilize several strategies to subvert innate and adaptive immunity, thereby avoiding clearance by the host and establishing persistent infections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Donnenberg, 2013</xref>). For example, UPECs were shown to interfere at the interface between innate and adaptive immunity: after contact with UPECs during urinary tract infections (UTIs), tissue resident mast cells secrete high amounts of interleukin-10 (IL-10), an immunosuppressive cytokine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chan et al., 2013</xref>), that drives the differentiation of regulatory T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Hsu et al., 2015</xref>). The combined effect of subverting the host immune response and establishing a protected niche inside the host greatly increases the ability of pathogens to cause persistent infections.</p><p>Here, we asked whether type 1 pili play a role in manipulating host immunity and thereby facilitate recurring bacterial infections by dissecting the underlying molecular mechanism between the interaction of UPEC and DCs.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Type 1 piliated UPECs inhibit T cell activation and proliferation by decreasing expression of co-stimulatory molecules on DCs</title><p>To study the influence of type 1 pili on the adaptive immune system, we genetically engineered bacteria with and without pili. The <italic>fim</italic> genes that produce the molecular components of the type 1 pilus are part of an operon on the <italic>E. coli</italic> chromosome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A, B</xref>) whose expression is regulated by phase variation. We generated stable phase-locked bacterial mutants by locking the fim switch (<italic>fimS</italic>) either in the phase-ON orientation, resulting in constitutive expression of the type 1 pilus, or in the phase-OFF orientation, blocking expression of the pilus (hereafter simply termed ON and OFF, respectively). To achieve this, we deleted the 9-bp long recognition site for the site-specific recombinases FimB and FimE in the internal repeat region upstream of the <italic>fimS</italic> element in either orientation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>).

First, DCs have to migrate from the site of antigen encounter and uptake (usually peripheral tissues) to the site of antigen presentation (e.g., lymph nodes), where they meet T cells. This migration step is fully dependent on directional guidance via chemokines, but largely independent of adhesive interactions with the extracellular matrix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Lämmermann et al., 2008</xref>). Second, T cells have to physically interact with DCs in order to probe their surface for antigen presentation and co-stimulation, meaning that contact dynamics between DCs and T cells are essential parameters determining T cell activation and proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bousso, 2008</xref>).</p><p>We first investigated DC–T cell contacts using live cell microscopy and found that UPEC ON bacteria, compared to OFF bacteria, increased the antigen specific contact times between DCs and naive CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells.

This was specific to antigen-bearing DCs, as in the absence of OVA contact times were short and indistinguishable between ON and OFF stimulation.

In line with their excessive surface immobilization, ON stimulated DCs were largely immobile on 2D surfaces and migratory speed was reduced compared to OFF stimulated DCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Next, we performed in vitro migration assays where DCs migrate in 3D cell-derived matrices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kaukonen et al., 2017</xref>) and found diminished migration after stimulation with ON bacteria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). The same effect on the migratory capacity we observed in ear crawl-out assays where endogenous skin DCs migrate within their physiological tissue in situ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Stösel et al., 1997</xref>). Here, the ventral halves of explanted mouse ears were repeatedly exposed to either UPEC ON or OFF bacteria during 48 hr.

To test if immobilization by hyperactive CD11b is causative for the loss of migration upon UPEC ON stimulation, we measured migration of DCs in 3D collagen gels. Here, DCs efficiently migrate in an integrin-independent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Lämmermann et al., 2008</xref>) and hyperactive CD11b, which does not bind to collagen 1, should no longer be able to immobilize ON stimulated cells. Indeed, we found that the migration speed of ON and OFF stimulated DCs in 3D collagen was indistinguishable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1F</xref>).</p><p>Finally, we asked if activation of β2 integrins maps upstream of the observed detrimental effect on co-stimulatory molecule expression after stimulation with UPEC ON bacteria. <italic>Itgb2</italic><sup>−/−</sup> DCs still expressed lowered levels of co-stimulatory molecules after ON stimulation when compared to OFF stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1G</xref>), suggesting that downregulation of co-stimulatory molecules does not depend on integrin activation.

This causes prolonged interaction times with T cells and impaired migratory capacity. Together, with the above finding of reduced co-stimulatory molecule expression, these data demonstrate that type 1 piliated UPEC target three functional hallmarks of DCs that are critical for the activation of naive T cells: (1) migration to the lymph node, (2) the physical interaction with T cells, and (3) the expression of co-stimulatory molecules.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>The GPI-anchored glycoprotein CD14 binds FimH, making it a novel target for type 1 pili</title><p>To find the interaction partner for type 1 pili on host cells, we first investigated the role of the major immune cell receptor TLR4 which was previously suggested as a receptor for the FimH protein of type 1 pili (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Mossman et al., 2008</xref>).

We confirmed that our ON <italic>ΔfimH</italic> mutants still express type 1 pili but lack the ability to agglutinate with yeast (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>). We performed an immunoprecipitation-type approach using magnetic Protein A beads, a CD14-Fc chimeric protein and the bacterial mutants. First, the CD14-Fc chimera was coupled to the magnetic Protein A beads (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2A</xref>). Next, we introduced a constitutively expressed <italic>yfp</italic> fluorescent marker into the chromosome of the UPEC ON and ON <italic>ΔfimH</italic> mutants for tracking. Using fluorescence microscopy, we found abundant ON bacteria bound per CD14-coupled bead, whereas binding of the <italic>fimH</italic> deletion mutants was scarce (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). Binding of ON bacteria was not due to unspecific binding of FimH to the bead matrix, as uncoupled beads also showed very scarce binding. Additionally, we analyzed the binding of bacteria to beads by flow cytometry by gating on the size parameters and fluorescence signal of the bacteria population (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2B</xref> for gating strategy and methods section for further technical details). ON bacteria showed increased binding to CD14-coupled beads when compared to the <italic>fimH</italic> deletion mutants or to ON bacteria binding to uncoupled beads (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). To further test if only FimH is necessary for binding to CD14, and not interactions with LPS on the bacterial membrane, we extracted type 1 pili (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Sheikh et al., 2017</xref>) from UPEC ON and ON <italic>ΔfimH</italic> mutants and performed a dot blot assay using biotinylated CD14 and streptavidin–HRP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). Biotinylated CD14 only bound to type 1 pili extracts from ON bacteria, whereas no binding was observed to type 1 pili extracts from ON mutants lacking the FimH protein.</p><p>We next tested if binding of FimH to CD14 is causative for the increase in adhesion of DCs and the decrease in co-stimulator molecules on their membrane after UPEC ON stimulation. Indeed, deleting <italic>fimH</italic> from UPEC ON bacteria fully rescued the adhesion and the expression of all co-stimulatory molecules when compared to stimulation with the UPEC ON bacteria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E, F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B, C</xref>).</p><p>Next, we asked whether expression of pathogenic FimH in an otherwise non-pathogenic bacterial background is sufficient to affect expression of co-stimulatory molecules on DCs. We constructed a locked-ON mutant of <italic>E. coli</italic> W, a non-pathogenic <italic>E. coli</italic> strain, and replaced the endogenous <italic>fimH</italic> gene with the pathogenic <italic>fimH</italic> variant of the UPEC strain CFT073. This non-pathogenic ON <italic>fimH<sub>CFT073</sub></italic> bacteria was able to agglutinate with yeast, confirming the correct insertion of the pathogenic <italic>fimH</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>). However, neither adhesion nor expression of co-stimulatory molecules of DCs was affected after stimulation with the non-pathogenic ON <italic>fimH<sub>CFT073</sub></italic> mutants as compared to the non-pathogenic <italic>E. coli</italic> W ON bacteria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B, C</xref>). Given these results we asked if the observed immune-modulatory properties are specific to the pathogenic strain CFT073 only, or if other UPEC strains similarly affect DC activation. Thus, we constructed ON and OFF mutants of two additional clinical isolates, UTI89 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chen et al., 2006</xref>) and 536 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hochhut et al., 2005</xref>), and analyzed adhesion and expression of co-stimulatory molecules of DCs. Interestingly, only the ON bacteria of UTI89 strongly increased adhesion of DCs, whereas ON bacteria of 536 had only a moderate effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1D</xref>). Additionally, none of the two isolates affected all of the co-stimulatory molecules, but both decreased expression of CD86 only (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1E, F</xref>). Thus, we hypothesize that compared to these two strains, the clinical isolate CFT073 expresses additional virulence factors, which act downstream of the FimH–CD14 interaction to modulate the functional hallmarks of the immune response of DCs.</p><p>Finally, we were interested in the molecular mechanism(s) triggered upon FimH binding to CD14. Since NFAT (nuclear factor of activated T cells) signaling was shown to map downstream of CD14-mediated Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Zanoni et al., 2009</xref>), we used the inhibitor FK506 to block calcineurin prior to stimulation with bacteria. Blocking the NFAT pathway partially rescued expression of co-stimulatory molecules after ON stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1D</xref>), establishing NFAT as one downstream target of FimH. Thus, we tested if overactivation of the NFAT pathway after UPEC ON stimulation affects production of cytokines known to be NFAT dependent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Fric et al., 2012</xref>). Indeed, we found several NFAT-target cytokines to be increased after ON compared to OFF stimulation, with IL-3, IL-4, IL-10, and GM-CSF being most severely affected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H</xref>), whereas blocking of the NFAT pathway or deletion of CD14 resulted in equal expression of NFAT-target cytokines between ON and OFF stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H</xref>). However, it should be noted, that blocking of calcineurin with FK506 resulted in a general upregulation of cytokines, most likely because several NFAT-target cytokines are also regulated by other means such as NF-κB, AP-1, or STAT signaling pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hermann-Kleiter and Baier, 2005</xref>).</p><p>Based on these experimental observations, we propose the following model of interaction between FimH on UPECs and CD14 on DCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4I</xref>): CD14 directly binds FimH on the tip of type 1 pili, leading to overactivation of the NFAT pathway and increased expression of immunomodulatory cytokines, such as GM-CSF, IL-3, IL-4, and IL-10. LPS-induced activation of CD14 is not affected by FimH binding, leaving CD14 endocytosis and expression of proinflammatory cytokines, such as TNF-α, IL-6, and CCL5, unaltered.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>FimH amino acids predicted to bind are highly conserved and are partially located in the mannose-binding domain</title><p>The two-domain FimH protein consists of a receptor-binding domain and a pili-binding domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Choudhury et al., 1999</xref>).

To this end, we first aimed to resolve the initial events of DC migration, interstitial migration and entry into the lymphatics by devising crawl-in assays where exogenously stimulated DCs are allowed to invade the lymph vessels of the ventral halves of untreated, explanted mouse ears. In line with our previous results, we found fewer ON compared to OFF stimulated DCs inside the lymph vessels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). Next, we aimed to resolve the later stage events of DC migration by in vivo migration assays, in which fluorescently labeled ON and OFF stimulated DCs were injected separately into hind footpads of mice and the total number of cells that arrived in the popliteal lymph node after 72 hr were assessed. Interestingly, we observed only slight reduction in the number of ON stimulated DCs in the lymph nodes compared to OFF stimulated ones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). Notably, antibody-mediated blockage of CD14 fully restored migration of ON stimulated DCs in vivo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>). The alleviated effect at later time points, when DCs were exposed to inflamed tissue, indicated that non-cell autonomous factors can modulate the effect of piliated bacteria. We therefore mixed ON vs. OFF stimulated DCs, stained with different colors, and then either performed crawl-in assays or footpad injections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E, F</xref>). Strikingly, we could no longer observe any differences in the migration of ON and OFF stimulated DCs. This result points toward a strong, non-cell autonomous effect where differentially stimulated DCs mutually affect their migratory capabilities and thus average the binary response observed at the single-cell level, most likely due to exchange of immunomodulatory cytokines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H</xref>). Interestingly, similar non-cell autonomous behavior of DCs integrating information at the population rather than the single-cell level was recently reported in the context of antiviral responses. Here, a quorum of sensed stimuli governed the activation of DCs via secreted cytokines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bardou et al., 2021</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Here, we uncovered that type 1 piliated UPECs target the glycoprotein CD14 on the surface of DCs and thereby shut down the migratory capacity of DCs and their ability to interact with and activate T cells.</p><p>It has been proposed that the unusually tight regulation of UPECs type 1 pili expression has evolved to limit exposure to the host immune system, allowing the pathogen to establish a persistent infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Donnenberg, 2013</xref>). In this study, we uncovered and characterized a different fundamental role of type 1 pili, as modulators of the innate and adaptive immune response. We found that type 1 piliated UPECs decreased the migratory capacity of DCs by increasing their adhesion to other cells, such as T cells, and the extracellular matrix by overactivation of integrins. The effective and timely transition from an adhesion to a migration phenotype is essential for DCs to migrate from the site of the actual infection to the lymph node in order to interact with lymphocytes. To achieve these migratory and signaling tasks, DCs need to dynamically regulate integrin-mediated adhesion, and we found that overactivation of integrins triggered by type 1 piliated UPECs leads to effective immobilization to the extracellular matrix and decreased turnover of cell–cell interactions. Overactivation of integrins, by hijacking integrin-linked kinases leading to decreased turnover of focal adhesions, was already shown to subvert innate immunity during <italic>Shigella</italic> and enterohemorrhagic <italic>E. coli</italic> (EHEC) infections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Kim et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Shames et al., 2010</xref>), however UPECs do not express the same genes. Moreover, we found that type 1 piliated UPECs also decreased the expression of co-stimulatory molecules, which are essential for T cell activation and proliferation.</p><p>We identified CD14, a GPI-anchored glycoprotein, as the direct target for the FimH protein of type 1 pili. In analogy, a previous study showed that the <italic>fimA</italic>-encoded major type V fimbriae of the oral pathogen <italic>Porphyromonas gingivalis</italic> also bind CD14 and thereby increase integrin-mediated adhesion by activating CD11b integrin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Harokopakis and Hajishengallis, 2005</xref>). Using in silico protein–protein docking analysis, we found strong predicted binding between CD14 and FimH through specific amino acids in both proteins. Interestingly, the respective FimH amino acids are highly conserved not only among pathogenic, but also non-pathogenic <italic>E. coli</italic> strains. However, although we found FimH to be necessary, we did not find the simple presence of pathogenic <italic>fimH</italic> gene in an otherwise non-pathogenic genetic background to be sufficient for suppression of the immune response. Additionally, the quantitative effects on suppression of the immune response varied strongly between several different clinical isolates. Generally, the pathogenic potential of UPECs does not seem to be the result of a single defined virulence gene, but rather a combination of effects by several factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Touchon et al., 2009</xref>). For example, the outer membrane of different clinical isolates displays a wide diversity in protein composition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Wurpel et al., 2015</xref>) and the production of outer membrane vesicles delivering associated proteins was linked to pathogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Schwechheimer and Kuehn, 2015</xref>).Therefore, it remains unknown which other pathogenic gene(s) work together with <italic>fimH</italic>, as the UPEC strain CFT073 carries accessory genes encoded by 13 pathogenicity islands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Lloyd et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>Given how pathogenic bacteria can circumvent the host immune response by generating protected niches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Grant and Hung, 2013</xref>) and due to the constantly growing presence of multidrug-resistant strains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Boucher et al., 2009</xref>), treatment of persistent or recurring infections is increasingly challenging. Although vaccination approaches against FimH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Eldridge et al., 2021</xref>) or non-conventional treatments, such as small mannosides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Schönemann et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Mydock-McGrane et al., 2016</xref>), showed promising results, treatments of infections caused by type 1 piliated pathogens remains difficult. Our findings underscore the importance of the mannose-binding domain, and several conserved amino acid residues in this domain, in the interaction between FimH and CD14. For example, R98, showing the strongest binding to CD14 in our predictions, was identified to be important to stabilize the protein–ligand interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Han et al., 2010</xref>). However, targeting this residue only was not sufficient to boost affinity of FimH antagonists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Tomašič et al., 2021</xref>). Given our results, we hypothesize that this could be because not individual amino acids, but the overall secondary structure of the mannose-binding domain of FimH is important for the interaction with host receptors. Blocking CD14 antibodies, such as the human anti-CD14 antibody IC14 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Axtelle and Pribble, 2001</xref>), could represent an alternative way to treat recurring infections caused by type 1 piliiated pathogens, such as UTIs or inflammatory bowel diseases like Crohn’s disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Sivignon et al., 2017</xref>), given that CD14 is expressed by hematopoietic but also non-hematopoietic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Zanoni and Granucci, 2013</xref>).</p><p>Although opportunistic pathogens continuously circulate in humans as asymptomatic colonizers, they occasionally cause symptomatic acute or even chronic infections in some individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Donnenberg, 2013</xref>). Opportunistic pathogens use type 1 pili to adhere to and invade into host epithelial cells. While the cellular invasion represents a <italic>de facto</italic> passive mechanism for the pathogens to hide from the immune system and to establish persistent or recurring infections, we found that UPECs use type 1 pili to actively manipulate the behavior of innate immune cells, and thus also the adaptive immune response, by direct interaction of FimH and CD14 receptor on DCs. Binding of FimH to CD14 overactivated the NFAT pathway leading to expression of immunomodulatory cytokines. For example, we found increased levels of IL-10 which acts as an immunosuppressant decreasing the expression of co-stimulatory molecules on DCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Mittal and Roche, 2015</xref>), drives differentiation of regulatory T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Hsu et al., 2015</xref>) and is a hallmark cytokine produced by tolerogenic DCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Domogalla et al., 2017</xref>). Although the immunosuppressive effects that type 1 piliated UPECs exert on DCs after the FimH–CD14 interaction are averaged in larger populations by non-cell autonomous effects during mixed infections, our results underscore the importance of the binary response during pathogen–host interaction at the single-cell level given that early immune response to UPECs can decide on the recurrent fate of the infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hannan et al., 2010</xref>). Moreover, since CD14 is a multifunctional co-receptor of several immune cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Zanoni and Granucci, 2013</xref>) and type 1 pili are expressed not only by pathogenic but also by non-pathogenic <italic>E. coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Shawki and McCole, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Croxen and Finlay, 1999</xref>), our findings add a new layer of complexity to the physiological relevance of type 1 pili – as modulators of the immune response in general and specifically during persistent and recurring infections.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Experimental model and subject details</title><sec id="s4-1-1"><title>Animals</title><p>Mice were bred and maintained at the local animal facility in accordance with the IST Austria ethics commission.

In brief, round shaped coverslips were coated with 0.2% gelatin in PBS in 24-well dishes for 1 hr at 37°C. Gelatin was crosslinked with 1% glutaraldehyde in PBS for 30 min at RT and quenched with 1 M glycine in PBS for 20 min at RT. After washing the coverslips twice with PBS, 5 × 10<sup>4</sup> 3T3 mouse fibroblasts in DMEM (Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium), GlutaMAX, supplemented with 10% FCS, 100 U/ml penicillin and 100 µg/ml streptomycin were seeded per well. After 48 hr 3T3 fibroblasts reached confluency and were treated daily with ascorbic acid for better crosslinking of the extracellular matrix. Old medium was gently removed and fresh medium with 50 µg/ml sterile ascorbic acid was added for 10–14 days. 3T3 fibroblasts were extracted with extraction buffer (0.5% Triton-X, 20 mM NH<sub>4</sub>OH in PBS) for 2 min and washed twice with PBS containing 1 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub> and 1 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub> (PBS/Ca/Mg). DNA was digested with 100 µg/ml DNaseI in PBS/Ca/Mg for 1 hr at 37°C and CDMs were washed twice with PBS/Ca/Mg before storage in PBS/Ca/Mg supplemented with 100 U/ml penicillin and 100 µg/ml streptomycin at 4°C.</p><p>Before use, CDMs were placed onto custom-made imaging chambers and incubated with R10 medium for 1 hr at 37°C. The medium was removed and a 1 µl CCL21 chemokine (RND Systems; 25 µg/ml) spot was injected into the CDM and incubated for 10 min. 1 ml R10 medium was added on top and the CDM was incubated for 1 hr at 37°C to allow a chemokine gradient to form. After washing twice gently with R10 medium, CFT073 locked-ON (KT179) and locked-OFF (KT180) stimulated DCs were concentrated by centrifugation and the dense cell pellet was pipetted into the CDM at the opposite site to the chemokine spot. 2 ml of R10 medium was added and images were taken every minute for a total of 6 hr on a bright field microscope using ×10 magnification and an exposure of 20ms.

What follows is the decision letter after the first round of review.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting the paper &quot;Type 1 piliated uropathogenic <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> hijack the host immune response by binding to CD14&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>Comments to the Authors:</p><p>We are sorry to say that, after consultation with the reviewers, we have decided that this work in its present form will not be considered further for publication by <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>Specifically, all Reviewers feel the topic is of great interest but that more mechanistic insights are necessary and that relevance of the findings reported should be also assessed in vivo, at least in the context of DC migration. We anticipate that addressing these comments would take more than the 2-month time we allow for revisions, we are therefore rejecting the manuscript at this point. However, should the authors be able to address the points mentioned above, we would be delighted to receive a revised manuscript.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>Initially the authors described the capacity of pilus-expressing <italic>E. coli</italic> to reduce T cell proliferation, co-stimulatory molecule induction on DCs, and to increase DC-T cell interaction time (via CD11b-activation) in vitro. Also, that the migratory capacity into lymphatics of DCs exposed to pilus+ <italic>E. coli</italic> was significantly decreased.</p><p>The authors showed that reduced co-stimulatory molecule induction and potentiated integrin activation are events independently regulated, but how this regulation takes place remains completely overlooked. Also, if production of inflammatory mediators -such as pro-inflammatory cytokines or interferons- is also affected remains unknown.</p><p>Next, the authors focused on the mechanism that allows the pilus to change the functions of DCs. Because of previous literature, authors tested the involvement of TLR4 and found that in Tlr4-deficient cells the presence of pili still affects adhesion and migration into the lymphatics. The authors concluded that TLR4 is not involved in these processes. An important information that lacks here is, though, the relevance of TLR4 in regulating co-stimulatory molecules and inflammatory cytokines, as well as T cell proliferation.</p><p>Next the authors focused on CD14 for its links with integrin activity and cell adhesion. The authors convincingly show that CD14 engagement decreases the migratory capacity of DCs and dampen co-stimulatory molecules induction by pilus+ <italic>E. coli</italic> (although also here any info about T cells is missing). Most importantly, the authors demonstrated that the presence of FimH expressed by pathogenic <italic>E. coli</italic> is necessary for these functions. Notably, expression of pathogenic FimH on pili of non-pathogenic coli did not reproduced the phenotype. These data raise important questions about the minimal requirements necessary for FimH to exert its functions.</p><p>Finally, the authors identified 3 aminoacidic residues of FimH necessary to bind CD14 and either mutated them or inhibited their binding capacity with D-mannose, a D-mannose derivative, as well as an antibody directed against CD14. These experiments showed that at least co-stimulatory molecule expression was partially rescued by these treatments. Based on these data, the authors propose possible future therapeutic interventions aimed at targeting FimH and CD14 interaction.</p><p>Overall, this is a well-designed, but still quite preliminary, work that lacks many mechanistic insights and a proof that the interaction between CD14 and FimH really plays a relevant role in vivo during an infection.</p><p>In my opinion, there are two major points that need to be addressed to make this paper a strong candidate for <italic>eLife</italic>: (i) more mechanistic insights on how CD14 engagement by FimH modulate DC activation; (ii) in vivo relevance of the pathways identified.</p><p>Regarding the mechanistic insights:</p><p>How the global transcriptome of DCs exposed to pilus-positive or negative bacteria is affected? Are interferons or other pro-inflammatory cytokines differentially regulated? The authors solely showed that TLR4-deficency does not affect adhesion and migration into lymphatics, but not that DCs respond in the same manner to pilus+ or pilus-negative bacteria.</p><p>How the engagement of CD14 by FimH modulates the activation of integrins or the inhibition of co-stimulatory molecules? Is FimH preventing binding of LPS by CD14 and, thus, changing the signaling capacity of TLR4?</p><p>CD14 is internalized upon LPS binding to drive IFN-I production. Does this happen with FimH<sup>+</sup> bacteria? CD14 has also been shown to exert TLR4-independent funcitons such as calcium influxes and NFAT activation. Is any of those potentiated or prevented by the encounter of FimH<sup>+</sup> bacteria?</p><p>How does this influence either co-stimulatory molecule expression? And what about IFN-I production? The authors have all the tools and capacity to answer these questions.</p><p>Regarding the in vivo experiments:</p><p>Relevance of the pathways and mechanisms described in the paper needs to be proved in a mouse model of UPEC infection.</p><p>Other points:</p><p>Please add the analysis on T cell proliferation as well as the other analyses missing as reported in the Review.</p><p>Authors should further dissect the phenotype of T cells immobilized on DCs in vitro. They claim this reduces activation, but this experiment may also suggest the opposite. Activation of OT-II cells using CD11b-deficient DCs should be performed.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>In this study, Tomasek et al. tested the hypothesis that type 1 pili, a pre-adapted virulence factor used by uropathogenic <italic>E. coli</italic> (UPEC) to interact with host infected cells, alter dendritic cell (DC) activation. They found that type 1 pili interfere with CD14 activities, leading to defective DC migration, costimulatory molecule expression and antigen presentation. The main strength of the study is the dissection of the structural interplay between FimH and CD14, as it convincingly shows that the two molecules interact. On the other hand, analysis of the functional impact of type 1 pili on DC activation as well as on CD14 activities could be improved. Overall, this study provides a conceptual advance in our understanding of host-pathogen interactions and highlight CD14 as a possible target for the treatment of persistent bacterial infections.</p><p>Most of the work is based on the analysis of DC responses to bacteria with (ON) or without (OFF) type 1 pili. Incubation of DCs with UPEC ON led to reduced antigen (OVA) presentation and T cell proliferation; lower induction of costimulatory molecules by DCs; higher integrin (Cd11b) activation; tighter adhesion of DCs to serum-coated surfaces; reduced DC migration ex vivo and in explanted tissues. CD14ko, but not TLR4ko, DCs show a normalized migration behavior and costimulatory molecule expression in response to UPEC ON.</p><p>The authors conclude that type 1 pili limit Ag presentation capacities of DCs by interfering with costimulatory molecule expression and by causing integrin hyperactivation, leading to immobilization on ECM and defective migration. They also propose that this occurs in a CD14-dependent manner.</p><p>- The experiments in support of a causative role of Cd11b hyperactivation in defective DC migration are not entrely convincing, as they only show that UPEC ON stimulation does not immobilize DCs on type 1 collagen (which is not bound by Cd11b). To sustain their point, the authors may test whether Cd11b hyperactivation by means other than UPEC ON exposure also results in DC immobilization, or test whether blockade of CD11b hyperactivation (or of Cd11b) restore migration patterns of DCs stimulated with UPEC ON.</p><p>- Whether UPEC ON-dependent DC immobilization has any consequence in vivo for antigen presentation also remains unclear. The authors could test whether UPEC ON or OFF are differentially capable of eliciting DC recruitment and interaction with T cells to lymph nodes.</p><p>- The authors find that CD14ko are not sensitive to UPEC ON-mediated alterations of migration, and they conclude that CD14 is required for increased integrin activity. This conclusion is not fully supported, in my view. It would be important to link CD14 and Cd11b hyperactivation using an independent, and possibly more direct, readout of integrin hyperactivation. More generally, a detailed characterization of how CD14ko DC respond to UPEC ON or UPEC OFF would be helpful to support the proposed link between the type 1 pili and CD14.</p><p>- It remains unclear whether interference with CD14 activity by UPEC ON has any impact in vivo. The study would be much improved if the authors could compare host survival and bacterial persistence upon infection of wt (and possibly CD14ko) mice with UPEC On and UPEC OFF.</p><p>The authors identify a potential binding site between FimH and CD14 and then convincingly show that these molecules physically interact. FimH therefore appears to be a critical determinant of the pathogenic effect of type 1 pili in DCs.</p><p>- The interaction site between FimH and CD14 is said to occur &quot;in an area not involved in LPS binding&quot;. It would be important if the authors supported this claim experimentally, by measuring whether FimH alters inflammatory gene expression and/or cytokine expression and in LPS-stimulated DCs. More generally, the study would greatly benefit it the authors could</p><p>- CD14 acts in DCs in a ligand dose-dependent manner. Can the authors show DC responses to different concentration of UPEC ON/OFF?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>The authors explore the ability of the pili, a virulence factor typical of <italic>Enterobacteriaceae</italic> and of particular relevance in the study of uropathogenic <italic>E. coli</italic> (UPEC), to regulate the host immune response. Pili are particularly interesting as their expression can be turned on and off cyclically by bacteria due to phase variation, which can allow modulation of the virulence of isogenic bacteria. While it is known that pili modulate bacterial adhesion to host cells, little is known of the direct immunomodulatory properties of pili. Here the authors use a clever mutant <italic>E. coli</italic> model which is locked either in the ON (pilus expressor) or OFF( pilus non expressor) condition to study the ability of the pilus to influence dendritic cell (DCs) responses. The authors convincingly demonstrate that: (a) Pilus expressing (ON)-<italic>E. coli</italic> can inhibit the capacity of DCs to stimulate transgenic T cells in vitro, (b) ON-<italic>E. coli</italic> can down-modulate the ability of DCs to upregulate the costimulatory molecule CD40 and to a lesser extent CD80 and CD86, (c) ON-<italic>E. coli</italic> reduces DCs motility by enhancing the activation of beta2 integrins, which results in DCs being retained in the tissues and migrating less efficiently into the lymph, (d) CD14 is the receptor for pili proteins and is interaction between pili and CD14 is responsible for modulating some DCs responses.</p><p>While the experiments are convincing and well controlled, the authors fail to evaluate key innate functions of dendritic cells, such as cytokine production, where CD14 plays an important regulatory role, either indirectly by regulating TLR internalization and activation of the endosomal pathway, or directly by activating calcium signaling and NFAT activation. It is also unclear whether CD14 binding is blocking its ability to respond to other ligands (i.e. LPS). This tampers the impact of the conclusions. Moreover the absence of any in vivo infection experiment, tampers the enthusiasm for the paper. It's difficult to interpret the claim that pili influence DCs ability to activate T cells with only limited in vitro experiments. DCs ability to influence adaptive immunity is dependent on several things, including antigen transport, cytokine production, cell-cell interaction, migration etc…that cannot be fully recapitulated in vitro. Also, DCs exert important innate immune functions locally in the tissues, that are not only the activation of T cells and do not require their migration into the lymph, an aspect that is not taken in consideration by the authors.In conclusion, while the experiments are sound and controlled, and the idea is of great general interest in the context of host pathogen interactions, the analyses are insufficient to understand the immunomodulatory properties of pili with a level of depth that can be meaningful in an infection context.</p><p>As mentioned above, while the paper does a good job at identifying pili as structures able to influence DC responses through CD14, they fail to evaluate a number of important functions of dendritic cells that are directly regulated by the receptor CD14, such as cytokine production downstream of TLR4 and/or directly downstream to CD14. Moreover, they do not go into sufficient depth neither regarding the molecular mechanism downstream to CD14 that could explain the observed phenotypes (are pili stimulating responses downstream of CD14? Are they inhibiting LPS binding? Are they inhibiting interactions between CD14 and TLR4 or TLR2?) , nor the ability of pili to influence the overall outcome and/or the activation of DCs during an infection in vivo.</p><p>The authors also discuss their results stressing that pili inhibit the capacity of DCs to activate T cells, however, only one initial experiment evaluating T cell activation is performed, in an in vitro setting with transgenic TCR bearing T cells. While the authors demonstrate that the time of contact between T cells and DCs is augmented in the presence of pilus expressing bacteria, they do not explore the consequences of this enhanced contact and the relative impact of integrin activation vs costimulatory molecules expression in influencing T cell responses. While the topic is of great potential interest and the authors have devised an interesting tool to specifically study the importance of pili, they need to add depth to their work in order to take complete advantage of the tool they created and to help to answer the question they have posed.</p><p>Even taking into account the difficulty and the regulatory burden of animal experimentation, the authors could do a better job in dissecting the molecular mechanisms underlying the ability of pili to inhibit DCs and the dynamics of DCs-T cell interaction.</p><p>[Editors’ note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Type 1 piliated uropathogenic <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> hijack the host immune response by binding to CD14&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been evaluated by Carla Rothlin (Senior Editor) and a Reviewing Editor.</p><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed, as outlined below:</p><p>i) Incorporate the changes to the text requested by Reviewer 1.</p><p>ii) Concerning the requests of Reviewer 2, the authors should present a side-by-side comparison of cytokines produced by WT DCs, CD14 ko DCs and FK506-treated WT DCs to formally prove a reduction in NFAT-dependent cytokines by CD14 KO DCs and FK506-treated DCs in response to &quot;ON&quot; bacteria.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>The authors incorporated many requests previously made. In particular, they added new exciting results re NFAT relevance in their model and about cell-intrinsic and cell-extrinsic requirements. in vivo data, though only based on in vitro stimulated DCs, nicely complement the findings of the authors. The authors also analyzed additional isolates that suggest bacterium-specific behaviors.</p><p>Although the authors did not perform in vivo infections, and some of their (new) findings open more mechanistic questions, the elegant ON/OFF model utilized, the identification of CD14 as a key regulator of responses to FimH, together with the new data provided make this new version of the manuscript exciting.</p><p>I have only a few changes to request:</p><p>1) Please properly cite in line 248, 249 the citation reported in line 1629.</p><p>2) Re Figure 3G: Please, stress that RANTES is an ISG and, thus, the capacity of CD14 to drive interferon-dependent responses upon LPS encounter is not altered by the presence of FimH. Ideally, authors should have measured type I interferons to prove that CD14-intrinsic responses to LPS are not altered, but this point can be just mentioned, also based on data on CD14 internalization.</p><p>3) Always re Figure 3G: I would strongly encourage the authors to remove IFNγ from the cytokines measured. Murine DCs do not efficiently produce IFNγ in response to LPS/gram-negative bacteria. And indeed the authors measured extremely low levels, if any, of this cytokine.</p><p>4) Please add to the discussion or at the end of the paragraph a brief line about the results shown in Figure 3I about the maintenance of increased integrin activity in CD14-/- cells exposed to ON bacteria.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>The authors have performed a number of new experiments to address my initial concerns. The new manuscript shows that Pili act through the CD14-NFAT axis to induce the production of immunomodulatory cytokines that, in turn decrease upregulation of costimulatory molecules. The authors also added in vivo data modeling DCs migration by injecting OVA loaded-, <italic>E. coli</italic>-activated-, DCs in the footpad and analyzing migration and proliferation that demonstrate that the combination of defects in migration as well as costimulatory molecule affects T cell proliferation, albeit with a small size effect, and that the effect is not cell autonomous (consistently with the involvement of NFAT mediated cytokine production in the phenotype).</p><p>The new data support idea that CD14 control of cytokine production through NFAT can induce the downregulation of costimulatory molecules, however I believe that some important controls should be included:</p><p>The authors do not show any comparison between CD14 Ko DCs and WT DCs in term of cytokine production, and do not show whether CD14 KO and FK506 have the same effect on cytokine production and downregulation of costimulatory molecules.</p><p>While it might be beyond the authors scope, it would be interesting to identify which NFAT dependent cytokine is mediating the phenotype observed.</p><p>Moreover the small size of the in vivo effect, as well as the fact that it is not cell autonomous somewhat lower the enthusiasm for the conclusions, in particular, due to the fact that pili expression can be turned on and off in vivo, thus mimicking the effect of a mixed stimulation. Importantly assessment of mixed transfer on T cell proliferation is missing!</p><p>Some other concerns include:</p><p>a) WT, CD14 and TLR4 KO cells are never depicted in the same graph and therefore I deduce that the experiments on each cell genotype are independent experiments. These comparisons should be done in the same experiment to be able to compare KO with WT. Indeed the author state in line: 232-234 &quot; It was previously shown that tlr4-/- DCs express reduced levels of co-stimulatory molecules (Shen et al., 2008) and this was also true for our in vitro generated tlr4-/- DCs&quot;. However, TLR4 -/- DCs are never compared to WT DCs in the manuscript.</p><p>b) While internalization of CD14 Is assessed, production of type I interferons is never assessed and should be considered as CD14 trafficking of TLR4 can influence IFN production.</p><p>c) While CD80 and CD86 expression are clearly depending on CD14, CD40 expression seems to be TLR4 dependent. The author should discuss this point.</p><p>d) In line 244 LPS driven cytokines is incorrect. TLR4 driven or NfKB dependent cytokines would be more rigorous.</p><p>Overall, while the manuscript has significantly improved, some pieces of the puzzle are still missing and the modest in vivo effect, in an artificial model of DCs migration and function, leaves open the question of the relevance of this mechanism during infection.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The authors have performed a large set of experiments that satisfactorily address most of my previous criticisms – especially for what concerns the functional impact of type 1 pili on CD14-mediated DC activation. In my view, the revised manuscript is a strong candidate for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.78995.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>[Editors’ note: the authors resubmitted a revised version of the paper for consideration.

We performed additional experiments to gain deeper insight into the signaling pathway downstream of the FimH-CD14 interaction. We analyzed cytokine levels in the supernatant of UPEC ON and OFF stimulated DCs (line 244-247 and line 321-325, Figure 3G und 4H). We found that ON stimulation led to increased expression of several immune-modulatory cytokines, mainly linked to NFAT pathway activation (eg IL-4, IL-10, GM-CSF), whereas cytokines related to activation of DCs via LPS (eg IL-6 and TNFalpha) were equally expressed upon ON and OFF stimulation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Next, the authors focused on the mechanism that allows the pilus to change the functions of DCs. Because of previous literature, authors tested the involvement of TLR4 and found that in Tlr4-deficient cells the presence of pili still affects adhesion and migration into the lymphatics.

In line with the increase in adhesion and the decrease in migration, tlr4 null DCs displayed decreased expression of co-stimulatory molecules after UPEC ON stimulation, as compared to UPEC OFF stimulation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Next the authors focused on CD14 for its links with integrin activity and cell adhesion. The authors convincingly show that CD14 engagement decreases the migratory capacity of DCs and dampen co-stimulatory molecules induction by pilus+ <italic>E. coli</italic> (although also here any info about T cells is missing). Most importantly, the authors demonstrated that the presence of FimH expressed by pathogenic <italic>E. coli</italic> is necessary for these functions. Notably, expression of pathogenic FimH on pili of non-pathogenic coli did not reproduced the phenotype. These data raise important questions about the minimal requirements necessary for FimH to exert its functions.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that although FimH is necessary for the observed immune-modulatory phenotypes, we did not find (pathogenic) FimH to be sufficient. To address this point, we performed adhesion assays (as an indirect measure also for the migration potential) and expression of costimulatory molecules using ON and OFF mutants of two additional clinical isolates (strains UTI89 and 536) to get an understanding if this is a UPEC-wide phenomenon (line 310-315, Supplementary Figure 6E-F). Interestingly, the strength of the immune-modulatory effects varied in the different strains – some affect adhesion, whereas others do not. Only CFT073 affected expression of all co-stimulatory molecules. We conclude that CFT073 expresses virulence factors that act downstream of the FimHdependent CD14 signaling and thereby modulate the observed phenotypes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Finally, the authors identified 3 aminoacidic residues of FimH necessary to bind CD14 and either mutated them or inhibited their binding capacity with D-mannose, a D-mannose derivative, as well as an antibody directed against CD14. These experiments showed that at least co-stimulatory molecule expression was partially rescued by these treatments. Based on these data, the authors propose possible future therapeutic interventions aimed at targeting FimH and CD14 interaction.</p><p>Overall, this is a well-designed, but still quite preliminary, work that lacks many mechanistic insights and a proof that the interaction between CD14 and FimH really plays a relevant role in vivo during an infection.</p></disp-quote><p>We performed a series of experiments (both ex vivo and in vivo) to address the mechanistic aspects of the FimH/CD14 interaction. We added a new figure to support these findings (Figure 7).</p><p>First, we identified the NFAT pathway to be overactivated downstream of FimH binding to CD14 (line 316-321, Figure 4G and Supplementary Figure 4D) and that this leads to increased expression of NFATdriven cytokines (line 321-325, Figure 4H).</p><p>Second, to verify that the interaction between CD14 and FimH plays a relevant role in vivo during an infection, we performed in vivo migration assays using UPEC ON and OFF stimulated DCs, and additionally blocked CD14 during stimulation of DCs using the blocking CD14 antibody M14-23 (line 396-402, Figure 7C-D). Additionally, we analyzed in vivo T cell proliferation after UPEC ON and OFF stimulation (line 381-388, Figure 7A). We found migration of DCs from the footpad into the popliteal lymph node to be reduced after ON stimulation, compared to OFF stimulation, although due to the spread of the data in vivo this effect was not significant (Figure 7C), whereas treating DCs with the blocking CD14 antibody restored in vivo migration of ON stimulated DCs fully (Figure 7D). Interestingly, as soon as we mixed ON and OFF stimulated DCs before injection (Figure 7F) or performed ex vivo ear crawl in migration assays with mixed cells (Figure 7A), we found that the same amount of DCs reached the lymph node, irrespective of the stimulus. We assume that these effects are due to non-cell autonomous effects the DCs face once they are in close contact with differentially stimulated DCs (Bardou et al., EMBOJ, 2021). Interestingly, although the overall amount of in vivo divided T cells was the same between ON and OFF stimulation, a greater fraction of T cells reached further rounds of division after OFF stimulation, compared to after ON stimulation – reflected in the proliferation index (Figure 7A). We hypothesize that ON stimulation therefore also affects in vivo T cell priming, but given that inside the host antigen transfer to resident DCs happens (Kleindienst and Brocker, The Journal of Immunity, 2003), we think that the effect is not as pronounced as in vitro. We therefore think that the immune-modulatory effect we found is of special interest when looking at cell-cell interactions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In my opinion, there are two major points that need to be addressed to make this paper a strong candidate for eLife: (i) more mechanistic insights on how CD14 engagement by FimH modulate DC activation; (ii) in vivo relevance of the pathways identified.</p></disp-quote><p>We now performed additional experiments to answer those questions (see outlined below).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Regarding the mechanistic insights:</p><p>How the global transcriptome of DCs exposed to pilus-positive or negative bacteria is affected?

The authors have all the tools and capacity to answer these questions.</p></disp-quote><p>We now detected cytokine levels after UPEC ON and OFF stimulation and we found LPS-driven cytokines to be similarly expressed between ON and OFF stimulated DCs (line 244-247, Figure 3G) and only minimal differences in MHCII levels (Supplementary Figure 1D). This indicates that DCs do react to UPEC ON mutants in an LPS dependent manner. Additionally, we tried to override the negative effects of UPEC ON mutants on DC adhesion by adding excessive amounts of exogenous LPS (200ng/ml). Overstimulation with LPS did not lift the effect ON mutants had on adhesion of DCs (data not added to the manuscript), demonstrating that the FimH-CD14 interaction is actin in a dominant manner.</p><p>The molecular details, how the FimH CD14 binding affects downstream signaling, such as the NFAT pathway (line 316-321, Figure 4G and Supplementary Figure 4D) are unclear, given that CD14 is a GPI anchored protein and thus has to act via co-receptors. We found equal rates of CD14 internalized upon UPEC ON and OFF stimulation (line 247-249, Figure 3H) and based on literature (Zanoni 2009) we hypothesize that activation of the NFAT pathway involves Ca signaling, leading to overactivation of the NFAT pathway and thus increased production of NFAT-driven cytokines (line 321-325, Figure 4H). Accordingly, we found that blocking activation of calmodulin (using FK506) prior to ON stimulation, rescued the expression of co-stimulatory molecules (line 316-321, Figure 4G and Supplementary Figure 4D).</p><p>We assayed expression of co-stimulatory molecules on tlr4 -/- DCs and found expression of costimulatory molecules still reduced after ON stimulation (line 231-236, Figure 3C and Supplementary Figure 3C) again suggesting that CD14 signaling is the rate-limiting pathway.</p><p>We also performed in vitro T cell proliferation assays using beta2 -/- DCs to dissect the effects of increased adhesion and decreased co-stimulatory molecules on T cell priming (line 211-216, Figure 2G und Supplementary Figure 2G). Beta2 integrin -/- DCs had a lower baseline-efficiency in supporting T cell proliferation when compared to WT DCs. Importantly, proliferation was still decreased after ON stimulation compared to OFF stimulation of beta2 -/- DCs. We conclude, that not hyperactivation of integrins but decreased co-stimulation is the dominant cause of reduced T cell priming. Additionally, cd14 -/- DCs still show increased levels of integrin activity after ON stimulation (line 249-251, Figure 3I and Supplementary Figure 3G).</p><p>Finally, we performed in vivo migration and T cell proliferation assays (Iine 381-412, Figure 7) and we found immunosuppression of DCs by ON UPECs to be modulated by non-cell autonomous effects.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Regarding the in vivo experiments:</p><p>Relevance of the pathways and mechanisms described in the paper needs to be proved in a mouse model of UPEC infection.</p></disp-quote><p>Although we agree that it will be very interesting to see how the molecular interaction we describe affects urinary tract infections (UTIs), we think that this is beyond the scope of this manuscript. UTIs are extremely complex pathogenetic sequences, and type 1 pili and FimH have pleiotropic roles in this process, including invasion into epithelia. Here, the fact that the FimH-CD14 interaction site overlaps with the mannose binding site that mediates invasion is especially challenging. The immune responses following invasion involve both innate and adaptive responses, which are difficult to dissect. As a natural infection always occurs with bacteria that can phase-vary between ON and OFF, it will be necessary to first characterize if and how UTIs proceed after infection with the pure ON and OFF mutants. In short, we argue that our findings represent the groundwork that will hopefully be picked up by more clinically oriented researchers who have proper animal models and in vivo expertise at hand to dissect how the pathway we identified can be utilized to target UTIs.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Other points:</p><p>Please add the analysis on T cell proliferation as well as the other analyses missing as reported in the Review.</p><p>Authors should further dissect the phenotype of T cells immobilized on DCs in vitro.

They found that type 1 pili interfere with CD14 activities, leading to defective DC migration, costimulatory molecule expression and antigen presentation. The main strength of the study is the dissection of the structural interplay between FimH and CD14, as it convincingly shows that the two molecules interact. On the other hand, analysis of the functional impact of type 1 pili on DC activation as well as on CD14 activities could be improved. Overall, this study provides a conceptual advance in our understanding of host-pathogen interactions and highlight CD14 as a possible target for the treatment of persistent bacterial infections.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank reviewer 2 for the encouraging words on our work as well as for pointing out the limitations. To address these, we performed a new set of experiments that tested the functional impact of type 1 pili on DCs by identifying the NFAT pathway as one pathway upregulated upon UPEC ON stimulation (line 316-321, Figure 4G and Supplementary Figure 4D) and we analyzed cytokine expression of UPEC ON and OFF stimulated DCs (line 321-325, Figure 4H). As also mentioned in the reply to reviewer 1, we found that ON stimulation leads to overactivation of the NFAT pathway, most likely by increased calcium influx as already known upon CD14 activation (Zanoni 2009), and this lead to increased expression of several cytokines such as IL-4, IL-10 and GM-CSF. Additionally, we found LPS-driven cytokines, such as IL-6, TNF-α and IL-1beta, equally expressed after ON and OFF stimulation (line 244-247, Figure 3G) as well internalization of CD14 receptor line 247-249, Figure 3H indicating binding of FimH to CD14 does not inhibit LPS-driven activation of DCs. Finally, we performed in vivo migration and T cell priming assays to show the in vivo relevance of our findings that we show in a new figure (Iine 381-412, Figure 7) and we observed a strong non-cell autonomous effect indicating the relevance of our findings on a cell-to-cell basis.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Most of the work is based on the analysis of DC responses to bacteria with (ON) or without (OFF) type 1 pili. Incubation of DCs with UPEC ON led to reduced antigen (OVA) presentation and T cell proliferation; lower induction of costimulatory molecules by DCs; higher integrin (Cd11b) activation; tighter adhesion of DCs to serum-coated surfaces; reduced DC migration ex vivo and in explanted tissues.

The authors could test whether UPEC ON or OFF are differentially capable of eliciting DC recruitment and interaction with T cells to lymph nodes.</p></disp-quote><p>To verify that the interaction between CD14 and FimH plays a relevant role in vivo during an infection, we performed in vivo migration assays using UPEC ON and OFF stimulated DCs and we analyzed in vivo T cell proliferation after UPEC ON and OFF stimulation (line 381-412, Figure 7). We comment on the results extensively in the reply to reviewer 1. Briefly, we found migration of DCs from the footpad into the popliteal lymph node reduced after ON stimulation, compared to OFF stimulation. However, as soon as we mixed ON and OFF stimulated DCs before injection, we found the same amount of DCs reaching the lymph node irrespective of the stimulus. We assume that these effects are due to noncell autonomous effects the DCs face once the DCs are in close contact with differentially stimulated DCs (Bardou et al., EMBOJ, 2021). T cell priming in vivo did not seem different after ON and OFF stimulation when looking at the overall amount of dividing T cells, however less T cells reached further rounds of division after ON stimulation reflected in the proliferation index. We hypothesize that ON stimulation therefore also affects in vivo T cell priming, but given that inside the host, antigen transfer to resident DCs in the lymph node occurs (Kleindienst and Brocker, The Journal of Immunity, 2003), we think that the effect is not as pronounced as in vitro.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- The authors find that CD14ko are not sensitive to UPEC ON-mediated alterations of migration, and they conclude that CD14 is required for increased integrin activity. This conclusion is not fully supported, in my view. It would be important to link CD14 and Cd11b hyperactivation using an independent, and possibly more direct, readout of integrin hyperactivation. More generally, a detailed characterization of how CD14ko DC respond to UPEC ON or UPEC OFF would be helpful to support the proposed link between the type 1 pili and CD14.</p></disp-quote><p>The most direct readout we can come up with to assay integrin activation is the integrin activity measurement in flow cytometry, as it reflects best what is actually happening on the integrin level itself without the need of an indirect readout such as migration. We therefore stained for active and total CD11b integrin on the cd14 -/- DCs and found overall a strong decrease in integrin activity, due to less active integrins on cd14 -/- DCs (line 249-251, Figure 3I and Supplementary Figure 3G). However, ON stimulation of cd14 -/- DCs still increased activity of CD11b integrins, pointing towards a CD14 independent mechanism of integrin hyperactivation after ON stimulation. We therefore revised this statement in the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- It remains unclear whether interference with CD14 activity by UPEC ON has any impact in vivo.

We thus focused on the downstream effects of the FimH – CD14 interaction: we identified that UPEC ON mutants overactivate the NFAT pathway in DCs, leading to increased expression of immune-modulatory cytokines (line 316-325, Figure 4G, 4H and Supplementary Figure 4D). Additionally, we have proven that the observed effects also hold true in vivo (line 381-412, Figure 7). In line with secreted factors being affected, we found strong non-cell autonomous effects blurring the cellular phenotypes when differentially stimulated DCs were co-applied (Figure 7E and F).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors identify a potential binding site between FimH and CD14 and then convincingly show that these molecules physically interact.

We therefore confidently assume, that the FimH binding site on CD14 is indeed different enough from the LPS binding site and that LPS recognition is not inhibited by type 1 pili binding to CD14. We also checked if DCs react in a dose depended manner to UPEC ON and OFF mutants and found that DCs react with a gradual increase in adhesion the more ON mutants are added in a mixture of UPEC ON/OFF mutants (we did not add this data to the manuscript).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>The authors explore the ability of the pili, a virulence factor typical of Enterobacteriaceae and of particular relevance in the study of uropathogenic <italic>E. coli</italic> (UPEC), to regulate the host immune response. Pili are particularly interesting as their expression can be turned on and off cyclically by bacteria due to phase variation, which can allow modulation of the virulence of isogenic bacteria. While it is known that pili modulate bacterial adhesion to host cells, little is known of the direct immunomodulatory properties of pili. Here the authors use a clever mutant <italic>E. coli</italic> model which is locked either in the ON (pilus expressor) or OFF( pilus non expressor) condition to study the ability of the pilus to influence dendritic cell (DCs) responses. The authors convincingly demonstrate that: (a) Pilus expressing (ON)-<italic>E. coli</italic> can inhibit the capacity of DCs to stimulate transgenic T cells in vitro, (b) ON-<italic>E. coli</italic> can down-modulate the ability of DCs to upregulate the costimulatory molecule CD40 and to a lesser extent CD80 and CD86, (c) ON-<italic>E. coli</italic> reduces DCs motility by enhancing the activation of beta2 integrins, which results in DCs being retained in the tissues and migrating less efficiently into the lymph, (d) CD14 is the receptor for pili proteins and is interaction between pili and CD14 is responsible for modulating some DCs responses.</p><p>While the experiments are convincing and well controlled, the authors fail to evaluate key innate functions of dendritic cells, such as cytokine production, where CD14 plays an important regulatory role, either indirectly by regulating TLR internalization and activation of the endosomal pathway, or directly by activating calcium signaling and NFAT activation. It is also unclear whether CD14 binding is blocking its ability to respond to other ligands (i.e. LPS). This tampers the impact of the conclusions. Moreover the absence of any in vivo infection experiment, tampers the enthusiasm for the paper. It's difficult to interpret the claim that pili influence DCs ability to activate T cells with only limited in vitro experiments. DCs ability to influence adaptive immunity is dependent on several things, including antigen transport, cytokine production, cell-cell interaction, migration etc…that cannot be fully recapitulated in vitro. Also, DCs exert important innate immune functions locally in the tissues, that are not only the activation of T cells and do not require their migration into the lymph, an aspect that is not taken in consideration by the authors. In conclusion, while the experiments are sound and controlled, and the idea is of great general interest in the context of host pathogen interactions, the analyses are insufficient to understand the immunomodulatory properties of pili with a level of depth that can be meaningful in an infection context.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank reviewer 3 for the comments and criticism on our work and for appreciating our approach of phase-locked mutant generation. We fully agree that we did not show cytokine production as a key function of DCs, as also pointed out by reviewer 1 and 2. We therefore analyzed cytokine levels after UPEC ON and OFF stimulated DCs in a quantitative manner using a cytokine array assay to understand if production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and LPS-driven cytokines are altered after ON stimulation (line 244-247 and line 321-325, Figure 3G and 4H). We found immune-modulatory cytokines upregulated by ON mutants (line 321-325, Figure 4H), due to overactivation of the NFAT pathway (line 316-321, Figure 4G). However, LPS-driven cytokines were equally expressed, and therefore we confidently assume that binding of FimH to CD14 is not blocking binding and recognition of LPS (line 244-247, Figure 3G). Furthermore, this is supported by CD14 endocytosis being similar between ON and OFF stimulation (line 247-249, Figure 3H).</p><p>We agree that the lack of in vivo experiments undermined the relevance of our finding in the infection context. We therefore performed in vivo migration assays and in vivo T cell proliferation assays, as outlined in detail in the reply to reviewer 1 and 2 (data presented in a new figure, Figure 7). Briefly, we found migration of DCs into the lymph node reduced after ON stimulation, compared to OFF stimulation (line 396-402, Figure 7C). However, as soon as we mixed ON and OFF stimulated DCs before injection, we found same amount of DCs reaching the lymph node irrespective of the stimulus.</p><p>We assume that these effects are due to non-cell autonomous effects the DCs face once the DCs are in close contact with differentially stimulated DCs (Bardou et al., EMBOJ, 2021).

We hypothesize that ON stimulation therefore also affects in vivo T cell priming, but given that inside the host antigen transfer to resident DCs in the lymph node occurs (Kleindienst and Brocker, The Journal of Immunology, 2003), we think that the effect is not as pronounced as in vitro. Given this non-cell autonomous effect, we are not convinced if infection models (for example bladder infection models of mice) would lead to additional insights for the interaction proposed of FimH-CD14. The identified interaction seems to be especially relevant at the individual cell-to-cell level and might be overlooked in the context of infection models.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>As mentioned above, while the paper does a good job at identifying pili as structures able to influence DC responses through CD14, they fail to evaluate a number of important functions of dendritic cells that are directly regulated by the receptor CD14, such as cytokine production downstream of TLR4 and/or directly downstream to CD14. Moreover, they do not go into sufficient depth neither regarding the molecular mechanism downstream to CD14 that could explain the observed phenotypes (are pili stimulating responses downstream of CD14? Are they inhibiting LPS binding? Are they inhibiting interactions between CD14 and TLR4 or TLR2?) , nor the ability of pili to influence the overall outcome and/or the activation of DCs during an infection in vivo.</p><p>The authors also discuss their results stressing that pili inhibit the capacity of DCs to activate T cells, however, only one initial experiment evaluating T cell activation is performed, in an in vitro setting with transgenic TCR bearing T cells.

While the topic is of great potential interest and the authors have devised an interesting tool to specifically study the importance of pili, they need to add depth to their work in order to take complete advantage of the tool they created and to help to answer the question they have posed.</p><p>Even taking into account the difficulty and the regulatory burden of animal experimentation, the authors could do a better job in dissecting the molecular mechanisms underlying the ability of pili to inhibit DCs and the dynamics of DCs-T cell interaction.</p></disp-quote><p>We now analyzed cytokine expression and identified the NFAT pathways to be upregulated upon UPEC ON stimulation, which leads to upregulation of NFAT-driven cytokines (GM-CSF, IL-4, IL-10; line 321325, Figure 4H). Blocking NFAT activation by calmodulin partially rescued the expression of costimulatory molecule expression (line 316-321, Figure 4G), and we therefore assume that additional pathways next to NFAT might be affected upon FimH binding to CD14. We also found LPS-driven cytokine expression (TNF-α, INF-γ, IL-6, IL-1beta) to be the same after ON and OFF stimulation, leading us to conclude that LPS binding/activation of CD14 is not inhibited by FimH binding (line 244-247, Figure 3G). This is further supported by the fact that CD14 still becomes internalized upon ON stimulation (line 247-249, Figure 3H).</p><p>Additionally, we also analyzed expression of co-stimulatory molecules on tlr4 -/- DCs (line 231-236, Figure 3C). In line with the increase in adhesion and the decrease in migration, tlr4 -/- DCs displayed decreased expression of co-stimulatory molecules after UPEC ON stimulation, as compared to UPEC OFF stimulation, although expression of co-stimulatory molecules was generally low.</p><p>To dissect if overactivation of integrins and the observed increased interaction time between DCs and T cells or if only downregulation of co-stimulatory molecules is causative for the dampened response of T cells, we performed in vitro T cell priming using beta2 -/- DC. We found that ON stimulated beta2 -/- DCs are still unable to efficiently prime T cells, compared to OFF stimulated beta2 -/- DCs (line 211216, Figure 2G and Supplementary Figure G). Thus, overactivation of integrins and the therefore increased DC-T cell interaction time is not causative for the lack of T cell response after UPEC ON stimulation; but what causes it, is the lack of co-stimulatory molecules. This is further supported by our finding, that cd14 -/- DCs still show overactive integrins after ON stimulation as compared to OFF stimulation (line 249-251, Figure 3I and Supplementary Figure 3G); although integrin activity was generally strongly reduced, when compared to WT DCs.</p><p>[Editors’ note: what follows is the authors’ response to the second round of review.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>The authors incorporated many requests previously made.
