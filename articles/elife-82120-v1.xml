Mass transport limitations (nutrients, oxygen, waste diffusion) of macroscale 3D tissue culture are circumvented by initially culturing murine or porcine adipocytes in 2D, after which bulk fat tissue is produced by mechanically harvesting and aggregating the lipid-filled adipocytes into 3D constructs using alginate or transglutaminase binders. The 3D fat tissues were visually similar to fat tissue harvested from animals, with matching textures based on uniaxial compression tests. The mechanical properties of cultured fat tissues were based on binder choice and concentration, and changes in the fatty acid compositions of cellular triacylglyceride and phospholipids were observed after lipid supplementation (soybean oil) during in vitro culture. This approach of aggregating individual adipocytes into a bulk 3D tissue provides a scalable and versatile strategy to produce cultured fat tissue for food-related applications, thereby addressing a key obstacle in cultivated meat production.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd><italic>Sus scrofa domesticus</italic> (pig)</kwd><kwd>cultured meat</kwd><kwd>cultivated meat</kwd><kwd>cultured fat</kwd><kwd>cultivated fat</kwd><kwd>lab-grown meat</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100019411</institution-id><institution>New Harvest</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Graduate Student Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yuen Jr</surname><given-names>John Se Kit</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100006133</institution-id><institution>Advanced Research Projects Agency - Energy</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DE-AR0001233</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yuen Jr</surname><given-names>John Se Kit</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P41EB027062</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kaplan</surname><given-names>David L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100014037</institution-id><institution>National Defense Science and Engineering Graduate</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Graduate Student Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yuen Jr</surname><given-names>John Se Kit</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A simple way to create larger volumes of fat tissue for food purposes may be to grow individual fat cells and mechanically combine them together (rather than directly growing the full tissue).</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Cultivated meat (also cultured, cell-cultured, in vitro meat) uses tissue engineering to produce meat for food (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Datar and Betti, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Post, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Post and Hocquette, 2017</xref>). Canonically, this research has focused on recreating the muscle component of meat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Post, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Benjaminson et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Simsa et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Ben-Arye et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Furuhashi et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Verbruggen et al., 2018</xref>). However, fat is key to the taste and texture of meat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">He et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Moritz et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Frank et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Frank et al., 2017</xref>). For example, peak evaluation scores were achieved with beef samples containing ~36% crude fat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Iida et al., 2015</xref>). Hundreds of volatile compounds are released when meat is cooked, with a majority originating from lipids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Frank et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Ba et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Mottram et al., 1982</xref>). Fat is also responsible for the species-specific flavor of meat, making it important for reproducing the flavors of specific animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Ramalingam et al., 2019</xref>). In addition to cultivated meat, in vitro-grown fat could also be used to enhance existing plant-based meats, as complex species-specific flavors of animals are difficult to recapitulate de novo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Fish et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">van Vliet et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bohrer, 2019</xref>).</p><p>While cultured fat stands to greatly improve the quality of alternative proteins, producing macroscale tissues remains a major challenge due to mass transport limitations. Even millimeter-scale in vitro tissues are challenging to generate, as oxygen and nutrients are only able to diffuse through several hundred microns of dense tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Coyle et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Murphy et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Helmlinger et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Jain et al., 2005</xref>). Various approaches have been implemented in tissue engineering to overcome diffusion limitations, such as vascularization and the incorporation of perfusion channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Kolesky et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Sarig-Nadir et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Li et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Lovett et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Lai et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Muller et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Kang et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Louis et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Volz et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Wittmann et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib112">Yang et al., 2020</xref>). However, current strategies are often limited by scalability and complexity. A dense array is required when incorporating perfusion channels, as all tissues must remain within several hundred microns of a channel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib111">Yamamoto et al., 2012</xref>). For adipose tissue, lipid accumulation decreases considerably once cells are ~1 mm away from a perfusion channel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Li et al., 2018</xref>). Vascularization of macroscale tissues is achieved via co-culture with endothelial cells, which spontaneously organize into capillary-sized vessels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Andrée et al., 2019</xref>). However, spontaneous vessel formation may not be feasible for centimeter- to meter-scale tissues, as cultivated cells may die during the time required for the vasculature to form (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Unal et al., 2018</xref>). Capillaries may also be too small to deliver a sufficient volume of media when supporting larger tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Tetzlaff and Fischer, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Moya et al., 2013</xref>). Thus, many challenges remain to scale fat (and other) tissues to bulk production levels.</p><p>In this study, our goal was to develop a relatively simple method of producing bulk cultured fat tissue that circumvents contemporary mass transport limitations. This was achieved by growing murine and porcine adipocytes in thin layers with easy access to the culture media, followed by post-growth aggregation into 3D adipose after sufficient adipocyte maturation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Aggregation at the end of cell culture removed the need for nutrient delivery via vascularization or elaborate 3D tissue perfusion, thus reducing costs and improving scalability. This approach is feasible when creating tissue solely for food purposes, as there is no requirement for continued cell survival once the final edible tissue is produced. This paradigm allows for simpler approaches and outcomes in comparison to regenerative medicine goals.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Graphical abstract covering the overall concepts behind producing macroscale volumes of cultured fat in this study.</title></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-82120-fig1-v1.tif"/></fig><p>We hypothesized that aggregating individual adipocytes would be sufficient to reproduce the taste, nutrition, and texture profile of fat, as adipose tissue in vivo is a dense aggregation of lipid-filled adipocytes with a sparse extracellular matrix (ECM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Mescher, 2021</xref>). Lipid-filled adipocytes were grown in vitro and aggregated into bulk macroscale tissues within suitable matrices, then compared with native adipose tissue from various animals. Cultured fat and native adipose samples were characterized for lipid droplet morphology and mechanical properties to infer textural characteristics.

After reaching confluency, 3T3-L1s were induced to differentiate into adipocytes for 2 days, then switched to lipid accumulation media until 15–30 days of culture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). At day 15, cultured adipocytes were 81.6% (±5.5%) positive for peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). 30-day adipocytes contained ~3 times more lipid per cell than 15-day adipocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C and D</xref>).

Here, the goal was to investigate any positive or negative effects of lipid supplementation on adipocyte fatty acid (FA) composition relative to in vivo adipocytes. Lipid supplementation (e.g., with Intralipid) has been reported to enhance adipogenic differentiation and may thus be a useful strategy in enhancing fat cell lipid accumulation during cultured fat production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">El Hadri et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ding et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Kokta et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Kim et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib113">Yanting et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Malodobra-Mazur et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Jurek et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Kim et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>When comparing the intracellular triacylglycerides (TAGs) of in vitro adipocytes (also termed in vitro fats [IVFs]) without lipid supplementation (other than lipids in fetal bovine serum [FBS]) and native mouse fats, the major difference observed was an enrichment of 16:1 and a lack of 18 carbon FAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Unsupplemented IVFs contained significantly less 18:1 and 18:2 versus 7D and 67D mouse fats, as well as slightly less 18:0 and 18:3 than 67D mouse. 16:0 was observed at similar levels to 67D mouse, while being lower than 7D mouse. Lower carbon FAs were found at higher levels in unsupplemented IVFs (e.g., 6:0), but these FAs were also occasionally enriched in 7D mouse (14:0, 12:0, 10:0). The addition of lipids (500–1000 µg/ml Intralipid) during cell culture altered adipocyte TAGs dose dependently, generally bringing FA compositions closer to that of the native fats largely through a reduction in 16:1 and increase in 18:1. Intralipid-treated IVFs had elevated levels of 16:0 and 18 carbon FAs (18:0, 18:1, 18:2, 18:3), which correlates with the composition of soybean oil, the major constituent of Intralipid (aside from water) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abdelghany et al., 2020</xref>).

Most studies that investigate 3T3-L1 adipogenesis in 2D are of limited culture duration (≤15 days), with lipid accumulation manifesting as small lipid droplets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Sheng et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Neal and Clipstone, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Sharma et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Wang et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Pazienza et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bogan et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Park et al., 2018</xref>). Here, we show that extended 2D culture (30 days) of in vitro adipocytes resulted in the emergence of larger lipid droplets, a key trait of white adipose tissue. Abundant lipids were also observed in porcine adipocytes, especially with 0–2% serum. Enhanced adipogenesis in low serum or serum-free media has been reported by numerous groups; the diminished lipid accumulation found in adipocytes differentiated in high serum conditions (e.g., 20% in this study) may be due to factors in FBS, such as transforming growth factor β, that have been found to be pro-proliferative and anti-adipogenic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Jurek et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Mitić et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Lee et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Entenmann and Hauner, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Sandhu et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Sprenger et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Boone et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Suryawan and Hu, 1993</xref>). Indeed, our results with porcine adipocytes in 20% FBS show increased nuclei and decreased lipid accumulation during differentiation. Despite the abundant lipid accumulation observed in in vitro porcine adipocytes cultured with 0-2% FBS, intracellular lipid accumulation was multilocular. A multilocular phenotype can signify adipocyte browning, indicating the presence of beige or brown fat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Jung et al., 2019</xref>). However, the lipid morphology observed in the Yorkshire pig DFAT cells of this study likely represents an immature white adipocyte phenotype, as Yorkshire pigs reportedly have no brown adipose tissue (due to the lack of a functional UCP1 gene) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib115">Zheng et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Berg et al., 2006</xref>).

For example, in this study we found that Intralipid supplementation drastically increased porcine cell adipogenesis. In this study, porcine dedifferentiated fat (DFAT) cells were used as adipocytes as they been reported to proliferate and accumulate lipids for at least 50 passages while maintaining expression of adipocyte-specific genes such as PPARγ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Nobusue and Kano, 2010</xref>). Additionally, DFAT cells have been shown to accumulate more intracellular lipids than adipose-derived stromal vascular cells, making them a better choice for large-scale cultured fat production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Peng et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>After in vitro adipocyte generation, mechanical aggregation of the cells during cell scraping immediately produced what looked like fat tissue. Murine adipocytes were then combined with food-relevant binders to maintain aggregation and tissue integrity. Uniaxial compression testing of alginate-based cultured fat tissues revealed similar stress-strain behaviors to native fat tissues, while mTG crosslinked adipocytes exhibited weaker resistance to compression closer to rendered fats. As mTG has been shown to greatly strengthen protein-rich materials, the weaker mTG fat tissues may be due to a lack of extracellular protein available for crosslinking among the aggregated in vitro adipocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Broderick et al., 2005</xref>). Thus, to strengthen mTG fat tissues it may be beneficial to mix in additional proteins such as soy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Dreher et al., 2020</xref>). It would also be interesting to investigate whether upregulating ECM deposition would improve mTG crosslinking, especially since ECM-promoting culture media components like ascorbic acid have also been shown to improve in vitro adipogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Jurek et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Cuaranta-Monroy et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Liu et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Kim et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Thorrez et al., 2018</xref>). Ultimately, the mechanical properties of aggregated cultured fat tissues were tunable based on the binding technique used (alginate versus mTG), as well as via the concentration of binder (0.8 versus 1.6% alginate).</p><p>When investigating the TAG compositions of in vitro-grown fats, we found murine 3T3-L1 cells to differ from native fats, notably being deficient in 18:1 and 18:2 while being enriched in 16:1 and shorter chained SFAs. It has been shown that rodents lacking dietary oleic acid (18:1 ω-9) compensated with higher levels of 16:1, as endogenous production of oleic acid is insufficient to achieve the amounts typically found in normal tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Bourre et al., 1997</xref>). Primary porcine adipocytes on the other hand achieved a closer FA profile their native equivalents, though slightly lacking in certain FAs such as 18:2. The scarce presence of 18:2 for both murine and porcine cells is likely due an inability for mammals to synthesize linoleic acid (18:2 ω-6), which may highlight the importance of its supplementation during in vitro culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Hansen, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Malcicka et al., 2018</xref>). Indeed, Intralipid treatment (44–62% linoleic acid) enriched 18:2 and raised overall PUFA levels for all in vitro adipocytes, with murine cells additionally achieving more similarity to native mouse fats in terms of 16:1 and 18:1 levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abdelghany et al., 2020</xref>). The increase in 18:3 from Intralipid across murine and porcine adipocytes represents a potential enrichment in omega 3 PUFAs, as 18:3 in soybean oil is alpha-linoleic acid. These changes suggest that lipid supplementation may be useful for tuning in vitro adipocyte TAGs to address deficiencies in particular FAs, enhance specific FAs, or more closely match the composition of native fats.</p><p>As phospholipids have been reported to contribute significantly to meat flavor, we additionally looked at IVF phospholipid FAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Mottram and Edwards, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Huang et al., 2010</xref>). In vitro porcine adipocytes were found to contain similar ratios of phospholipid FAs with their in vivo counterparts, although they notably contained fewer 20:4 and 18:2 FAs than the native fat samples tested. As linoleic acid (18:2) is a precursor to arachidonic acid (20:4 ω-6), it was possible that low 20:4 was due to a lack of 18:2. However, Intralipid-treated porcine IVFs did not show increased 20:4 despite having increases in 18:2. 20:4 levels in porcine IVFs were not uncommonly low though, achieving the same value as reported elsewhere for pig fat (1.4% of all FAs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Dinh et al., 2021</xref>). High 20:4 in our native pig samples could be related to how native pork fat FAs are very pliable based on the animal’s diet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">Wood et al., 2008</xref>). Ultimately, optimal intracellular 20:4 levels are unclear, as arachidonic acid has been linked with both inflammation and enhanced meat flavor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Calder, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Adam et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Takahashi, 2018</xref>). If desired, raising 20:4 may be possible through supplementation during cell culture, or via genetic interventions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Takahashi, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Rouzer et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Gol et al., 2018</xref>). For murine IVF phospholipids, Intralipid did not raise 18:2 despite its high linoleic acid content (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abdelghany et al., 2020</xref>). This could be due to genetic influence over phospholipid FAs and our use of the 3T3-L1 cell line (less representative of native adipocytes). It has been reported that different strains of mice can have varying phospholipid compositions when fed the same diet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Hulbert et al., 2006</xref>). While useful as a preliminary assessment on the potential flavor or aroma profiles of cultured fat, phospholipid FA profiles are not considered a definitive analysis on fat flavor and aroma. There is thus a need in the field for further research comparing the flavor profiles of cultured fats with native fats and plant-based alternatives, such as via sensory evaluation panels where human participants taste or smell food samples with cultured fat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Iida et al., 2015</xref>). Gas chromatography/mass spectrometry approaches may also be explored for a quantitative analysis of the various volatile compounds present in the aromas of cultured and in vivo fats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Watanabe et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>As a result of the comparable fatty acid compositions between in vitro and native fats (especially for primary porcine cells), similar caloric values may be expected for in vitro and native fats on a ‘per gram of lipid’ basis. However, structured cultured fat tissues in this study may have lowered caloric values due to adipocyte dilution (e.g., the 1:1 mixing of alginate and adipocytes in this study). Here, alternate adipocyte binding protocols and materials may be pursued to create cultured fat tissues with larger proportions of cultured adipocytes. For example, mixing cell-cultured adipocytes with more concentrated alginate would allow a smaller volume to be added for the same final alginate percentage. Other binder materials such as locust bean gum may also be used, which can be dispersed into cultured adipocytes as a powder and then formed into a gel after heating (thus minimally diluting the in vitro-grown adipocytes) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Dionísio and Grenha, 2012</xref>). With future efforts, characterizations such as calorimetry may be useful for quantifying any differences in caloric value between cultured and in vivo fat tissues. In this realm, thermogravimetric analyses may also be useful for assessing the cooking behavior of cultured fat tissues.</p><p>Aggregating in vitro adipocytes to generate cell-cultured animal fat using various binders unlocks a simplified approach of producing bulk cultured fat tissue with lower costs and direct scalability, addressing a key obstacle in cultivated meat production and contributing to the paradigm of food production using cell culture techniques. The adipocyte aggregation approach is cell type and species agnostic, as demonstrated via the 3T3-L1s (adipogenic fibroblasts) and primary porcine DFAT cells (mesenchymal stem cell-like cells) in this study. While laboratory techniques (2D culture in tissue culture flasks) were used to produce the adipocytes for aggregation in this study, the concept of generating adipose tissues for food via the aggregation of individual fat cells should be applicable to cells generated in larger-scale bioreactor systems (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). For example, adherent preadipocytes could be proliferated and differentiated en masse in various fixed bed bioreactors, after which they are harvested (e.g., by spraying fluid onto the cells to detach them) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Leinonen et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Pörtner and Platas Barradas, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hanley et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Leung et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib114">Yuen et al., 2022</xref>). The large-scale generation of adipocytes might also be achieved in suspension bioreactors using microcarrier, spheroid/aggregate approaches, or through cell adaptation to single cell suspension (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib114">Yuen et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Frye and Patrick, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Lohr et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Nahmias and Cohen, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bellani et al., 2020</xref>). Once produced, adipocytes can then be formed into structured cultured fat tissues by mixing with binder or crosslinking ingredients. Cultured adipocytes can also be directly added to food products (e.g., soups and sauces) as an unstructured fat biomass. Incorporating cultured fats or fat tissues into plant-based meats permits the creation of hybrid products, where sustainable and low-cost plant ingredients are enhanced by the complex species-specific flavors that arise from added animal fat cells. Taken together, these approaches offer a potential path to producing meat (or realistic meat alternatives) without animal slaughter, while potentially being more sustainable than conventional meat production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Tuomisto et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Tuomisto and de Mattos, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Sun et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Mattick et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Odegard and Sinke, 2021</xref>).</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>A conceptual schematic for scaling up cultured fat production via adipocyte aggregation.</title><p>As opposed to cell scraping methods with cell culture flasks, large-scale adipose production could utilize different types of bioreactors, including suspension bioreactors (e.g., rotating wall vessel and stirred tank) and adherent bioreactors (e.g., fixed bed, hollow fiber) for cell proliferation and differentiation. The adipocytes are then harvested and aggregated for incorporation into food products. For products requiring structured cultured fat tissues, fat cells are combined with binders or crosslinking ingredients to form a rigid construct. Adipocytes can also be directly included in food products that do not require the cultured fat to be structured.</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"

Mature adipocytes were collected from the floating lipid layer in the centrifuged solution and added to 10 ml of DMEM containing 20% FBS (A31606-01, Lot: 2129571; Thermo Fisher) and 100 µg/ml Primocin (ant-pm-1; InvivoGen, San Diego, CA, USA), then centrifuged again (500 × <italic>g</italic>, 5 min). Mature adipocytes were collected and transferred to a T25 tissue culture flask (Nunc EasYFlask, 156367; Thermo Fisher) containing 3.5 ml of DMEM with 20% FBS and 100 µg/ml Primocin and incubated at 39°C with 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. After 2 days, the floating lipid layer was transferred into a new T25 flask and completely filled (~75 ml) with DMEM+20% FBS+100 µg/ml Primocin. The filled flask was kept at upside down at 39°C, 5% CO<sub>2</sub> for 5 days, during which the mature adipocytes attached to the top surface and dedifferentiated. The flask was then drained, flipped around, and used normally with 3.5 ml of culture media. DFAT cells were used up to passage 3, grown using DMEM+20% FBS+100 µg/ml Primocin, and cryopreserved with a 9:1 solution of culture medium and DMSO.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Adipogenic differentiation</title><p>During terminal passages (where cells were differentiated instead of passaged for further cell culture), 3T3-L1s were grown DMEM with 10% FBS and 1% Anti/Anti until 100% confluency. Twenty-four to 48 hr after reaching confluency, cells were switched to an adipogenic induction medium (differentiation medium) consisting of DMEM with 10% FBS, 1% Anti/Anti, 10 µg/ml insulin (I0516; Sigma), 1 µM dexamethasone (D4902; Sigma), 0.5 mM 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (IBMX, I5879; Sigma) and 2 μM rosiglitazone (R0106; TCI America, Portland, OR, USA). After 2 days of adipogenic induction, 3T3-L1s were switched to a lipid accumulation medium for 13–28 days with feeding every 2–3 days. During cell feedings, great care was taken to handle the cells gently to prevent lift-off of lipid-laden adipocytes (<xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>). During the aspiration of used culture media, the tissue culture flask is inverted gently to collect media on the top and sidewalls. Dispensing new media (or other liquids) is also performed in the inverted position to avoid direct pipetting on the cells. The flask is then carefully reinverted to its upright position to allow gentle contact with the cells on the bed of the flask. The lipid accumulation medium consisted of DMEM with 10% FBS and 1% Anti/Anti, with 120 µg/ml Intralipid (I141; Sigma) and 10 µg/ml insulin. For experiments on the effects of fatty acid supplementation on cultured adipocytes, Intralipid concentration varied from 0 to 1000 µg/ml. ‘Fifteen-day’ cultured adipocytes refer to 2 days of adipogenic induction and 13 days of lipid accumulation post-induction, while ‘30-day’ adipocytes refer to 2 days of induction and 28 days of accumulation.</p><p>Porcine DFAT cells were differentiated similarly to 3T3-L1s, except the adipogenic induction and lipid accumulation phases lasted for 4 and 26 days, respectively (total 30 days). Different adipogenic media were also used. The induction medium consisted of Advanced DMEM/F12 (12634-028; Thermo Fisher) supplemented with 2 or 20% FBS, 0 or 500 µg/ml Intralipid, 100 µg/ml Primocin, 0.5 µM dexamethasone, 0.5 mM IBMX, 5 μM rosiglitazone, 2 mM (1×) GlutaMAX (35050-061; Thermo Fisher), 20 µM biotin (B04631G; TCI America, Portland, OR, USA), and 10 µM calcium-D-pantothenate (P001225G; TCI America). During lipid accumulation, the same medium was used sans IBMX.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Harvest of lipid-laden adipocytes and formation of 3D cultured fat tissues</title><p>After adipogenic differentiation, adipocytes were rinsed with DPBS after gentle aspiration of the culture media. Flasks were kept on their sides for 5–10 min to more thoroughly drain the DPBS, then cells were harvested using a cell scraper (83.3952; Sarstedt, Nümbrecht, Germany) via a series of raking motions (as opposed to the windshield wiper approach) into a pre-weighed 50 ml centrifuge tube.</p><p>All reconstructed cultured fat tissues were generated in cylindrical 3D printed molds open from the top and bottom (Ø 6 mm, 3 mm height) using a biocompatible resin (Surgical Guide resin; Formlabs, Somerville, MA, USA) and a stereolithography 3D printer (Form2 Printer; Formlabs). A glass coverslip was adhered (Loctite 3556; Henkel Adhesives, Düsseldorf, Germany) to the bottom of the mold to hold the adipocytes during tissue formation and was taken off afterwards to facilitate tissue removal. Two approaches were carried out to form the 3D cultured fat tissues. The first method involved mixing cell-scraped in vitro adipose with a sterile-filtered 15% (w/v) mTG solution (Activa TI; Ajinomoto, Itasca, IL, USA) at a 4:1 ratio (adipose:transglutaminase) and incubating the mixed tissue at 37°C overnight. The second method involved embedding the in vitro adipose in slow gelling alginate of various concentrations, with the approach adapted from the literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Growney Kalaf et al., 2016</xref>). Here, 1.6% or 3.2% (w/v) medium viscosity sodium alginate solutions (1007-50; Modernist Pantry, Eliot, ME, USA) were prepared by adding powder to water and allowing the alginate to hydrate for at least 1 hr. After hydration, calcium carbonate powder (CaCO<sub>3</sub>, 1505-50; Modernist Pantry, Eliot, ME, USA) was added to the alginate solutions to achieve 25 mM and vortexed for 10–60 s to yield evenly dispersed suspensions. To initiate delayed gelation, glucono delta-lactone powder (1159-50; Modernist Pantry, Eliot, ME, USA) was added to the alginate-calcium mixtures to achieve 50 mM and vortexed again for 10–60 s. Finally, the 1.6% and 3.2% alginate solutions were mixed 1:1 (volumetrically) with cell-scraped adipocytes to obtain alginate-cultured fat constructs of 0.8% and 1.6% alginate, respectively. For cultured porcine fat, scraped adipocytes were mixed with 3.2% alginate at a 1:1 (volumetric) ratio. All macroscale cultured fat tissues were stored at 4°C for a maximum of 3 days prior to mechanical testing.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Native animal adipose samples</title><p>Beef fat tissue (<italic>Bos taurus</italic>) from the pectoralis minor (brisket point cut) and chicken fat tissue (<italic>Gallus gallus</italic>) from the thigh were purchased from a local butcher shop. Both samples were displayed at refrigerator temperatures in the shop and transported to the laboratory at RT (~15 min). Two types of pork fat tissues were used in this study. For lipidomics, pork fat from the belly was purchased from a local butcher shop. For mechanical testing and fluorescence imaging, adipose from the belly of a freshly sacrificed 97-day-old Yorkshire pig was obtained at the Tufts University Medical Center and transported to the laboratory on ice (~25 min). Food-grade lard (Goya, Secaucus, NJ, USA) and tallow (Epic Provisions, Austin, TX, USA) were purchased commercially for mechanical testing and shaped with the same 3D printed molds used for forming macroscale IVF tissues. For lipidomics, beef, pork, and chicken samples were flash frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at –80°C, then thawed for lipid extraction. For mechanical (compressive) testing and fluorescence imaging, beef, pork, and chicken adipose samples were directly used after acquisition. Mouse fat tissue samples were obtained from the perigonadal regions of 7- and 67-day-old mice (CD-1 strain; Charles River, Wilmington, MA, USA) and directly used for lipidomics and fluorescence imaging.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Mechanical testing</title><p>Unconfined uniaxial compressive testing was carried out using a dynamic mechanical analyzer (RSA3; TA Instruments, New Castle, DE, USA). Cultured fat tissue samples (Ø 6 mm, 3 mm height) were taken from storage at 4°C and allowed to warm to RT (25°C as measured by an infrared thermometer) prior to testing. Beef, pork, and chicken fat tissue samples were cut using 6 mm biopsy punches, cut to 3 mm heights, and tested at 25°C. During testing, fat tissue samples were placed between parallel stainless steel plates and compressed. Compressive stress responses and elastic recoveries were measured up to 50% strain at a rate of 1.667% s<sup>–1</sup>. Stress/strain curve data were obtained using the TA Universal Analysis software and represent mean values over n.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Fluorescence and immunofluorescence staining</title><p>Cultured adipocytes in 48-well tissue culture plates were stained to confirm lipid accumulation and to check for markers of adipogenic differentiation. Here, 15- and 30-day 3T3-L1s adipocytes were stained for neutral lipids using DMEM 10% FBS 1% Anti/Anti culture media supplemented with 2 µM BODIPY 493/503 (4,4-difluoro-4-bora-3a,4a-diaza-s-indacene, D3922; Invitrogen, Waltham, MA, USA). Cells were first rinsed with DPBS, then incubated at 37°C for 15–30 min with 140 µl of the BODIPY-culture media solution in each well. After BODIPY incubation, cells were rinsed twice with DPBS and then fixed in 4% PFA for 10–15 min at RT protected from light. After fixation, cells were rinsed twice in DPBS then simultaneously blocked and permeabilized with B/P buffer (DPBS with 0.1% Tween 20 [P2287; Sigma], 0.1 M glycine [161-0718; Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA], 0.02% sodium azide [S2002; Sigma], and 5% goat serum [16210-064; Thermo Fisher]). Cells were then incubated overnight with primary antibodies at 4°C in B/P buffer containing either 1:50 rabbit anti-fatty acid synthetase (MA5-14887; Invitrogen, Waltham, MA, USA, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:AB_10980075">AB_10980075</ext-link>) or 1:500 rabbit anti-PPARγ (ab45036, Abcam, Waltham, MA, USA, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:AB_1603934">AB_1603934</ext-link>). The next day, cells were rinsed in DPBS and incubated with 2 µg/ml DAPI (4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole, 62248; Thermo Fisher) and 1:500 Alexa Fluor Plus 647 conjugated goat anti-rabbit secondary antibodies (A32733; Invitrogen, Waltham, MA, USA, AB_2633282) for 1 hr at RT. Finally, cells were rinsed in DPBS twice and stored in mounting media (H-1700; Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA, USA) at RT. Porcine DFAT adipocytes were stained for lipids via a 15–30 min incubation at 37°C in lipid accumulation media (sans Intralipid) supplemented with 2 µM BODIPY 493/503 and 2 µg/ml Hoescht 33342 (H3570; Invitrogen). DFAT cells were then fixed in 4% PFA at RT for 10–15 min, then rinsed with DPBS and stored in mounting media.</p><p>For lipid staining of native adipose samples, chicken, beef, pork, and mouse tissues were first fixed in 4% PFA at 4°C overnight. After fixation, adipose tissues were incubated in optimal cutting temperature compound (OCT, 4583; Sakura Finetek, Torrance, CA, USA) overnight at 4°C. Samples were then placed in molds with additional OCT and flash frozen with liquid nitrogen. Blocks of fat embedded in OCT were then cryosectioned (Leica CM1950; Wetzlar, Germany) and dried on glass slides (Superfrost Plus Gold, 22-035813; Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) at RT for 15–30 min. After drying, slides with tissue sections were rehydrated in DPBS for 10 min to dissolve the OCT, then stained with 2 µM BODIPY 493/503 for 30 min at RT. Stained tissues were then cleaned with DPBS and mounted with a coverslip plus mounting media. Staining jars (EasyDip; Simport Scientific, Saint-Mathie-de-Beloeil, QC, Canada) were used whenever possible to minimize sample loss that was sometimes observed when pipetting solutions directly onto the glass slides.</p><p>Z-stack images of all samples were taken using a confocal microscope (SP8; Leica, Wetzlar, Germany) using 405, 488, 638 nm lasers as appropriate. Quantifications of lipid accumulation (degree of BODIPY staining) were performed by first segmenting images into stain versus background regions using ilastik, followed by measurements of the stain area in CellProfiler (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Berg et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Stirling et al., 2021</xref>). BODIPY staining area was divided by the number of nuclei detected to calculate the amount of lipid accumulation per cell. PPARγ % was calculated by counting the number of PPARγ positive nuclei in CellProfiler (after ilastik segmentation), then dividing by total nuclei. Lipid droplet diameters were measured by first segmenting BODIPY images in ilastik, then taking the mean diameter of each BODIPY object (lipid droplet) in CellProfiler.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Lipid extraction</title><p>Lipids were extracted from in vitro adipocytes and native adipose tissues for downstream lipidomics analyses. For this analysis, 10 cm<sup>2</sup> worth of in vitro adipocytes were rinsed three times with DPBS with 5 min waits to remove residual culture media, followed by detachment with a cell scraper after the removal of residual DPBS via vacuum aspiration. This cell-scraped cultured fat was used for lipid extractions and lipidomics. Native adipose samples were thawed from –80°C storage (previously flash frozen with liquid nitrogen) and 10 mg (pork, beef, chicken) or 15 mg (mouse) samples were minced with tweezers and scissors prior to lipid extraction. All groups were performed in triplicate.</p><p>Lipid extractions were performed using a methyl tert-butyl ether-based (MTBE, 41839AK; Alfa Aesar, Haverhill, MA, USA) approach scaled down for 1.5 ml Eppendorf tubes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">Wong et al., 2019</xref>). Four-hundred µl of methanol (BPA4544; Thermo Fisher) was added to the fat samples in a 1.5 ml centrifuge tube and vortexed for 1 min, followed by an addition of 500 µl MTBE with occasional mixing for 1 hr at RT. Next, 500 µl of water was added and solutions were vortexed for 1 min. Aqueous and organic phases were separated by centrifuging samples at 10,000 × <italic>g</italic> for 5 min. The upper organic phase was then transferred to a new tube while the aqueous phase was re-extracted using 200 µl of MTBE, 1 min of vortexing, and 5 min of centrifugation.

The authors present exceptional evidence that this approach is scalable and that the lipid treatment of the cultured adipocytes modifies their fatty acid composition in the triglyceride as well as the phospholipid portions, which is important for engineering the taste component in cellular agriculture. The work will be of broad interest to bioengineers, tissue engineers, biomaterial scientists, and stem cell biologists.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="decision-letter" id="sa1"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.82120.sa1</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision letter</article-title></title-group><contrib-group content-type="section"><contrib contrib-type="editor"><name><surname>Radisic</surname><given-names>Milica</given-names></name><role>Reviewing Editor</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/03dbr7087</institution-id><institution>University of Toronto</institution></institution-wrap><country>Canada</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="reviewer"><name><surname>Radisic</surname><given-names>Milica</given-names></name><role>Reviewer</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/03dbr7087</institution-id><institution>University of Toronto</institution></institution-wrap><country>Canada</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="reviewer"><name><surname>Pieters</surname><given-names>Vera M</given-names></name><role>Reviewer</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/03dbr7087</institution-id><institution>University of Toronto</institution></institution-wrap><country>Canada</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><boxed-text id="sa2-box1"><p>Our editorial process produces two outputs: (i) <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://sciety.org/articles/activity/10.1101/2022.06.08.495192">public reviews</ext-link> designed to be posted alongside <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.06.08.495192v3">the preprint</ext-link> for the benefit of readers; (ii) feedback on the manuscript for the authors, including requests for revisions, shown below.

We have now added a new figure and the following text in the manuscript to cover the topic of cultured fat scale up more holistically:</p><p>New Text (Lines 360-374): “While laboratory techniques (2D culture in tissue culture flasks) were used to produce the adipocytes for aggregation in this study, the concept of generating adipose tissues for food via the aggregation of individual fat cells should be applicable to cells generated in larger scale bioreactor systems. For example, adherent preadipocytes could be proliferated and differentiated en masse in various fixed bed bioreactors, after which they are harvested by spraying fluid onto the cells as a means of detaching them<sup>78–81</sup>. The large-scale generation of adipocytes might also be achieved in suspension bioreactors using microcarrier, spheroid/aggregate approaches, or through cell adaptation to single cell suspension<sup>82–86</sup>. Once produced, adipocytes can then be formed into structured cultured fat tissues by mixing with binder or crosslinking ingredients. Cultured adipocytes can also be directly added to food products (e.g., soups and sauces) as an unstructured fat biomass. Incorporating cultured fats or fat tissues into plant-based meats permits the creation of hybrid products, where sustainable and low-cost plant ingredients are enhanced by the complex species-specific flavors that arise from added animal fat cells. Taken together, these approaches offer a potential path to producing meat (or realistic meat alternatives) without animal slaughter, while potentially being more sustainable than conventional meat production<sup>87–91</sup>.”</p><p>Figure 7 (Lines 377-383): “A conceptual schematic for scaling up cultured fat production via adipocyte aggregation. As opposed to cell scraping methods with cell culture flasks, large scale adipose production could utilize different types of bioreactors, including suspension bioreactors (e.g., rotating wall vessel and stirred tank) and adherent bioreactors (e.g., fixed bed, hollow fiber) for cell proliferation and differentiation. The adipocytes are then harvested and aggregated for incorporation into food products. For products requiring structured cultured fat tissues, fat cells are combined with binders or crosslinking ingredients to form a rigid construct. Adipocytes can also be directly included in food products that do not require the cultured fat to be structured.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>One of my additional questions would relate to the ability for thermal processing. Is it possible to assess the caloric value of these types of products and how far away they are from real products as well as how they change upon thermal processing?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this comment. On a “per gram of lipid” basis, we would expect the same caloric values between in vitro and native fats, due to their similar fatty acid compositions. Conversely, cell-cultured adipocytes mixed with binders such as alginate may have a lowered caloric value due to adipocyte dilution (i.e., the 1:1 mixing of alginate and adipocytes). Alternate protocols or binder materials may permit a closer resemblance to in vivo fats though, should a larger portion of the final cultured fat tissue comprise of the pure cell-cultured adipocytes. An example of this would be mixing cell cultured adipocytes with a more concentrated alginate solution, which would allow for less volume of alginate to be added to the cultured cells to achieve the same final alginate percentage. Another example to maintain a high proportion of adipocytes would be to use another binder such as locust bean gum, which can be dispersed into the cultured fat as a powder, and then formed into a gel after heating.</p><p>In the discussion, we have added text to reflect caloric values and analyses such as calorimetry and thermogravimetric analysis, which may be useful as future steps for establishing the equivalence of cultured and native fat tissues (in terms of caloric value and cultured fat tissue cooking behavior).</p><p>New Text (Lines 343-354): “As a result of the comparable fatty acid compositions between in vitro and native fats (especially for primary porcine cells), similar caloric values may be expected for in vitro and native fats on a “per gram of lipid” basis. However, structured cultured fat tissues in this study may have lowered caloric values due to adipocyte dilution (e.g., the 1:1 mixing of alginate and adipocytes in this study). Here, alternate adipocyte binding protocols and materials may be pursued to create cultured fat tissues with larger proportions of cultured adipocytes. For example, mixing cell-cultured adipocytes with more concentrated alginate would permit less dilution of in vitro adipocytes a smaller volume to be added for the same final alginate percentage. Other binder materials such as locust bean gum may also be used, which can be dispersed into cultured adipocytes as a powder and then formed into a gel after heating (thus minimally diluting the in vitro-grown adipocytes). With future efforts, characterizations such as calorimetry may be useful for quantifying any differences in caloric value between cultured and in vivo fat tissues. In this realm, thermogravimetric analyses may also be useful for assessing the cooking behavior of cultured fat tissues.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>Thank you for compiling this interesting work.
