immune cell development by connecting PI3K to downstream AKT signaling. However, the roles of PDK1 in CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell differentiation, especially in T follicular helper (Tfh) cell, remain obscure. Here we reported PDK1 intrinsically promotes the Tfh cell differentiation and germinal center responses upon acute infection by using conditional knockout mice. PDK1 deficiency in T cells caused severe defects in both early differentiation and late maintenance of Tfh cells. The expression of key Tfh regulators was remarkably downregulated in PDK1-deficient Tfh cells, including <italic>Tcf7</italic>, <italic>Bcl6</italic>, <italic>Icos</italic>, and <italic>Cxcr5</italic>. Mechanistically, ablation of PDK1 led to impaired phosphorylation of AKT and defective activation of mTORC1, resulting in substantially reduced expression of Hif1α and p-STAT3. Meanwhile, decreased p-AKT also suppresses mTORC2-associated GSK3β activity in PDK1-deficient Tfh cells. These integrated effects contributed to the dramatical reduced expression of TCF1 and ultimately impaired the Tfh cell differentiation.</p></abstract><kwd-group

serine/threonine kinase 3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase 1 (PDK1) is a critical metabolic regulator connecting PI3K and downstream molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Park et al., 2009</xref>). PDK1 is crucial for multiple types of immune cell development, such as hematopoietic stem cells, B cells, NK cells, T cells, and cytolytic CD8<sup>+</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Park et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Baracho et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Venigalla et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Yang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Finlay et al., 2012</xref>). Despite these profound effects of PDK1 on the regulation of various immune cell subsets, its role in CD4<sup>+</sup> T helper cells, especially T follicular helper (Tfh) cell differentiation, has not been experimentally determined.</p><p>Upon foreign antigens challenge, naïve CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells differentiate into functionally distinct subsets. Tfh cells are a specialized population that provides cognate help in germinal center (GC) to facilitate immunoglobulin affinity maturation and heavy-chain class switching, and ultimately promote generation of high-affinity antibodies of diverse isotypes, long-lived plasma cells, and memory B cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Crotty, 2014</xref>). The characteristic features of Tfh cells are defined as expression of the CXCR5, ICOS, PD-1, Bcl-6, and IL-21 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Crotty, 2019</xref>). Differentiation of Tfh cell relies on precisely orchestrated transcriptional program, which lies in the mutually antagonistic Bcl-6-Blimp1 as the core regulatory axis. Bcl-6 is indispensable for the divergence of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells into Tfh lineage, whereas Blimp1 programs Th1 cell formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Johnston et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Yu et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Nurieva et al., 2009</xref>). TCF1 (encoded by <italic>Tcf7</italic>) supports Tfh cell specification by promoting Bcl-6 and repressing Blimp1 expression, revealing a key role of TCF1 in the regulation of the Bcl-6-Blimp1 axis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Shao et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Wu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Choi et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Xu et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Compared with other T helper cells, the differentiation of Tfh is more dependent on signals provided by both TCR and co-receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Deenick et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Baumjohann et al., 2013</xref>). Except sustained TCR signals, Tfh cells also express high levels of many co-receptors for their generation and function, including CD28 and ICOS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Qin et al., 2018</xref>). The PI3K signaling via AKT is responsible for transduction of Tfh cell-dependent TCR signals and ICOS co-stimulation and essential for Tfh cell differentiation. Previous studies have revealed inactivation of PI3K catalytic subunit p110δ or regulatory subunit p85α almost completely abolishes Tfh cell differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Rolf et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Leavenworth et al., 2015</xref>), whereas mice that express the E1020K activating mutant of p110δ or have a T cell-specific deficiency of PTEN exhibit enhanced Tfh cell formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Preite et al., 2018a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Shrestha et al., 2015</xref>). Moreover, FoxO1, which is suppressed by AKT, restrains Tfh cell differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Stone et al., 2015</xref>). Besides, PI3K-mediated signaling pathways involving mTORC1 and mTORC2 are also critical for Tfh cells. mTORC1 induces p-S6 and Glut1 expression to promote protein synthesis and cell proliferation, essential events for Tfh cell specification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Zeng et al., 2016</xref>). Unlike mTORC1, mTORC2 programs Tfh cell differentiation by decreasing FoxO1 activity and transcriptionally regulates signature programming of Tfh cells, including <italic>Bcl6</italic>, <italic>Cxcr5</italic>, and <italic>Tcf7</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hao et al., 2018</xref>). Correspondingly, Yang et al. reported mTORC2-deficient CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells show reduced p-GSK3β, β-catenin, and TCF1 level, establishing a positive link between PI3K/AKT and Wnt/β-catenin/TCF1 signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Yang et al., 2016</xref>). Besides, mTOR-dependent Hif activity is also crucial for Tfh cell development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Cho et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>In this study, we explore the knowledge gap whether and how PDK1 plays essential roles in Tfh cell differentiation elicited by acute viral infection and protein immunization. Our data indicated that PDK1 is intrinsically required for Tfh cell formation and effector functions, which is important to understanding the nature of the Tfh cell development.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>PDK1 promotes Tfh cell differentiation and GC Bcell responses</title><p>To elucidate whether PDK1 regulates Tfh cell differentiation, we first evaluated the expression of PDK1 in bifurcation of effector CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells into Tfh or Th1 cells upon acute viral infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Xu et al., 2015</xref>). We infected wild-type C57BL/6J mice with LCMV Armstrong strain and observed elevated expression level of PDK1 in Tfh cells compared with naïve CD4<sup>+</sup> T or Th1 cells on day 8 post-infection (8 dpi), which suggested potential roles of PDK1 in Tfh cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). To further investigate the function of PDK1 in Tfh cells, we generated conditionally knockout mice (<italic>Pdk1</italic><sup>fl/fl</sup>::<italic>Cd4</italic>-Cre mice), and the deletion efficiency in CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells was further confirmed by quantitative RT-PCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>).

Consistent with decreased p-AKT, phosphorylation of GSK3β was remarkably reduced in PDK1-deficient Tfh cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). Moreover, expression level of TCF1 was much lower in PDK1-null Tfh cells than that of WT cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). Decreased GSK3β phosphorylation in PDK1-deficient Tfh cells caused enhanced GSK3β activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>), which was accounted for impaired TCF1 level.

Here, we focused on exploring the role of kinase PDK1 in the regulation of Tfh cell differentiation and effector function. The generation of Tfh cells was severely compromised in PDK1-deficient mice upon acute LCMV infection and KLH immunization. Correspondingly, the GC responses were also impaired as a consequence of defective Tfh cells. BM chimera results further revealed PDK1 controls Tfh cells in a cell-intrinsic fashion. By using different mice models, we validated that PDK1 is essential for both early expansion and late maintenance of Tfh cells. Taken together, these data support the notion that PDK1 is critical for the development and B-cell helper function of Tfh cells.</p><p>CD28 and ICOS are two key costimulatory receptors expressed by Tfh cells, both of which activate PI3Kδ and are essential for Tfh cell differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Preite et al., 2018b</xref>). Previous study indicated that ICOS-dependent PI3K signal exerts nonredundant function in the generation of Tfh cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gigoux et al., 2009</xref>). By using GSEA and flow cytometry assay, we observed that ICOS functioned as upstream activator of PDK1 in CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells. Moreover, we found that Tfh cells exhibited higher expression of PDK1 than Th1 cells and naïve CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells. These results collectively suggested that ICOS-dependent PDK1 activity is pivotal for Tfh cells.</p><p>The PI3K-AKT signaling pathway is activated by various cell-surface receptors that are crucial for Tfh cell differentiation and function. It is well elaborated that PI3K is a critical component of pathway driving Tfh cell differentiation and GC formation supported by data from PI3K-targeting mice as well as mice and humans expressing activating mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Rolf et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Preite et al., 2018a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Preite et al., 2018b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lucas et al., 2014</xref>). Activation of PI3K facilitates the recruitment of PDK1 and AKT to the plasma membrane through their PH domains, which enables phosphorylation of T308 within the catalytic domain of AKT. To be fully activated, a second crucial residue (S473) located in a hydrophobic motif within AKT’s regulatory domain must be phosphorylated by protein kinases like mTORC2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fayard et al., 2010</xref>). mTORC2-deficient mice exhibited severely impaired Tfh cells by activating Tfh cell repressor FoxO1 expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Zeng et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hao et al., 2018</xref>), and we observed the phenotypes of <italic>Pdk1</italic><sup>fl/fl</sup>::<italic>Cd4</italic>-Cre cells almost recapitulated the defects of mTORC2-deficient Tfh cells. mTORC2-deficient T cells exhibited decreased phosphorylation of p-AKT at Ser473 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Zeng et al., 2016</xref>), whereas, in our experimental system, we found a reduction of both phosphorylated T308 and S473 levels in PDK1-deficient Tfh cells, similar phenomena were also observed in PDK1-null B cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Venigalla et al., 2013</xref>). Meanwhile, we observed a reduction of phosphorylated FoxO1/3a and basal FoxO1 levels, which is a downstream molecule of AKT. These results suggested that PDK1-AKT-FoxOs signaling may not be responsible for defective Tfh cells in PDK1-null mice, as FoxO1 is a negative regulator for Tfh cell formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Stone et al., 2015</xref>). In addition, the level of phosphorylated S6 was severely decreased in PDK1-deficient Tfh cells, indicating impaired mTORC1 pathway in the absence of PDK1. Compromised mTORC1 activity in turn attenuates protein synthesis and cell proliferation, which are essential for Tfh cell differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Zeng et al., 2016</xref>). Meanwhile, we found the expression of both <italic>Hif1a</italic> mRNA and Hif1α protein was significantly decreased in PDK1-deficient Tfh cells, which may also contribute to the defective phenotype as loss of Hif1α in CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells impairs Tfh cell differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Cho et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">He et al., 2019</xref>). These results collectively indicated that PDK1-dependent downstream molecular pathways are indispensable for Tfh cell biology.</p><p>Transcription factor TCF1 is expressed at an extremely high level in Tfh cells post-viral infection and exerts crucial roles in generation, maintenance, and effector functions of Tfh cells by repressing <italic>Prdm1</italic> and <italic>Il2ra</italic> and promoting <italic>Bcl6</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Shao et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Wu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Choi et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Xu et al., 2015</xref>). It has been proposed that β-catenin, a coactivator of TCF1 that is negatively regulated by p-GSK3β, linking PI3K-AKT and TCF1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Yang et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Zhou et al., 2010</xref>). Besides, it has been reported that mTORC1 controls TCF1 expression in Tfr cells by phosphorylated STAT3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Xu et al., 2017</xref> ). Correspondingly, we found both the p-GSK3β<sup>S9</sup> and p-STAT3<sup>S727</sup> levels were significantly decreased in PDK1-deficient Tfh cells. Furthermore, PDK1-null Tfh cells showed both impaired <italic>Tcf7</italic> mRNA and TCF1 protein level. Reconstituting PDK1-deficient CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells with TCF1 rectifies their defects in the generation of Tfh cells. Moreover, forced expression of STAT3-CA (constitutive active form of STAT3) could restore the Tfh cell numbers of PDK1-deficient mice. These observations collectively suggested that PDK1-dependent TCF1 expression contributes to Tfh cell formation.</p><p>In summary, the role of PDK1 in Tfh cell differentiation was extensively investigated in the current study. Our data further suggested PDK1 activates AKT in Tfh cells via phosphorylating both Thr308 and Ser473 residues. On the one side, p-AKT in turn activates mTORC1, and mTORC1 subsequently drives protein synthesis and Hif1α expression and supports TCF1 expression by p-STAT3 to sustain Tfh cell differentiation. On the other side, p-AKT also suppresses GSK3β activity and ultimately promotes TCF1 expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). Therefore, our study uncovers PDK1 as a critical regulator for Tfh cell development for both early expansion and late maintenance by mainly modulating TCF1 expression.</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Working model of PDK1 in regulating Tfh cell differentiation.</title><p>Left panel: In PDK1-sufficient cells, AKT gets activated by phosphorylation at Thr308 and Ser473. p-AKT activates mTORC1, and mTORC1 further phosphorylates S6 and supports Hif1α expression, promoting protein synthesis, proliferation, and metabolization. mTORC1 also phosphorates STAT3 to induce TCF1 expression. In addition, p-AKT also guards TCF1 activity through the inactivation of GSK3β, an inhibitor of TCF1 and β-catenin. Enhanced TCF1 contributes to Tfh cell differentiation, GC responses, and humoral immunity. Right panel: In PDK1-deficient cells, AKT remains inactivated by loss of phosphorylation at Thr308 and Ser473, which contributes to impaired mTORC1 activity and activities of downstream molecules, inducing p-STAT3-dependent TCF1 expression. In addition, inactivation of p-AKT leads to compromised p-GSK3β, resulting in increased GSK3β activity and subsequently inhibition on TCF1 level. Decreased TCF1 leads to impaired Tfh cell differentiation, GC responses, and humoral immunity.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-61406-fig7-v1.tif"/></fig></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Mice</title><p><italic>Pdk1</italic><sup>fl/fl</sup> mice have been described before (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Lawlor et al., 2002</xref>). <italic>Cd4</italic>-Cre, <italic>Rosa26<sup>CreER</sup></italic>, and C57BL/6J (CD45.1 and CD45.2) mice were purchased from the Jackson Laboratory.

responses. The role of PDK1 has not been previously analyzed with regards to Tfh differentiation. This thorough study explored the role of PDK1 in Tfh cells and further our understanding of these important cells.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;The kinase PDK1 is critical for promoting T follicular helper cell differentiation&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Tadatsugu Taniguchi as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Carolyn Genevieve King (Reviewer #1); Amanda Poholek (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>As the editors have judged that your manuscript is of interest, but as described below that additional experiments are required before it is published, we would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). First, because many researchers have temporarily lost access to the labs, we will give authors as much time as they need to submit revised manuscripts. We are also offering, if you choose, to post the manuscript to bioRxiv (if it is not already there) along with this decision letter and a formal designation that the manuscript is &quot;in revision at <italic>eLife</italic>&quot;. Please let us know if you would like to pursue this option.

Using a T cell conditional knockout model, the authors show that PDK1 deficiency impairs TFH generation during LCMV condition in both non-competitive and competitive (mixed bone marrow chimera) settings. Comparison of wild type and PDK1-/- TFH cells by RNAseq -/- TFH clearly shows a defect in the expression of many genes and pathways known to be essential for TFH cells; these findings are further corroborated by biochemical assays showing impaired PI3K/Akt signaling, GSK3b phosphorylation and mTORC1 activation in PDK1-/- TFH cells. Overexpression of TCF1, a transcription factor required for TFH differentiation, partially rescues TFH differentiation by PDK1-/- T cells suggesting that TCF1 is induced downstream of PDK1 signaling. These findings are generally in line with what is expected and known about PI3K activity/TFH cells, and this is where the authors have focused much of their attention. The manuscript could be improved by investigating whether PDK1 is activated downstream of CD28, ICOS or both; and whether PDK1 may have any PI3K independent role in CD4 T cells as has been suggested for CD8's.</p><p>1) The data in Figure 1D nicely show impaired TFH generation by PDK1-/- T cells both as a proportion of total CD4 T cells (gated on CD44?) as well as the number of CD4 T cells. However, based on the numbers reported it seems that Th1 numbers are also significantly decreased, indicating that PDK1 deficiency leads to a general expansion defect in the CD4 T cell compartment. This is not unexpected given previous published data (1), but might be important to understanding the nature of the Tfh defect – is it something that occurs early or late during infection; i.e. is it a defect in expansion of the compartment, initial acquisition or later maintenance of the Tfh fate?</p><p>2) All of the TFH markers shown in Figure 1D with the exception of Bcl6 are nicely reproduced in the bone marrow chimera experiments shown in Figure 2D. Bcl6 in Figure 2D only appears to be impacted on a small proportion of the TFH compartment as opposed to a global defect. Do the authors have an explanation for why this might be the case? Does it have something to do with TFH gating? Related to the first comment, it would also be informative to see if these markers are impacted in the non-TFH compartment to determine if their expression is TFH-specific or not.</p><p>3) The RNAseq data shown in Figure 3 is an important resource that might be used to understand the signaling pathways directly impacted by PDK1 deficiency in T cells. This could be done by looking at additional publicly available gene enrichment pathways. For example, are there differences in CD28 versus ICOS dependent pathways in these cells? What about mTORC1 versus mTORC2 – specific to TFH cells as reported by Zeng et al. (2).</p><p>4) PDK1 KO T cells have defects in pAkt but also have defects in total expression of Akt. Decreased pAKT-S473 can more or less be explained by decreased total expression of AKT; what is interesting, is that pAKT-S308 is decreased independently of AKT expression. This might point to more impairment of mTORC1 compared to mTORC2. This would be consistent with the very strong impairment of pS6 in Figure 4. Although GSK3b phosphorylation is also decreased in PDK1 KO TFH cells (which according to Yang et al. (3) would be more important for mTORC2 activation) the authors should show total GSK3b expression to aid in the interpretation of this data.</p><p>5) PDK1 KO TFH cells are partially rescued by TCF7 overexpression but these data do not directly link PDK1 deficiency to TCF1. In the Discussion, the authors suggest that PDK1/Akt activates mTORC1 to drive TCF1 expression but a previous report suggests that TCF1 is regulated by mTORC2 (3). The authors should try to explain/place their findings in the context of what has been published.</p><p>6) Work by Doreen Cantrell has shown that PDK1 can have a PI3K independent effect in CD8 T cells and is required for mTORC1 activation (4). It would be interesting to see if this is also the case for CD4 T cells and could help explain some of the discrepancies in the TFH field – namely work showing that mTORC1 is alternately required for and represses TFH cell fate (2,5); the same is true for HIF activation (6-8) (which the authors demonstrate in Figure 3, is impacted by PDK1 deletion). The authors might be in the position to shed light on this question through a careful analysis of whether PDK1 expression/activity is differentially regulated by various signaling pathways which are important for TFH cells (e.g. TCR? CD28? IL-2R? ICOS? &gt;&gt; mTORC1, mTORC2, HIF….). Importantly, the authors have generated a useful tool – SMARTA PDK1<sup>fl/fl</sup>ERT2-Cre mice – which could be used to assess the impact of early versus late deletion of PDK1 in T cells. This would allow them to address whether PDK1 deficiency impacts early vs. late TFH differentiation (e.g. TCF1 induction or maintenance) which would help them to hone in on which signaling pathways to investigate further.</p><p>1) Park, S.-G. et al.

They found that Pdk1 is necessary for Tfh cell generation during acute viral infection. Further, they performed RNA-Seq and the data suggest that PDK1 deficiency resulted decreased Tfh cell transcriptional programming. I have the following comments:</p><p>1) It has been well documented that PDK1 plays a central role in many signal transduction pathways including the activation of Akt and PKC. Through its effects on these kinases, PDK1 is involved in the regulation of a wide variety of processes, including cell proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis. It is appreciated that the authors focus on Tfh cell, however, the general phenotype of the Pdk1 knockout mice need to be mentioned including the effects on T cell homeostasis, initial activation and differentiation of other T cell types (e.g. Is in vivo and/or in vitro differentiation of Th1, Th2 and Th17 cells affected?). The authors need to carefully examine the roles of Pdk1 on T cell homeostasis, proliferation and differentiation.</p><p>2) Although the authors concluded that “Pdk1 as a critical regulator for Tfh cell development”, only one LCMV-Arm model is not enough for this conclusion, the authors need to test the effect of Pdk1 on Tfh cells by using at least another model, such as NP-OVA or KLH immunization.</p><p>3) For the mechanistic study, it will be important to choose early time points (days 2-3) after LCMV infection, to identify primary events, instead of associated consequences after Pdk1 knockout.</p><p>4) The authors concluded that “TCF1 serves as a critical regulator at downstream of PDK1 in promoting Tfh cell differentiation” and did rescue exp in Figure 4E. Can CXCR5 or Bcl6 overexpression also rescue the defective generation of Tfh cells by Pdk1 knockout?</p><p>5) PI3K signals are important for lymphocyte trafficking. Do Pdk1-deficient T cells have defect in migratory response toward CXCL13 or CCL21?</p><p>6) An important effect of Tfh cell function is the induction of germinal center.

To directly exhibit the Th1 numbers, we added the statistical data of both Th1 percentage and numbers in current Figure 1D with the fold change in comparison with Tfh cells. As mentioned by the reviewer, our results reflected that numbers of Th1 cells (2.6-fold) were also significantly decreased, though the frequency of Th1 cells in the absence of PDK1 was elevated compared with WT controls.

We noticed that the distinct degree of reduced Bcl6 expression in original Figure 1D and Figure 2D. After reviewing the data set and repeating the experiments, we found the extremely low degree of Bcl6 expression shown in original Figure 1D did not representatively reflect the difference of mean level from at least three independent experiments in primary mice, though the conclusion on reduced Bcl6 expression in PDK1-deficient Tfh cells is reliable. To appropriately present the data, we replaced the original histogram and statistical data in the new version and the conclusion remains consistent, which exhibited that Bcl6 expression (current Figure 1E) was statistically decreased in PDK1-deficient Tfh cells (CXCR5<sup>+</sup>CD44<sup>+</sup>).</p><p>On the other aspect, we changed the strategy as Hao et al., 2018, to show the intrinsic regulation of PDK1 in Tfh cells from BM chimeric mice, which showed the contribution rate of both WT and PDK1-deficient donors.

In order to examine the differences of CD28 versus ICOS signaling between WT and PDK1-deficient cells, we extracted data from published studies and performed GSEA analysis (Kunzli et al., 2020; Riley et al., 2002). The results suggested that PDK1-deficient Tfh cells showed lower expression of signatures in the gene set “Up-regulated under anti-CD28” containing up-regulated genes upon anti-CD28 stimulation, while exhibited increased expression of signatures in the gene set “Down-regulated under anti-ICOS-L” containing down-regulated genes upon ICOS-L blocking (Figure 5E). These analyses implied that CD28 or ICOS dependent PDK1 activity may involve in Tfh cell differentiation. To further validate this conclusion, we stimulated CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells isolated from GP61-primed WT SMARTA mice with different stimuli combinations. We found anti-ICOS only could elicit a higher level of p-AKT<sup>T308</sup>, an indicator of PDK1 activity, while combination of anti-ICOS plus anti-CD3 or/and anti-CD28 had a similar effect with anti-ICOS only. These results further suggested ICOS-dependent PDK1 activity is essential for Tfh cells. We showed these figures in current Figure 5F and G, and the text was amended accordingly.</p><p>To examine effects of mTORC1 versus mTORC2 between two genotypes of cells, GSEA was also performed with gene sets obtained from published two studies (Hao et al., 2018; Zeng et al., 2016). We observed both Raptor and Rictor-activated genes were significantly enriched in WT Tfh cells, while Raptor and Rictor-suppressed genes were remarkably enriched in <italic>Pdk1</italic><sup>fl/fl</sup>Cd4-Cre Tfh cells. These results suggested that PDK1 downstream genes involved in both mTORC1 and mTORC2 dependent pathways play crucial roles in regulating Tfh cell differentiation. These results were shown in Figure 6A and the text was amended accordingly.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) PDK1 KO T cells have defects in pAkt but also have defects in total expression of Akt. Decreased pAKT-S473 can more or less be explained by decreased total expression of AKT; what is interesting, is that pAKT-S308 is decreased independently of AKT expression. This might point to more impairment of mTORC1 compared to mTORC2. This would be consistent with the very strong impairment of pS6 in Figure 4. Although GSK3b phosphorylation is also decreased in PDK1 KO TFH cells (which according to Yang et al. (3) would be more important for mTORC2 activation) the authors should show total GSK3b expression to aid in the interpretation of this data.</p></disp-quote><p>We agreed with the reviewer for this concern. Decreased pAKT-S473 expression was also reported in B cell population due to PDK1 deficiency (Venigalla et al., 2013), but the reason remains to be further investigated. Given the total AKT expression is substantially decreased in PDK1-deficient Tfh cells, we cannot exclude the possibility that impaired AKT expression contributes to the decreased pAKT-T308. Nevertheless, the decreased pAKT-T308 is in accordance with conditional ablation of PDK1 in T cells, which is an upstream kinase of AKT (Toker and Newton, 2000). As presumed by the reviewer, PDK1 deficiency has more profound effect on mTORC1 activity, as indicated by remarkable impairment of p-S6 activity. While our GSEA analysis and experiments also indicated strong correlation between PDK1 and mTORC2.</p><p>As requested, we also checked the total GSK3β expression in WT and PDK1-deficient Tfh cells on day 8 post infection. We found GSK3β expression was significantly elevated in PDK1-deficient Tfh cells compared with WT cells. This result is consistent with decreased GSK3β phosphorylation and TCF1 expression in PDK1-deficient Tfh cells, which reported by Yang et al. (Yang et al., 2016). We thank the reviewer again for this suggestion and modified the relative figure and descriptions in revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) PDK1 KO TFH cells are partially rescued by TCF7 overexpression but these data do not directly link PDK1 deficiency to TCF1.

Yang et al. reported that mTORC2-pAKT may also support TCF-1 activity through the inactivation of GSK3β, an inhibitor of β-catenin and TCF-1 (Yang et al., 2016). Correspondingly, we also found impaired p-AKT<sup>S473</sup> and p-GSK3β activity in PDK1-deficient cells, indicating a positive link between PDK1/AKT and TCF-1. On the other aspect, Xu et al. reported mTORC1-dependent p-STAT3<sup>S727</sup> activity is crucial for driving TCF1 expression in T follicular regulatory cells (Xu et al., 2017). Due to severe defects of mTORC1 activity, we also checked the p-STAT3<sup>S727</sup> activity in PDK1-deficient Tfh cells. We found impaired phosphorylation of STAT3 at S727 in PDK1-deficient Tfh cells (Figure 6C). Furthermore, we found that overexpression of STAT3-CA (a constitutive active form of STAT3) could also partially rectify the defects in PDK1-deficient Tfh cells (Figure 6D and E). These analyses further indicated PDK1mTORC1-p-STAT3-TCF1 is also critical for Tfh cell differentiation. We have supplemented these data and relative discussion based on our observations and published results (Xu et al., 2017; Yang et al., 2016).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Work by Doreen Cantrell has shown that PDK1 can have a PI3K independent effect in CD8 T cells and is required for mTORC1 activation (4).

We have noticed that in CTLs, PDK1 but not PI3K or AKT is crucial for mTORC1 activity (Finlay et al., 2012). It is worthy to investigate this in CD4 T cells. A recent paper has pointed out that gain-of-function mutations in the gene encoding the phosphatidylinositol-3-OH kinase catalytic subunit p110δ (PI3Kδ) result in enhanced phosphorylation of AKT and S6 in CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells relative to that in wildtype CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells (Preite et al., 2018), which implies possible link between PI3K and mTORC1 in CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells. However, whether PDK1 has PI3K independent effect in CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells and is required for mTORC1 activation is still needed to be further investigated in future study. In current study, we mainly focused on the effect of PDK1 ablation on downstream signal and consistent with the results from Cantrell Lab, we also observed decreased mTORC1 activity and reduced Hif1a expression (Figure 6C). To address which signaling is responsible for PDK1 activity, we performed GSEA analysis and in vitro validation. As claimed above (reviewer 1, concern 3), the GSEA results showed CD28 or ICOS dependent PDK1 activity may be involved in Tfh cell differentiation. The in vitro validation assay indicated anti-ICOS only could elicit higher level of p-AKT<sup>T308</sup>, an indicator of PDK1 activity, while combination of anti-ICOS plus anti-CD3 or/and anti-CD28 had a similar effect with antiICOS only. Besides, the CD25 signaling did not affect PDK1 activity in our experimental system. These analyses collectively indicated that ICOS signaling had a profound effect on PDK1 activity to control Tfh cell differentiation, which is essential for initiation of Tfh program (Crotty, 2011).</p><p>By using adoptive transfer models with SMARTA <italic>Pdk1</italic><sup>fl/fl</sup><italic>ERT2</italic>-Cre or WT donors, we analyzed the impact of deletion of PDK1 on early Tfh cell differentiation upon LCMV infection (Figure 4A, E). We also determined the effect of PDK1 on Tfh cells at late stage via tamoxifen induced deletion model (Figure 4F-I). We found PDK1 deficiency influences Tfh cell differentiation and expansion at both initiation and late maintenance. In addition, by performing GSEA analysis with mTORC1/mTORC2-dependent gene sets, we found PDK1 had a similar gene regulation pattern with both mTORC1 and mTORC2. Our results thus demonstrated ICOS-PDK1mTORC1/mTORC2 signaling is essential for Tfh cell differentiation during the entire process.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>In the manuscript by Sun et al., the authors describe a cell intrinsic role for PDK1 in Tfh cell differentiation in the context of LCMV infection.

There are several alterations which would add further clarity to the manuscript before publication.</p><p>1) For all flow cytometry figures, it would be helpful in the figure legends to explain what gates were used. For example in Figure 1C and E, figure legends state analysis is from spleens, are the authors pre-gating on CD4<sup>+</sup> cells? Please add this detail for all flow figures.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this suggestion. The strategies for identification of Th1 cells are CD4<sup>+</sup>CD44<sup>+</sup>CXCR5<sup>-</sup>, Tfh cells are CD4<sup>+</sup>CD44<sup>+</sup>CXCR5<sup>+</sup>, GC Tfh cells are CD4<sup>+</sup>CD44<sup>+</sup>CD62LCXCR5<sup>+</sup>PD-1<sup>hi</sup> or Bcl<sup>-</sup>6<sup>hi</sup>, respectively. As requested, we supplemented the figure legends in relative parts and modified our statement in the Results section as well. The figure legend of Figure 1C and E were modified as follow: “Flow cytometry analysis of CDC44<sup>+</sup>CXCR5<sup>+</sup> Tfh cells and CD44<sup>+</sup>CXCR5<sup>-</sup> Th1 cells gated on total CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells (top panel), or PD-1<sup>hi</sup>CXCR5<sup>+</sup> GC Tfh cells (middle panel) and Bcl<sup>-</sup>6<sup>hi</sup>CXCR5<sup>+</sup> GC Tfh cells (bottom panel) gated on CD44<sup>+</sup>CD62L<sup>-</sup> CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells from spleens of WT and <italic>Pdk1</italic><sup>fl/fl</sup><italic>Cd4</italic>-Cre mice on 8 <italic>dpi</italic>” and “Expression of PD-1, ICOS, and Bcl6 on Tfh cells (CD4<sup>+</sup>CD44<sup>+</sup>CXCR5<sup>+</sup>) was analyzed by flow cytometry”, respectively.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) In Figure 3 for RNAseq, the authors state that Tfh cells were sorted from WT and PDK1-KO mice, but do not explain what the sorting strategy is for gating. This should be clearly explained in the text and figure legends, as according to Figure 1, it is not clear how Tfh's would be isolated as there are very few present.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this kind suggestion and apologized for our insufficient description in original manuscript. The sorting strategy is SLAM<sup>-</sup> subset of CD4<sup>+</sup>CD44<sup>high</sup>CD62L<sup>low</sup> cells and the gate from WT Tfh cells was directly applied for PDK1-deficient samples. Even though the cells in this population from PDK1-deficient mice are composed of defective Tfh cells, it had the potential of differentiation towards Tfh cell. Therefore, the RNA-seq data in this population would be appropriate to reflect the differentially expressed gene (DEGs) in Tfh cells between WT and PDK1-deficient mice.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) In Figure 3C, GSEA plot, please add the Normalized enrichment score (NES), p value and FDR to the figure.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this kind suggestion and apologized for our incomplete figure presentation. As requested, we add the NES, p value and FDR to all GSEA plots. Since we supplemented a series of new data, we reorganized our figures in the revised manuscript and the original Figure 3C is the current Figure 5C.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) What percent of the SMARTA cells given TCF-1 expressing RV were successfully transduced? Can the authors confirm overexpression of TCF-1?</p></disp-quote><p>We understand the reviewer’s concern. As requested, we showed the contour plot exhibited the efficiency of TCF1 transduction (GFP<sup>+</sup>) as follows (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig2">Author response image 2</xref>). Besides, we also sorted GFP<sup>+</sup> donor cells and confirmed TCF1 overexpression by qPCR (Figure 6—figure supplement 1B). In addition, we also exhibited and confirmed the overexpression of STAT3, CXCR5 and Bcl<sup>-</sup>6 (Figure 6—figure supplement 1B and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig2">Author response image 2</xref>).</p><fig id="sa2fig2"><label>Author response image 2.</label><caption><title>Analysis of transduction efficiency.</title></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-61406-resp-fig2-v1.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) If possible, the outlier dots in all 2D flow plots are a bit small and could be bigger to make it easier to see them.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this kind suggestion and apologized for our imperfect figure presentation in initial submission. We guessed that the figure mentioned by the reviewer might be original Figure 2B instead of 2D (a representative flow figure), which reflected the defects in Tfh cell differentiation from PDK1-deficient donors in BM chimeric mice. Considering all the contour figures exhibiting with small size outlets, we respectfully ask the reviewer for understanding that we would like to keep the contour figure with small outlets to ensure consistent format for all the contour figures in entire paper. We changed the strategy to show the defects in Tfh cell differentiation from both WT and PDK1-deficient donors in order to clearly present the data from BM chimeric mice. The new data were shown in current Figure 3B-G and the conclusion remains consistent with original data presentation.</p><p>We modified the relative section in revised manuscript, accordingly.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>The authors performed LCMV Armstrong infection model to test the effect of T cell Pdk1 on Tfh cell generation. They found that Pdk1 is necessary for Tfh cell generation during acute viral infection. Further, they performed RNA-Seq and the data suggest that PDK1 deficiency resulted decreased Tfh cell transcriptional programming. I have the following comments:</p><p>1) It has been well documented that PDK1 plays a central role in many signal transduction pathways including the activation of Akt and PKC. Through its effects on these kinases, PDK1 is involved in the regulation of a wide variety of processes, including cell proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis. It is appreciated that the authors focus on Tfh cell, however, the general phenotype of the Pdk1 knockout mice need to be mentioned including the effects on T cell homeostasis, initial activation and differentiation of other T cell types (e.g. Is in vivo and/or in vitro differentiation of Th1, Th2 and Th17 cells affected?). The authors need to carefully examine the roles of Pdk1 on T cell homeostasis, proliferation and differentiation.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for raising this constructive suggestion. Indeed, PDK1 is involved in the regulation of a wide variety of processes. It has been reported that PDK1 deficiency blocks T cell development at the DN4 stage, and PDK1 is required for CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell proliferation but not survival of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell (Hinton et al., 2004; Park et al., 2009). PDK1 is also critical for Th2 cytokine IL-4 expression (Nirula et al., 2006). Besides, targeting PDK1 with Ox40-Cre resulted in more IL-4 and IL-17a production, indicating PDK1 deficiency leads to disorder of Th2 and Th17 cell differentiation (Yu et al., 2015).</p><p>To address the concern raised by reviewer, we also checked Th2 and Th17 cells in KLH-immunized mice model (current Figure 2—figure supplement 1). We found both IL-4 and IL-17a production were elevated in PDK1-deficient CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, which were consistent with previous reports. To analyze the effect of PDK1 on Th1 differentiation, we directly analyzed the Th1 subsets in our mice models (current Figure 1C and D; Figure 2A and B). We found PDK1 deficient mice had lower cell numbers of Th1 cells. However, based on the fold-changes in Tfh versus Th1 cells due to PDK1 deficiency, we found that PDK1 deficiency resulted in more severe defects in Tfh cells, implying the specific-role of PDK1 in regulating Tfh differentiation and expansion.</p><p>Collectively, PDK1 is not only essential for a general expansion of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, but also has specific role in Tfh cell differentiation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Although the authors concluded that “Pdk1 as a critical regulator for Tfh cell development”, only one LCMV-Arm model is not enough for this conclusion, the authors need to test the effect of Pdk1 on Tfh cells by using at least another model, such as NP-OVA or KLH immunization.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this kind suggestion. As requested, we examined the Tfh cell differentiation in both <italic>Pdk1</italic><sup>fl/fl</sup><italic>Cd4</italic>-Cre and WT control mice by using KLH immunization. The results reflected that PDK1-deficient CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell has substantial defects towards Tfh cell differentiation upon KLH immunization (Figure 2).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) For the mechanistic study, it will be important to choose early time points (days 2-3) after LCMV infection, to identify primary events, instead of associated consequences after Pdk1 knockout.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this constructive suggestion. As requested, adoptive transfer model was applied to determine the early effect on Tfh cell differentiation (early time point, Day 3). We found the PDK1-deficient CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell has a general expansion defect upon LCMV challenge, especially, more specifically impaired the differentiation of Tfh cells at early stage (Figure 4A-D). The expansion of early Tfh cells was also impaired due to PDK1 deficiency (Figure 4D). In addition， we found the expression of Tfh regulatory genes <italic>Tcf7</italic>, <italic>Bcl6</italic>, <italic>Cxcr5</italic>, and <italic>Pdcd1</italic> was substantially altered (Figure 4E). These data thus suggested PDK1 has indispensable roles during early Tfh differentiation. We believe these data are important to understand the nature of early Tfh differentiation and the PDK1 function during this process. We amended these data and modified the relative description in revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The authors concluded that “TCF1 serves as a critical regulator at downstream of PDK1 in promoting Tfh cell differentiation” and did rescue exp in Figure 4E. Can CXCR5 or Bcl6 overexpression also rescue the defective generation of Tfh cells by Pdk1 knockout?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this constructive suggestion. As requested, we performed the rescue experiments with overexpression of CXCR5 or Bcl6 and we found these two factors can also partially rescue the phenotype of Tfh cell differentiation due to PDK1 deficiency (Figure 6D and E). However, these results are predictable since TCF1 was reported as a key regulator upstream of Bcl6 which is the central regulator for Tfh differentiation (Choi et al., 2015; Wu et al., 2015; Xu et al., 2015). These results collectively suggested that TCF1 is only one of multiple regulators downstream of PDK1 which plays essential roles in Tfh cell differentiation, reflecting PDK1-related gene expression program is complicated during Tfh cell differentiation. Based on these new data, we modified our descriptions in the relative section as well.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) PI3K signals are important for lymphocyte trafficking. Do Pdk1-deficient T cells have defect in migratory response toward CXCL13 or CCL21?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for raising this concern. After we learned relative studies (Hao et al., 2018; Moriyama et al., 2014; Weinstein et al., 2018), we selected CXCL13 (ligand for CXCR5) as a chemokine to detect the migratory response of Tfh cells from both PDK1-deficient and Ctrl mice. The results indicated that PDK1-deficient Tfh cells had significant defects in migratory response toward CXCL13. The results were shown in Figure 1G.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) An important effect of Tfh cell function is the induction of germinal center. Do Pdk1 knockout mice have reduced germinal center phenotypes?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer for this concern. Given the substantial defects in GC B cells and plasma cells were detected via surface staining (current Figure 1H and I), we presumed that PDK1 knockout mice have reduced germinal center. To confirm this point, we performed immunochemical staining in spleen section of mice on Day 8 post infection. The substantial defects in the germinal center formation were exhibited in PDK1 deficient mice (Figure 1J). These data collectively reflect PDK1 deficiency impaired Tfh cell differentiation and resulted in the reduced germinal center phenotypes. We modified the relative part in main text as well.</p></body></sub-article></article>
