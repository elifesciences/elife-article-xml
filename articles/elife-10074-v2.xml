In some tissues, one gene copy may be switched off—through a process called ‘genomic imprinting’—while the other copy remains active. In plants, genomic imprinting is vital for seeds to develop normally. It is particularly important in the tissue that provides nutrients for the growing embryo (the endosperm), in which one of the copies of many genes are switched off. Genes inherited from the male parent that have been imprinted are known as paternally expressed imprinted genes (<italic>PEGs</italic>).</p><p>Unlike most animals, it is common for plants to have more than two sets of chromosomes. When plants with different numbers of chromosome sets cross-fertilize each other, their offspring may have three copies of every gene instead of two. These ‘triploid’ seeds often die because their endosperm fails to develop normally. This is due to the increased activity of imprinted genes, which causes changes in the activity of many other genes in the endosperm. Although it is known that genomic imprinting in the endosperm helps to establish this reproductive barrier, it is not clear what specific roles many of the imprinted genes play.</p><p>Here, Wolff et al. switched off several different <italic>PEGs</italic> in the plant <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> to investigate how they affect seed development. The experiments show that in seeds that have the normal two copies of every gene, inactivating these imprinted genes does not affect seed development. However, in triploid seeds, inactivating three of the imprinted genes rescues seeds that would normally die. These genes encode proteins that activate pathways in the endosperm that promote the formation of cell walls, which is a crucial stage in seed development.</p><p>Wolff et al.'s findings reveal how imprinted genes in the endosperm establish a barrier to reproduction by preventing seeds produced from crosses between plants with different numbers of chromosome sets from being able to survive. Reproductive barriers are a major obstacle in plant breeding, so understanding how these barriers form may open new avenues for developing new plant varieties.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.10074.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.10074.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>genomic imprinting</kwd><kwd>hybridization barrier</kwd><kwd>seed development</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>A. thaliana</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000781</institution-id><institution>European Research Council (ERC)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ERC-2011-StG - 280496</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Köhler</surname><given-names>Claudia</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004359</institution-id><institution>Vetenskapsrådet (Swedish Research Council)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2014-3820</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Köhler</surname><given-names>Claudia</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004063</institution-id><institution>Knut och Alice Wallenbergs Stiftelse (Knut and Alice Wallenberg Foundation)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Köhler</surname><given-names>Claudia</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004200</institution-id><institution>Stiftelsen Olle Engkvist Byggmästare</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Köhler</surname><given-names>Claudia</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.3</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Hybridization barriers in <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> can be established by paternally expressed imprinted genes (PEGs) that affect cellularization of the endosperm during seed development.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Genomic imprinting is an epigenetic phenomenon occurring in mammals and flowering plants that leads to parent-of-origin specific differential expression of maternally and paternally inherited alleles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gehring, 2013</xref>). Recent screening of the seed transcriptome in various plant species revealed dozens to several hundreds of novel candidate imprinted genes in maize, rice, castor bean, and <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gehring et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hsieh et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Luo et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Waters et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Wolff et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Pignatta et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Xu et al., 2014</xref>). While few reports demonstrate genes to be temporally imprinted in the plant embryo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Jahnke and Scholten, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Raissig et al., 2013</xref>), the vast majority of imprinted genes has been observed in the endosperm, the ephemeral triploid tissue derived after fertilization of the diploid central cell with a haploid sperm cell. In most angiosperms the endosperm initially develops as a syncytium and cellularizes after a defined number of mitotic divisions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Li and Berger, 2012</xref>). The right timing of endosperm cellularization is crucial for proper seed development, its failure results in deficient nutrient supply, which causes embryo arrest and eventually seed abortion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hehenberger et al., 2012</xref>). In <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, endosperm cellularization is regulated by, among others, the type I MADS-box transcription factor AGL62. Loss of <italic>AGL62</italic> leads to precocious endosperm cellularization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kang et al., 2008</xref>), whereas increased <italic>AGL62</italic> expression correlates with delayed or failed cellularization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Erilova et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Tiwari et al., 2010</xref>). Similar effects on endosperm development have been observed in response to interploidy hybridizations. While maternal excess hybridizations cause precocious endosperm cellularization and reduced seed size, the reciprocal cross leads to endosperm cellularization failure and seed abortion in an accession-dependent frequency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Scott et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dilkes et al., 2008</xref>). This phenomenon establishes a postzygotic reproductive barrier by preventing the formation of viable triploid seeds and has been termed ‘triploid block’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Marks, 1966</xref>). Dosage-sensitivity of the endosperm has been proposed to be a consequence of deregulated imprinted genes that are responsible for interploidy hybridization failure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Haig and Westoby, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gutierrez-Marcos et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kinoshita, 2007</xref>). Indeed, in response to interploidy hybridizations many imprinted genes are deregulated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Jullien and Berger, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Tiwari et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Wolff et al., 2011</xref>) and the paternally expressed imprinted gene <italic>ADMETOS</italic> (<italic>ADM</italic>) has been identified to be a causative gene responsible for abortion of triploid seeds upon paternal excess hybridizations in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kradolfer et al., 2013</xref>). While the identification of <italic>ADM</italic> provided first evidence that imprinted genes can establish reproductive barriers, the question whether this is a more general phenomenon applying to other imprinted genes as well, remained unresolved.</p><p>In this study we investigated the functional role of 15 <italic>PEGs</italic> during seed development in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>. None of the analyzed <italic>peg</italic> mutants caused qualitative or quantitative abnormalities of diploid seed development, revealing that many <italic>PEGs</italic> do either not have an important functional role in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> seeds or act redundantly with non-imprinted genes. However, 3 out of ten tested <italic>peg</italic> mutants rescued triploid seed abortion, uncovering a major role of <italic>PEGs</italic> in establishing postzygotic interploidy hybridization barriers.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results|discussion"><title>Results and discussion</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Impaired <italic>PEG</italic> function does not impact on diploid seed development</title><p>Genomic imprinting has been proposed to have a major impact on seed development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Haig and Westoby, 1989</xref>). We tested this hypothesis by investigating whether loss of <italic>PEG</italic> function would negatively impact on seed development and viability. We examined 15 <italic>PEGs</italic> that were shown to be imprinted at 4 days after pollination (DAP) in reciprocal crosses between Col and Bur-0 accessions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Wolff et al., 2011</xref>).

Due to the lack of small nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) for <italic>PEG1, PEG9,</italic> and <italic>PKR2</italic> we only tested the imprinting status of the 6 remaining <italic>PEGs</italic> in reciprocal crosses of Col and L<italic>er</italic> accessions at 4 DAP. Parent-of-origin specific expression could be detected for all the genes tested (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>), revealing that all tested <italic>PEGs</italic> are consistently imprinted in different accessions.</p><p>To analyze the functional role of <italic>PEGs</italic> during seed development, we obtained T-DNA insertion mutants for all genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). We tested the mRNA levels in all mutants that were not yet previously investigated and found them strongly reduced compared to wild type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). Nevertheless, none of the analyzed mutants had increased levels of unfertilized ovules or seed abortion compared to wild-type plants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) and neither transmission through the male gametophyte was significantly impaired (Chi–Square test, 1:1 segregation hypothesis; p &gt; 0.3) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>). We investigated the possibility that <italic>PEGs</italic> have a positive impact on seed size by pollinating wild-type plants with pollen from heterozygous <italic>peg</italic> mutants and analyzed the size of mature seeds. This analysis revealed that there was no significant (<italic>F</italic>-test; α = 0.01) difference between wild-type and <italic>peg/+</italic> mutant seeds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). We furthermore tested the possibility whether PEG function could have a more prominent effect when fitness of the maternal parent was compromised. We completely removed rosette leaves of Col mother plants 2 days prior to emasculation and repeated the crosses with <italic>peg/+</italic> mutants. In agreement with a previous report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Akiyama and Agren, 2012</xref>), substantial loss of source tissue caused a reduction of seed number in the majority of crosses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5</xref>).

We tested whether rescue of triploid seed viability by <italic>suvh7</italic>, <italic>peg2</italic> and <italic>peg9</italic> was associated with restored endosperm cellularization. While the endosperm of triploid seeds was completely uncellularized at 8 DAP, endosperm cellularization in triploid <italic>suvh7</italic>, <italic>peg2</italic> and <italic>peg9</italic> seeds was almost complete at 8 DAP; only the over-proliferated chalazal cyst remained uncellularized (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>).

Consistently, embryos of <italic>peg2</italic>, <italic>peg9</italic>, and <italic>suvh7</italic> triploid seeds developed, albeit delayed compared to wild-type diploid embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>).</p><p>Triploid seed rescue by <italic>adm</italic> is associated with strongly decreased mRNA levels of type I <italic>AGAMOUS-LIKE</italic> MADS-box genes (<italic>AGLs</italic>) as well as <italic>PEGs</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kradolfer et al., 2013</xref>). To test whether triploid rescue is generally connected with decreased expression of <italic>AGLs</italic> and <italic>PEGs</italic>, we generated whole-genome transcriptome data of seeds from triploid <italic>adm</italic>, <italic>suvh7</italic> and <italic>peg2</italic> mutants and analyzed expression of <italic>AGLs</italic> and <italic>PEGs</italic> that had increased mRNA levels in triploid seeds.

Strikingly, while <italic>peg2</italic> had the strongest effect on triploid seed rescue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>), the effect on gene expression was weakest among the three mutants.

This suggests that <italic>peg2</italic>-mediated triploid seed rescue occurs independently of normalized <italic>AGL</italic> and <italic>PEG</italic> expression and may affect a pathway downstream of either <italic>AGLs</italic> or <italic>PEGs</italic>. In support of this view, most genes down-regulated in triploid <italic>peg2</italic> seeds were similarly down-regulated in triploid <italic>adm</italic> and <italic>suvh7</italic> seeds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Figure 3—source data 1</xref>), suggesting that all three mutants affect a common downstream pathway. Genes commonly down-regulated in all three mutants were significantly enriched for genes involved in carbohydrate metabolism and in particular genes encoding for polygalacturonases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). Polygalacturonan is the backbone of the major primary cell wall component pectin, which is degraded by polygalacturonases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Atmodjo et al., 2013</xref>). Pectin degradation is assumed to be a key step in the deconstruction of plant cell walls (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Xiao et al., 2014</xref>), therefore suppression of pectin hydrolysis in <italic>adm</italic>, <italic>suvh7</italic>, <italic>peg2</italic>, and <italic>peg9</italic> may be the key mechanism to induce endosperm cellularization and restore triploid seed viability.

Of those, 33 genes were upregulated in triploid seeds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). In contrast, expression of pectin biosynthesis genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Atmodjo et al., 2013</xref>) was not negatively affected in triploid seeds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>), suggesting that pectin degradation rather than pectin biosynthesis is disturbed in triploid seeds. Most of the 33 pectin degradation genes remained repressed until the heart stage of embryo development in wild-type seeds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>) and became expressed at the cotyledon stage of embryo development, concomitantly with endosperm degradation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). In concordance with restored endosperm cellularization in triploid <italic>peg</italic> mutants, expression of 27 out of 33 pectin degradation genes that were upregulated in triploid seeds was normalized in at least one of the <italic>peg</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). Pectins are polymerized and methylesterified in the golgi and secreted into the cell wall as highly methylesterified forms. Subsequently, they can be modified by pectinases such as pectin methylesterases that catalyse the demethylesterification of homogalacturonans releasing acidic pectins, which can be visualized by ruthenium red binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Downie et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Micheli, 2001</xref>). Before endosperm cellularization, the ruthenium red signal was similar between diploid and triploid seeds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>), suggesting that there were no major differences in pectin synthesis and degradation between diploid and triploid seeds.

Consistent with the expression of genes encoding for pectin degrading enzymes in 6 DAP triploid seeds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>), the ruthenium red signal in the uncellularized endosperm at 6 DAP seeds was substantially weaker compared to the signal in 4DAP seeds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.10074.016</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Analysis of pectin biosynthesis and degradation genes in diploid and triploid seeds.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Venn diagram showing overlap of pectin degradation genes and genes being upregulated in seeds derived from wild type x <italic>osd1</italic> crosses (signal log ratio [SLR] &gt; 1, p &lt; 0.05) and genes being downregulated in either wild type x <italic>adm-2 osd1</italic> (SLR &lt; −1, p &lt; 0.05), wild type x <italic>suvh7-1 osd1</italic> (SLR &lt; −1, p &lt; 0.05), or wild type x <italic>peg2 osd1</italic> (SLR &lt; −1, p &lt; 0.05).

The previous decision letter after peer review is shown below.]</p><p>Thank you for choosing to send your work entitled “Paternally expressed imprinted genes establish postzygotic hybridization barriers in <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana”</italic> for consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your full submission has been evaluated by Detlef Weigel (Senior Editor) and two peer reviewers, and the decision was reached after discussions between the reviewers. Based on our discussions and the individual reviews below, we regret to inform you that your work cannot be considered for publication in <italic>eLife</italic> at this time.</p><p>There was agreement that the manuscript reports on an interesting topic, and that it is a nice extension of your recent paper in Developmental Cell. The reviewers were excited about the possibility that <italic>PEGs</italic> converge on pectin degradation and thereby overcome the triploid block. Unfortunately, it is currently unclear where and how the <italic>PEGs</italic> converge to affect pectin degradation genes, whether pectin degradation is indeed altered, and whether the changes in expression of pectin degradation genes are cause or consequence of the suppression of the triploid block. Furthermore, there is only weak support for the claim that, in agreement with parental conflict theory, <italic>PEGs</italic> function as growth regulators. If these <italic>PEGs</italic> functioned as positive regulators of embryo growth during parental conflict, would one not expect <italic>PEG</italic> mutations to have paternal effects on embryo growth (i.e. reduced resources/growth of embryos)?</p><p>We would be willing to reconsider as a new submission a manuscript that directly shows altered pectin degradation, and demonstrates that this is the direct cause of triploid block suppression.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>The dosage effect of imprinted genes has been associated with postzygotic hybridization barriers in the endosperm. A paternally imprinted gene in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, <italic>ADMETOS</italic> (<italic>ADM</italic>), influences endosperm cellularization and contributes to seed abortion in interploidy crosses, a phenomenon known as the triploid block. In this manuscript, the authors show that three additional paternally imprinted genes contribute to the triploid block. They hypothesise that the triploid block is circumvented by the suppression of pectin degradation. The identification of four imprinted genes that contribute to the triploid block in plants gives important insight into this developmental process and it is potentially influential to the field of imprinting.</p><p>Although I potentially support the publication of the present research, my main concern is that the effect of the mutations on the three imprinted genes is not fully understood and thus their precise role in triploid block remains unknown.</p><p>1) It is unclear why only one mutant allele of <italic>SUVH7</italic>, <italic>PEG2</italic> and <italic>PEG9</italic> was tested in the interploidy analysis. To avoid any misinterpretation of phenotypes, two independent mutant alleles for each gene should be tested.</p><p>2) The authors postulate that suppression of pectin hydrolysis by <italic>PEGs</italic> could be the mechanism that restores triploid viability. However, this is highly speculative especially considering that the precise functions of three of the <italic>PEGs</italic> remain known.</p><p>3) I do not see how the data support the conclusion that <italic>PEGs</italic> function as growth regulators and that this agrees with the predictions of the parental conflict theory.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>In this manuscript, the authors investigated the functional roles of 15 <italic>PEGs</italic> during <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> seed development. Although they did not find obvious functions of these genes in wild-type seeds, clever genetic experiments revealed that at least three <italic>PEGs</italic> are required for the so-called triploid block, a post-zygotic reproductive barrier that originates in the endosperm. These results substantiate their earlier findings that imprinted genes, such as <italic>ADM</italic>, can establish post-zygotic hybridization barriers and thus may be key speciation genes. However, they do not establish a strong connection between their genetic results and expression analyses. If the authors want to make the claim summarized in the second to last sentence in the Abstract, then more work is needed with either existing resources or new experiments. That is, while the pathways appear to converge on genes that decrease pectin degradation, which may increase cellularization and subsequent embryo viability, it is impossible to evaluate how likely this is a cause or correlation based on the presented data. Overall, I agree that this work advances the understanding of the functional roles of imprinted genes in plants, but think more could be presented to get an idea of the underlying molecular mechanism.</p><p>At the very least, the authors should give more information relating to the hypothesis that suppression of pectin degradation in the triploid <italic>PEG</italic> mutants contributes to increased viability. This seems like an important aspect of their manuscript, but GO enrichments of commonly down-regulated genes are not necessarily strong indicators of common functions. For instance, they should mention how many genes were commonly down-regulated in the three triploid mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref> shows 70 but this was only for genes up-regulated in triploid seeds). And they should show the levels of the 18 (?) commonly down-regulated genes suggested to be involved in pectin degradation (18 based on <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3–figure supplement 1</xref>, but perhaps some of these may be overlapping?) in wild-type, triploid and triploid <italic>peg</italic> mutant backgrounds. It would be interesting to see the transcript levels of these pectin degradation genes in wild-type endosperm and these should be available from the microarray datasets generated by the Harada and Goldberg labs (Belmonte (2013) PNAS). Finally, they should stain the triploid seeds/endosperm (and controls) with a pectin dye such as Ruthenium Red to test for decreased pectin levels at multiple time points prior to cellularization. This may address whether decreased pectin is a cause or consequence of increased cellularization in the triploid mutants.</p><p>[Editors’ note: what now follows is the decision letter after the authors submitted for further consideration.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your work entitled “Paternally expressed imprinted genes establish postzygotic hybridization barriers in <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana”</italic> for peer review at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your submission has been favorably evaluated by Detlef Weigel (Senior Editor) and two reviewers.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>As you will see, both reviewers agree that this manuscript has substantially improved. One of the reviewers asked for Ruthenium Red staining of the 3n <italic>peg</italic> mutants. I had asked you about this, and the reviewers and I have discussed your response. We understand that the reciprocal link between cellularization and PME activity makes it difficult to properly interpret Ruthenium Red staining.

In this manuscript, the authors suggest that <italic>PEGs</italic> can contribute to the triploid block by promoting pectin degradation and thus increasing endosperm cellularization and subsequent seed viability. The use of multiple alleles, or complementation, and more detailed expression analyses builds a solid case for their hypothesis. The Ruthenium Red staining is also consistent with their hypothesis, although it is difficult to interpret staining patterns/intensities between cellularized and uncellularized endosperm. Nevertheless, this manuscript advances the understanding of imprinted gene functions in plants and unveils a mechanism by which this can occur.</p><p>The authors should perform Ruthenium Red staining on the 3n <italic>peg</italic> mutants (e.g. 3n <italic>adm-2</italic>, 3n <italic>suv7-1</italic>, 3n <italic>peg2</italic>) to check whether pectin degradation defects are rescued by mutating <italic>PEGs</italic>.</p><p><italic>Minor comments:</italic></p><p>1) Remove or reword the last sentence of the Results/Discussion.

We furthermore have included data for additional alleles of those mutants that suppress triploid seed abortion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2–figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p>Our manuscript addresses an open question in the imprinting field concerning the functional role of imprinted genes during plant development. Recent genome-wide efforts discovered dozens to several hundreds of imprinted genes in various plant species; however, our understanding of the functional role of imprinted genes remained sparse. In this study we tested whether paternally expressed imprinted genes (<italic>PEGs</italic>) have a functional role during seed development in <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>. We report that loss of function of 15 <italic>PEGs</italic> did not impair seed development and neither caused a quantitative effect on seed size. Strikingly however, we identified three <italic>PEGs</italic> that establish postzygotic hybridization barriers, preventing successful hybridizations of plants that differ in ploidy. Therefore, together with the previously identified <italic>PEG ADM,</italic> we have discovered four <italic>PEGs</italic> in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> that establish barriers to interploidy 2 hybridizations, revealing that PEGs have a major role as speciation genes in plants. Based on genome-wide transcriptome studies of three <italic>peg</italic> mutants we reveal that bypass of the hybridization barrier likely occurs by different mechanisms that converge on suppression of endosperm cell wall formation by suppressing pectin degradation. Collectively, our work reveals that a subset of <italic>PEGs</italic> maintains functional roles in the inbreeding plant <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> that become evident upon deregulated expression. We strongly believe that our results are of general interest to a broad public.</p><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p><italic>[…] Although I potentially support the publication of the present research, my main concern is that the effect of the mutations on the three imprinted genes is not fully understood and thus their precise role in triploid block remains unknown</italic>.</p><p><italic>1) It is unclear why only one mutant allele of</italic> SUVH7<italic>,</italic> PEG2 <italic>and</italic> PEG9 <italic>was tested in the interploidy analysis. To avoid any misinterpretation of phenotypes, two independent mutant alleles for each gene should be tested</italic>.</p><p>We agree with this concern and included the analysis of additional alleles for <italic>suvh7</italic> and <italic>peg9</italic>. As for <italic>peg2</italic> no additional alleles were available, we complemented the <italic>peg2</italic> mutant using a genomic construct. Data are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2–figure supplement 2</xref>.</p><p><italic>2) The authors postulate that suppression of pectin hydrolysis by</italic> PEGs <italic>could be the mechanism that restores triploid viability. However, this is highly speculative especially considering that the precise functions of three of the</italic> PEGs <italic>remain known</italic>.</p><p>We addressed this concern by including additional data on the regulation of pectin biosynthesis and pectin degradation gene expression as well as pectin levels in diploid and triploid seeds in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>. These data show that pectin degradation genes are significantly upregulated in triploid seeds and suppressed by mutations in <italic>PEG</italic> genes. We furthermore show that those pectin degradation genes that become upregulated in triploid seeds are expressed in the endosperm of wild-type seeds at the time of endosperm breakdown, supporting their role in pectin degradation in the endosperm. We finally show that 6 DAP triploid seeds have reduced levels of de-esterified pectins, in agreement with increased activity of pectin degradation enzymes that use de-esterified pectins as substrates.</p><p><italic>3) I do not see how the data support the conclusion that</italic> PEGs <italic>function as growth regulators and that this agrees with the predictions of the parental conflict theory</italic>.</p><p>We have deleted this part of the manuscript.</p><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p><italic>In this manuscript, the authors investigated the functional roles of 15</italic> PEGs <italic>during</italic> Arabidopsis <italic>seed development. Although they did not find obvious functions of these genes in wild-type seeds, clever genetic experiments revealed that at least three</italic> PEGs <italic>are required for the so-called triploid block, a post-zygotic reproductive barrier that originates in the endosperm. These results substantiate their earlier findings that imprinted genes, such as</italic> ADM<italic>, can establish post-zygotic hybridization barriers and thus may be key speciation genes. However, they do not establish a strong connection between their genetic results and expression analyses. If the authors want to make the claim summarized in the second to last sentence in the Abstract, then more work is needed with either existing resources or new experiments.</italic></p><p>We have added new data supporting that <italic>PEGs</italic> directly or indirectly regulate pectin degradation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). We nevertheless have removed this part from the Abstract, as this is not the major point of this manuscript, which we rather find in the fact that many <italic>PEGs</italic> build hybridization barriers. This finding is novel and in our view worth reporting.</p><p><italic>That is, while the pathways appear to converge on genes that decrease pectin degradation, which may increase cellularization and subsequent embryo viability, it is impossible to evaluate how likely this is a cause or correlation based on the presented data. Overall, I agree that this work advances the understanding of the functional roles of imprinted genes in plants, but think more could be presented to get an idea of the underlying molecular mechanism</italic>.</p><p>We have addressed this concern; please see our comment 2 to reviewer1.</p><p><italic>At the very least, the authors should give more information relating to the hypothesis that suppression of pectin degradation in the triploid</italic> PEG <italic>mutants contributes to increased viability. This seems like an important aspect of their manuscript, but GO enrichments of commonly down-regulated genes are not necessarily strong indicators of common functions. For instance, they should mention how many genes were commonly down-regulated in the three triploid mutants (</italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3"><italic>Figure 3C</italic></xref> <italic>shows 70 but this was only for genes up-regulated in triploid seeds).
