initiate the response is not known. The serine/threonine phosphatase RsbU initiates the General Stress Response in <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> upon binding a partner protein (RsbT) that is released from sequestration by environmental stresses. We report that RsbT activates RsbU by inducing otherwise flexible linkers of RsbU to form a short coiled-coil that dimerizes and activates the phosphatase domains. Importantly, we present evidence that related coiled-coil linkers and phosphatase dimers transduce signals from diverse sensor domains to control the General Stress Response and other signaling across bacterial phyla. This coiled-coil linker transduction mechanism additionally suggests a resolution to the mystery of how shared sensory domains control serine/threonine phosphatases, diguanylate cyclases and histidine kinases. We propose that this provides bacteria with a modularly exchangeable toolkit for the evolution of diverse signaling pathways.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>PPM phosphatase</kwd><kwd>sigma factor</kwd><kwd>stress response</kwd><kwd>coiled coil</kwd><kwd>SAXS</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>B. subtilis</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100007864</institution-id><institution>Brandeis University</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Startup Funds</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bradshaw</surname><given-names>Niels</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>T32 GM135126</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Baral</surname><given-names>Rishika</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>T32 GM007122</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Caban-Penix</surname><given-names>Suhaily</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P30 GM138395</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hopkins</surname><given-names>Jesse B</given-names></name><name><surname>Watkins</surname><given-names>Maxwell B</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A coiled-coil-based transduction mechanism is identified for a serine/threonine phosphatase that controls a bacterial stress response, suggesting that phosphatases are part of a modularly exchangeable toolkit for bacterial signaling.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The General Stress Response (GSR) allows bacteria to survive in hostile and changing environments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bergkessel et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Harms et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gottesman, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Guldimann et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hecker et al., 2007</xref>). A defining feature of the GSR is that it controls transcription of a large and diverse set of genes, dramatically reshaping the physiology of the organism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gottesman, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Guerreiro et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Boekhoud et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Boylan et al., 1993</xref>). Another defining feature is that the GSR is induced by a variety of stress conditions that are frequently associated with each other, including stationary phase, nutrient depletion, cellular damage, and (for pathogens) host defense mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gottesman, 2019</xref>). This multiplicity of initiating conditions allows cells to anticipate and prepare for accumulating adversity, suggesting why the GSR is present in every bacterial species that has so far been analyzed. The GSR additionally contributes to pathogenesis through expression of genes controlling virulence, biofilm formation, and quorum sensing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kint et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Battesti et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bartolini et al., 2019</xref>). Inactivation of the GSR, in turn, promotes the transition to long-term slow growth and antibiotic resistance, which are particularly important for persistent infections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Tuchscherr and LÃ¶ffler, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Herbert et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bergkessel et al., 2016</xref>). Thus, deciphering the mechanisms that govern GSR activity is critical to understanding how bacteria interact with and adapt to their environments.</p><p>A major barrier to understanding initiation of the GSR is that we lack a unique, generalizable mechanistic model for how the activating signaling proteins have evolved to respond to species-specific signals. In a widespread mechanism for initiating the GSR, a member of the PPM family of serine/threonine phosphatases dephosphorylates a phosphorylated substrate protein to activate an alternative Ï-factor through a âpartner-switchingâ mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hecker et al., 2007</xref>), but how the phosphatase receives and is activated by an upstream signal has not been determined.</p><p>In this study, we address how the GSR phosphatase RsbU from <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> is regulated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Yang et al., 1996</xref>) and present evidence that this mechanism is widely conserved. RsbU dephosphorylates a single phospho-serine on its substrate protein (RsbV) to release the GSR transcription factor (Ï<sup>B</sup>) from inhibition by an anti-sigma factor (RsbW; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). RsbU has an N-terminal four-helix bundle domain that dimerizes RsbU and is also the binding site for RsbT, which activates RsbU as a phosphatase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C and D</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Delumeau et al., 2004</xref>). RsbT is sequestered in a megadalton stress sensing complex called the stressosome, and is released to bind RsbU in response to specific stress signals including ethanol, heat, acid, salt, and blue light (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hecker et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Marles-Wright et al., 2008</xref>).

These signaling domains are frequently found as N-terminal regulators of histidine kinases and GGDEF diguanylate cyclases in bacteria, but whether or not there are shared mechanistic features between the regulatory principles of PPM phosphatases and these other signaling effector families is not known (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">MÃ¶glich et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Galperin, 2006</xref>).</p><p>We previously described a mechanism for allosteric control of the related <italic>B. subtilis</italic> phosphatase SpoIIE, which regulates endospore formation through a partner-switching mechanism analogous to RsbU control of the GSR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Ho and Bradshaw, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bradshaw et al., 2017</xref>). Two helices of the PPM domain (Î±1 and Î±2), which we refer to as the switch element, change conformation to recruit metal cofactor and activate SpoIIE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bradshaw et al., 2017</xref>). Based on analysis of structural and genetic data, we conjectured that this conformational change exemplifies a common mechanism among diverse phosphatases. However, we could not propose a specific model for how unrelated regulatory domains modularly control the switch conformation. For RsbU, we found that RsbT enhances phosphatase activity by increasing the efficacy of metal cofactor binding and that substitution of an amino acid in Î±1 (RsbU<sup>M166V/L</sup>) activates RsbU in the absence of RsbT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Ho and Bradshaw, 2021</xref>).

vs. q) was a poor fit (Ï<sup>2</sup> 12.53) to a profile calculated from the AlphaFold2 model of an RsbU dimer using FoXS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Schneidman-Duhovny et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Schneidman-Duhovny et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). We therefore assessed the SAXS data for the RsbU dimer for features that report on flexibility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kikhney and Svergun, 2015</xref>). First, the scattering intensity data lacked distinct features caused by the multi-domain structure of RsbU from the AlphaFold2 model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). This can be visualized more readily from a dimensionless Kratky plot, which is bell-shaped and peaks above 1.3, indicating that the RsbU dimer is non-globular (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). Additionally, the data do not show the two peaks from the FoXS computed model of the AlphaFold2 dimer that reflect the extended two domain structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kikhney and Svergun, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Receveur-Brechot and Durand, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4âfigure supplement 2</xref>). The scattering data had several additional characteristic features indicating flexibility: the P(r) plot is smooth and has an extended tail (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cordeiro et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kikhney and Svergun, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Receveur-Brechot and Durand, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>), R<sub>g</sub> and I(0) calculated from P(r) are larger than when calculated from Guinier fits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cordeiro et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kikhney and Svergun, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Receveur-Brechot and Durand, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>), molecular weight calculated using the MoW2 modified Porod volume method is an overestimate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Rambo and Tainer, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>), and the R<sub>g</sub> (39.05Â±0.16 Ã) was larger than the R<sub>g</sub> of the AlphaFold2 dimer model (34.05 Ã). Prompted by this evidence of flexibility, we performed multi-state modelling using MultiFoXS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Schneidman-Duhovny et al., 2016</xref>), which incorporates flexibility and heterogeneity. MultiFoXS produced a two-state solution with Ï<sup>2</sup> of 1.2 (as compared to the one-state model with Ï<sup>2</sup> of 12.5) and low residuals across the entire range of data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4âfigure supplement 2</xref>). We allowed flexibility for the linker residues 82â96 while keeping the N-terminal domain dimerized because a stable dimer of the N-terminal domain is observed in solution, was present in a previous X-ray crystal structure of C-terminally truncated RsbU{Delumeau:2004ep}, and C-terminally truncated RsbU coelutes as a heterodimer with the full-length protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4âfigure supplement 1</xref>). Importantly, the precise region of allowed linker flexibility does not have a substantial impact on the MultiFoXS fit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4âfigure supplement 3</xref>), but constraining the C-terminal phosphatase domain dimer does not yield a good fit to the data (Ï<sup>2</sup> of 5.4; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4âfigure supplement 3</xref>). The structural models predicted by MultiFoXS depict a dimerized N-terminal domain with flexible linkers and PPM domains that do not make contact. Notably, this approach also would include models in which both domains remain dimerized, suggesting that such models are not the best fit of the data. The two conformations that were selected as the best fit to the scattering data by MultiFoXS also have very different R<sub>g</sub> values, (34.91 Ã [71%] and 45.69 Ã [29%]), indicating RsbU samples a range of conformational space that includes a more compact state(s) consistent with the AlphaFold2 model and a significantly extended state(s), emphasizing that the linker is highly flexible. Together, we conclude that the RsbU linker appears to be flexible in the absence of RsbT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>RsbU linker is flexible in the absence of RsbT, and is rigidified by RsbT binding.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) I(q) versus q plot of the dimer component of SAXS scattering data from RsbU (blue) overlaid with a FoXS generated profile fit of the AlphaFold2 RsbU dimer structure (red).

The RsbT/U<sup>Q94L</sup> complex eluted as a major peak with a higher molecular weight shoulder (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4âfigure supplements 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">4</xref>; also visible when we ran RsbU<sup>Q94L</sup> alone. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4âfigure supplement 1</xref>), with the average molecular weight of the main peak (determined by MALS) of 125 kDa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4âfigure supplement 1</xref>). This is larger than the predicted molecular weight of a heterotetrameric 2RsbT/2RsbU<sup>Q94L</sup> complex (105 kDa), suggesting that some higher order complexes form. EFA deconvolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Meisburger et al., 2016</xref>) identifies two components. The first deconvolved component had a SAXS determined molecular weight of 164 kDa, while the second had a SAXS molecular weight of 103 kDa, consistent with a 2RsbT/2RsbU complex (105 kDa). Together with the fact that RsbT co-elutes with RsbU<sup>Q94L</sup> throughout the entire peak (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4âfigure supplement 1</xref>) and the MALS molecular weight, we assess that this second component is an 2RsbT/2RsbU hetero-tetramer. The identity of the higher molecular weight component of the scattering data is ambiguous, but could represent a larger assembly of RsbT/RsbU<sup>Q94L</sup> or multimers of RsbU<sup>Q94L</sup> that were observed when RsbU<sup>Q94L</sup> was analyzed alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4âfigure supplement 1</xref>). Several lines of evidence demonstrate that the 2RsbT/2RsbU<sup>Q94L</sup> complex lacks the flexibility of the 2RsbU complex. First, the R<sub>g</sub> from the Guiner fit (35.06Â±0.43 Ã) matches well with the model computed from the AlphaFold2 prediction of the heterotetrameric complex of 2RsbT/2RsbU using FoXS (33.68 Ã) and is smaller than the R<sub>g</sub> we observed for the RsbU dimer (39.05Â±0.16 Ã). Second, the features of the scattering data that suggested flexibility for RsbU dimers all suggest that the RsbT/RsbU complex is more rigid (the quality of the FoXS fit, a lower peak of the dimensionless Kratky plot, and a shorter tail of the P(r) plot; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cordeiro et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kikhney and Svergun, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Receveur-Brechot and Durand, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C, E, F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4âfigure supplement 4</xref>). Third, fitting the scattering profile (I(q) vs. q) to the AlphaFold2 model yielded a Ï<sup>2</sup> of 1.83 without requirement for flexibility (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). As expected, based on the lack of evidence of flexibility in the scattering profile and P(r) function, the model is not improved by the use of multi-state modeling by MultiFoXS, which was run as a control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Schneidman-Duhovny et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4âfigure supplement 4</xref>).

Our structural prediction, supported by our genetic and structural data suggest that RsbU linkers assume a crossed Î±-helical conformation that dimerizes the phosphatase domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>).

However, key mechanistic features of the activation mechanisms differ between the two systems. The <italic>E. coli</italic> GSR is initiated by stabilizing the alternative sigma factor Ï<sup>S</sup> (RpoS) against degradation by ClpXP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). Under non-stressed conditions, degradation of Ï<sup>S</sup> is mediated by the adapter protein, RssB, which is inhibited by anti-adaptors (IraD, IraM, and IraP) and stimulated by phosphorylation on its N-terminal response-receiver domain during stress. Historically, the differences between these systems were interpreted to mean that they operate by distinct mechanistic principles. However, RssB contains a C-terminally truncated (and therefore inactive) PPM phosphatase domain, suggesting some aspects of its regulatory mechanism could be shared with RsbU (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Battesti et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Our findings reveal that <italic>E. coli</italic> RssB and <italic>B. subtilis</italic> RsbU use three shared regulatory features to control GSR activation through their distinct downstream mechanisms.

The C-terminal pseudo-phosphatase domain of RssB is joined to its N-terminal Ï<sup>S</sup> binding response-receiver domain by a predominantly Î±-helical linker (termed the segmented helical linker, or SHL) of similar length to the linker of RsbU (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dorich et al., 2019</xref>). The SHL folds to occlude the Ï<sup>S</sup> interacting face of the response-receiver domain when bound to anti-adapters, and is remodeled to promote Ï<sup>S</sup> interaction when the response-receiver domain is phosphorylated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Brugger et al., 2023a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Brugger et al., 2023b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dorich et al., 2019</xref>). Supporting the hypothesis that the SHL is mechanistically related to the RsbU linker, substitution of W143, the homologous residue to Q94 of <italic>B. subtilis</italic> RsbU, blocks regulation by IraD and IraP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Battesti et al., 2013</xref>). Second, the interface between the linker and Î±1 of the phosphatase domain is critical for regulation of both RssB and RsbU (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Brugger et al., 2023a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dorich et al., 2019</xref>).

Third, conformational change of the switch helices (Î±1 and Î±2) of the phosphatase domain is of shared regulatory importance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Battesti et al., 2013</xref>). HDX experiments demonstrate that there is decreased exchange of the Î±1 helix of the pseudo-phosphatase domain of RssB when Ï<sup>S</sup> is bound, suggesting that the conformational dynamics of this region are reduced by substrate recognition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Brugger et al., 2023a</xref>).</p><p>These striking mechanistic similarities between RssB from <italic>E. coli</italic> and RsbU from <italic>B. subtilis</italic> suggest that key regulatory features were conserved when an ancestral phosphatase lost enzymatic activity and became a dedicated adapter protein in <italic>E. coli</italic> and related Î³-proteobacteria.

While not all GSR regulatory mechanisms involve a phosphatase or adapter protein related to RsbU/RssB, these findings suggest that linker-mediated control of a PPM phosphatase is a broadly conserved mechanism for GSR initiation across bacterial phyla.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>An exchangeable toolkit for signal transduction</title><p>Histidine kinases and GGDEF diguanylate cyclases are the two most prevalent families of bacterial signal transduction proteins. A striking feature of their regulatory mechanisms is that they are often active in dimeric complexes that are allosterically controlled by N-terminal regulatory domains that propagate signals through crossing Î±-helical linkers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Zschiedrich et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Randall et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gourinchas et al., 2017</xref>). Our findings that the crossing Î±-helical linkers are structurally similar (Fig. S2C) and that shared regulatory domains (response receiver, HAMP, and PAS domains) connect phosphatase dimers by a coiled-coil linker (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A-C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplement 1</xref>) suggests that this shared allosteric regulatory architecture allows modular exchange of N-terminal domains between PPM phosphatases, histidine kinases, and GGDEF diguanylate cyclases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). In support of this, the RsbU N-terminal domain and RsbT were previously shown to control GGDEF diguanylate cyclase activity in <italic>Moorella thermoacetica</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Quin et al., 2012</xref>), histidine kinases with RsbU N-terminal domains are found in operons with <italic>rsbT</italic> and stressosome genes in some <italic>Proteobacteria</italic> species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Heinz et al., 2022</xref>), and AlphaFold2 prediction of these dimeric complexes reveals coiled-coil linkers to the effector domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5EâF</xref>). Similarly, the PAS/Î±/Î² hydrolase module that controls RsbP phosphatase activity in <italic>B. subtilis</italic> is found coupled to histidine kinases and GGDEF diguanylate cyclases across bacterial phyla (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Nadezhdin et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>While the specific mechanism discovered here for linker control of RsbU activity (flexibility controlled by a binding partner) is distinct from the models for linker control of histidine kinases and GGDEF diguanylate cyclases (piston shift, scissoring, and helical rotation; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Zschiedrich et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Randall et al., 2022</xref>), the shared dimeric architecture suggests that N-terminal regulatory domains could be modularly exchanged across effector domain families (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>). Allosteric control of PPM switch element conformation could theoretically be achieved by piston shift, scissoring, or helical rotation. Future characterization of PPM phosphatases will be required to determine how widespread linker flexibility is as a regulatory mechanism and how modularly sensory domains can be exchanged across signaling effector families.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Protein expression and purification</title><p>All proteins were expressed in <italic>E. coli</italic> BL21 (DE3) cells grown at 37 Â°C to an OD<sub>600</sub> of 0.4 and induced at 16 Â°C for 14â18 hr with 1 mM isopropyl Î²-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) unless otherwise specified.

Plasmids containing <italic>rsbU</italic> or <italic>rsbT/rsbU<sup>Y28I</sup></italic> were subjected to PCR mutagenesis using GoTaq DNA polymerase mix (Promega) supplemented with 2 mM additional MgCl<sub>2</sub>. Pools of mutagenized inserts were assembled into digested plasmid using isothermal (Gibson) assembly and transformed into <italic>E. coli</italic> DH5Î± cells. Mutation rate of approximately one single-nucleotide polymorphism per kilobase of DNA was confirmed by sequencing individual clones. Plasmids were then introduced to <italic>B. subtilis</italic> using natural competence and cells were plated on selective medium containing IPTG and X-gal for two days at 37 Â°C. Blue colonies were selected, restruck on plates with and without IPTG, and plasmids recovered from single colonies that retested as Ï<sup>B</sup> positive were sequenced using Sanger sequencing. For the RsbU<sup>Y28I</sup> suppressor screen, two independent pools of PCR mutagenized plasmid were screened. In addition to the reported variants that were selected, we identified simple revertants that restored Y28 in both pools, and mutations in the promoter and RBS that we predict enhanced protein production. These variants were not studied further. Individual amino acid changing mutations were rebuilt in the parental plasmid using PCR (QuickChange) mutagenesis and the phenotypes were validated by replating on indicator plates. All strains shown in the figures are from these rebuilt plasmids.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>AlphaFold2 structure predictions</title><p>AlphaFold2 predictions were performed using ColabFold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Mirdita et al., 2022</xref>).

While the authors propose that the mechanism may extend to other bacteria, the evidence is largely based on structural modeling rather than direct experimental validation across multiple phyla. Additionally, the phrase &quot;General Stress Response&quot; might imply that the paper broadly explains stress response regulation, but it specifically examines the activation of RsbU by RsbT, which is just one really small part of the broader GSR network. The redundancy in &quot;A General Mechanism for the General Stress Response&quot; could also create an impression of an oversimplified, universal model when stress responses are often species- and context-specific.

The activation of GSR-specific sigma factors is frequently at the heart of the induction of a GSR. Given the range of stresses that can lead to GSR induction, the regulatory inputs are frequently complex. In <italic>B. subtilis</italic>, the stressosome, a multi-protein complex, contains a set of proteins that, upon appropriate stresses, initiate partner switching cascades that free the sigma B sigma factor from an anti-sigma. The focus here is on the mode of activation of RsbU, a serine/threonine phosphatase of the PPM family, leading to sigB activation. RbsT, a component of the degradosome interacts with RsbU upon stress, activating the phosphatase activity. Once active, RsbU dephosphorylates its target (RsbV, an anti-antisigma), which in turn binds the anti-sigma. The conclusion is that flexible linker domains upstream of the phosphatase domain are the target for activation, resulting in a crossed-linker dimeric structure. The authors then use the information on RsbU to suggest that parallel approaches may be used to activate PPM phosphatases for the GSR response in other bacteria.</p><p>Strengths and Weaknesses:</p><p>(1) A strength of the work is the combination of modeling, genetics and biochemical approaches to support the idea that the flexibility of the linker of the RsbU phosphatase is critical to signalling and that this changes as a result of interactions of the signaling protein RsbT.</p><p>(2) The impact of the work, beyond better understanding of this particular signalling system, lies in the suggested parallels with other GSR system regulators in a range of bacteria. The work here provides fairly clear indications of what mutational changes would be most likely to test the model.</p><p>(3) Assuming that these predictions are shown to be correct in future work, that will leave as an intriguing question why this particular geometry has been conserved in GSR - whether they emerge from a common ancestor (found where?) and/or there is some characteristic (flexibility of modulating the response?) that is particularly important for GSR signal input. Coupled with this will be further understanding of how the linker and/or interacting proteins change in different systems.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="referee-report" id="sa3"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.100376.3.sa3</article-id><title-group><article-title>Reviewer #3 (Public review):</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><anonymous/><role specific-use="referee">Reviewer</role></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>Summary:</p><p>The authors present a study building on their previous work on activation of the general stress response phosphatase, RsbU, from <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic>. Using computed structural models of the RsbU dimer the authors map previously identified activating mutations onto the structure and suggest further protein variants to test the role of the predicted linker helix and the interaction with RsbT on the activation of the phosphatase activity.</p><p>Using in vivo and in vitro activity assays, the authors demonstrate that linker variants can constitutively activate RsbU and increase the affinity of the protein for RsbT, thus showing a link between the structure of the linker region and RsbT binding.</p><p>Small angle X-ray scattering experiments on RsbU variants alone, and in complex with RsbT show structural changes consistent with a decreased flexibility of the RsbU protein, which are hypothesised to indicate an disorder-order transition in the linker when RsbT binds. This interpretation of the data is consistent with the biochemical data presented by the authors.</p><p>Further computed structure models are presented for other protein phosphates from different bacterial species and the authors propose a model for phosphatase activation by partner binding. They compare this to the activation mechanisms proposed for histidine kinase two-component systems and GGDEF proteins and suggest the individual domains could be swapped to give a toolkit of modular parts for bacterial signalling.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>The key mutagenesis data is presented with two lines of evidence to demonstrate RsbU activation - in vivo sigma-b activation assays utilising a beta-galactosidase reporter and in vitro activity assays against the RsbV protein, which is the downstream target of RsbU. These data support the hypothesis for RsbT binding to the RsbU linker region as well as the dimerisation domain to activate the RsbU activity.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>Small angle scattering curves are difficult to unambiguously interpret, but the authors present good interpretations that fit with the biochemical data presented. These interpretations should be considered as models for future testing with other methods - hydrogen/deuterium exchange mass spectrometry, would be a good additional method to use, as exchange rates in the linker region would be affected significantly by the disorder/order transition on RsbT binding.</p><p>The interpretation of the computed structure models is provided with a few caveats related to the bias in the models returned by AlphaFold2. For the full-length models of RsbU and other phosphatase proteins, the relationship of the domains to each other is likely to be the least reliable part of the models - this is apparent from the PAE plots shown in supplementary figure 8.</p><p>Comments on revisions:</p><p>The authors have addressed the review comments satisfactorily for this manuscript to stand as a version of record.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="author-comment" id="sa4"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.100376.3.sa4</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author

A challenge of studying flexible proteins is that it is often not possible to directly obtain high resolution structural data. For the case of <italic>B. subtilis</italic> RsbU, the independent experimental approaches we applied (including two unbiased genetic screens, targeted mutagenesis, SAXS, enzymology, and structure prediction, which includes evolutionary coupling) converged upon a model for activation, which we feel is well supported. Frustratingly, our attempts at determining high resolution experimental structures have been unsuccessful, which we think is due to the flexibility of the proteins revealed by our SAXS experiments. For example, we collected X-ray diffraction data from crystals of a fragment of <italic>B. subtilis</italic> RsbU containing the N-terminal domain and linker in which the linker was almost entirely disordered in the maps.

The activation of GSR-specific sigma factors is frequently at the heart of the induction of a GSR. Given the range of stresses that can lead to GSR induction, the regulatory inputs are frequently complex. In <italic>B. subtilis</italic>, the stressosome, a multi-protein complex, contains a set of proteins that, upon appropriate stresses, initiate partner switching cascades that free the sigma B sigma factor from an anti-sigma. The focus here is on the mode of activation of RsbU, a serine/threonine phosphatase of the PPM family, leading to sigB activation. RbsT, a component of the degradosome interacts with RsbU upon stress, activating the phosphatase activity. Once active, RsbU dephosphorylates its target (RsbV, an anti-antisigma), which in turn binds the anti-sigma. The conclusion is that flexible linker domains upstream of the phosphatase domain are the target for activation, via binding of proteins to the N-terminal domain, resulting in a crossed-linker dimeric structure. The authors then use the information on RsbU to suggest that parallel approaches are used to activate PPM phosphatases for the GSR response in other bacteria. (Biology vs. Mechanism, evolution?)</p><p>Strengths and Weaknesses:</p><p>Many of these have to do with clarifying what was done and why. This includes the presentation and content of the figures.</p><p>One issue relates to the background and context. A bit more information on the stresses that release RsbT would be useful here. The authors might also consider a figure showing the major conclusions and parallels for SpoIIE activation and possibly other partner switches that are discussed, introducing the switch change more clearly to set the stage for the work here (and the generalization). There are a lot of players to keep track of.</p></disp-quote><p>We plan to carefully review the manuscript to improve the clarity of presentation and background. In particular, we thank the reviewer for pointing out the missing information about the release of RsbT from the stressosome. We will incorporate this information into the introduction and provide an additional figure.</p><p>We have added the following text to the introduction:</p><p>âRsbT is sequestered in a megadalton stress sensing complex called the stressosome, and is released to bind RsbU in response to specific stress signals including ethanol, heat, acid, salt, and blue lightâ</p><p>We have added a new figure panel (2C) that shows the model for how Q94L, M166V, and RsbT binding induce conformational change of the PPM domain to recruit metal cofactor and activate RsbU (analogous, but slightly different from the mechanism for SpoIIE).</p><p>The reviewer additionally provided detailed helpful comments that we will incorporate in the text and figures.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>The authors present a study building on their previous work on activation of the general stress response phosphatase, RsbU, from <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic>. Using computed structural models of the RsbU dimer the authors map previously identified activating mutations onto the structure and suggest further protein variants to test the role of the predicted linker helix and the interaction with RsbT on the activation of the phosphatase activity.</p><p>Using in vivo and in vitro activity assays, the authors demonstrate that linker variants can constitutively activate RsbU and increase the affinity of the protein for RsbT, thus showing a link between the structure of the linker region and RsbT binding.</p><p>Small angle X-ray scattering experiments on RsbU variants alone, and in complex with RsbT show structural changes consistent with a decreased flexibility of the RsbU protein, which is hypothesised to indicate a disorder-order transition in the linker when RsbT binds. This interpretation of the data is consistent with the biochemical data presented by the authors.</p><p>Further computed structure models are presented for other protein phosphates from different bacterial species and the authors propose a model for phosphatase activation by partner binding. They compare this to the activation mechanisms proposed for histidine kinase two-component systems and GGDEF proteins and suggest the individual domains could be swapped to give a toolkit of modular parts for bacterial signalling.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>The key mutagenesis data is presented with two lines of evidence to demonstrate RsbU activation - in vivo sigma-b activation assays utilising a beta-galactosidase reporter and in vitro activity assays against the RsbV protein, which is the downstream target of RsbU. These data support the hypothesis for RsbT binding to the RsbU linker region as well as the dimerisation domain to activate the RsbU activity.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>Small angle scattering curves are difficult to unambiguously interpret, but the authors present reasonable interpretations that fit with the biochemical data presented. These interpretations should be considered as good models for future testing with other methods - hydrogen/deuterium exchange mass spectrometry, would be a good additional method to use, as exchange rates in the linker region would be affected significantly by the disorder/order transition on RsbT binding.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that the SAXS data has inherent ambiguity due to the nature of the measurement. However, SAXS is one of the best techniques to directly assess conformational flexibility. Our scattering data for RsbU have multiple signatures of flexibility supporting a high confidence conclusion. While the scattering data support a reduction in flexibility for the RsbT/RsbU complex, we agree that a high resolution structure would be valuable. However the combination of the scattering data with our biochemical and genetic data supports the validity of the AlphaFold predicted model. We thank the reviewer for the suggestion of future hydrogen/deuterium exchange experiments that would be complementary, but which we feel are beyond the scope of this work.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The interpretation of the computed structure models should be toned down with the addition of a few caveats related to the bias in the models returned by AlphaFold2. For the full-length models of RsbU and other phosphatase proteins, the relationship of the domains to each other is likely to be the least reliable part of the models - this is apparent from the PAE plots shown in Supplementary Figure 8. Furthermore, the authors should show models coloured by pLDDT scores in an additional supplementary figure to help the reader interpret the confidence level of the predicted structures.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for suggestions on how to clarify the discussion of AlphaFold models.

The GSR is a critical adaptive mechanism that allows bacteria to survive under various stress conditions by reshaping their physiology through a broad transcriptional response. RsbU, a key player in the GSR, facilitates the activation of the transcription factor SigB by dephosphorylating RsbV. This activation is mediated through a partner-switching mechanism involving RsbT. Baral and colleagues use a combination of genetic screening, structural predictions via AlphaFold2, and biophysical techniques such as SAXS and MALS to present a model for how RsbT regulates RsbU. Key findings include the identification of specific amino acid substitutions that enhance RsbU activity, the role of the Î±-helical linker in RsbU dimerization and activation, and the potential broader conservation of these mechanisms across bacterial species. However, as described below, additional work is required to solidify the results.</p><p>Major Points</p><p>(1) The manuscript is misnamed--it dissects a single step of the signal-transduction pathway regulating the general stress response. Instead, it is rather seeking a generalizable mechanism for kinase -phosphatase interactions across stresses.</p></disp-quote><p>We have edited the title to âA General Mechanism for Initiating the General Stress Response in Bacteriaâ to reflect that that this study addresses the initiating event of the general stress response.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) The genetic screen likely has limitations in detecting all possible variants that could affect RsbU activity. The readout is specific to Ï^B activation, and the focus on specific amino acid substitutions may overlook other significant regions or mechanisms involved in the regulation of RsbU, particularly those involving RsbV and RsbT.</p></disp-quote><p>Our screens were specifically designed to identify features of RsbU that contribute to regulation. Importantly, RsbU does not have any known targets other than RsbV and the downstream Ï<sup>B</sup> response but agree that substitutions in either RsbV or RsbT could influence RsbU activation. In principle our suppressor screen with RsbU<sup>Y28I</sup> could have identified RsbT variants (<italic>rsbT</italic> was mutagenized in this screen), but we did not identify any such variants in the screen. We conducted a separate screen (published elsewhere) that specifically addressed how RsbU recognizes RsbV.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) The authors largely focus on the biochemical and structural aspects of RsbU regulation. There is limited discussion on the broader functional implications of these findings in the context of bacterial physiology and stress response. Incorporating more in vivo studies to show how these mechanisms impact bacterial survival and adaptation would provide a more comprehensive understanding.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate this comment, but did not conduct additional studies of survival and adaptation because the phenotypes of Ï<sup>B</sup> deletion in <italic>B. subtilis</italic> under laboratory conditions are relatively mild and therefore difficult to assay. Future studies to address this in other systems could be highly informative.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) The results primarily support the model of linker-mediated dimerization and rigidity. However, other potential regulatory mechanisms or interacting partners might also play significant roles in RsbU activation. A more thorough exploration of these possibilities would strengthen the study's conclusions.</p></disp-quote><p>One of the major advantages of RsbU as a model for initiation of the general stress response is that the system is discreet with all evidence pointing to there being a single primary input (RsbT) and output (dephosphorylation of RsbV). While there are other possible variations on the system (for example RsbU may be directly activated by manganese stress), we focused on this system precisely because of its simplicity.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) While the study presents evidence for the conservation of the described mechanism across different species, this assumption is based on structural predictions and limited experimental data. Broader experimental validation across diverse bacterial species would be necessary to substantiate this claim. Coevolution coupling along with conservation/evolutionary studies could be considered.</p></disp-quote><p>We have altered the language in the paper to emphasize where we are making inferences from predictions that are therefore more speculative. We agree that a more detailed analysis of the evolutionary coupling would likely be fruitful. We note that these couplings are the major driving force of AlphaFold predictions, suggesting that these couplings contributed to the models that we analyzed.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(6) The reliance on AlphaFold2 for structural predictions introduces potential biases and uncertainties inherent in computational models. Experimental validation of these models through additional techniques such as cryo-EM or X-ray crystallography would strengthen the conclusions.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with this point, which is why we performed extensive analysis and validation of the models for RsbU using SAXS, genetics, and biochemistry. The proposed techniques are made more challenging by flexibility and heterogeneity, which we detected in our experiments. Our attempts thus far at experimental structure determination are consistent with this being a major technical hurdle.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(7) SAXS data provide low-resolution structural information, and the interpretation of flexibility versus rigidification might be overemphasized in its interpretation. This part of the study was difficult to interpret. Improving readability by breaking down the text into sections with clear headings for each figure panel and clarifying descriptions of the panels and methods would help. Complementary high-resolution techniques could provide a more definitive view of the linker's conformational changes.</p></disp-quote><p>We have modified the presentation of the figures to clarify the SAXS analysis. The fact that the SAXS analysis suggests flexibility rather than a discrete inactive conformation means that high-resolution techniques may not be appropriate for this system.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(8) The study primarily focuses on the model where RsbT binding rigidifies the RsbU linker. Alternative hypotheses, such as subtle conformational adjustments without complete rigidification, are not extensively explored or ruled out.</p></disp-quote><p>Our analysis of the SAXS data strongly suggests that a subtle conformational change could not account for the scattering data that we obtained. We have modified the text to clarify this point.</p><p>âIndicative of significant deviation between the RsbU structure in solution to the AlphaFold2 model, the scattering intensity profile (I(q) vs. q) was a poor fit (Ï<sup>2</sup> 12.53) to a profile calculated from the AlphaFold2 model of an RsbU dimer using FoXS (Schneidman-Duhovny et al. 2016; Schneidman-Duhovny et al. 2013) (Fig. 4A). We therefore assessed the SAXS data for the RsbU dimer for features that report on flexibility (Kikhney &amp; Svergun 2015).

It would also be good to clearly present in the text the logic of asking if the mutant is RsbT independent or not (and the interpretation of that). Quantitative assays of these would be very useful.</p></disp-quote><p>We chose not to perform quantitative-LacZ assays here because of several complications to interpreting these results that we encountered in our previously published study (Ho and Bradshaw, 2021). However, the level of blue pigmentation shown in Figure 1B for RsbU Q94L and RsbU M166V is qualitatively different, making the comparison possible. Most importantly, we observed cell density dependent changes in LacZ activity in the absence of <italic>rsbT</italic> for <italic>rsbUM166V</italic> expressing cells, meaning that comparisons between strains would be difficult. Additionally, we found that it was important to make a chromosomal replacement of <italic>rsbU</italic> to see the full effect of the M166V substitution.

Blue (low error) is good, presumably. What are the A, B, C, and D sections showing? Different parts of a given letter region (and between them)? What is the x-axis? Is the top-ranked model used in every case in the text? How different are these models? The Methods section could be used for some of this (but doesn't in its current form). This also becomes important for the models generated later in the paper (Figure S7), which look rather different here.</p></disp-quote><p>We have modified figure S8 to include additional labels and have added structures with the pLDDT scores shown.

For these analyses we used the Socket2 program, which analyzes a PDB file to identify coiled-coil regions and thus does not provide a confidence score.

We considered making helix-breaking mutations, which would be predicted to block RsbU activation, but favored analysis of the wildtype protein because of limitations in interpreting the effects of loss-of-function mutations.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) Figure 2A, RsbT binding to RsbU: It was not entirely clear to this reviewer why one would expect the RsbT binding, not needed for activation, to be increased by the mutation that stabilizes the crossed alpha helices. The change is impressive but doesn't the lack of a need for RsbT suggest that this mutation bypasses the normal mechanism? (Is dimerization enuf? Or other protein cross helices?).</p></disp-quote><p>We have modified the text to clarify this point: âOne prediction of our hypothesis that RsbT stabilizes the crossed alpha helices of the RsbU dimer, is that RsbT should bind more tightly to <italic>rsbUQ94L</italic> than to <italic>RsbU</italic> because the coiled-coil conformation that RsbT binds would be more energetically favorable.â Another way of putting this is that if the Q94L substitution activates RsbU through an on-pathway mechanism, RsbT <italic>must</italic> bind more tightly.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) Figure 3A, Figure S3: Please label the yellow (interface) residues in RsbU and RsbT in Fig. S3 and the green (suppressor) spheres in Figure 3A.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added labels to the figures as suggested.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>If RbsT interacts with the N-terminal dimerization domain and linker, why were residues 174 and 178 (from PPM domain) shown to be implicated in binding?</p></disp-quote><p>The fact that residues in the switch region suppress a mutation that decreases RsbT binding suggests that this region is part of an allosteric network that links RsbT binding, the linker, and dimerization of the phosphatase domains.

If these are in fact RsbT independent, they support the importance of the linker (do they further stabilize coiled-coil formation?), rather than the role of RsbT here. Are G92 and T89 on the outside of the coiled-coil? If Q94 is buried, is it qualitatively different from these others?</p></disp-quote><p>G92 and T89 are predicted to be exposed.

It would be helped by telling the reader what the R91 contact is initially.</p></disp-quote><p>We have modified the text to clarify this point: âTo test the model that RsbT activates RsbU by directly interacting with the linker to dimerize the RsbU phosphatase domains, we introduced a charge swap at position R91 that would abolish a predicted salt-bridge with RsbT D92 (Fig. 3C).â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(9) Figure 4 and the discussion of it in the text is not likely to be easily understandable for many readers. Aside from providing a bit more explanation of what these analyses are showing, it would be useful to start the whole section (or maybe even much earlier in the paper) with the information found on lines 261-264, that other studies show that the N-terminus dimerizes stably on its own (and is it known that the C-terminus does not?). Then the discussion of the alternative models early in this section would be clearer.</p></disp-quote><p>We have updated the introduction to emphasize this point âRsbU has an N-terminal four-helix bundle domain that dimerizes RsbU and is also the binding site for RsbT, which activates RsbU as a phosphatase (Fig. 1C,D) (Delumeau et al. 2004).â</p><p>We have also added clarification to the model presented at the beginning of this section: âA second possibility is that inactive RsbU is dimerized by the N-terminal domains but that the linkers of inactive RsbU are flexible and that the phosphatase domains only interact with each other when RsbT orders the linkers into a crossing conformation.â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Is the dimerization of the N-terminal domains previously determined similar/the same as what is seen in the AlphaFold models used here (or the AlphaFold dimerization derived primarily from that data?).</p></disp-quote><p>Yes, the dimerization in the AlphaFold models matches closely to the published structure.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(10) Discussion and Figure 5: The final part of this work predicts AlphaFold models for a set of other phosphatases involved in initiating GSR across bacterial species, and suggests that linked-mediated phosphatase dimerization is the critical factor to activate the phosphatase.
