However, how its role in the metabolism of tumor cells during melanoma development remains unclear. Here, we demonstrated that TIPE promoted glycolysis by interacting with pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2) in melanoma. We found that TIPE-induced PKM2 dimerization, thereby facilitating its translocation from the cytoplasm to the nucleus. TIPE-mediated PKM2 dimerization consequently promoted HIF-1α activation and glycolysis, which contributed to melanoma progression and increased its stemness features. Notably, TIPE specifically phosphorylated PKM2 at Ser 37 in an extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)-dependent manner. Consistently, the expression of TIPE was positively correlated with the levels of PKM2 Ser37 phosphorylation and cancer stem cell (CSC) markers in melanoma tissues from clinical samples and tumor bearing mice. In summary, our findings indicate that the TIPE/PKM2/HIF-1α signaling pathway plays a pivotal role in promoting CSC properties by facilitating the glycolysis, which would provide a promising therapeutic target for melanoma intervention.</p></abstract><kwd-group

sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Melanoma is derived from the aberrant growth of melanocytes and is classified into several subgroups such as cutaneous melanoma (CM), uveal melanoma (UM), and mucosal melanoma (MM), based on its tissue locations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Han et al., 2021</xref>). CM is the major subgroup of melanoma. Accumulating evidence has revealed that metabolic reprogramming contributes to the tumorigenesis and progression of melanoma. Owing to its low incidence rate, targeting metabolism might be a promising therapeutic approach for the treatment of melanoma and offers a deeper understanding of its pathobiology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Brunner and Finley, 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Faubert et al., 2020</xref>). However, melanoma-altered metabolic reprogramming remains poorly understood.</p><p>The Warburg effect, also known as aerobic glycolysis, is a part of metabolic reprogramming. It partly contributes to increased lactate levels regardless of oxygen availability in tumor cells, providing cancer cell tumorigenicity, progression, and chemoresistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Guo et al., 2022</xref>). Pyruvate kinase isoform M2 (PKM2) is the key enzyme that irreversibly converts phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) to pyruvate in the last step of glycolysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Li et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Liu et al., 2021</xref>). It is shifted between catalytically inactive dimeric and active tetrameric forms, and the PKM2 dimer predominantly serves as a key glycolytic enzyme that provides advantages for tumor progression due to the Warburg effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Liu et al., 2017</xref>). Post-translational modifications of PKM2, such as FGFR1-mediated Tyr105 phosphorylation and ERK1/2-dependent Ser37 phosphorylation, can promote PKM2 from a tetrameric to dimeric form, accelerating its translocation into the nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Christofk et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Li et al., 2016</xref>). In the nucleus, PKM2 acts as a protein kinase that phosphorylates STAT3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chen et al., 2022b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dhanesha et al., 2022</xref>) and Histone H3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Niu et al., 2020</xref>). Interestingly, nuclear PKM2 also functions as a coactivator for several transcription factors, such as HIF-1α (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Luo et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Wang et al., 2014</xref>) or Oct4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Yang et al., 2018</xref>), by which regulates metabolic gene transcription and promotes tumorigenesis or sustains cancer stem cell (CSC) populations. Furthermore, HIF-1α is constitutively activated in melanoma under both normal and hypoxic conditions and is accompanied by increased glycolysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">D’Aguanno et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Malekan et al., 2021</xref>). Therefore, the precise mechanisms underlying PKM2 activity regulation and its function as an HIF-1α coactivator might provide a molecular basis for the melanoma targeted therapy.</p><p>The tumor necrosis factor alpha-induced protein 8 (TNFAIP8, TIPE) family is composed of four members: TIPE, TIPE1, TIPE2, and TIPE3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Yang et al., 2022</xref>). Accumulating evidence suggests that TIPE is strongly associated with the development of various cancers by affecting cell proliferation, apoptosis, invasion, and metastasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Goldsmith et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Niture et al., 2018</xref>). Therefore, TIPE is broadly considered pro-cancerous (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Padmavathi et al., 2018</xref>). However, we previous revealed that TIPE functions as a tumor suppressor in colitis and colitis-associated colon cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Lou et al., 2022</xref>), indicating that TIPE might serve a multifarious function in malignancies. Hitherto, the role of TIPE in melanoma remains unclear. In this study, we revealed that TIPE-mediated PKM2 Ser37 phosphorylation accelerates PKM2 translocation from the cytoplasm to the nucleus, thereby elevating its binding ability to HIF-1α and hypoxia response elements (HREs), thus promoting metabolic reprogramming. TIPE-mediated metabolic reprogramming can confer tumorigenesis and stem-like phenomena to melanoma cells. This process represents an important regulator of the TIPE family for regulating aerobic glycolysis, paving the way for cancer-specific metabolism in response to low-oxygen challenge.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>TIPE increases aerobic glycolysis in melanoma cells</title><p>To characterize how TIPE performs biological functions in melanoma, we examined its expression levels in melanoma cell lines. The results showed that A375 and A875 cells had relatively higher TIPE expression than G361 and MM96L cells. Therefore, we downregulated TIPE expression in A375 cells and overexpressed TIPE in G361 cells to perform further experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Furthermore, we demonstrated that TIPE promotes melanoma tumorigenesis both in vitro and in vivo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p>Consequently, we performed RNA sequencing analysis by overexpressing TIPE in G361 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) to examine the underlying mechanisms involved in the progression of melanoma. The results revealed that the overexpression of TIPE dramatically promoted expression of genes regarding glycolysis and the HIF-1α pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B, C</xref>). Since HIF-1α pathway participates in metabolic reprogramming, especially aerobic glycolysis as well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Baik et al., 2019</xref>), we assumed that TIPE promotes melanoma progression might via the regulation of metabolic reprogramming. Therefore, we performed a metabolomic analysis after interfering with TIPE in A375 cells. Interestingly, the results indicated that the aerobic glycolysis pathway, including pyruvate and lactate, was significantly inhibited in melanoma cells after TIPE silencing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>), confirming that TIPE facilitates glycolytic metabolism in melanoma. Consequently, ATPase activity, lactate secretion, and ATP content assays were performed to further confirm TIPE-induced glycolytic changes. The results demonstrated that TIPE decreased ATPase activity and ATP content while promoting lactate production (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E–G</xref>). Additionally, we measured the extracellular acidification rate (ECAR) after the overexpression or downregulation of TIPE using a Seahorse Bioscience Flux Analyzer. The results also revealed that TIPE promoted glycolysis and glycolytic capacity in melanoma cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H–K</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Effect of TIPE on melanoma cell glycolysis.</title><p>(<bold>A, B</bold>) Transcriptomics analysis by unsupervised hierarchical clustering and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analysis showed that TIPE increased glycolysis and HIF-1α pathways.

Next, we performed Co-IP assays to confirm the interactions between TIPE and PKM2. The results revealed that exogenously overexpressed Flag-tagged PKM2 interacted with exogenously overexpressed HA-tagged TIPE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B, C</xref>). Furthermore, endogenous interactions between PKM2 and TIPE were confirmed in the A375 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D, E</xref>). GST-pull down assays demonstrated that TIPE directly bound to PKM2 in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>).

The results also showed that endogenous interactions between TIPE and PKM2 were confirmed in G361 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>). Based on these interactions, we identified the binding regions between TIPE and PKM2. We generated four fragments of PKM2, including amino acids 1–390 (NA1BA2), 45–390 (A1BA2), 1–219 (NA1B), and 220–390 (A2), based on their structural domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>).

Finally, the TIPE protein was divided into two fragments, including amino acids 1–100 (M1) and 101–198 (M2). The data showed that the amino acids 1–100 (M1) and 101–198 (M2) of TIPE interacted with PKM2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2J</xref>). Due to both domains of TIPE can interact with PKM2, we believe that the A2 domain of PKM2 might have important structural effects that could affect interactions with TIPE.

Intriguingly, we demonstrated that dimeric PKM2 was reduced in TIPE-silenced A375 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2K</xref>) and was increased following TIPE overexpression in G361 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2L</xref>). Normally, a dimeric form of PKM2 with low affinity for its substrate, PEP, and a tetrameric form have a high PEP affinity. Moreover, the dimeric form of PKM2 is more prone to translocation into the nucleus and thus exerts protein kinase activity, which confers the Warburg effect and tumorigenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Zhou et al., 2022</xref>). Western blot analysis of nuclear and cytosolic fractions from A375 cells revealed that PKM2 primarily resided in the cytoplasm in which TIPE was downregulated. Likewise, the nuclear level of PKM2 was increased after overexpression of TIPE in G361 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2M</xref>). Furthermore, we examined the distribution of PKM2 after TIPE overexpression by using a Thermo Fisher EVOS microscopic analysis. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2N</xref>, PKM2 was predominantly present in the nucleus after TIPE overexpression, and this phenomenon was diminished by the administration of a PKM2 dimer formation suppressor (TEPP-46, 100 μM). It has been shown that dimeric PKM2 promotes tumor progression by regulating the Warburg effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Zhou et al., 2022</xref>).

Consequently, TIPE-activated HRE reporter activity in a dose-dependent manner, and this phenomenon was reversed after PKM2 knockdown, demonstrating that TIPE has critical effects on the activation of HIF-1α transcription in a PKM2-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>).

Our results preliminarily demonstrate that TIPE promotes PKM2 dimerization and nuclear import, thereby increasing HIF-1α transcriptional activation and promoting aerobic glycolysis. Normally, Erk1/2-dependent phosphorylation of PKM2 at serine 37 (Ser37) and FGFR1-dependent phosphorylation of PKM2 at tyrosine 105 (Tyr105) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Li et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Zhou et al., 2018</xref>) are indicative of its dimerization and translocation, further promoting the Warburg effect and serving as a transcription factor coactivator (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Novoyatleva et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Wei et al., 2020</xref>). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, interference with TIPE in A375 cells blocked PKM2 Ser37 phosphorylation, and overexpression of TIPE in G361 cells caused Ser37 phosphorylation compared to controls. However, the phosphorylation of PKM2 Tyr105 did not show any obvious changes. Consequently, we hypothesized that this transformation caused by Ser37 phosphorylation affects the interaction between TIPE and PKM2. As expected, the mutation of PKM2 at S37A blocked its interaction with TIPE, but not with the Y105D mutation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). Interestingly, this mutation also interfered with the interaction between PKM2 and HIF-1α, which was elevated by TIPE overexpression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). A previous study has revealed that TIPE promotes chemoresistance in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) by activating the ERK signaling pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Pang et al., 2020</xref>). In addition, phosphorylation of PKM2 at serine 37 is ERK1/2-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Yang et al., 2012</xref>). TIPE does not serve as a phosphorylase to perform such post-translational modifications directly. Taken together, these results indicate that TIPE promotes PKM2 dimerization depending on ERK signaling. As expected, the ERK inhibitor, U0126, inhibited PKM2 Ser37 phosphorylation induced by TIPE overexpression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>).

Its overexpression is positively associated with the development of various cancers, including liver, lung, and breast cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Lou et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Niture et al., 2018</xref>). However, Chen et al. reported that TIPE initially inhibits cancer cell proliferation but promotes tumor migration and metastasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Li et al., 2021</xref>). In addition, a previous report has demonstrated that TIPE functions as a tumor suppressor in certain inflammatory carcinogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Lou et al., 2022</xref>). These results suggest that TIPE plays a variety of roles in cancer progression. Interestingly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Niture et al., 2021</xref> reported that TIPE promotes prostate cancer progression by regulating oxidative phosphorylation and glycolysis . However, the mechanism through which TIPE regulates metabolic reprogramming remains unclear. Here, we demonstrate that TIPE facilitates the Warberg effect by promoting dimeric PKM2-mediated HIF-1α transactivation in melanoma. Therefore, targeting TIPE may offer a novel therapeutic approach for melanoma treatment.</p><p>Mammalian pyruvate kinase consists of four isoforms, M1, M2, L, and R, which are encoded by two distinct genes (PKM and PKLR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Valentini et al., 2002</xref>). Although these isoforms share similar features, only PKM2 exhibits the lowest basal enzymatic activity and is capable of configuration transformation between the tetramer and dimer, meeting differential metabolic demands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Morgan et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Puckett et al., 2021</xref>). Cancer cells shift toward the preferential expression of the specific isoform of PKM2, especially its dimeric form, and serve as a pivotal metabolic enzyme that promotes the activation of oncogenic pathways in tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Icard et al., 2022</xref>). Normally, PKM2 enzymatic activity is accurately modulated in a variety of ways, such as post-translational modifications or metabolite binding, to maintain balanced levels in tumor cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Puckett et al., 2021</xref>). Here, we showed that TIPE promoted melanoma tumorigenesis by promoting glycolysis. The results showed that TIPE interacts with PKM2 and may participate in glycolysis. However, TIPE did not influence the expression of PKM2 at either the mRNA or the protein level. Because of the modulation of PKM2 kinetic properties primarily via its dimer and tetramer configurations, we demonstrated that TIPE could promote its dimeric form transformation, increasing PKM2 residing in the nucleus. However, the downstream signaling pathways that are mediated by TIPE in melanoma remain largely unknown.</p><p>The nuclear PKM2 routinely serves as a coactivator to transcriptionally activate certain metabolic genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cluntun et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Zhang et al., 2019</xref>). Because TIPE binds PKM2 and transports it into the nucleus, the dimeric form of PKM2 more easily enters the nucleus to become a coactivator of HIF-1α, resulting in the upregulation of HIF-1α targeted genes such as <italic>LDHA</italic> and <italic>SLC2A1</italic>. Thus, we elucidate these relationships in the next step. To verify whether TIPE activates HIF-1α transcriptional activity, we found that TIPE significantly increased the activation of the HRE promoter, especially when combined with PKM2. However, this activation was diminished by interfering with PKM2, indicating that TIPE has critical effects on the activation of HIF-1α transcription in a PKM2-dependent manner. Because PKM2 interacts with HIF-1α and potentiates PKM2-mediated HIF-1α transcription, we found that TIPE increased the interaction between HIF-1α and PKM2. In TCGA dataset, the hypoxia score was positively correlated with the mRNA expression of TIPE in melanoma, and the TIPE higher expression group had a higher hypoxia score than the lower expression group.</p><p>The mechanisms associated with PKM2 translocation are diverse, the most important of which is Erk1/2-dependent phosphorylation of PKM2 at serine 37 (Ser37) and FGFR1-dependent phosphorylation of PKM2 at tyrosine 105 (Tyr105) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Li et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Zhou et al., 2018</xref>). Consequently, we demonstrated that TIPE increased the levels of PKM2 Ser37 but not PKM2 Tyr105. Furthermore, we conjectured that this transformation caused by Ser37 phosphorylation affects the interaction between TIPE and PKM2. The results showed that mutation of PKM2 at S37A blocked its interaction with TIPE but not with Y105D. Because phosphorylation of PKM2 at serine 37 is dependent on ERK1/2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Yang et al., 2012</xref>) and TIPE promotes AML chemoresistance by activating the ERK signaling pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Pang et al., 2020</xref>), we used an ERK inhibitor to further demonstrate the activation of HIF-1α induced by TIPE. Not surprisingly, we found that TIPE facilitates the Warberg effect predominantly by driving PKM2 Ser37 phosphorylation. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the augmentation of TIPE on HRE promoter activation or HIF-1α targeted genes such as <italic>LDHA</italic> and <italic>SLC2A1</italic> was blocked by the S37A mutation, as previously reported. These results demonstrated that TIPE promotes HIF-1α transcriptional activation via ERK-dependent PKM2 Ser37 phosphorylation.</p><p>Increasing evidence has shown that HIF-1α promotes tumor progression, metastasis, and therapeutic drug resistance by maintaining cancer stemness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cui et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Niu et al., 2021</xref>). Here, we observed that TIPE significantly enhanced tumorigenesis, glycolysis, and CSC properties under normoxia in melanoma, whereas suppression of PKM2 dimerization rescued these TIPE-induced effects. Interestingly, we revealed that decreasing of PKM2 dimerization can rescue TIPE-induced cell proliferation, glycolysis, and CSC properties. However, this phenomenon was diminished by activation of HIF-1α, demonstrating that TIPE promotes melanoma cells proliferation, glycolysis, and CSC properties via dimeric PKM2-dependent HIF-1α activation. Furthermore, using a tissue ship, we showed that the expression of TIPE in melanoma tissues was dramatically increased compared to that in benign skin tumor tissues. To determine if there was a correlation between TIPE and PKM2 Ser37 levels, the results also demonstrated that TIPE expression was positively correlated with PKM2 Ser37 levels. Consistently, the expression of TIPE has a positive relationship with PKM2 Ser37, LDH, and the CSCs marker CD44 in TIPE-overexpressing cell-derived xenografts. TCGA dataset revealed that TIPE has a positive relationship with CSCs markers, including <italic>BMI1</italic>, <italic>NANOG</italic>, <italic>NOTCH1</italic>, and <italic>POU5F1</italic> in melanoma. These results further demonstrate that TIPE maintains melanoma cell stem phenotypes in a PKM2 dimerization manner.</p><p>However, we measured metabolites such as glucose, pyruvate, and lactate at steady state, the methods such as isotope tracing experiment might be more suitable for study glucose catabolism into pyruvate, as well as tracing into lactate or into the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle following changes in TIPE expression. Moreover, the relationship between TIPE levels and melanoma patient outcome is not presented in this article. One reason is that the tissue microarray lack of the survival data. Interestingly, the TCGA dataset showed a contradictory result that the higher TIPE expression has a favorable prognosis for melanoma. The detailed mechanisms will be discussed in our following article, and we hope that it might as a continuous research topic for TIPE in melanoma. In summary, we identified that TIPE serves as an oncogenic candidate for melanoma and determined that TIPE promotes the Warburg effect and maintains the stemness of melanoma. TIPE binds to PKM2, inducing its dimeric transformation by enhancing ERK-dependent PKM2 Ser37 phosphorylation, and thus activating the transcription of HIF-1α, providing tumorigenicity and cancer stem-like phenomena for melanoma progression. The newly identified TIPE/PKM2/HIF-1α axis is an ideal therapeutic target for melanoma and opens an avenue for the development of a novel strategy for precision therapy.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cell culture and plasmids construction</title><p>Human A375, A875, G361, MM96L, and HEK-293T cell lines were purchased from the Shanghai Institute of Cell Biology (Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai, China) and were maintained in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM, Gibco) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Gibco) at 37°C under 5% CO<sub>2</sub>.

For CD44 analyzing, the cells were seeded, harvested, and incubated with anti-CD44 fluorescent antibody. Isotype-matched human immunoglobulins served as controls. Finally, the cells were counted with the FACS scanner.</p></sec><sec id="s4-17"><title>Mouse xenograft tumor study</title><p>Xenograft tumor studies were conducted utilizing the 6-week-old male BALB/c nude mice purchased from the Shanghai SLAC Laboratory Animal Co, Ltd. The total number of mice was randomly divided into respective groups and maintained in a standard pathogen free environment. All the animal experiments were approved by the Animal Ethics Committee of Zibo Central Hospital, Binzhou Medical University (Ethical Approval Number: 2021-037). Tumor growth was monitored regularly and the length, width, and height measurements taken every 7 days for five times. In the rescue experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>), the tumor volumes were measurements taken every 5 days for seven times. For the rescue test, 1 week after injection, mice bearing TIPE-vector were treated with TEPP-46. TEPP-46 (50 mg/kg) or vehicle control (0.9% NaCl) was administrated via intraperitoneal injection. At the end of experiment, mice were euthanized and tumors were collected. Tumors were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for further IHC analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s4-18"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>GraphPad Prism (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA) was used for statistical analyses. Two-tailed Student’s <italic>t</italic>-tests were used to compare two groups. Linear regression analysis was explored to analyze the correlation of TIPE with other indicators. All the data are shown as the standard error of mean from at least three independent experiments. A p value of &lt;0.05 was considered statistically significant for all tests.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Data curation, Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Validation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Data curation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Software</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con8"><p>Visualization</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con9"><p>Methodology, Writing – original draft</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con10"><p>Conceptualization, Supervision</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>This study has been approved by the Medical Ethics Committee, the Animal Care and Use Committee of Zibo Central Hospital, Binzhou Medical University (Ethical Approval Number: 2021-037).

The authors begin by confirming TIPE expression in melanoma cell lines and identify &quot;high&quot; and &quot;low&quot; expressing models for functional analysis. They show that TIPE depletion slows tumour growth in vivo, and using both knockdown and over expression approaches, show that this is associated with changes in glycolysis in vitro. Compelling data using multiple independent approaches is presented to support an interaction between TIPE and the glycolysis regulator PKM2, and over-expression of TIPE promoted nuclear translocation of PKM2 dimers. Mechanistically, the authors also demonstrate that PKM2 is required for TIPE-mediated activation of HIF1a transcriptional activity, as assessed using an HRE-promoter reporter assay, and that TIPE-mediated PKM2 dimerization is p-ERK dependent. Finally, the dependence of TIPE activity on PKM2 dimerization was demonstrated on tumor growth in vivo and in regulation of glycolysis in vitro, and ectopic expression of HIF1a could rescue inhibition of PKM2 dimerization in TIPE overexpressing cells and reduced induction of general cancer stem cell markers, showing a clear role for HIF1a in this pathway.</p><p>The detailed mechanistic analysis of TIPE mediated regulation of PKM2 to control aerobic glycolysis and tumor growth is a major strength of the study and provides new insights into the molecular mechanisms that underpin the Warburg effect in melanoma cells. The main conclusions of this paper are well supported by data, however further investigation of a potential oncogenic effect of TIPE in melanoma patients is warranted to support the tumor promoting role of TIPE identified in the experimental models. Analysis of patient samples showed a significant increase in TIPE protein levels in primary melanoma compared to benign skin tumours, and a further increase upon metastatic progression. Moreover, TIPE levels correlate with proliferation (Ki67) and hypoxia gene sets in the TCGA melanoma patient dataset. However, intriguingly, high TIPE expression associates with better survival outcomes in the TCGA melanoma patient cohort, therefore further investigation of how TIPE-mediated regulation of glycolysis contributes to melanoma progression is warranted to confirm the authors claims of a potential oncogenic function. Regardless, the new insights into the molecular mechanisms underpinning TIPE-mediated aerobic glycolysis in melanoma are convincing and will likely generate interest in the cancer metabolism field.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="author-comment" id="sa3"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.92741.4.sa3</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Tian</surname><given-names>Maojin</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Zibo Central Hospital Affiliated to Binzhou Medical University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Zibo</named-content></addr-line><country>China</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Yang</surname><given-names>Le</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Shandong First Medical University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Jinan</named-content></addr-line><country>China</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Zhao</surname><given-names>Ziqian</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Second Affiliated Hospital of Xinjiang Medical University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Urumqi</named-content></addr-line><country>China</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Li</surname><given-names>Jigang</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Zibo Central Hospital Affiliated to Binzhou Medical University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Zibo</named-content></addr-line><country>China</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Lianqing</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Zibo Central Hospital Affiliated to Binzhou Medical University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Zibo</named-content></addr-line><country>China</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Yin</surname><given-names>Qingqing</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Shandong First Medical University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Jinan</named-content></addr-line><country>China</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Hu</surname><given-names>Wei</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Zibo Central Hospital Affiliated to Binzhou Medical University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Zibo</named-content></addr-line><country>China</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Lou</surname><given-names>Yunwei</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Xinxiang Medical University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Xinxiang</named-content></addr-line><country>China</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Du</surname><given-names>Jianxin</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Zibo Central Hospital Affiliated to Binzhou Medical University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Zibo</named-content></addr-line><country>China</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Zhao</surname><given-names>Peiqing</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Zibo Central Hospital Affiliated to Binzhou Medical University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Zibo</named-content></addr-line><country>China</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>The following is the authors’ response to the previous reviews.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>Tian et al. describe how TIPE regulates melanoma progression, stemness, and glycolysis.

We have expanded the analysis to include the relationship between TIPE levels and melanoma progression, specifically distinguishing between non-lymph node metastasis and lymph node metastasis. In addition, we added the association between TIPE and Ki67 or LDH levels as your advised, as shown in Figure 7.</p><p>However, the relationship between TIPE levels and melanoma patient outcome is not presented in this article. One reason is that the tissue microarray lack of the survival data. Interestingly, the TCGA dataset showed that the higher TIPE expression has a favorable prognosis for melanoma. We are also very curious about this. Our following study indicated that TIPE might serve as a positive regulator of PD-L1. Therefore, the higher expression of TIPE presents more sensitive tendency to immunotherapy, resulting in a favorable prognosis in melanoma. The detailed mechanisms will be discussed in our following article, and we hope that it might as a continuous research topic for TIPE in melanoma.</p><p>We just only disclose a little information that TIPE shares similar survival and immune signature to PD-L1 and PD-1 in melanoma as following:</p><fig id="sa3fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-92741-sa3-fig1-v1.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) The duration of the in vivo experiments was not clearly defined in the figures, however, it was clear from the tumor volume measurements that they ended well before standard ethical endpoints in some of the experiments.
