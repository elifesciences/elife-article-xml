genetic elements that can profoundly impact the evolution of genomes and species. A long-standing hypothesis suggests that hybridization could deregulate TEs and trigger their accumulation, although it received mixed support from studies mostly in plants and animals. Here, we tested this hypothesis in fungi using incipient species of the undomesticated yeast <italic>Saccharomyces paradoxus</italic>. Population genomic data revealed no signature of higher transposition in natural hybrids. As we could not rule out the elimination of past transposition increase signatures by natural selection, we performed a laboratory evolution experiment on a panel of artificial hybrids to measure TE accumulation in the near absence of selection. Changes in TE copy numbers were not predicted by the level of evolutionary divergence between the parents of a hybrid genotype. Rather, they were highly dependent on the individual hybrid genotypes, showing that strong genotype-specific deterministic factors govern TE accumulation in yeast hybrids.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Hybrids arise when two populations of organisms that are related but genetically different mate and produce offspring. Hybridization has long been regarded as one of the many ways species evolve. Studying the changes in the genome that result from this process can provide insights into evolutionary history and predict the outcome of mixing between genetically different populations. In fact, the inability of two organisms to mate and produce viable and fertile hybrids has been used as a way to define species. It has been speculated that the infertility of many hybrids is due to short sequences of DNA in the genome called transposable elements. These elements are sequences of DNA that, when active, can move to a different position in the genome, causing mutations. It is thought that the process of hybridization may be activating transposable elements leading to the infertility often observed in hybrids.</p><p>The activation of transposable elements in hybrids has been studied in animals and plants, and usually, the hybrids studied were either generated in the laboratory or found in the wild. Fungal species, such as the yeast <italic>Saccharomyces paradoxus</italic>, have hundreds of wild strains, including many hybrids, and can also be crossed in the laboratory to produce new hybrids, allowing a combined approach to studying the activation of transposable elements. Hénault et al. used this yeast to investigate whether hybridization leads to increased activity of transposable elements in fungi.</p><p>To test this hypothesis, Hénault et al. analyzed the genomes of hundreds of natural strains of <italic>S. paradoxus</italic> to count and locate their transposable elements and establish evolutionary relationships between them. Next, they crossed different strains in the laboratory to see how the transposable elements would act upon hybridization.</p><p>If transposable elements were activated by hybridization, then hybrids would accumulate more transposable elements. However, the analyses did not show increased numbers of transposable elements in wild hybrids of <italic>S. paradoxus</italic>. This could be explained by an actual absence of transposable element activation, or by natural selection eliminating individuals that accumulate more transposable elements. To determine which is the case, Hénault et al. next recreated several hybrids in the laboratory and reproduced them for hundreds of generations. Hybrids were grown in the laboratory such that natural selection was almost incapable of favoring some yeasts over others, allowing the hybrids to accumulate transposable elements. These experiments revealed that hybrids accumulated transposable elements at different and largely unpredictable rates. Indeed, closely related hybrids often had highly different numbers of transposable elements in their genomes after being reproduced in the laboratory.</p><p>These observations indicate that the accumulation of transposable elements depends on various factors and cannot be easily predicted, and that hybridization may only be a small piece of the puzzle. Additionally, Hénault et al. demonstrated that undomesticated organisms like fungi can provide unique insights into evolutionary hypotheses.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Saccharomyces paradoxus</kwd><kwd>transposable elements</kwd><kwd>hybridization</kwd><kwd>fungi</kwd><kwd>experimental evolution</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000038</institution-id><institution>Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RGPIN-2015-03755</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Landry</surname><given-names>Christian R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000038</institution-id><institution>Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NSERC Alexander Graham-Bell doctoral scholarship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hénault</surname><given-names>Mathieu</given-names></name><name><surname>Charron</surname><given-names>Guillaume</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003151</institution-id><institution>Fonds de recherche du Québec – Nature et technologies</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>FRQNT doctoral scholarship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hénault</surname><given-names>Mathieu</given-names></name><name><surname>Charron</surname><given-names>Guillaume</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000156</institution-id><institution>Fonds de Recherche du Québec - Santé</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>FRQS postdoctoral scholarship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Marsit</surname><given-names>Souhir</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001804</institution-id><institution>Canada Research Chairs</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Canada Research Chair in Evolutionary Cell and Systems Biology</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Landry</surname><given-names>Christian R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Transposable elements are not reactivated in natural hybrids of the yeast <italic>Saccharomyces paradoxus</italic>, but their accumulation is genotype-specific and is not predicted by the evolutionary divergence between a hybrid's parents.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Hybridization is increasingly recognized as an important component of species evolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Mallet, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Mallet et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib118">Stukenbrock, 2016</xref>). Abundant empirical evidence shows that hybridization frequently leads to transgressive phenotypes in plants, animals, and fungi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Langdon et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Rieseberg et al., 1999</xref>). Mutation rates are traits for which transgressive segregation can have a major impact on the evolutionary fate of hybrids, with potential implications for the emergence of reproductive barriers and speciation. Insertions caused by transposable elements (TEs) are a class of mutations that could be particularly responsive to hybridization. TEs are diverse and ubiquitous DNA sequences that can duplicate and spread within genomes, forming families of dispersed repeated sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Bourque et al., 2018</xref>). They can either replicate through ‘copy-and-paste’ (retrotransposons) or ‘cut-and-paste’ (DNA transposons) mechanisms. TEs were first identified in cytological studies of chromosome instability in <italic>Zea mays</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">McClintock, 1950</xref>). In her seminal 1984 perspective, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">McClintock, 1984</xref> summarized evidence suggesting that TEs respond to various types of ‘genome shocks’, one of which she suspected was hybridization. Since McClintock’s early insights, many studies investigated the association between TEs and hybridization across taxonomic groups and documented increased TE activity in hybrids. We refer to this increase as TE reactivation, but our use of this term implies no mechanistic basis and other terms like derepression are used in the literature. Reactivation was evidenced by increased TE abundance, novel TE insertions, TE epigenetic changes or higher TE transcript levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Dion-Côté et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Kidwell et al., 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Labrador et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Liu and Wendel, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">O'Neill et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Picard, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib124">Ungerer et al., 2006</xref>). However, hybrid reactivation is not universal, as many studies across a similar taxonomic range found no evidence for it (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Coyne, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Göbel et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Hey, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Kawakami et al., 2011</xref>). In fungi, a recent preprint showed that no TE reactivation occurs in experimental interspecific hybrids between the yeasts <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> and <italic>Saccharomyces uvarum</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib117">Smukowski Heil et al., 2020</xref>). Thus, TE reactivation exhibits no clear taxonomic distribution, and the conditions favorable for its manifestation are still unclear.</p><p>Studies of hybrids in controlled crosses revealed genetic bases to TE reactivation, but less focus was put on cases of natural hybrids (but see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Kawakami et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib125">Ungerer et al., 2009</xref>). In addition to the genetic structure of populations, environmental pressures and demographic factors can influence the action of evolutionary forces on TEs, thus impacting the genomic landscapes of TEs in natural populations, including hybrids. Population genetic models have investigated the action of the major evolutionary forces on mean TE copy number (CN) per individual (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Charlesworth and Charlesworth, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Charlesworth and Langley, 1989</xref>). Three such forces are deterministic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Charlesworth et al., 1994</xref>). First, TE CN increases at a certain transposition rate, which incorporates the various forms of transposition regulation (either by the host or by TEs themselves). Second, TEs are removed from the genome at a certain excision rate. Third, most TE insertions are deleterious, such that individual fitness is assumed to be a decreasing function of CN and natural selection acts to purge TE insertions from populations. The fourth important force is genetic drift, a stochastic force that impacts the efficiency of natural selection by increasing the probability of fixation of deleterious mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Lynch, 2007</xref>). The intensity of drift is inversely proportional to the effective population size <italic>N<sub>e</sub></italic>. In populations with small <italic>N<sub>e</sub></italic>, drift renders natural selection inefficient, such that deleterious mutations are more likely to fix by chance. In principle, any of those evolutionary forces could affect hybrids in a way that differs from their parents, leading to hybrid-specific dynamics in the accumulation of TEs.</p><p>Population data in <italic>Drosophila</italic> indicate that deterministic forces have a predominant influence on the allele frequency spectrum of TE insertions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Charlesworth and Langley, 1989</xref>), consistent with a minimal contribution from drift. Among the deterministic forces, transposition rate is arguably the most likely to be impacted by hybridization, for instance if genetic incompatibilities impair transposition regulation mechanisms. A classic illustration of this is hybrid dysgenesis in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, a syndrome caused by mismatches between paternal TEs and egg-loaded pools of Piwi-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) that lead to inefficient TE repression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Brennecke et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Bucheton et al., 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Erwin et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">Rubin et al., 1982</xref>). Similarly, hybrids between <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> and <italic>Arabidopsis arenosa</italic> show overexpression of a TE family from the <italic>A. arenosa</italic> subgenome that is dependent on the ploidy level of the parental accessions involved, suggesting that dosage imbalance of epigenetic regulators causes reactivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Josefsson et al., 2006</xref>). It can also be expected that the number of genetic incompatibilities increases with genetic divergence, yielding a positive relationship between evolutionary divergence and TE deregulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Orr, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Parhad and Theurkauf, 2019</xref>). Additionally, evidence from <italic>Drosophila</italic> suggests that hybridization may impact excision rates for specific TE families (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Coyne, 1989</xref>). Along with these deterministic factors, reductions in natural selection efficiency should also be considered. Evidence from <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Lockton et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Lockton and Gaut, 2010</xref>), <italic>Caenorhabditis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Dolgin et al., 2008</xref>) and <italic>Daphnia</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib138">Ye et al., 2017</xref>) suggests that long-term differences in <italic>N<sub>e</sub></italic> caused by demography or mating system are associated with variation in TE content (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Lynch and Conery, 2003</xref>). A reduction in <italic>N<sub>e</sub></italic> can be expected when a novel hybrid lineage is formed. Indeed, it has been hypothesized that population bottlenecks inherent with hybrid speciation in <italic>Helianthus</italic> might have played a role in the accumulation of TEs through a decreased efficiency of purifying selection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib125">Ungerer et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>An emerging eukaryotic model system in ecological and evolutionary genomics is the yeast <italic>Saccharomyces paradoxus</italic>, the undomesticated sister species of the budding yeast <italic>S. cerevisiae. S. paradoxus</italic> has a complex admixture history in North America, making it an ideal model system to test hybridization-related evolutionary hypotheses in natural populations and in the laboratory (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Hénault et al., 2017</xref>).

Subsequent evolution can either leave the hybrid TE content unchanged, or drive it to increase or decrease. These changes can be driven by biases in transposition or excision rates or by variation in natural selection efficiency. Two complementary approaches can be used to investigate which factors drive TE dynamics in hybrids. First, genomic data from natural populations can be harnessed to understand how population structure, environmental pressures and natural selection efficiency shaped natural variation in TE content. Second, evolution experiments in laboratory controlled conditions (constant environment and relaxed natural selection) allow to test the effect of properties of artificial hybrid genotypes on TE accumulation, namely evolutionary divergence between parents and initial TE content.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-60474-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Ty elements showed no reactivation in hybrid lineages and contrasted abundances among pure lineages.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Bayesian phylogenetic tree of the North American <italic>Saccharomyces paradoxus</italic> lineages based on genome-wide SNPs.

These annotations revealed counts of full-length elements an order of magnitude lower than solo LTRs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>), consistent with previously reported data on <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> and <italic>S. paradoxus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Carr et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Goffeau et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Kim et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib139">Yue et al., 2017</xref>). To overcome the difficulty of comparing multiple families of short and often degenerated LTR sequences within a phylogenetic framework, we built intra-genome LTR sequence similarity networks. Sequences within the Ty1-Ty2 and Ty3p-Ty3 LTR family pairs were indistinguishable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>), in agreement with Ty2 and Ty3 being specific to <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Carr et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Naumov et al., 1992</xref>). Consequently, Ty2 and Ty3 LTR annotations were merged with Ty1 and Ty3p, respectively. Although they were clearly distinct, Ty4 and Tsu4 LTRs showed a close relatedness, which justified their combination into the Ty4/Tsu4 family. No Tsu4 LTR was annotated in the <italic>SpA</italic> genome, consistent with this family being specific to North American <italic>S. paradoxus</italic> and absent from Eurasian <italic>S. paradoxus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bergman, 2018</xref>).</p><p>Based on the assembly annotations, Ty1 was the most abundant family and exhibited the largest CN variation among lineages, with a striking difference between <italic>SpB</italic> and <italic>SpC</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref>). The generality of CN patterns revealed by genome assemblies was confirmed by normalized short-read depth (NRD) over Ty reference sequences for 207 natural diploid isolates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1a</xref>; PRJNA277692, PRJNA324830, PRJNA479851). The hybrid lineages <italic>SpC*</italic>, <italic>SpD<sub>1</sub></italic> and <italic>SpD<sub>2</sub></italic> had intermediate full-length Ty1 and Tsu4 CNs compared to their parental lineages, indicating no apparent persistent reactivation or maintenance of Ty elements in these lineages. Notably, Ty3p appeared extinct in all hybrid lineages, with no signal for internal sequences. The most outstanding profile was that of the pure lineage <italic>SpC</italic>, which had significantly higher full-length Ty1 and Ty3p CNs compared to the other lineages. For Tsu4, <italic>SpB</italic> was the lineage with the highest CN. Thus, lineage-wide CNs were consistent with an absence of reactivation in hybrids, the most contrasted profiles being found among pure lineages.</p><p>CNs alone may not reflect the actual dynamics of a TE family within a genome. For instance, a recently expanding family may not have had the time to reach the CN of another family (or the same family in a different lineage) that would be more abundant but at equilibrium. We thus explored the evolutionary dynamics of Ty families within each genome. If high CNs were caused by recent family expansions, they should be associated with a signature of low divergence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bergman and Bensasson, 2007</xref>). We used the sequence divergence to the most closely related LTR for each LTR annotation to approximate evolutionary divergence since transposition.

We defined Ty orthogroups from a whole-genome multiple alignment of the six assemblies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>). Most orthogroups were either private to one genome or conserved across the six (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>), suggesting that a major fraction of Ty insertion polymorphisms segregated at low frequency in North American lineages. This was consistent with studies in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> showing that insertions are mostly fixed or at low frequency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bleykasten-Grosshans et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Carr et al., 2012</xref>). Private orthogroups comprised LTRs that had low divergence, consistent with recent transposition activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). Private orthogroups were significantly enriched in full-length Ty1 elements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>), including in hybrid lineages. This indicated that all lineages had active transposition for at least some Ty families. It also suggested that an absence of transposition in hybrid lineages could not explain the absence of reactivation. We called lineage-wide insertion polymorphisms from discordant mappings of the 207 short read libraries to estimate the distribution of insertion allele frequencies. This calling method is noisy and only allows to call non-reference alleles, but should nevertheless provide rough estimates of the insertion allele frequency spectra. Principal component analysis (PCA) on non-reference insertions yielded the expected grouping of strains into well-defined lineages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>). The allele frequency distributions showed a similar excess of very-low-frequency alleles for the six lineages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>), suggesting that Ty elements were subject to largely uniform evolutionary forces across lineages.</p><p>We focused on the most abundant Ty1 to investigate the transposition dynamics in a phylogenetic framework (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Le Rouzic et al., 2013</xref>). Bayesian phylogenetic trees of Ty1 LTRs were converted into ultrametric phylogenies to approximate the timing of branching events using a conserved Ty4 LTR orthogroup as an outgroup. Branching times revealed that lineages had largely similar Ty1 dynamics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c</xref>). Due to the shortness of LTR sequences, most branches collapsed with the outgroup, indicating an expected saturation of the molecular substitution signal. A focus on recent dynamics revealed a clear expansion signature in <italic>SpC</italic> that was shared by <italic>SpC*</italic> and, to a lesser extent, by <italic>SpD<sub>1</sub></italic> and <italic>SpD<sub>2</sub></italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c</xref>), which was reflected by the peaks of young private and full-length elements. This suggests that any recent expansion signature in hybrid lineages can be largely explained by inheritance from their <italic>SpC</italic>-related parent. The rapid expansion in <italic>SpC</italic> and <italic>SpC*</italic> can be contrasted with the more gradual expansion in <italic>SpA</italic>, which harbored the second highest Ty1 CN. This contrasted with the assumption that TE abundances can be interpreted as equilibrium CNs under the transposition-selection balance hypothesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Charlesworth and Charlesworth, 1983</xref>) and rather suggested a recent transposition rate increase in <italic>SpC</italic>-related lineages.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Population structure best explains TE content variation, with minor contributions from climatic variation</title><p>Our results showed that hybrid lineages exhibited no outstanding Ty CN profiles or sequence dynamics. However, potential hybrid-specific differences in transposition rate might be masked by other factors that can be expected to impact Ty dynamics. To exclude this possibility, we investigated which factors best explain the variation in Ty CN in natural lineages. First, population structure incorporates both host-encoded (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Curcio et al., 2015</xref>) and Ty-encoded (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Czaja et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">Saha et al., 2015</xref>) determinants of Ty transposition rates. Second, environmental factors can influence Ty transposition rate, as demonstrated by temperature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Paquin and Williamson, 1984</xref>) and nitrogen starvation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Morillon et al., 2000</xref>) for Ty1 in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>. If hybrid lineages experience distinct environmental conditions in nature, this may impact their transposition rates. Finally, the efficiency at which natural selection purges deleterious Ty insertions (which depends on <italic>N<sub>e</sub></italic>) could vary between lineages, ultimately affecting the transposition-selection balance. To help discriminate global from lineage-specific patterns arising from these factors, analyses with all lineages aggregated were complemented by lineage-specific analyses. However, hybrid lineages were represented by relatively few strains (≤10 in each case), which made it hard to reach meaningful conclusions for some analyses. Thus, some of the lineage-specific analyses were focused on the more abundant <italic>SpB</italic> and <italic>SpC</italic> pure lineages.</p><p>We first investigated the relative contribution of population structure and environmental factors. We combined genome-wide single nucleotide variants from our population genomic data with climatic (temperature, precipitation, solar radiation, vapor pressure, wind) and water balance data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abatzoglou et al., 2018</xref>). We reduced the dimensionality of both datasets by PCA, using coordinates on the major principal components (PCs) to describe population structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>) and climatic variation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref>). We then fitted linear models to compare how genotypes-based PCs (gPCs) and environment-based PCs (ePCs) can explain CN variation in Ty1, Ty3p and Tsu4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref>). Globally, gPCs reached higher levels of statistical significance as linear predictors of CN compared to ePCs. gPC1 both explained a high proportion of variance (52%, 9% and 36% for all lineages, <italic>SpB</italic> and <italic>SpC</italic>, respectively; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>) and was a highly significant linear predictor of Ty1 CN. Linear models that explained Ty CNs with both gPCs and ePCs had generally lower Akaike information criterion (AIC) values than models that included only gPCs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1b</xref>), suggesting that climatic variables have modest although significant contributions in explaining CN variation. Unsupervised clustering of strains along gPCs consistently yielded more homogeneous clusters than ePCs in terms of Ty CN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4</xref>). Overall, these results show that the genetic structure of North American <italic>S. paradoxus</italic> is generally a much better predictor of Ty CNs across lineages than climatic variables. Since locations where hybrid lineages were sampled have climatic profiles similar to pure lineages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>), exposure to specific environmental conditions appears unlikely to explain the absence of observable Ty reactivation in hybrid lineages.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Associations between population structure, climatic variables and Ty CNs for all lineages (left), <italic>SpB</italic> only (middle), or <italic>SpC</italic> only (right).</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Linear models fitted on Ty CNs with gPCs and ePCs as independent variables.

Natural selection acts to purge deleterious insertions, and its efficiency depends on the strength of genetic drift opposing it (which is inversely proportional to <italic>N<sub>e</sub></italic>). Ty reactivation in hybrid lineages might be counterbalanced by higher efficiency of natural selection in these lineages, although there is no a priori reason to expect higher <italic>N<sub>e</sub></italic> in hybrids.

While pure lineages did exhibit variation in π<sub>S</sub> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1c</xref>), there was no obvious negative relationship between Ty CNs and π<sub>S</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>), as would be expected under a transposition-selection equilibrium (assuming negligible variation in mutation rate). For instance, nucleotide diversity was higher in <italic>SpC</italic> than in <italic>SpA</italic>, while <italic>SpC</italic> exhibited the highest Ty1 and Ty3p CN. While these rough <italic>N<sub>e</sub></italic> estimates should be interpreted with caution, they suggested that natural selection efficiency is likely not the main determinant in CN variation. However, our data indicated that some Ty families experienced recent expansions and thus may not be at equilibrium. Recent hybrid lineages also cannot be meaningfully characterized by long-term <italic>N<sub>e</sub></italic>, further limiting the usefulness of π<sub>S</sub> as a measure of the efficiency of natural selection.</p><p>We can expect that most of the fitness effects associated with TE insertions are caused by alterations of host functions encoded in <italic>cis</italic>. Perhaps the TE insertions with the largest functional alteration potential are those which interrupt ORFs of host genes. Across the six genome assemblies, no Ty insertion was found to interrupt an ORF. Lineage-wide Ty insertion calls revealed four Ty insertions predicted to be within host ORFs, three of which are found in <italic>SpC</italic> strains and one in <italic>SpB</italic>. All the ORF-disrupting insertions were private alleles, and in all cases the strain harboring them had a CN higher than the median of its lineage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>). Examination of depth of coverage at these four loci revealed narrow peaks in the corresponding strains that were consistent with target site duplications (TSDs) arising from Ty integration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplements 3</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s6">6</xref>). The absence of ORF-disrupting Ty insertions in hybrid lineages and their scarcity in pure lineages suggest that natural selection is globally very efficient at purging these mutations.</p><p>The number of ORF-disrupting Ty insertion alleles in <italic>SpC</italic> (three) compared to <italic>SpB</italic> (one) suggested a slight overrepresentation in <italic>SpC</italic>, which could be explained by a bias towards the accumulation of deleterious insertion alleles in this lineage. To test this hypothesis, we examined the functional annotations of the corresponding genes. There were striking patterns of functional relatedness among genes harboring an ORF-disrupting insertion. Two <italic>SpC</italic> strains had independent Ty1 insertions at different loci within YDL024C (<italic>DIA3</italic>, which encodes a protein of unknown function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Palecek et al., 2000</xref>]), as evidenced by the corresponding TSDs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s4">Figure 5—figure supplement 4</xref>). The two other genes were involved in resistance to arsenic compounds: 16_037 (<italic>SpB</italic>) had a Tsu4 insertion in YPR200C (<italic>ARR2</italic>, which encodes an arsenate reductase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Mukhopadhyay and Rosen, 1998</xref>], <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s5">Figure 5—figure supplement 5</xref>), while LL2011_004 (<italic>SpC</italic>) had a Ty1 insertion disrupting YPR201W (<italic>ARR3</italic>, which encodes an arsenite/H<sup>+</sup> antiporter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib136">Wysocki et al., 1997</xref>], <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s6">Figure 5—figure supplement 6</xref>). This functional relatedness could be explained by positive selection; however, this scenario is incompatible with the extremely low frequency at which these insertions segregate. Thus, the most parsimonious explanations for these patterns appears to be either a mutational bias favoring Ty insertions at these loci or fitness effects too small to be visible to natural selection.</p><p>We investigated the fitness effect of the ORF-disrupting Ty1 insertion in <italic>ARR3</italic> by measuring the growth of a collection of 123 <italic>S. paradoxus</italic> strains in culture medium supplemented with arsenite (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s7">Figure 5—figure supplement 7</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s8">Figure 5—figure supplement 8</xref>). Growth in 0.8 mM sodium meta-arsenite (NaAsO<sub>2</sub>) showed significant variation between lineages (mixed design ANOVA, p=9.54 × 10<sup>−39</sup>), and more total variance was explained by variation between lineages (lineages: 86.58%, strains: 10.20%, residuals: 3.22%). <italic>SpC</italic> and <italic>SpC*</italic> lineages exhibited poor growth in 0.8 mM arsenite compared to <italic>SpB</italic> and <italic>SpA</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a</xref>).

This indicated that the disruption of a major gene involved in arsenite resistance had no further deleterious effect on the poor growth ability of <italic>SpC</italic>-related strains in presence of arsenite. The absence of growth defect in arsenite for LL2011_004, combined with the extremely low frequencies of all the ORF-disrupting alleles, suggests that these insertions are effectively neutral and are not observed because of an important reduction in purifying selection efficiency.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Genomic patterns of Ty insertions indicate that natural selection efficiency cannot explain CN variation in natural lineages.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Difference between growth curves in 0.8 mM NaAsO<sub>2</sub> (As) and control medium (synthetic complete, SC).

Ty elements contain many transcription factor binding sites and can affect the expression levels of adjacent genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Morillon et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Coney and Roeder, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib122">Todeschini et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Lesage and Todeschini, 2005</xref>). Dosage-sensitive and functionally central genes should on average be subject to stronger selection against mutations that affect their regulation. For instance, in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, genes that are essential or that have many protein physical interactions were shown to be depleted in eQTLs, i.e. variants that affect expression levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Albert et al., 2018</xref>). However, the association of Ty insertions with regulatory effects on adjacent genes is expected to be highly variable, as transcriptional effects are known to depend on the location, orientation and nucleotide sequence of the inserted element (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Coney and Roeder, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Lesage and Todeschini, 2005</xref>). Nevertheless, if selection efficiency explains a significant part of Ty CN variation, we reason that when CNs are high (i.e. at low <italic>N<sub>e</sub></italic>), Ty insertions should be more frequently observed near genes which properties reflect stronger dosage and functional constraints, compared to when CNs are low (i.e. at high <italic>N<sub>e</sub></italic>). Focusing on the Ty insertions private to each lineage, we found no significant difference in the proportion of neighboring genes annotated as essential in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> (p&gt;0.05, pairwise Fisher’s exact tests, FDR correction), although <italic>SpC</italic> did exhibit the highest essential to non-essential ratio (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5c</xref>). Distributions of physical distance to neighboring genes were similar across lineages, as were distributions of relative orientation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s10">Figure 5—figure supplement 10</xref>). Additionally, genes neighboring Ty insertions private to <italic>SpC</italic> show no bias towards more protein physical interactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5d</xref>, p&gt;0.05, pairwise two-tailed Mann-Whitney U tests, FDR correction). We fitted the ratio of non-synonymous to synonymous substitutions (ω) to each neighboring gene to estimate the strength of purifying selection on protein-coding sequences. The ω distributions for genes neighboring private Ty insertions exhibited no significant bias (p&gt;0.05, pairwise two-tailed Mann-Whitney U tests, FDR correction). In particular, the distribution in <italic>SpC</italic> exhibited no skew towards lower values, suggesting no association with genes under strong purifying selection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5e</xref>). Notably, genes harboring ORF-disrupting insertions show little protein physical interactions and no signature of purifying selection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5d–e</xref>).</p><p>We next investigated whether lineage-specific selection signatures on genes are associated with Ty insertions. We used the RELAX branch-site codon model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib133">Wertheim et al., 2015</xref>) to derive estimates of selection intensity (<italic>k</italic>) along individual gene trees. Within the RELAX framework, <italic>k</italic> &lt; 1 indicates relaxed selection and <italic>k</italic> &gt; 1 indicates strengthened (positive or purifying) selection. We define Δ<italic>k</italic> = <italic>k<sub>SpB</sub>−k<sub>SpC</sub></italic>, corresponding to the difference between the average <italic>k</italic> values for clades comprising <italic>SpB</italic> and <italic>SpC</italic> strains, respectively. Overall, the distribution of Δ<italic>k</italic> values for genes neighboring private <italic>SpC</italic> insertions was very similar to that for conserved insertions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5f</xref>), while the distribution for private <italic>SpB</italic> insertions was slightly biased toward genes relaxed in <italic>SpB</italic>. For both <italic>SpB</italic> and <italic>SpC</italic>, there were more private insertions adjacent to genes experiencing relaxed selection in the corresponding lineage, although comparisons with conserved insertions were not statistically significant (p&gt;0.05, Fisher’s exact tests, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5g</xref>). This is consistent with efficient purifying selection acting against insertions near genes in both lineages. While genes harboring ORF-disrupting insertions have signatures of stronger selection in <italic>SpC</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5e</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s11">Figure 5—figure supplement 11</xref>), this observation is mitigated by their far-right position in the ω distribution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5d</xref>). Overall, these results show that variation in natural selection efficiency is unlikely to explain a large part of the variation in Ty CNs in natural lineages.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>TE content variation in experimental evolution under relaxed selection reveal no systematic effect of hybridization but major effects of individual genotypes</title><p>Thus far, our results showed that no reactivation is apparent in natural hybrid lineages, that population structure over environmental variables best explains variation in Ty CNs and that natural selection efficiency is unlikely to explain much variation in Ty genomic landscapes. However, natural selection seems equally efficient at purging deleterious Ty insertions in all lineages, leaving the possibility that strong purifying selection could mask any reactivation in hybrids. Transient reactivation may also be followed by rapid re-establishment of host repression and leave little to no signature in contemporary genomes. Moreover, natural hybrids are somewhat limited in their ability to uncover the interplay between hybridization and transposition, as they are relatively recent introgressed lineages that resulted from admixture between closely related lineages. To systematically explore the effect of hybridization on Ty transposition rates, we performed a large-scale mutation accumulation (MA) experiment on 11 artificial hybrid backgrounds, eight of which were previously published (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Charron et al., 2019</xref>). A MA experiment with yeast consists in subjecting a population to periodic single-cell bottlenecks (typically during hundreds to thousands of mitotic generations) by repeatedly streaking one randomly chosen isolated colony, thus amplifying genetic drift and making natural selection inefficient (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Lynch et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6a</xref>). <italic>S. paradoxus</italic> was inferred to reproduce mitotically 99.9% of the time in the wild (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib123">Tsai et al., 2008</xref>), making MA experiments a reasonably realistic approximation of its natural life cycle. Pairs of haploid derivatives of natural <italic>S. paradoxus</italic> and <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> strains were chosen to span a range of evolutionary divergence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6b</xref>), yielding four categories of intraspecific crosses (from the least to the most divergent): <italic>SpC</italic> × <italic>SpC</italic> (CC), <italic>SpB</italic> × <italic>SpB</italic> (BB), <italic>SpB</italic> × <italic>SpC</italic> (BC) and <italic>SpB</italic> × <italic>SpA</italic> (BA); and one category of interspecific crosses: <italic>SpB</italic> × <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> (BSc; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6c</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1d-f</xref>). The crosses used also spanned a range of variation in parental Ty CNs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6d</xref>).

Focusing on full-length Ty1, Ty3p, and Tsu4, no global trend emerged from the variation of NRD before and after MA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6e</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1f</xref>). Mixed effects linear models fitting cross-specific intercepts and slopes showed no statistically significant support for a global effect of time on CNs. Nevertheless, specific combinations of crosses and Ty families showed significant differences in either central tendency or variance. Often, crosses within a category of parental strain divergence showed contrasting patterns. For example, although CC1, CC2, and CC3 are genetically very similar <italic>SpC</italic> × <italic>SpC</italic> crosses, only CC1 exhibits a significant decrease in Ty1 and Tsu4 CNs. There were also cases of opposite trends within the same category of cross, for instance Ty1 CN in BC and BA crosses. This showed that individual parental genotypes, even if they are evolutionarily closely related, can have very different dynamics, both in sign and magnitude.</p><p>We next sought to understand how these dynamics are determined by properties of the different hybrid genotypes tested. We fitted linear models to the variation in CN between T<sub>ini</sub> and T<sub>end</sub> (ΔCN), using the sum of CNs of both parental strains of a cross and the evolutionary divergence between them as independent variables. Although these models explain little global variance (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.40, 0.08, and 0.06 for Ty1, Ty3p, and Tsu4, respectively), we found that neither independent variable was a significant predictor of ΔCN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6f</xref>). Only Tsu4 showed a slightly positive regression slope with respect to evolutionary divergence, and none of them was statistically significant, indicating that divergence between parents of a hybrid has no large influence on its CN dynamics. On the other hand, Ty1 ΔCN had a negative relationship with parental Ty1 CN and was marginally significant (p=0.056), suggesting that the initial CN of a hybrid genotype can dictate the sign and magnitude of its CN change. However, this result should be interpreted with care as some of the crosses shared common parental strains and were thus not entirely independent. This relatedness may in fact explain part of the pattern seen for Ty1. Crosses that shared the <italic>SpB</italic> parental strain UWOPS-91–202 (BB2, BC2, BA2, BSc2) seemed to have systematically higher Ty1 ΔCN values than the corresponding crosses that shared the <italic>SpB</italic> parental strain MSH-604 (BB1, BC1, BA1, BSc1). UWOPS-91–202 appeared to be a naturally Ty-less strain, as no full-length element was found for any family in its genome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6d</xref>). Previous reports of such Ty-less strains were shown to be permissive to the accumulation of Ty elements when assayed in the laboratory using a reporter assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Czaja et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Garfinkel et al., 2003</xref>). This observation also supports the hypothesis that genotype-specific characteristics can be major determinants of variation in Ty CN.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The literature on TE reactivation in hybrids demonstrates its relevance to the field of speciation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib113">Serrato-Capuchina and Matute, 2018</xref>). Reactivation can be a source of postzygotic reproductive isolation by compromising genome stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Dion-Côté and Barbash, 2017</xref>), which translates into a spectrum of deleterious hybrid phenotypes spanning sterility, developmental abnormalities and inviability. Many studies investigated the TE reactivation hypothesis at the interspecific level and yielded equivocal evidence. For instance, mixed evidence for TE reactivation was found within the <italic>Drosophila</italic> genus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Coyne, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Hey, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Labrador et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib130">Vela et al., 2014</xref>), where reactivation seems to depend on the species pair involved. On the other hand, three well-established hybrid species that emerged from parallel hybridization between the same species pair in the genus <italic>Helianthus</italic> all exhibit important reactivation of LTR retrotransposons, both at the genomic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib125">Ungerer et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib124">Ungerer et al., 2006</xref>) and transcriptomic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Renaut et al., 2014</xref>) levels. However, a study of hybrid zones between the two parental species revealed that no reactivation is apparent in recent hybrid populations, casting doubt on the idea that hybridization alone triggered reactivation and suggesting the involvement of other factors like abiotic stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Kawakami et al., 2011</xref>). Overall, this data nuances the hypothesis that hybridization could act as a systematic trigger of TE proliferation and reproductive isolation.</p><p>In this study, we used population genomic data on North American lineages of the yeast <italic>S. paradoxus</italic> to test whether TEs were reactivated in natural hybrids. It was previously shown that these lineages experienced two hybridization events that resulted in the establishment of admixed lineages that have partial postzygotic reproductive isolation with their respective parental lineages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Eberlein et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Leducq et al., 2016</xref>). We found no evidence of TE reactivation in any of these natural hybrid lineages. Our data showed that while some hybrid lineages may have relatively high CNs and exhibit evolutionary dynamics consistent with recent expansions, these signatures were never more pronounced than that of their parental lineages (<italic>SpC</italic> in the case of <italic>SpC*</italic> and <italic>SpC*</italic> in the case of <italic>SpD<sub>1</sub></italic> and <italic>SpD<sub>2</sub></italic>). Moreover, our analyses suggest that environmental and demographic factors are unlikely to be major factors affecting TE CNs in natural lineages, which therefore likely reflect the underlying transposition rates. Our observations would seem consistent with a role of TE reactivation in speciation, as natural hybrids with high levels of reactivation would likely be unobserved. However, they contrast with long-established hybrid species in <italic>Helianthus</italic>, showing that reactivation and long-term maintenance can be compatible.</p><p>We note that the analysis of contemporary genomes is inherently limited in the ability to uncover transient reactivation that would immediately follow hybridization and rapidly faint, perhaps as a result of a re-establishment of TE repression. However, this scenario may be unlikely in yeast, given the absence of many epigenetic and post-transcriptional repression mechanisms (see discussion below) that can yield such a rapid re-establishment in other species. For instance, the re-establishment of piRNA-mediated P element repression in <italic>Drosophila</italic> P-M dysgenic hybrids occurs in single female individuals because paternally inherited piRNA clusters become expressed as they age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Khurana et al., 2011</xref>). If a hypothetical re-establishment of Ty repression was rather driven by selection for genomic variants, this should result in a gradual improvement of repression with time. Our data provides no support for this hypothesis, as younger hybrid lineages <italic>SpD<sub>1</sub></italic> and <italic>SpD<sub>2</sub></italic> do not show more pronounced signatures of recent Ty expansion compared to the older <italic>SpC*</italic> lineage. Additionally, Ty CNs of artificial hybrids at the initial time point of our MA experiment (i.e. early after hybridization) generally show good agreement with the expectation from their parental haploid strains, which is incompatible with an early reactivation of Ty elements.</p><p>Many factors are susceptible to determine whether a hybrid genotype exhibits reactivation or not. According to the Bateson-Dobzhansky-Muller (BDM) model, genetic incompatibilities should accumulate as populations diverge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Orr, 1995</xref>). Additionally, the evolutionary conflict between host genomes and TEs results in an arms race that can accelerate the evolution of the genes involved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Blumenstiel et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib128">Van Valen, 1973</xref>). Thus, it can be expected that incompatibilities affecting transposition rates are more likely to be observed in hybrids between highly diverged genotypes compared to closely related ones. Here, we report data from MA experiments on artificial hybrids that probe the relationship between evolutionary divergence and transposition rates. We show that contrary to the expectation from the BDM model, hybrids between more divergent genotypes exhibit no deregulation of TEs. This conclusion is consistent with recent results from Smukowski Heil and colleagues, who showed that no Ty1 reactivation occurs in experimental interspecific hybrids between <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> and <italic>S. uvarum</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib117">Smukowski Heil et al., 2020</xref>). Instead of reactivation, many hybrid genotypes exhibited marked decreases in TE CNs after evolution. This trend is especially important for Ty3p, as eight out of ten genotypes exhibit a negative change in median CN. Ty3p is also the least abundant Ty family in natural lineages, as it is found in rarely more than ~5 copies and extinct in all hybrid strains sampled. Such low abundance families are likely more prone to extinction, as stochastic fluctuation in CN would more frequently lead to the loss of all copies. Stochastic loss of Ty copies may come from intra-element LTR recombination or loss of heterozygosity at a locus where a Ty element is present in one parent only, although the mechanistic causes of CN decrease remain to be investigated. This result also seems consistent with the reported Ty CN decrease in mitotically propagated experimental populations of <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bast et al., 2019</xref>), suggesting a potential intrinsic bias towards TE loss. However, it should be noted that the latter study used haploid populations in a regime with efficient natural selection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">McDonald et al., 2016</xref>), thus limiting the relevance of comparisons with our results.</p><p>Transposition is a complex cellular process, with multiple steps regulated by both TEs and host genomes. Genetic screens in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> revealed that genes involved in multiple cellular functions (chromatin organization, transcription, translation, RNA and protein metabolism) affect Ty1 transposition rate, either positively or negatively (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Curcio et al., 2015</xref>). Thus, it is possible that divergent hybrids suffer from misregulation at different steps of the transposition process that have antagonistic effects, such that they cancel out at the level of transposition rates. It is also possible that such antagonistic interactions exist between transposition and excision rates, yielding no net change in CN. Answering these questions will require a thorough investigation of novel Ty insertion loci in the MA lines, which is beyond the scope of this study. Transposition regulation being a polygenic trait with a large mutational target is also consistent with the strong genotype specificity we observed in our artificial hybrids. Some of the contrasted dynamics between crosses that share high genetic similarity might originate from cryptic genetic variation in genes involved in Ty regulation, whose effect on transposition rate would be uncovered in hybrids.</p><p>TEs are structurally very diverse and populate the genomes of a vast range of species, and the control mechanisms in response to their mobilization may exhibit a correspondingly large diversity. In many eukaryotes, TEs are repressed epigenetically through mechanisms that include DNA methylation, chromatin modification, and mRNA degradation, processes in which small RNAs play central roles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Lisch, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib115">Slotkin and Martienssen, 2007</xref>). In many fungi, TE repression acts via multiple mechanisms involving RNA interference (RNAi) or cytosine methylation, including repeat-induced point mutation (RIP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Gladyshev, 2017</xref>). Notably, introgressed species of the fungal genus <italic>Coccidioides</italic> harbor genomic signatures of efficient RIP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Neafsey et al., 2010</xref>), suggesting that this mechanism may remain active in the face of hybridization. Unlike other eukaryotes, <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> and its closely related species lost the genes of the RNAi pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Drinnenberg et al., 2009</xref>) and have no cytosine methylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Proffitt et al., 1984</xref>). Instead, <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> Ty1 has a potent self-repression mechanism, with a strength that depends on the actual Ty1 CN in the host genome (thus termed CN control, CNC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Garfinkel et al., 2003</xref>). CNC is a post-transcriptional mechanism that relies on p22, an N-truncated form of the Gag (p49) Ty1-encoded capsid protein which is translated from an alternative transcript of Ty1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">Saha et al., 2015</xref>). p22 inhibits transposition by interfering with the assembly of the cytoplasmic virus-like particles that are essential to the replication cycle of Ty1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">Saha et al., 2015</xref>). This unique repression mechanism may explain some of the patterns we observed in the artificial hybrids. In particular, our data suggests a negative relationship between the initial Ty1 CN in hybrid genotypes and the change in Ty1 CN between the onset and the end of the MA experiment. This pattern seems consistent with an efficient action of CNC, although our results would then suggest that CNC efficiency is largely independent of the degree of evolutionary divergence between the subgenomes of a hybrid. This contrasts with the recent finding that interspecific sequence divergence in p22 has a dramatic impact on the action of CNC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Czaja et al., 2020</xref>), although such impact is likely mitigated by the generally much lower divergence levels in our crosses. Thus, further experimental work is needed to disentangle the mechanistic contributions of Ty1 CN and sequence divergence in the regulation of transposition rates in <italic>Saccharomyces</italic> hybrids.</p><p>In conclusion, our work illustrates how the use of natural model systems that are amenable to experimental investigations can bring novel insights on long-standing evolutionary hypotheses. Our results show that natural hybrid lineages of the wild yeast <italic>S. paradoxus</italic> exhibit no TE reactivation and suggest that dynamics of TE content evolution in hybrids depend on deterministic factors that evolutionary divergence between parents can hardly predict.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Reagent type (species) <break/>or resource</th><th valign="top">Designation</th><th valign="top">Source or reference</th><th valign="top">Identifiers</th><th valign="top">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Sequence-based reagent</td><td valign="top">Forward primer to construct <break/>the deletion cassette for <break/>the <italic>ADE2</italic> gene in <italic>SpC</italic></td><td valign="top"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Charron et al., 2019</xref></td><td valign="top">CLOP97-F5</td><td valign="top">acaattaaggaatcaagaaaccgt <break/>gataaaaaattcaagt <break/>CAGCTGAAGCTTCGTACGC</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Sequence-based reagent</td><td valign="top">Reverse primer to construct <break/>the deletion cassette for <break/>the <italic>ADE2</italic> gene in <italic>SpC</italic></td><td valign="top"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Charron et al., 2019</xref></td><td valign="top">CLOP97-F6</td><td valign="top">gtaattgttcgctggccaagtata <break/>ttaatacatttatata <break/>GCATAGGCCACTAGTGGATC</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Strain, strain background <break/>(<italic>Saccharomyces paradoxus</italic>)</td><td valign="top">Haploid parent for MA lines</td><td valign="top"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Charron et al., 2014</xref></td><td valign="top">LL2011_001 <italic>MATa hoΔ::kanMX4</italic></td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Strain, strain background <break/>(<italic>Saccharomyces paradoxus</italic>)</td><td valign="top">Haploid parent for MA lines</td><td valign="top"><italic>This study</italic></td><td valign="top">LL2011_001 <italic>MATa</italic> <break/><italic>hoΔ::kanMX4 ade2Δ::hphNT1</italic></td><td valign="top">Haploid yeast strain with <italic>ho</italic> <break/>and <italic>ade2</italic> deletions. <break/>See Materials and methods <break/>section <italic>Mutation accumulation</italic></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Strain, strain background <break/>(<italic>Saccharomyces paradoxus</italic>)</td><td valign="top">Haploid parent for MA lines</td><td valign="top"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Leducq et al., 2016</xref></td><td valign="top">LL2011_012 <italic>MATa hoΔ::kanMX4</italic></td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Strain, strain background <break/>(<italic>Saccharomyces paradoxus</italic>)</td><td valign="top">Haploid parent for MA lines</td><td valign="top"><italic>This study</italic></td><td valign="top">LL2011_012 <italic>MATa</italic> <break/><italic>hoΔ::kanMX4 ade2Δ::hphNT1</italic></td><td valign="top">Haploid yeast strain with <italic>ho</italic> and <break/><italic>ade2</italic> deletions.

To avoid spurious effects arising from log transformation of very sparse coverage, CN values lower than −1.25 were replaced by −1.25 as for MA lines (see below). In each case, PCs explaining a cumulative sum of 80% of the total variance in the dataset were kept and named gPCs (from PCAs on SNP data) or ePCs (from PCAs on climatic variables). Ordinary least squares models were fitted using the Python package statsmodels version 0.10.1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib112">Seabold and Perktold, 2010</xref>). Two types of models were fitted: OLS using both gPCs and ePCs as predictors, and OLS using only gPCs as predictors. The quality of the two model types was compared using their AIC values. Strains were clustered according to their coordinates on gPCs using the AffinityPropagation algorithm from scikit-learn with parameters max_iter=10,000 damping=0.8, and subsequently according to their coordinates on ePCs using the KMeans algorithm from scikit-learn with the same number of clusters fitted for gPCs.

A randomly selected subset of 34 strains from the 207 wild strains were chosen. The VCF matrix from the SNP calling step above was used to derive the DNA sequences of protein-coding genes in these 34 strains.

activity. It seems that in contrast to what has been suggested previously, hybrids do not always show an elevated transposon activity, and that the genetic background (and complex interactions between alleles/mutations) may be a more important influence on transposon activity.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;The effect of hybridization on transposable element accumulation in an undomesticated fungal species&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Patricia Wittkopp as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Douda Bensasson (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>We would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). Specifically, when editors judge that a submitted work as a whole belongs in <italic>eLife</italic> but that some conclusions require a modest amount of additional new data, as they do with your paper, we are asking that the manuscript be revised to either limit claims to those supported by data in hand, or to explicitly state that the relevant conclusions require additional supporting data.</p><p>Our expectation is that the authors will eventually carry out the additional experiments and report on how they affect the relevant conclusions either in a preprint on bioRxiv or medRxiv, or if appropriate, as a Research Advance in <italic>eLife</italic>, either of which would be linked to the original paper.</p><p>All reviewers appreciate the relevance and scientific rigor of your study. Still, all reviewers also agree that, despite the large body of work presented here, it may not be possible to conclude that hybridization never induces Ty activity (or reduces repression of Ty activity), as this may depend on the exact nature (evolutionary distance, specific alleleles…) of the parental genomes. While you are very careful with interpreting the results, we would ask you to more explicitly discuss these possible alternative scenarios.</p><p>Two reviewers also suggested using established reporter assays to directly measure Ty activity in hybrids. In principle, these are very easy experiments that would, in our opinion, provide a fantastic way to consolidate the conclusions. However, we want to leave it up to you to decide whether you want to include this in the current manuscript.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>In this paper, Hénault and colleagues investigate the hypothesis that transposons (Ty elements) may become more active in hybrids. They first explore the genomes of natural hybrid <italic>S. paradoxus</italic> lineages and do not find evidence for elevated Ty activity in hybrid lineages, although some strains exhibit signs of higher Ty activity than others. Next, a mutation-accumulation experiment where Ty activity is measured in 6 lineages of hybrids with varying degrees of heterozygosity further confirms these findings.</p><p>Overall, this is a well-written and interesting study that helps to gain further insight into the factors that control transposon activity. The results suggest that, in contrast to what has been suggested previously, at least not all hybrids show an elevated transposon activity, and that the genetic background (and complex interactions between alleles/mutations) may be a more important factor. That said, I am a bit puzzled by the way the problem was approached – I appreciate that forensics of natural genomes is perhaps the best way to investigate a natural genetic phenomenon, but it obviously also has shortcomings. The lab experiments are a great addition, but there I cannot help but wondering whether using reporter systems for Ty activity (e.g. the typical systems with fluorescent reporters that have an intron) would have not been a more efficient way to measure Ty activity in thousands of different (artificial and natural) hybrids? Perhaps substance for a follow-up study…</p><p>Specific questions and concerns:</p><p>I wonder to what extent the genome analysis (i.e. the first part of the paper) depends on how long ago the hybridization events occurred. It seems plausible that if Ty elements become more active, this effect is the biggest immediately after the hybridization, and disappears over time as the genome re-establishes suppression of Ty activity. Would this influence the findings? It seems useful to discuss this in the text.</p><p>I suspect that using third-position codon diversity is a rather poor estimate of an effective population size, especially over longer periods of time? If this is the case, perhaps the results using this analysis should be interpreted with even more caution?</p><p>Is it necessarily true that the overrepresentation of ORF-disrupting Ty insertions in the <italic>SpC</italic> lineage points at a bias towards more deleterious insertions? Are the numbers strong enough to exclude noise? Or could selection be lower/more recent here?</p><p>Is it necessarily true that we expect a negative correlation between Ty insertions near essential genes and a lower purifying selection? Could noise play a role? And, how strong is the effect that a mutation (or more accurately, a Ty insertion) near an essential gene is on average more deleterious? Do we know how far that effect stretches from the gene, and was this taken into account in the analysis?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>I think the topic is very interesting, the work is well done, and the manuscript is well written (maybe can be shorten). Overall, the message is that the hybridisation does not trigger TE expansion in yeast and is supported by population genomics and experimental evolution data. I have two main points:</p><p>1) Did the authors were too conservative with their hybrid design and crossed populations that were too similar? I guess their rational is to mimic what they isolated in nature, but maybe if they look at the <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> x <italic>S. paradoxus</italic> crosses that they published before, this might change.</p><p>2) I think the natural strains described in the first part of the paper and used for the crossing, would benefit for characterising TE activity, e.g. looking expression or better using existing reporters that enable to calculate rates of retrotransposition and excision. I think this can have major impact in the results obtained from the MALs and is a more direct read out of the hybridisation effect.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>This work uses wild yeast as a model and thus integrates many approaches to test competing theories about transposable element (TE) contributions to early speciation. It shows that natural hybrids between <italic>S. paradoxus</italic> subspecies show TE copy numbers (CNs) that are intermediate between those of their parents. Population genetic structure explains most of the natural variation among strains in TE levels though there could be a small effect of climate on Ty3p CNs. There is no evidence that TEs are at higher levels because of random drift. Mutation accumulation experiments with good replication similarly show no increase in transposition in hybrids compared with non-hybrid controls. Past work showed that the model yeast lineages used here are partially reproductively isolated. This work shows that their hybridization does not lead to increased TE reactivation and is not driving their speciation through Bateson-Dobzhanski-Muller interactions.</p><p>The experiments and analyses are convincing, and I have no substantive concerns. Furthermore, this number of integrated analyses is needed and would only be possible in few eukaryotes. The authors present a thorough discussion that interprets findings in the context of the model system and literature for all eukaryotes, from molecular biology to evolutionary genetics.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.60474.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>[…] That said, I am a bit puzzled by the way the problem was approached – I appreciate that forensics of natural genomes is perhaps the best way to investigate a natural genetic phenomenon, but it obviously also has shortcomings.

Perhaps substance for a follow-up study…</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the positive feedback and for the constructive suggestion of using retrotransposition reporter assays as an orthogonal approach. To avoid repeating our response, we invite the reviewer to see the response to reviewer 2’s second major comment, which expressed basically the same suggestion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Specific questions and concerns:</p><p>I wonder to what extent the genome analysis (i.e. the first part of the paper) depends on how long ago the hybridization events occurred. It seems plausible that if Ty elements become more active, this effect is the biggest immediately after the hybridization, and disappears over time as the genome re-establishes suppression of Ty activity. Would this influence the findings? It seems useful to discuss this in the text.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that the timing of hybridization may have an impact on the ability to observe Ty reactivation. It is entirely possible that a reactivation immediately following hybridization may have been rapidly suppressed by re-establishment of host repressive mechanisms, and that most resulting insertions were further purged by selection or lost by drift. Thus, this approach has limited ability to detect past, transient episodes of reactivation. We are aware that this is an important drawback of the population genomic approach, as highlighted by the reviewer. Thus, we modified the text to emphasize that our ability to detect reactivation from contemporary genomes is limited to persistent reactivation or to the maintenance of the accumulated TEs.</p><p>When first presenting the CN profiles from wild lineages, we added:</p><p>“The hybrid lineages <italic>SpC</italic>*, <italic>SpD<sub>1</sub></italic> and <italic>SpD<sub>2</sub></italic> had intermediate full-length Ty1 and Tsu4 CNs compared to their parental lineages, indicating no apparent persistent reactivation or maintenance of Ty elements in these lineages.”</p><p>When transitioning from the population genomics section to the experimental evolution section, we emphasized the difficulty to detect transient reactivation from contemporary genome analysis by adding this sentence: “Transient reactivation may also be followed by rapid re-establishment of host repression and leave little to no signature in contemporary genomes.”</p><p>Finally, we added a paragraph in our Discussion to mention this limitation and discuss the likelihood of transient reactivation scenarios in the light of our results and the known repression mechanisms in yeast:</p><p>“We note that the analysis of contemporary genomes is inherently limited in the ability to uncover transient reactivation that would immediately follow hybridization and rapidly faint, perhaps as a result of a re-establishment of TE repression. […] Additionally, Ty CNs of artificial hybrids at the initial time point of our MA experiment (i.e. early after hybridization) generally show good agreement with the expectation from their parental haploid strains, which is incompatible with an early reactivation of Ty elements.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>I suspect that using third-position codon diversity is a rather poor estimate of an effective population size, especially over longer periods of time? If this is the case, perhaps the results using this analysis should be interpreted with even more caution?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that non-synonymous diversity at codon third positions only provides very rough estimates of <italic>N</italic><sub>e</sub>. While we tried to state this in the text, we understand that readers may easily overestimate the level of confidence we put in this result. We thus changed the main text to emphasize the suggestive nature of this result. We also cited Tsai et al., 2008 as an example of the use of nucleotide diversity in population genomic data to estimate population genetic parameters.</p><p>“Genome-wide nucleotide diversity at four-fold degenerate codon positions (π<sub>S</sub>) is related to long-term <italic>N</italic><sub>e</sub> and was used to approximate this parameter across diverse taxa (Lynch and Conery, 2003). […] While these rough <italic>N</italic><sub>e</sub> estimates should be interpreted with caution, this result suggested that natural selection efficiency is likely not the main determinant in CN variation.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Is it necessarily true that the overrepresentation of ORF-disrupting Ty insertions in the SpC lineage points at a bias towards more deleterious insertions? Are the numbers strong enough to exclude noise? Or could selection be lower/more recent here?</p></disp-quote><p>Although many of our results tend to suggest that the <italic>SpC</italic> lineage could be subject to relaxed selection compared to others, we want to emphasize that these results constitute mixed evidence and we do not believe that the higher count of ORF-disrupting insertions in <italic>SpC</italic> compared to <italic>SpB</italic> (3 vs 1) is strong evidence in support for this hypothesis. We cannot exclude that it could be due to chance or sampling bias. The results we obtained in the search for a phenotypic defect associated with the private Ty1 insertion in <italic>ARR3</italic> indicate that this polymorphism is probably neutral, since the single strain bearing it has no significant growth defect in arsenite compared to the rest of the <italic>SpC</italic> lineage. We conclude from this result that relaxed selection cannot explain the occurrence of this rare polymorphism and speculate that this interpretation could apply to other ORF-disrupting insertions. We thank the reviewer for highlighting that this was not easily understood from our previous formulation, and we modified the text to make it clear that we do not claim any selective interpretation about the ORF-disrupting insertions.</p><p>We edited the beginning of the first paragraph of this section:</p><p>“The number of ORF-disrupting Ty insertion alleles in <italic>SpC</italic> (three) compared to <italic>SpB</italic> (one) suggested a slight overrepresentation in <italic>SpC</italic>, which could be explained by a bias towards more deleterious insertion alleles in this lineage. To test this hypothesis, we examined the functional annotations of the corresponding genes.”</p><p>To strengthen our estimation of the phenotypic effect of the private Ty1 insertion in <italic>ARR3</italic>, we replicated the phenotypic measurement in arsenite at a larger scale. We modified the fourth paragraph of this section as follows:</p><p>“We investigated the fitness effect of the ORF-disrupting Ty1 insertion in ARR3 by measuring the growth of a collection of 123 <italic>S. paradoxus</italic> strains in culture medium supplemented with arsenite (Figure 5A, Figure 5—figure supplement 7, Figure 5—figure supplement 8). […] The absence of growth defect in arsenite for LL2011_004, combined with the extremely low frequencies of all the ORF-disrupting alleles, suggests that these insertions are effectively neutral and are not observed because of an important reduction in purifying selection efficiency.”</p><p>Figure 5 was modified. The previous Figure 5A-B was modified and added as a preliminary result as Figure 5—figure supplement 7. Replicates for all phenotypic measurements in NaAsO<sub>2</sub> were added as Figure 5—figure supplement 8. Statistical analysis of phenotypic variation within the <italic>SpC</italic> lineage was added as Figure 5—figure supplement 9:</p><p>We added this section to the Materials and methods:</p><p>“Growth assay in NaAsO<sub>2</sub></p><p>From the 208 wild strains used for whole genome sequence analyses, 123 strains had glycerol stocks available. [...] Post-hoc Tukey’s HSD test was performed using scikit-posthocs.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Is it necessarily true that we expect a negative correlation between Ty insertions near essential genes and a lower purifying selection? Could noise play a role? And, how strong is the effect that a mutation (or more accurately, a Ty insertion) near an essential gene is on average more deleterious? Do we know how far that effect stretches from the gene, and was this taken into account in the analysis?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that our explanation of the rationale we put forward to use adjacency to essential genes as a measure of selection efficiency lacks precision and nuance. Although it is noisy and surely has limited sensibility, this approach is expected to capture large variation in natural selection efficiency acting on the regulation of essential gene expression. Thus, we moderate our claims on the interpretability of these patterns and mention the expected sources of noise, which are indeed important.</p><p>Essential genes are known to be dosage-sensitive. Since by definition loss of function is lethal for these genes, important reduction in expression levels is expected to be deleterious for this class of genes. Additionally, they are overrepresented among genes that tolerate little overexpression (Makanae et al., 2013). They also have less genetic variation in mRNA levels (eQTLs) than most genes (Albert et al., 2018), showing that their expression levels are likely constrained by stabilizing selection. If natural selection is less efficient in a given lineage, we expect mutations that affect gene expression levels to be more frequently observed for this subset of genes compared to other lineages.</p><p>It is relatively well established that Ty elements can affect neighboring gene expression levels (Morillon, Springer and Lesage, 2000; Coney and Roeder, 1988; Todeschini et al. 2005; Lesage and Todeschini, 2005), either by increasing or decreasing them. Not all Ty insertions affect the expression of neighboring genes, as it depends on characteristics of the individual Ty insertions, notably position and orientation relative to the gene’s regulatory sequences. Although the study of many Ty1 insertions in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> allowed to define rules regarding the effect of position and orientation on neighboring gene expression (Lesage and Todeschini, 2005), to our knowledge, the generality of these rules at the genome scale were not assessed. Moreover, it was shown that single nucleotide substitutions can have dramatic consequences on the repressing or activating ability of a Ty element (Coney and Roeder, 1988), adding complexity to the prediction of gene expression effects caused by Ty insertions.</p><p>To address these aspects, we moved the background elements on the expression effects on adjacent genes from the second paragraph to the fifth paragraph of the section, and complemented it as follows:</p><p>“To gain a more comprehensive view of the strength of selection acting on Ty insertions, we compared the properties of genes in their neighborhood. […] Nevertheless, if selection efficiency explains a significant part of Ty CN variation, we reason that when CNs are high, Ty insertions should be more frequently observed near genes which properties reflect stronger dosage and functional constraints, compared to when CNs are low.”</p><p>In an attempt to add robustness to our analysis, we analyzed the distributions of number of protein-protein interactions (i.e. degree in the interactome) for genes neighboring Ty insertions, which corroborates our results based on gene essentiality, ω and <italic>k</italic>. We added the following sentences to the fifth paragraph of this section:</p><p>“Additionally, genes neighboring Ty insertions private to <italic>SpC</italic> show no bias towards higher number of physical interactions (Figure 5D, p&gt;0.05, pairwise two-tailed Mann-Whitney U tests, FDR correction).”</p><p>We modified Figure 5 by adding a panel showing the distributions of counts of physical interactions, as detailed in the previous comment about ORF-disrupting Ty insertions.</p><p>We added the analysis of physical interaction data in the Materials and methods:</p><p>“Physical interaction data for <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> S288c were retrieved from the BioGRID Multi-Validated Physical interaction dataset version 3.5.188 (Oughtred et al., 2019) and the interactome was built using Networkx.”</p><p>We analyzed the distributions of physical distance and relative orientation between Ty insertions and neighboring genes and show that differences among lineages are not significantly different. We added one sentence to the fifth paragraph of this section:</p><p>“Distributions of physical distance to neighboring genes were similar across lineages, as were distributions of relative orientation (Figure 5—figure supplement 10).”</p><p>We added Figure 5—figure supplement 10 to present the results of this analysis.</p><p>Former Figure 5—figure supplement 7 was changed to Figure 5—figure supplement 11.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>[…]</p><p>1) Did the authors were too conservative with their hybrid design and crossed populations that were too similar? I guess their rational is to mimic what they isolated in nature, but maybe if they look at the <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> x <italic>S. paradoxus</italic> crosses that they published before, this might change.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that restricting our analyses to the intraspecific divergence range excludes a vast range of higher divergence levels in interspecific crosses. The reason why we initially excluded the data from our <italic>S. paradoxus</italic> x <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> crosses is that we judged it was less relevant to our natural system of <italic>S. paradoxus</italic> lineages (wild <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> being largely absent at the latitudes where the analyzed strains were collected). While the choice to focus on intraspecific <italic>S. paradoxus</italic> crosses may seem conservative, we want to highlight their relevance in uncovering the mechanisms that contribute to early isolation in the process of speciation. Nevertheless, we agree that it makes sense to include our <italic>S. paradoxus x S. cerevisiae</italic> crosses in our analyses, which we named BSc in this manuscript. We updated the Introduction text to account for this new category of crosses:</p><p>“Here, we use population genomic data and laboratory evolution experiments on <italic>S. paradoxus</italic> and its sibling species <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> to investigate the hybrid reactivation hypothesis and, more generally, the factors governing TE accumulation in natural and experimental lineages.”</p><p>In the first paragraph of this section, we changed the following:</p><p>“To systematically explore the effect of hybridization on Ty transposition rates, we performed a large-scale mutation accumulation (MA) experiment on 11 artificial hybrid backgrounds, eight of which were previously published (Charron et al., 2019).”</p><p>”Pairs of haploid derivatives of natural <italic>S. paradoxus</italic> and <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> strains were chosen to span a range of evolutionary divergence (Figure 6B), yielding four categories of intraspecific crosses (from the least to the most divergent): <italic>SpC</italic>×<italic>SpC</italic> (CC), <italic>SpB</italic>×<italic>SpB</italic> (BB), <italic>SpB</italic>×<italic>SpC</italic> (BC) and <italic>SpB</italic>×<italic>SpA</italic> (BA); and one category of interspecific crosses: <italic>SpB</italic>×<italic>SpA</italic> (BSc; Figure 6C, Supplementary file 1A-F).”</p><p>We changed the third paragraph of this section as follows:</p><p>“Although these models explain little global variance (R<sup>2</sup>=0.40, 0.08 and 0.06 for Ty1, Ty3p and Tsu4 respectively), we found that neither independent variable was a significant predictor of ΔCN (Figure 6F). […] Crosses that shared the <italic>SpB</italic> parental strain UWOPS-91-202 (BB2, BC2, BA2, BSc2) seemed to have systematically higher Ty1 ΔCN values than the corresponding crosses that shared the <italic>SpB</italic> parental strain MSH-604 (BB1, BC1, BA1, BSc1).”</p><p>We modified the fourth paragraph of the Discussion as follows:</p><p>“This trend is especially important for Ty3p, as eight out of ten genotypes exhibit a negative change in median CN.”</p><p>We modified Figure 6 and Figure 6—figure supplement 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) I think the natural strains described in the first part of the paper and used for the crossing, would benefit for characterising TE activity, e.g. looking expression or better using existing reporters that enable to calculate rates of retrotransposition and excision. I think this can have major impact in the results obtained from the MALs and is a more direct read out of the hybridisation effect.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the suggestion of complementing our MA experiments with reporter assays that measure retrotransposition rate. We think this would be an entirely valuable approach to the question, as shown by Smukowski Heil and collaborators (Smukowski Heil et al., 2020), who recently demonstrated that no Ty reactivation occurs in interspecific hybrids between <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> and <italic>S. uvarum</italic>.</p><p>As we understand the reviewer's comment, the occurrence of genomic changes during MA following a hypothetical initial and transient reactivation of retrotransposition might be the major factor making reporter assays a “more direct read out” of retrotransposition rates compared to MA. However, we would like to argue that in the time scale of our MA experiment (less than 800 mitotic generations), and given that we sequenced the strains at the initial timepoint of the MA experiment, it appears unlikely that signatures of an early and transient reactivation would have been purged from the genomes we sequenced. While we agree that many types of genomic changes can yield variation in Ty CNs that is unrelated to retrotransposition <italic>per se</italic>, such a “masking” of reactivation would require a strong mutational bias towards elimination of genomic loci containing Ty elements, or systematically very strong deleterious effects associated with novel Ty insertions that would drive their counter-selection in a MA regime characterized by minimal <italic>N<sub>e</sub></italic>. We cannot find any good reason to expect any of these scenarios. As we mention in the discussion of the manuscript, we believe that confident assessment of the Ty insertion loci in the MA lines would be essential in gaining further insight into the genomic processes involved in Ty CN change, but we believe it would require new data collection and thorough analyses that are beyond the scope of this manuscript.</p><p>We agree that reporter assays are an attractive and certainly powerful way of characterizing transposition rates. However, we believe that many limitations make them hard to apply to the current study in a straightforward and meaningful way. First, to our knowledge, all the retrotransposition marker constructs available are based on a Ty1 copy from <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>. While this choice is certainly defendable in the case of interspecific hybrids involving <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> as a parent (as in the case of Smukowski Heil and collaborators and our BSc crosses), most of our results are on intraspecific hybrids of <italic>S. paradoxus</italic>. The large sequence divergence level that separates these species is likely to have functional consequences on the ability of the marker to retrotranspose and impact retrotransposition rates in an unpredictable way, thus prompting the adaptation of these tools to <italic>S. paradoxus</italic> Ty elements. Moreover, MA experiments offer the advantage of exploring retrotransposition activity of all families at the time. Thus, exploring the dynamics of all families would ideally require generating constructs that account for both inter-lineage and intra-strain variation in Ty content. Second, while its interpretation might seem straightforward at first sight, retrotransposition marker assays require the function of many cellular processes that can exhibit phenotypic diversity at the intraspecific level and thus need to be carefully controlled for. In order to yield sufficiently high numbers of mutants to reach appreciable sensitivity in a reasonable experimental setup, most assays require transcriptional induction using the <italic>GAL1</italic> promoter. In <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, it was shown that very low levels of intraspecific genetic variation results in wide phenotypic variation in the regulation of galactose genes (Lee et al., 2017). Additionally, splicing efficiency of the artificial introns inserted into <italic>HIS3</italic> or GFP can also exhibit intraspecific variation. Ruling out potential effects from these confounding processes requires many controls in the form of assays and constructs that are not readily available to us. Finally, our choice of experimental condition for the MA experiment (YPD) is incompatible with most reporter assays, which require induction in galactose and selection of a plasmid, either by auxotrophy complementation in synthetic medium or antibiotic resistance in complex medium. All these requirements are important deviations from the basic YPD medium used in the MA experiment. Thus, the results from reporter assays would be hard to interpret, as it would be difficult to disentangle the orthogonal experimental approach from environmental effects.</p><p>In conclusion, the difficulty to identify a clear drawback to our MA approach given our sequencing strategy, and the complexity of adapting reporter assays and their necessary controls to <italic>S. paradoxus,</italic> prompt us to argue against the inclusion of reporter assays as a revision to our manuscript. While this is certainly a valid and important orthogonal approach to our question, we believe that its complexity deserves to be addressed in a separate future study.</p></body></sub-article></article>
