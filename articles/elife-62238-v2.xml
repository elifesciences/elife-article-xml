Rejecting this misconception implies that evolution is nontransitive: a series of adaptive events will, on occasion, produce organisms that are less fit compared to a distant ancestor. Here we identify a nontransitive evolutionary sequence in a 1000-generation yeast evolution experiment. We show that nontransitivity arises due to adaptation in the yeast nuclear genome combined with the stepwise deterioration of an intracellular virus, which provides an advantage over viral competitors within host cells. Extending our analysis, we find that nearly half of our ~140 populations experience multilevel selection, fixing adaptive mutations in both the nuclear and viral genomes. Our results provide a mechanistic case-study for the adaptive evolution of nontransitivity due to multilevel selection in a 1000-generation host/virus evolution experiment.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>It is widely accepted in biology that all life on Earth gradually evolved over billions of years from a single ancestor. Yet, there is still much about this process that is not fully understood. Evolution is often thought of as progressing in a linear fashion, with each new generation being better adapted to its environment than the last. But it has been proposed that evolution is also nontransitive: this means even if each generation is ‘fitter’ than its immediate predecessor, these series of adaptive changes will occasionally result in organisms that are less fit than their distant ancestors.</p><p>Laboratory experiments of evolution are a good way to test evolutionary theories because they allow researchers to create scenarios that are impossible to observe in natural populations, such as an organism competing against its extinct ancestors. Buskirk et al. set up such an experiment using yeast to determine whether nontransitive effects can be observed in the direct descendants of an organism.</p><p>At the start of the experiment, the yeast cells were host to a non-infectious ‘killer’ virus that is common among yeast. Cells containing the virus produce a toxin that destroys other yeast that lack the virus. The populations of yeast were given a nutrient-rich broth in which to grow and subjected to a simple evolutionary pressure: to grow fast, which limits the amount of resources available.</p><p>As the yeast evolved, they gained beneficial genetic mutations that allowed them to outcompete their neighbors, and they passed these traits down to their descendants. Some of these mutations occurred not in the yeast genome, but in the genome of the killer virus, and this stopped the yeast infected with the virus from producing the killer toxin. Over time, other mutations resulted in the infected yeast no longer being immune to the toxin. Thus, when Buskirk et al. pitted these yeast against their distant ancestors, the new generation were destroyed by the toxins the older generation produced.</p><p>These findings provide the first experimental evidence for nontransitivity along a line of descent. The results have broad implications for our understanding of how evolution works, casting doubts over the idea that evolution always involves a direct progression towards new, improved traits.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>nontransitivity</kwd><kwd>experimental evolution</kwd><kwd>killer virus</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01GM127420</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lang</surname><given-names>Gregory I</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100008234</institution-id><institution>Lehigh University</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Faculty Innovation Grant</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lang</surname><given-names>Gregory I</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A series of selective events, each improving fitness relative to an immediate predecessor, can result in organisms that are less fit compared to a distant ancestor.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Adaptive evolution is a process in which selective events result in the replacement of less-fit genotypes with a more fit ones. Intuitively, a series of selective events, each improving fitness relative to the immediate predecessor, should translate into a cumulative increase in fitness relative to the ancestral state. However, whether or not this is borne out over long evolutionary time scales has long been the subject of debate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Ruse, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dawkins, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gould, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Shanahan, 2000</xref>). The failure to identify broad patterns of progress over evolutionary time scales—despite clear evidence of selection acting over successive short time intervals—is what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gould, 1985</xref> referred to as ‘the paradox of the first tier'. This paradox implies that evolution exhibits nontransitivity, a property that is best illustrated by the Penrose staircase and the Rock–Paper–Scissors game. The Penrose staircase is a visual illusion of ascending sets of stairs that form a continuous loop such that—although each step appears higher than the last—no upward movement is realized. In the Rock–Paper–Scissors game each two-way interaction has a clear winner (paper beats rock, scissors beats paper, and rock beats scissors), yet due to the nontransitivity of these two-way interactions, no clear hierarchy exists among the three.</p><p>In ecology, nontransitive interactions among extant species are well documented as contributors to biological diversity and community structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kerr et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Károlyi et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Laird and Schamp, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Reichenbach et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Menezes et al., 2019</xref>) and arise by way of resource (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Sinervo and Lively, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Precoda et al., 2017</xref>) or interference competition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kirkup and Riley, 2004</xref>). First put forward in the 1970s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gilpin, 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jackson and Buss, 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">May and Leonard, 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Petraitis, 1979</xref>), the importance of nontransitivity in ecology has garnered extensive theoretical and experimental consideration over the last half century (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Sinervo and Lively, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kerr et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Allesina and Levine, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Rojas-Echenique and Allesina, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Soliveres et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Liao et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>What is unknown is whether nontransitive interactions arise for direct descendants along a line of genealogical succession. This is the crux of Gould’s paradox and has broad implications for our understanding of evolutionary processes. For instance, if an evolved genotype is found to be less fit in comparison to a distant ancestor, the adaptive landscape upon which the population is evolving may not contain true fitness maxima (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Barrick and Lenski, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Van den Bergh et al., 2018</xref>) and, more broadly, directionality and progress may be illusory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gould, 1996</xref>). Testing the hypothesis that nontransitive interactions arise along lines of genealogical descent, however, is not possible in natural populations because it requires our ability to directly compete an organism against its immediate predecessor as well as against its extinct genealogical ancestors. Fortunately, laboratory experimental evolution, in which populations are preserved as a ‘frozen fossil record’, affords us with the unique opportunity to test for nontransitivity along a genealogical lineage by directly competing a given genotype against the extant as well as the extinct.</p><p>An early study of laboratory evolution of yeast in glucose-limited chemostats appeared to demonstrate that nontransitive interactions arise along a line of genealogical descent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Paquin and Adams, 1983</xref>). However, the specific events that led to nontransitivity in this case are unknown, and it is likely the case that the authors were measuring interactions between contemporaneous lineages in a population, rather than individuals along a direct line of genealogical descent, as they report (see Discussion). Indeed, adaptive diversification is common in experimental evolution due to spatial structuring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Rainey and Travisano, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Frenkel et al., 2015</xref>) and metabolic diversification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Paquin and Adams, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Helling et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Turner et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Spencer et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kinnersley et al., 2014</xref>), and is typically maintained by negative frequency-dependent selection, in which rare genotypes are favored. Collectively this work reinforces theory and observational evidence on the power of ecological nontransitivity as a driver and maintainer of diversity but is silent as to whether genealogical succession can also be nontransitive.</p><p>Here we determine the sequence of events leading to the evolution of nontransitivity in a single yeast population during a 1000-generation evolution experiment. We show that nontransitivity arises through multilevel selection involving both the yeast nuclear genome and the population of a vertically transmitted virus. Many fungi, including the yeast <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae,</italic> are host to non-infectious, double-stranded RNA ‘killer’ viruses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Wickner, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Schmitt and Breinig, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Schmitt and Breinig, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Rowley, 2017</xref>). Killer viruses produce a toxin that kills non-killer containing yeasts. The K1 toxin gene contains four subunits (δ, α, γ, and β), which are post-translationally processed and glycosylated to produce an active two-subunit (α, β) secreted toxin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bostian et al., 1983</xref>). Immunity to the toxin is conferred by the pre-processed version of the toxin, thus requiring cells to maintain the virus for protection. We show that nontransitivity arises due to multilevel selection: adaptation in the yeast nuclear genome and the simultaneous stepwise deterioration of the killer virus. By expanding our study of host-virus genome evolution to over 100 additional yeast populations, we find that multilevel selection, and thus the potential for the evolution of nontransitive interactions, is a common occurrence given the conditions of our evolution experiment.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Evolution of nontransivity along a line of genealogical descent</title><p>Previously we evolved ~600 haploid populations of yeast asexually for 1000 generations in rich glucose medium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lang et al., 2011</xref>).

The expectation, assuming additivity, is that the Late clone will be more fit than the Early clone, by roughly 5.0%. Surprisingly, we find that the Late clone is less fit than expected, to the extent that it often loses in pairwise competition with the Early clone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, left panel). Furthermore, the interaction between the Early and Late clones exhibits positive frequency-dependent selection, thus creating a bi-stable system where the fitness disadvantage of the Late clone can be overcome if it starts above a certain frequency relative to the Early clone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Evolution of nontransitivity is associated with changes to the killer virus</title><p>Positive frequency-dependent selection is rare in experimental evolution and can only arise through a few known mechanisms. It has been observed previously in yeast that harbor killer viruses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Greig and Travisano, 2008</xref>), which are dsRNA viruses that encode toxin/immunity systems. Using a well-described halo assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Woods and Bevan, 1968</xref>), we find that the ancestral strain of our evolved populations exhibits the phenotype expected of yeast that harbor the killer virus: it inhibits growth of a nearby sensitive strain and resists killing by a known killer strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p>We asked if the observed nontransitivity in the BYS1-D08 lineage could be explained by evolution of the killer phenotype. Phenotyping of the isolated clones revealed that the Intermediate clone no longer exhibits killing ability (K<sup>-</sup>I<sup>+</sup>) and that the Late clone possesses neither killing ability nor immunity (K<sup>-</sup>I<sup>-</sup>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). Killer toxin has been shown to impart frequency-dependent selection in structured environments due to a high local concentration of secreted toxin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Greig and Travisano, 2008</xref>). We hypothesized that a stepwise loss of killing ability followed by loss of immunity, along with the acquisition of beneficial <italic>yur1</italic> and <italic>ste4</italic> nuclear mutations, were responsible for the frequency-dependent and nontransitive interaction between Early and Late clones.</p><p>To determine if killer toxin production by the Early clone is necessary for it to outcompete the toxin-susceptible Late clone, we repeated the competition between the Early and Late clones using a virus-cured version of the Early clone. We find that removing the virus from the Early clone abolishes the frequency-dependent fitness advantage of the Early clone; the Late clone is 4.3% more fit than the cured Early clone at all frequencies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, right panel) due to the presence of adaptive mutations in the nuclear genome of the Late clone. Therefore the presence of killer virus in the Early clone and the subsequent loss of killer virus-associated phenotypes in the Late clone were necessary for the evolution of frequency dependence and nontransitivity.</p><p>To determine if viral evolution alone is sufficient to account for the observed fitness gains in nontransitive interactions, we focused on the first step in the evolutionary sequence: the transition from the Early clone to Intermediate clone. We transferred the killer virus from the Intermediate clone to the cured Early clone and assayed fitness relative to the Early clone. Because the virus from the Intermediate clone no longer produces toxin, we suspected that it may provide a fitness benefit to the host. However, we find that the evolved killer virus from the Intermediate clone confers no significant effect on host fitness compared to the killer virus from the Early clone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, right panel). This shows that the fitness benefit of the Intermediate clone relative to the Early clone is due to adaptation in the nuclear genome. Taken together these experiments show that the sequence of events leading to the evolution of nontransitivity involves changes to both the host and viral genomes.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Changes to killer-associated phenotypes are common under our experimental conditions</title><p>To determine the extent of killer phenotype evolution across all populations, we assayed the killer phenotype of 142 populations that were founded by a single ancestor and propagated at the same bottleneck size as BYS1-D08 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lang et al., 2011</xref>).

A within-cell advantage has been invoked to explain the invasion of internal deletion variants (e.g. ScV-S [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kane et al., 1979</xref>]) but has not been extended to point mutations. To test evolved viral variants for a within-cell fitness advantage, we generated a heteroplasmic diploid strain by mating the ancestor (with wild-type virus) with a haploid cytoductant containing either the I292M (K<sup>-</sup>I<sup>+</sup>) or −1 frameshift (K<sup>-</sup>I<sup>-</sup>) viral variant. The heteroplasmic diploids were propagated for seven single-cell bottlenecks every 48 hr to minimize among-cell selection. At each bottleneck, we assayed the yeast cells for killer phenotypes and we quantified the ratio of the intracellular viral variants by RT-PCR and sequencing. We find that killing ability was lost from all lines, suggesting that the evolved viral variants outcompeted the ancestral variant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). Sequencing confirmed that the derived viral variant fixed in most lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). In some lines, however, the derived viral variant increased initially before decreasing late. Further investigation into one of these lines revealed that the decrease in frequency of the viral variant corresponded to the sweep of a de novo G131D variant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>, inset). Viral variants therefore appear to constantly arise, and the evolutionary success of the observed variants results from their selective advantage over viral competitors within the context of an individual cell. We speculate that an intracellular competition between newly arising viral variants also explains the loss of immunity from populations that previously lost killing ability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>), given the relaxed selection for the maintenance of functional immunity in those populations.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>We examined phenotypic and sequence co-evolution of an intracellular double-stranded RNA virus and the host nuclear genome over the course of 1000 generations of experimental evolution. We observe complex dynamics including genetic hitchhiking and clonal interference in the host populations as well as the intracellular viral populations. Phenotypic and genotypic changes including the loss of killing ability, mutations in the host-encoded cell-wall biosynthesis genes, and the virally encoded toxin genes occur repeatedly across replicate populations. The loss of killer-associated phenotypes—killing ability and immunity to the killer toxin—leads to three phenomena with implications for adaptive evolution: positive frequency-dependent selection, multilevel selection, and nontransitivity.</p><p>Frequency-dependent selection can be either negative, where rare genotypes are favored, or positive, where rare genotypes are disfavored. Of the two, negative frequency-dependent selection is more commonly observed in experimental evolution, arising, for example, from nutrient cross-feeding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Helling et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Turner et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Spencer et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kinnersley et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Plucain et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Green et al., 2020</xref>) and spatial structuring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Rainey and Travisano, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Frenkel et al., 2015</xref>). Positive frequency-dependent selection, in contrast, is not typically observed in experimental evolution. By definition, a new positive frequency-dependent mutation must invade an established population at a time when its fitness is at its minimum. Even in situations in which positive frequency-dependent selection is likely to occur, such as the evolution of cooperative group behaviors and interference competition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chao and Levin, 1981</xref>), a mutation may be unfavorable at the time it arises. A crowded, structured environment provides an opportunity for allelopathies to offer a local advantage. Here we describe an alternative mechanism for the success of positive frequency-dependent mutations through multilevel selection of the host genome and a toxin-encoding intracellular virus. The likelihood of such a scenario occurring is aided by the large population size of the extrachromosomal element: each of the ~10<sup>5</sup> cells that comprise each yeast population contains ~10<sup>2</sup> viral particles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bostian et al., 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Ridley and Wickner, 1983</xref>).</p><p>Nontransitivity in our experimental system is due, in part, to interference competition. The production of a killer toxin by the Early clone kills the toxin-susceptible Late clone in a frequency-dependent manner: higher starting frequencies of the Early clone result in higher concentrations of toxin in the environment. Interference competition can drive ecological nontransitivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kerr et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kirkup and Riley, 2004</xref>), suggesting that similar mechanisms may underlie both ecological and genealogical nontransitivity. The adaptive evolution of genealogical nontransitivity in our system does not follow the canonical model of a co-evolutionary arms race where the host evolves mechanisms to prevent the selfish replication of the virus and the virus evolves to circumvent the host’s defenses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Daugherty and Malik, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Rowley, 2017</xref>). Rather, mutations that fix in the viral and yeast populations do so because they provide a direct fitness advantage in their respective populations. Nontransitivity arises through the combined effect of beneficial mutations in the host genome (which improves the relative fitness within the yeast population, regardless of the presence or absence of the killer virus) and the adaptive loss of killing ability and degeneration of the intracellular virus (which provides an intracellular fitness advantage to the virus). The end result is a high-fitness yeast genotype (relative to the ancestral yeast genotype) that contains degenerate viruses, rendering their hosts susceptible to the virally encoded toxin.</p><p>Though we did not find an impact of nuclear mutations on killer-associated phenotypes, we do observe a statistical enrichment of mutations in genes involved in β-glucan biosynthesis and in genes that when deleted confer a high level of resistance to the killer toxin. Nearly all mutations in these toxin-resistance genes are nonsynonymous (18 nonsense/frameshift, 21 missense, one synonymous), indicating a strong signature of positive selection. This suggests that the nuclear genome adapts in response to the presence of the killer toxin; however, the effect of these mutations may be beyond the resolution of our fitness assay.</p><p>Among the viral variants we identified were two unique ~1 kb deletions; remnants of the killer virus that retain little more than the <italic>cis</italic>-acting elements necessary for viral replication and packaging. These defective interfering particles are thought to outcompete full-length virus due to their decreased replication time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kane et al., 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Ridley and Wickner, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Esteban and Wickner, 1988</xref>). Defective interfering particles are common to RNA viruses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Holland et al., 1982</xref>). Though there are several different killer viruses in yeast (e.g. K1, K2, K28, and Klus), each arose independently and has a distinct mechanism of action (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Rodríguez-Cousiño et al., 2017</xref>). Nontransitive interactions may therefore arise frequently through cycles of gains and losses of toxin production and toxin immunity in lineages that contain RNA viruses.</p><p>Reports of nontransitivity arising along evolutionary lines of descent are rare (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">de Visser and Lenski, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Beaumont et al., 2009</xref>). The first (and most widely cited) report of nontransitivity along a direct line of descent occurred during yeast adaptation in glucose-limited chemostats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Paquin and Adams, 1983</xref>). This experiment was correctly interpreted under the assumption—generally accepted at the time—that large asexual populations evolved by clonal replacement, where new beneficial mutations arise and quickly sweep to fixation. This strong selection/weak mutation model, however, is now known to be an oversimplification for large asexual populations, where multiple beneficial mutations arise and spread simultaneously through the population leading to extensive clonal interference (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gerrish and Lenski, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kvitek and Sherlock, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lang et al., 2013</xref>). In addition, the duration of the Paquin and Adams experiment was too short for the number of reported selective sweeps to have occurred (4 in 245 generations and 6 in 305 generations, for haploids and diploids, respectively). The strongest known beneficial mutations in glucose-limited chemostats, hexose transporter amplifications, provide a fitness advantage of ~30% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gresham et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kvitek and Sherlock, 2011</xref>) and would require a minimum of ~150 generations to fix in a population size of 4 × 10<sup>9</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Otto and Whitlock, 1997</xref>). We contend that Paquin and Adams observed nontransitive interactions among contemporaneous lineages—ecological nontransitivity—rather than nontransitivity among genealogical descendants. Apart from the present study, there are no other examples of nontransitivity arising along a line descent, but numerous examples of nontransitive interactions among contemporaneous lineages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Sinervo and Lively, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kerr et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kirkup and Riley, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Károlyi et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Laird and Schamp, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Reichenbach et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Precoda et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Menezes et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Here we present a mechanistic case study on the evolution of nontransitivity along a direct line of genealogical descent.

Our results show that the continuous action of selection can give rise to genotypes that are less fit compared to a distant ancestor. We show that nontransitive interactions can arise quickly due to multilevel selection in a host/virus system. In the context of this experiment multi-level selection is common—most yeast populations fix nuclear and viral variants by Generation 1000.

the evolution experiment have been described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lang et al., 2011</xref>). Briefly, population BYS1-D08 is one of ~600 populations that were evolved for 1000 generations at 30°C in YPD + A and T (yeast extract, peptone, dextrose plus 100 μg/ml ampicillin and 25 μg/ml tetracycline to prevent bacterial contamination). Each day populations were diluted 1:2<sup>10</sup> into 128 μl of YPD + A and T in round-bottom 96-well plates using a BiomekFX liquid handler. The dilution scheme equates to 10 generations of growth per day at an effective population size of ~10<sup>5</sup>.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Growth conditions and strain construction</title><p>Unless otherwise specified, yeast strains were propagated at 30°C in YPD + A and T. The ancestor and evolved populations were described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lang et al., 2011</xref>). Early, Intermediate, and Late clones were isolated by resurrecting population BYS1-D08 at the Generation 0, 335, and 1000, respectively. These specific time points were selected to coincide with the completion of a selective sweep (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lang et al., 2013</xref>), when the population is expected to be near clonal. For each time point we isolated multiple clones from a YPD plate and assayed each one to verify that the killer phenotype was uniform.</p><p>The ancestral strain was cured of the M1 and LA viruses by streaking to single colonies on YPD agar and confirmed by halo assay, PCR, and sequencing. We integrated a constitutively expressed fluorescent reporter (pACT1-ymCitrine) at the <italic>CAN1</italic> locus in the cured ancestral strain as well as the Intermediate (Generation 335) and Late (Generation 1000) clones.</p><p>Karyogamy mutants were constructed by introducing the <italic>kar1Δ15</italic> allele by two-step gene replacement in the cured a <italic>MAT</italic>α version of the ancestor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Georgieva and Rothstein, 2002</xref>). The <italic>kar1Δ15</italic>-containing plasmid pMR1593 (Mark Rose, Georgetown University) was linearized with BglII prior to transformation and selection on -Ura. Mitotic excision of the integrated plasmid was selected for plating on 5-fluorotic acid (5-FOA). Then we replaced NatMX with KanMX to enable selection for recipients during viral transfer.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Fitness assays</title><p>Competitive fitness assays were performed as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lang et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lang et al., 2013</xref>). To investigate frequency dependence, competitors were mixed at various ratios at the initiation of the experiment. Competitions were performed for 50 generations under conditions identical to the evolution experiment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lang et al., 2011</xref>). Every 10 generations, competitions were diluted 1:1000 in fresh media and an aliquot was sampled by BD FACS Canto II flow cytometer. Flow cytometry data was analyzed using FlowJo 10.3. Relative fitness was calculated as the slope of the change in the natural log ratio between the experimental and reference strain. To detect frequency-dependent selection, each 10-generation interval was analyzed independently to calculate starting frequency and fitness.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Halo assay</title><p>Killer phenotype was measured using a high-throughput version of the standard halo assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Crabtree et al., 2019</xref>) and a liquid handler (Biomek FX). Assays were performed using YPD agar that had been buffered to pH 4.5 (citrate-phosphate buffer), dyed with methylene blue (0.003%), and poured into a 1-well rectangular cell culture plate.</p><p>Killing ability was assayed against a sensitive tester strain (yGIL1097) that was isolated from a separate evolution experiment initiated from the same ancestor. The sensitive tester was grown to saturation, diluted 1:10, and spread (150 µl) evenly on the buffered agar. Query strains were grown to saturation, concentrated 5×, and spotted (2 µl) on top of the absorbed lawn (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>, left).</p><p>Immunity was assayed against the ancestral strain (yGIL432). Query strains were grown to saturation, diluted 1:32, and spotted (10 µl) on the buffered agar. The killer tester was grown to saturation, concentrated 5×, and spotted (2 µl) on top of the absorbed query strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>, right).</p><p>Plates were incubated at room temperature for 2–3 days before assessment. Killer phenotype was scored according to the scale in shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Viral RNA isolation, cDNA Synthesis, and PCR</title><p>Nucleic acids were isolated by phenol–chloroform extraction and precipitated in ethanol. Isolated RNA was reverse-transcribed into cDNA using ProtoScript II First Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (NEB) with either the enclosed Random Primer Mix or the M1-specific oligo M1_R3.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Sanger sequencing and bioinformatics analyses</title><p>PCR was performed on cDNA using Q5 High-Fidelity Polymerase (NEB). The K1 ORF was amplified using primers M1_F1 or M1_F5 and M1_R6. The M1 region downstream of the polyA stretch was amplified using M1_F7 and M1_R3. The LA virus was amplified using LA_F2 and LA_R2, LA_F2 and LA_R3, or LA_F3 and LA_R6. PCR products were Sanger sequenced by Genscript.</p><p>Mutations were identified and peak height quantified using 4Peaks (nucleobytes). For intracellular competitions, mutation frequency was quantified by both Sanger and Illumina sequencing (see below), with both methods producing nearly identical results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p>The Sanger sequencing data was aligned to publicly available M1 and LA references (GenBank Accession Numbers U78817 and J04692, respectively) using ApE (A plasmid Editor). The ancestral M1 and LA viruses differed from the references at 7 sites (including 3 K1 missense mutations) and 19 sites, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Viral transfer</title><p>Viruses were transferred to <italic>MAT</italic><bold>a</bold> strains using the <italic>MAT</italic>α karyogamy mutant as an intermediate. Viral donors (<italic>MAT</italic><bold>a</bold>, <italic>ura3,</italic> NatMX) were first transformed with the pRS426 (<italic>URA3</italic>, 2µ ORI) for future indication of viral transfer. Cytoduction was performed by mixing a viral donor with the karyogamy mutant recipient (<italic>MAT</italic>α, <italic>ura3</italic>, KanMX) at a 5:1 ratio on solid media. After a 6 hr incubation at 30°C, the cells were plated on media containing G418 to select for cells with the recipient nuclei. Recipients that grew on -Ura (indicator of cytoplasmic mixing) and failed to grow on ClonNat (absence of donor nuclei) then served as donors for the next cytoduction. These karyogamy mutant donors (<italic>MAT</italic>α, <italic>URA3</italic>, KanMX) were mixed with the selected recipient (<italic>MAT</italic><bold>a</bold>, <italic>ura3,</italic> NatMX) at a 5:1 ratio on solid media. After a 6 hr incubation at 30°C, the cells were plated on media containing ClonNat to select for cells with recipient nuclei. Recipients that grew on -Ura (indicator of cytoplasmic mixing) and failed to grow on G418 (absence of the donor nucleus) were then cured of the indicator plasmid by selection on 5-FOA. Killer phenotype was confirmed by halo assays and the presence of the viral variants in the recipient was verified by Sanger sequencing.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Illumina sequencing and bioinformatics analyses</title><p>Multiplexed libraries were prepared using a two-step PCR. First, cDNA was amplified by Q5 High-Fidelity Polymerase (NEB) for 10 cycles using primers I292M_read1 and I292M_read2 or frameshift_read1 and frameshift_read2 to incorporate a random 8 bp barcode and sequencing primer binding sites. The resulting amplicons were further amplified by Q5 PCR for 15 cycles using primers i5_adapter and i7_adapter to incorporate the sequencing adaptors and indices. Libraries were sequenced on a NovaSeq 6000 (Illumina) at the Genomics Core Facility at Princeton University.</p><p>Raw FASTQ files were demultiplexed using a dual-index barcode splitter (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://bitbucket.org/princeton_genomics/barcode_splitter">https://bitbucket.org/princeton_genomics/barcode_splitter</ext-link>) and trimmed using Trimmomatic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bolger et al., 2014</xref>) with default settings for paired-end reads. Mutation frequencies were determined by counting the number of reads that contain the ancestral or evolved allele (mutation flanked by five nucleotides).</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Intracellular competitions</title><p>Within-cell viral competitions were performed by propagating a heteroplasmic diploid and monitoring killer phenotype and viral variant frequency. Diploids were generated by crossing the ancestor with a cytoductant harboring either the I292M or −1 frameshift viral variant. For each viral variant, three diploid lines (each initiated by a unique mating event) were passaged every other day on buffered YPD media for a total of seven single-cell bottlenecks to minimize among-cell selection. A portion of each transferred colony was cryopreserved in 15% glycerol. Cryosamples were revived, assayed for killer phenotype, and harvested for RNA. Following RT-PCR, samples were sent for Sanger sequencing and Illumina sequencing. Variant frequency deviated from the expected frequency of 0.5 at the initial time point, presumably due to an unavoidable delay between the formation of the heteroplasmic diploid and initiation of the intracellular competition from a single colony. Alternatively, viral copy number may vary between donor and recipient cells.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Reed Wickner, Amber Rice, and members of the Lang Lab for their comments on the manuscript.

occurrence within a single evolving lineage has not been shown rigorously before. Authors evolved yeast cells infected with a &quot;Killer&quot; virus, and found that selection occurring at multiple scales – among viruses within a cell – and between their host cells within a population – results in evolved populations that are less fit than the ancestors. This work demonstrates that evolution may not be a simple linear march of progress. Rather, progress over short time scales can sometimes lead to a reduction of fitness over the longer time scale due to the evolution of ecological interactions. For future work, we would like to know whether non-transitivity can also occur when selection acts only at one level, and how common non-transitivity is, what features predict its evolution, and at what evolutionary scale it acts.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Adaptive evolution of nontransitive fitness in yeast&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, including Wenying Shou as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Naama Barkai as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Kristina Hillesland (Reviewer #3); Duncan Greig (Reviewer #4).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>We would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). Specifically, we are asking editors to accept without delay manuscripts, like yours, that they judge can stand as <italic>eLife</italic> papers without additional data, even if they feel that they would make the manuscript stronger. Thus the revisions requested below only address clarity and presentation.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The findings presented in this manuscript are interesting. They show that selection is happening at multiple scales – among viruses within a cell – and between their host cells within a population. The conflict between these levels of selection results in evolved populations that are less fit than the ancestors. This work demonstrates that evolution may not be a simple linear march of progress. Rather, progress over short time scales can sometimes lead to a reduction of fitness over the longer time scale due to the evolution of ecological interactions.</p><p>The reviewers, who all identified themselves, have a range of points that they would like to see addressed, and for ease, the verbatim reviews are attached, including a summary of the discussion among the reviewers.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>Buskirk et al. examined the evolution of nontransitive fitness effects in yeast.

There are a lot of comparisons to think through here to get to that conclusion, and I think the average reader needs to be taken through that.

Why is the presence of an active virus and immunity more beneficial at higher frequencies?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #4:</italic></p><p>This study shows how well mixed populations of yeast cells initially expressing both an anticompetitor toxin and resistance to it, first lose toxin production (because there is a cost but no benefit to toxin production when all cells are resistant) and then lose resistance (because there is a cost but no benefit to resistance when no cells produce toxin). Consequently, these evolved sensitive populations have lower fitness than their own toxin-producing (resurrected) ancestors, but only if the toxic ancestors are introduced at a high enough frequency, that is, there is positive frequency dependent selection. These results are quite intuitive and satisfying, and are well supported by rigorous experiments determining the causal mutations and their selective advantages both within intra-cellular populations of the virus, and between cells in a the evolving populations. This was really nice, thorough, and interesting work. However the overall result is not really surprising, as much similar work has been done before (and is properly cited) in which three types of competitors show non-transitive pairwise fitness relationships.</p><p>The main claim to originality is that the three types here are generated sequentially by two rounds of mutation, natural selection, and replacement/fixation: that is, there is genealogical nontransitivity between ancestors and descendants, rather than just ecological nontransitivity between contemporary co-existing variants. This demonstrates an important principle: that natural selection can produce a decline in overall relative fitness in a lineage over multiple rounds of mutation and fixation. The only other reported example of this in experimental evolution is the work of Paquin and Adams, 1983, but the authors here argue convincingly that the Paquin and Adams, lacking the benefit of sequencing to identify mutations and their frequencies, inadvertently competed ecological types that were co-existing in their evolving populations and had not fixed.</p><p>My only criticism, then, is that the example of non-transitivity demonstrated here is rather &quot;obvious&quot;; the result is entirely predictable, given the amount of previous work in similar microbial systems. However, this is countered by the fundamental nature of the question for evolutionary biology, and the lack of specific experimental examples, apart from the very old Paquin and Adams. Overall, then, I am satisfied that this paper is a significant step forward, and is appropriate for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>. I found it well written, interesting, and the conclusions were well supported by careful and thorough experiments.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.62238.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>Buskirk et al. examined the evolution of nontransitive fitness effects in yeast.
