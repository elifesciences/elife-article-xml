Understanding how stem cells switch between these states is highly relevant for stem cell-based therapeutics. <italic>Drosophila</italic> neural progenitors (neuroblasts) have been an excellent model for studying self-renewal and differentiation, but quiescence remains poorly understood. In this study, we show that when neuroblasts enter quiescence, the differentiation factor Prospero is transiently detected in the neuroblast nucleus, followed by the establishment of a unique molecular profile lacking most progenitor and differentiation markers. The pulse of low level nuclear Prospero precedes entry into neuroblast quiescence even when the timing of quiescence is advanced or delayed by changing temporal identity factors. Furthermore, loss of Prospero prevents entry into quiescence, whereas a pulse of low level nuclear Prospero can drive proliferating larval neuroblasts into quiescence. We propose that Prospero levels distinguish three progenitor fates: absent for self-renewal, low for quiescence, and high for differentiation.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.03363.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.03363.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.03363.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Stem cells provide tissues in the body with a continuing source of new cells, both when the tissues are first developing and when they are growing or repairing in adulthood. A stem cell can divide to create either another stem cell, or a cell that will mature into one of many different cell types.</p><p>Neuroblasts are a type of brain stem cell and can divide to create two new cells: another neuroblast that will continue to replicate itself and a cell called a ganglion mother cell that will go on to produce two mature cells for the nervous system. Moreover, when a neuroblast divides, it splits unequally, so that certain molecules end up predominantly in the ganglion mother cell—including a protein called Prospero. Once partitioned into the ganglion mother cell, the Prospero protein enters the nucleus, where it switches off ‘stem cell genes’ and switches on ‘neuron genes’ so the ganglion mother cell can form the mature neurons of the brain. Thus, neuroblasts must keep Prospero out of the nucleus to maintain stem cell properties, whereas ganglion mother cells must move Prospero into the nucleus to form neurons.</p><p>Now, Lai and Doe discover a new way that the Prospero protein is used to control stem cell biology. Neuroblasts, like all stem cells, can enter periods where they go dormant or quiescent—that is, they temporarily stop generating ganglion mother cells. By analyzing which proteins are present in neuroblasts during this transition to quiescence, Lai and Doe discovered that the Prospero protein was briefly detected, at low levels, in the nucleus of the neuroblast just before it became dormant.</p><p>To see whether this ‘low-level pulse’ of nuclear Prospero is linked to the cell entering a dormant state, Lai and Doe investigated two types of mutant fly in which neuroblasts become dormant either earlier or later than in normal flies. A low-level pulse of nuclear Prospero still precisely matched the start of the dormant state in both mutants. When the Prospero protein was removed altogether, the neuroblasts failed to become dormant, and instead continued dividing.</p><p>Lai and Doe propose that different levels of Prospero distinguish three different fates for neuroblasts. Neuroblasts self-replicate when Prospero is kept out of the nucleus, become dormant when exposed to low level nuclear Prospero, and produce the mature cells of the brain when nuclear Prospero levels are high. Exactly how the intermediate levels of nuclear Prospero trigger the dormant state remains a question for future work, as is the question of whether the related mammalian protein, called Prox1, has a similar function.</p><p>Understanding how stem cells switch between cell division and quiescence is important for developing effective stem cell-based therapies. It could also help us understand cancer, as cancer cells go through similar periods of inactivity, during which they do not respond to many anti-tumor drugs.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.03363.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.03363.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>quiescence</kwd><kwd>prospero</kwd><kwd>neural progenitor</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lai</surname><given-names>Sen-Lin</given-names></name><name><surname>Doe</surname><given-names>Chris Q</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funder had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A low-level pulse of the nuclear Prospero protein is necessary and sufficient to cause neural progenitor cells to enter a quiescent state.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Quiescent stem cells preserve the stem cell pool for activation following disease or injury.

During neuroblast asymmetric division, the scaffolding protein Miranda (Mira) is partitioned into the differentiating daughter cell, called a ganglion mother cell (GMC), and it carries at least three cargo proteins: the translational repressors Staufen and Brain tumor (Brat) and the transcriptional repressor Prospero (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hirata et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Broadus and Doe, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Ikeshima-Kataoka et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Broadus et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Schuldt et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Shen et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bello et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Betschinger et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lee et al., 2006</xref>). In the GMC, Mira appears to be degraded and its cargo is released into the cytoplasm (Staufen, Brat) or the nucleus (Prospero).

We hypothesized that loss of a progenitor marker or gain of a differentiation marker might induce neuroblast quiescence. As a model system we used the identified neuroblast 3–3 in the thoracic segments (NB3-3T) which reliably enters quiescence at embryonic stage 15 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Tsuji et al., 2008</xref>). Moreover, neuroblast 3–3 in abdominal segments (NB3-3A) remains proliferative until the end of embryogenesis and provides an excellent internal control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Tsuji et al., 2008</xref>). Previous work showed that the quiescent NB3-3T can be recognized by Deadpan, a basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Zhu et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chell and Brand, 2010</xref>).

During neuroblast asymmetric cell division, Miranda-Prospero and Partner of numb (Pon)-Numb protein complexes are independently segregated into the GMC to promote differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Doe, 2008</xref>). In <italic>prospero</italic> mutants, Numb is still properly segregated to GMCs where it represses Notch activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Spana and Doe, 1995</xref>) and consequently the Notch reporter mγ-LacZ is restricted to parental neuroblasts. <italic>mγ-LacZ</italic> is transcribed only in neuroblasts; in wild type the protein perdures into neuroblast progeny, whereas in <italic>prospero</italic> mutants the protein is restricted to neuroblasts because the progeny proliferate without expressing mγ-LacZ and thus dilute out the protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Choksi et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A,B</xref>). Thus, we scored for EdU incorporation in the mγ-LacZ+ parental neuroblasts. Whereas in wild type nearly all neuroblasts ceased EdU incorporation by stage 16 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>), many mγ-LacZ+ neuroblasts continued to incorporate EdU in <italic>prospero</italic> mutants at the same stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). This strongly supports a model in which Prospero is required for neuroblast entry into quiescence. In addition, Prospero is unique among basal cell fate determinants in regulating neuroblast quiescence: loss of function mutations in <italic>numb</italic> or <italic>brat</italic>, or the Prospero target gene <italic>string</italic>, showed no effect on the timing of neuroblast quiescence (data not shown).<fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.03363.008</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Prospero is required for neuroblast quiescence.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>–<bold>B</bold>) Wild type and <italic>prospero</italic> mutant (<italic>pros</italic><sup><italic>17</italic></sup>) stage 16 embryos.

The results suggest that the level of Prospero required for neuroblast quiescence is lower than that in <italic>prospero</italic> haplo-insufficiency and that a low level of Prospero is sufficient to promote neuroblast quiescence (see next section). We conclude that Prospero is required for neuroblast quiescence.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Prospero is sufficient to induce neuroblast quiescence</title><p>The central brain neuroblasts are continuously proliferating during the third larval instar (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Ito and Hotta, 1992</xref>), and so we used this stage to determine whether transient Prospero expression could induce neuroblast quiescence. We used the TARGET method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">McGuire et al., 2003</xref>) to transiently induce Prospero expression for 2 hr, and then assayed for neuroblast quiescence 12 hr later (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Because high levels of Prospero can induce neuroblast differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Choksi et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cabernard and Doe, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bayraktar et al., 2010</xref>), we used Prospero levels low enough to minimize neuroblast differentiation, as shown by the persistence of most Deadpan+ neuroblasts after misexpression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). We identified quiescent neuroblasts by their failure to incorporate EdU, lack of progenitor marker Worniu, and lack of the differentiation marker Elav—together a robust signature for quiescent neuroblasts (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). In wild-type larval brains, we found few or no quiescent neuroblasts, as expected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E,F</xref>). In contrast, a pulse of Prospero resulted in the appearance of numerous quiescent neuroblasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E,F</xref>; 12 hr timepoint). To rule out the possibility that these ‘quiescent neuroblasts’ were early in the differentiation pathway, we reasoned that if they were quiescent they could reactivate proliferation in a nourishing environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chell and Brand, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Sousa-Nunes et al., 2010</xref>) whereas if they were differentiating they would never re-enter the cell cycle. Thus, we exposed larval neuroblasts to the same 2 hr pulse of Prospero, but waited 24 hr to assay neuroblasts. We found that nearly all of the neuroblasts that were quiescent at 12 hr after induction had reactivated proliferation and re-expressed progenitor markers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E,F</xref>; 24 hr timepoint). In addition, precocious low level nuclear Prospero could advance the timing of NB3-3T quiescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>). We conclude that transient, low-level nuclear Prospero is sufficient to induce neuroblast quiescence. Interestingly, Prospero can also transiently arrest the cell cycle without inducing differentiation in embryonic longitudinal glial progenitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26a">Griffiths and Hidalgo, 2004</xref>), although the relative levels of Prospero have not been explored in this system.<fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.03363.009</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Prospero is sufficient to induce neuroblast quiescence.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>–<bold>C</bold>) Transient overexpression of nuclear Prospero in neuroblasts (<italic>worniu-gal4 UAS-HA:prospero tub-gal80</italic><sup><italic>ts</italic></sup>) results in neuroblast quiescence (<bold>A</bold>) or differentiation (<bold>B</bold>).

They find that the NB3-3T lineage displays a brief pulse of weak Pros nuclear expression just prior to entering quiescence. Mutant and mis-expression analysis lends support for the notion that this brief pulse in fact induces quiescence. They also address this notion in the postembryonic neuroblasts, and find support for a similar role for Pros in quiescence. Since we know very little about the fascinating, and even potentially medically important phenomena of stem cell quiescence, this study is of importance, and would likely be interesting for a broader audience. However, the manuscript is not without problems, and several issues should be addressed prior to publication.</p><p>Substantive concerns:</p><p>1) If a weak and brief pulse of Pros protein in NB nuclei is indeed important for NB quiescence, it is possible that pros may show haplo-insufficiency. To this end, they could analyze NB3-3T quiescence in pros heterozygotes. In addition, given the role of <italic>grh</italic> in quiescence, any heterozygotic effect of pros may be enhanced in transhet with <italic>grh</italic> i.e., <italic>pros+/-; grh+/-</italic>. Any such genetic dosage effect would greatly strengthen the study.</p><p>2) In the Introduction section and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1–figure supplement 1</xref>: They state that “However, loss or misexpression of Worniu, Asense, or CycE has no effect on the timing of NB3-3T quiescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1–figure supplement 1</xref>; data not shown)”. I cannot find any data regarding that misexpression of these factors cannot affect the timing of NB3-3T quiescence. This is an important point in the paper, and some data should be provided.</p><p>3) In pros mutants GMCs are de-differentiated into NBs, and hence express NB markers, e.g. Dpn. Hence, they use mgamma-LacZ to identify NBs in pros mutants. This is a reasonable approach, given that the asymmetric localization of Numb into GMCs (which is not affected in pros) results in expression of mgamma-lacZ only in the NBs. However, given that b-gal has a half-life in embryos of 8-12 hrs, it is not clear to me how the b-gal can label only NBs. Yes, the transgene is only transcriptionally active in NBs, but surely the b-gal protein, being quite stable and not subjected to asymmetric distribution, must label daughter cells as well. We need to be convinced, in this context, that all or in fact any of the ectopically EdU labelled cells in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref> are actually NBs. Similarly, in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C-D</xref>, in pros mutants there is b-gal expression (as well as Mira expression) in several cells in the NB3-3T lineage; how can the authors be sure that the EdU positive cell is the NB?</p><p>4) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1 fig4s2">Figure 4–figure supplement 1 and 2</xref>: They mis-express pros in NB3-3T, and find that it can induce NB quiescence. This is not surprising, given the role of pros in terminating proliferation.</p><p>5) Regarding postembryonic NBs, there are at least two previous publications that have addressed the function of pros in postembryonic NBs. In the paper from the Gould lab (Maraunge et al, 2008, Supplement <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>) they show ectopic dividing cells in pros MARCM clones. However, since the clones are quite large, and they use few markers, ectopically dividing cells may just as well be GMCs and not NBs. Similarly, in the recent paper from the Doe lab itself (Bayraktar et al., Neural Dev, 2010,) they only study GOF effects of Pros, and find no pros LOF effects in Type I NBs. In the current study, they again show that GOF of pros can trigger NB quiescence in postembryonic NBs. This is not surprising given the two previous publications. However, they provide no new LOF data supporting the idea that Pros is necessary for NB quiescence.</p><p>6) The targets of Pros that induce/repress neuroblast quiescence are unknown. Pros has been shown to repress neuroblast cell-fate genes and cell-cycle genes in GMCs (Choksi SP, et al., Dev Cell 2006). The authors mentioned that loss or misexpression of Wor, Ase or CycE has no effect on the timing of NB3-3T quiescence. Have they tested these in 3rd instar central larval brain neuroblasts, in which the transient Pros expression was shown to induce neuroblast quiescence? Also, have they tested the role of String, an important cell cycle regulator that was repressed by Pros (Choksi SP, et al., Dev Cell 2006)?</p><p>7) The authors could also discuss the potential role of other cell fate determinants (Numb and Brat) in neuroblast quiescence. It will be valuable to know if the role of Pros represents a general function of cell fate determinants in regulating neuroblast quiescence or is Pros unique among the cell fate determinants in this process.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.03363.013</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>1) If a weak and brief pulse of Pros protein in NB nuclei is indeed important for NB quiescence, it is possible that pros may show haplo-insufficiency.

The results suggest that the levels of Prospero required for neuroblast quiescence is lower than that in <italic>pros</italic> haplo-insufficiency, which is consistent with our conclusions from the overexpression studies. We have added the result in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref> and revised the Results section: “In both wild type and prospero haplo-insufficiency embryos, the mγ-LacZ+ NB3-3T was proliferative at stage 14 and quiescent by stage 16 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, quantified in 3E). In prospero mutant embryos, the mγ-LacZ+ NB3-3T was proliferative at both stage 14 and 16 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>, quantified in 3E). The results suggest that the level of Prospero required for neuroblast quiescence is lower than that in prospero haplo-insufficiency and that a low level of Prospero is sufficient to promote neuroblast quiescence.”</p><p>Although <italic>grh</italic> plays an important role in regulating Pros activity in larval neuroblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Maurange et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chai et al., 2013</xref>), it is unknown whether <italic>grh</italic> plays a similar role in embryonic neuroblasts. If <italic>grh</italic> regulates the timing of neuroblast quiescence by preventing Pronuclear accumulation, trans-heterozygous <italic>pros+/- grh+/-</italic> will show no phenotype as Grh and Pros counteract each other in regulating neuroblast quiescence. As expected, we didn’t find any phenotype regarding the timing of neuroblast quiescence in the <italic>pros+/- grh+/-</italic>trans-heterozygous mutants (data not shown). Nevertheless, the concern led us to put back the discussion we removed in the previous submission due to the limitation of space: “In embryonic neuroblasts, the temporal transcription factors Pdm and Cas schedule the timing of neuroblast quiescence, but how they regulate Prospero nuclear import is unknown. In larval neuroblasts, Grh prevents accumulation of nuclear Prospero which would induce neuroblast cell cycle exit and differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chai et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Maurange et al., 2008</xref>), again by an unknown mechanism.”</p><p><italic>2) In the Introduction section and</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1"><italic>Figure 1–figure supplement 1</italic></xref><italic>: They state that “However, loss or misexpression of Worniu, Asense, or CycE has no effect on the timing of NB3-3T quiescence (</italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1"><italic>Figure 1–figure supplement 1</italic></xref><italic>; data not shown)”. I cannot find any data regarding that misexpression of these factors cannot affect the timing of NB3-3T quiescence. This is an important point in the paper, and some data should be provided</italic>.</p><p>We agree, and we have added a new figure with the requested data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1–figure supplement 2</xref>). In summary, when we overexpressed Ase or CycE, we didn’t observe significant change in the number of proliferating neuroblasts.</p><p><italic>3) In pros mutants GMCs are de-differentiated into NBs, and hence express NB markers, e.g. Dpn. Hence, they use mgamma-LacZ to identify NBs in pros mutants.

The short answer is that <italic>pros</italic> mutant GMCs do not transcribe mγ-lacZ but continue to divide and thus dilute out mγ−lacZ, resulting in high level mγ−lacZ specifically in the parental neuroblasts. We have clarified this in the Results section: “mγ-LacZ is transcribed only in neuroblasts; in wild type the protein perdures into neuroblast progeny, whereas in prospero mutants the protein is restricted to neuroblasts because the progeny proliferate without expressing mγ-LacZ and thus dilute out the protein (Choksi et al.; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A,B</xref>).”</p><p>We thank the reviewers for helping us clarify this important point, which further supports our identification of NB3-3T in the <italic>prospero</italic> mutants, and our conclusion that Prospero is required for neuroblast quiescence.</p><p><italic>4)</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1 fig4s2"><italic>Figure 4–figure supplement 1 and 2</italic></xref><italic>: They mis-express pros in NB3-3T, and find that it can induce NB quiescence. This is not surprising, given the role of pros in terminating proliferation</italic>.</p><p>Yes, we agree that a major role of Prospero in neural progenitor cells is to terminate proliferation as previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Li and Vaessin, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Choksi et al., 2006</xref>). However, we want to emphasize that our new discovery is the dosage effect of Prospero in the progenitor cells: high levels of Pros will terminate proliferation and induce differentiation, while low levels of Pros transiently arrest cell cycle but are not sufficient to change the neuroblast identity, which leads to quiescence. We have added the following sentence in the Result section to further emphasize our main conclusion in the current study: “Our results confirm that high levels of Prospero can trigger differentiation, and reveal that low levels of Prospero induce quiescence in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> neuroblasts.”</p><p><italic>5) Regarding postembryonic NBs, there are at least two previous publications that have addressed the function of pros in postembryonic NBs. In the paper from the Gould lab (</italic><italic>Maraunge et al, 2008</italic><italic>, Supplement</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3"><italic>Figure 3C</italic></xref><italic>) they show ectopic dividing cells in pros MARCM clones.

However, they provide no new LOF data supporting the idea that Pros is necessary for NB quiescence</italic>.</p><p>In our Results section, we have shown that loss of Prospero can delay the timing of neuroblast quiescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). We have also shown that transient overexpression of low levels of Prospero can induce neuroblast quiescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). To help readers easily understand our studies, we have revised the first sentence in the section of “Prospero is required for neuroblast quiescence” as follows: “Having shown a strong correlation between the timing of nuclear Prospero and neuroblast entry into quiescence, we next asked if Prospero is required for neuroblast entry into quiescence and loss of nuclear Prospero can delay the timing of neuroblast quiescence.”</p><p><italic>6) The targets of Pros that induce/repress neuroblast quiescence are unknown. Pros has been shown to repress neuroblast cell-fate genes and cell-cycle genes in GMCs (Choksi SP, et al.,</italic> <italic>Dev Cell 2006</italic><italic>). The authors mentioned that loss or misexpression of Wor, Ase or CycE has no effect on the timing of NB3-3T quiescence. Have they tested these in 3rd instar central larval brain neuroblasts, in which the transient Pros expression was shown to induce neuroblast quiescence? Also, have they tested the role of String, an important cell cycle regulator that was repressed by Pros (Choksi SP, et al.,</italic> <italic>Dev Cell 2006</italic><italic>)?</italic></p><p>In our earlier paper (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lai et al., 2012</xref>, Dev Cell), we showed that <italic>wor</italic> mutant larval neuroblasts prematurely differentiate or die, while overexpression of Wor results in the cell cycle arrest but not quiescence. We have also used <italic>cycE-RNAi</italic> (FBti0140127) and <italic>ase-RNAi</italic> (FBti0158728) to knock down CycE and Ase, respectively, but could not induce larval neuroblast quiescence (data not shown). We thus conclude that loss of CycE, Ase or Wor do not induce larval neuroblast quiescence.</p><p>As requested, we tested the role of String in neuroblast quiescence. We examined stg mutants for neuroblast EdU incorporation and Ase, Wor and Mira markers all are absent in quiescent neuroblasts. Interestingly, <italic>string</italic> mutant neuroblasts are EdU- as expected, but did not downregulate Ase, Wor and Mira, showing that they did not match the gene expression profile of quiescent neuroblasts. We conclude that although <italic>string</italic> is repressed by Pros, <italic>string</italic> downregulation is not sufficient to induce neuroblast quiescence. We add: “In addition, Prospero is unique among basal cell fate determinants in regulating neuroblast quiescence: loss of function mutations in numb or brat, or the Prospero target gene string, showed no effect on the timing of neuroblast quiescence (data not shown)”.</p><p><italic>7) The authors could also discuss the potential role of other cell fate determinants (Numb and Brat) in neuroblast quiescence. It will be valuable to know if the role of Pros represents a general function of cell fate determinants in regulating neuroblast quiescence or is Pros unique among the cell fate determinants in this process</italic>.</p><p>We thank the reviewers for this comment, which allowed us to add new experiments that further highlight the unique role of Pros in promoting neuroblast quiescence. We found that <italic>numb</italic> or <italic>brat</italic> null mutant embryos did not exhibit a delay or advance in neuroblast quiescence (data not shown). We add: “In addition, Prospero is unique among basal cell fate determinants in regulating neuroblast quiescence: loss of function mutations in numb or brat, or the Prospero target gene string, showed no effect on the timing of neuroblast quiescence (data not shown)”.</p></body></sub-article></article>
