These innate abilities render infections by this human pathogen a clinical challenge. How <italic>C. glabrata</italic> reacts inside macrophages and what is the molecular basis of its drug tolerance are not well understood. Here, we mapped genome-wide RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) occupancy in <italic>C. glabrata</italic> to delineate its transcriptional responses during macrophage infection in high temporal resolution. RNAPII profiles revealed dynamic <italic>C. glabrata</italic> responses to macrophages with genes of specialized pathways activated chronologically at different times of infection. We identified an uncharacterized transcription factor (CgXbp1) important for the chronological macrophage response, survival in macrophages, and virulence. Genome-wide mapping of CgXbp1 direct targets further revealed its multi-faceted functions, regulating not only virulence-related genes but also genes associated with drug resistance. Finally, we showed that CgXbp1 indeed also affects fluconazole resistance. Overall, this work presents a powerful approach for examining host-pathogen interaction and uncovers a novel transcription factor important for <italic>C. glabrata</italic>’s survival in macrophages and drug tolerance.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd><italic>Candida glabrata</italic></kwd><kwd>macrophage response</kwd><kwd>drug resistance</kwd><kwd>transcription factors</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100016252</institution-id><institution>Research Services and Knowledge Transfer Office, University of Macau</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MYRG2019-00099-FHS</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wong</surname><given-names>Koon Ho</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100006469</institution-id><institution>Fundo para o Desenvolvimento das Ciências e da Tecnologia</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>0033/2021/A1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wong</surname><given-names>Koon Ho</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100016252</institution-id><institution>Research Services and Knowledge Transfer Office, University of Macau</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MYRG2022-00107-FHS</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wong</surname><given-names>Koon Ho</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100006469</institution-id><institution>Fundo para o Desenvolvimento das Ciências e da Tecnologia</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>0099/2022/A2</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wong</surname><given-names>Koon Ho</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The dynamic transcription responses of the human fungal pathogen <italic>Candida glabrata</italic> during macrophage infection is revealed and a novel transcription factor important for the responses to macrophage, proliferation within macrophage, as well as anti-fungal drug resistance has been discovered.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Phagocytes such as macrophages constitute the first line of host immune defence against invading pathogens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brown, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Erwig and Gow, 2016</xref>).

Relative to other fungal species including <italic>C. albicans</italic>, <italic>C. glabrata</italic> is more resistant to antifungal drugs like fluconazole and can survive and proliferate inside immune cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Katsipoulaki et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Rai et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Seider et al., 2011</xref>). Thus far, details about how <italic>C. glabrata</italic> survives, adapts, and proliferates in phagocytes and the basis for its intrinsically high azole resistance are still not clearly understood.</p><p>Genome-wide transcriptomic studies have been performed to map the response of <italic>Candida species</italic> during macrophage infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kaur et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lorenz et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lorenz and Fink, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Rai et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Rubin-Bejerano et al., 2003</xref>), but the insights gained into the infection process so far lack temporal resolution, centering mostly on the late stages of the pathogen-host interactions. We reason that the immediate and early pathogen response is pivotal for survival and adaptation in the host, while responses during later stages reflect strategies for growth and proliferation. Therefore, delineating the whole episode of pathogen response, instead of just a snapshot, during infection is fundamental to understanding pathogenesis. However, conventional transcriptomic analysis involving mRNAs are less suitable for dissecting dynamic temporal transcriptional changes, as measurements of mRNA levels are convoluted by transcript stabilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Tan and Wong, 2019</xref>).</p><p>Here, we applied the powerful Chromatin Immuno-precipitation followed by the Next Generation Sequencing (ChIP-seq) method against elongating RNA Polymerase II (RNAPII) to map <italic>C. glabrata</italic> transcriptional responses during macrophage infection. We show that <italic>C. glabrata</italic> responds to macrophage infection by mounting chronological transcriptional responses. Based on the transcription pattern, we identified many candidate transcriptional regulators including a novel transcription factor, CgXbp1, for the macrophage response. Deletion of <italic>CgXBP1</italic> led to accelerated transcriptional activation of genes associated with multiple biological processes during interaction with macrophages. We further demonstrate that CgXbp1 is a multifaceted transcription factor directly binding to many <italic>C. glabrata</italic> genes with functions associated with the pathogenesis and drug resistance processes. <italic>CgXBP1</italic> deletion resulted in attenuated survival in host macrophages, diminished virulence in the <italic>Galleria mellonella</italic> model of Candidiasis, and elevated resistance to the antifungal drug fluconazole. Overall, our work uncovers an important novel transcription factor for <italic>C. glabrata</italic>’s survival in macrophages and antifungal drug resistance.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Mapping high temporal resolution transcriptional responses of <italic>C. glabrata</italic> during macrophage infection</title><p>To understand how <italic>C. glabrata</italic> survives macrophage phagocytosis, we applied ChIP-seq against elongating RNAPII in a time-course experiment after 0.5, 2, 4, 6, and 8 hr of THP-1 macrophage infection to map genome-wide transcription responses of <italic>C. glabrata</italic> during different stages of THP-1 macrophage infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). As expected, genes known to be induced by macrophage phagocytosis e.g., tricarboxylic acid [TCA] cycle, glyoxylate bypass, and iron homeostasis genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kaur et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Rai et al., 2012</xref>) had significant RNAPII occupancies at their gene bodies specifically but not at inter-genic regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). In addition, the ChIP-seq data also revealed temporal gene expression information. For example, the ATP synthesis gene <italic>CgCYC1</italic> was dramatically up-regulated immediately (0.5 hr) upon macrophage internalisation, while the TCA cycle gene <italic>CgCIT2</italic> and glyoxylate bypass gene <italic>CgICL1</italic> were induced slightly later at 2 hr and their transcription levels decreased subsequently (4–6 hr <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>).

In the immediate response (0.5 hr), genes (Group 1, n=181) were significantly enriched in processes such as adhesion, responses to copper ion and nitrogen compound, positive regulation of nuclear export in response to glucose starvation, lipid oxidation, and ATP synthesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). This indicated that <italic>C. glabrata</italic> experiences nutrient and energy deprivation immediately upon entry to macrophages. Alternatively, the induction of ATP biosynthesis genes may reflect a strong demand for energy by <italic>C. glabrata</italic> to deal with the host’s attacks and/or to adapt to the host microenvironment. Subsequently (2 hr post phagocytosis), <italic>C. glabrata</italic> underwent a major metabolic remodelling presumably to prepare for growth and generate energy, as reflected by the next wave of transcriptional induction for genes (Group 2, n=171) involved in the TCA cycle, biosynthesis of inosine 5’ monophosphate (IMP), carboxylic acid, amino acid, nucleotide, and precursor for metabolite and energy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C and D</xref>). In addition, cell cycle arrest and DNA damage checkpoint genes (<italic>CgMEC3, CgGLC7, CAGL0G07271g, and CAGL0A04213g</italic>) were also strongly induced at this early stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref>), and <italic>C. glabrata</italic> cells were indeed arrested at the G1-S phase cell cycle after macrophage engulfment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B</xref>). It is noteworthy that many genes and pathways previously shown to be critical for <italic>C. glabrata</italic> virulence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kasper et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kaur et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Rai et al., 2012</xref>) such as adherence, response to DNA damage, oxidative stress, autophagy, TCA cycle, amino acid biosynthesis, and iron homeostasis were markedly induced at the early stages (0.5 and 2 hr <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3A–G</xref>). Therefore, virulence-centric biological processes were among the most immediate <italic>C. glabrata</italic> responses upon macrophage phagocytosis, implying the importance of the early transcriptional response towards its adaptation and survival in macrophages.</p><p>During the next stage of infection (2–4 hr), <italic>C. glabrata</italic> continued to actively transcribe genes associated with carbon metabolism, DNA repair, and pathogenesis (Group 3, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C and D</xref>). It is interesting to note that gluconeogenesis and glycolysis genes (as determined based on the genes of the unidirectional rate-limiting steps) were both induced during macrophage infection but at different times – first with gluconeogenesis genes followed by glycolysis genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4A</xref>), suggesting that phagocytosed <italic>C. glabrata</italic> cells were still trying to achieve metabolic homeostasis and to counter macrophage internal milieu at this stage. In addition, genes required for chromatin assembly and modification were also significantly induced at this stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4B and C</xref>), supporting an earlier report about the involvement of chromatin remodelling during the infection process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Rai et al., 2012</xref>). Towards the later phase of this stage (4 hr), genes for responses to different stresses (e.g. oxidative, chemical stress, and osmolarity) and resistance thermo-tolerance and oxidative stress (e.g. trehalose biosynthesis and pentose phosphate pathway, respectively) become maximally induced (Group 4, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C and D</xref>). The induction of these stress response pathway genes towards the end of metabolic remodelling is somewhat unexpected, as it suggests that phagocytic attacks (e.g. ROS) against <italic>C. glabrata</italic> might not have occurred until the later phase. However, as shown above, the observation that DNA repair and damage response genes were already upregulated at 2 hr indicates that cells had already experienced the attacks. These findings collectively suggest that <italic>C. glabrata</italic> elicits a coordinated stage-wise response during infection; first adapting to macrophage nutrient microenvironment before overcoming phagocytic attacks. Interestingly, a family of sterol uptake genes (known as <italic>TIR</italic> [Tip1-related]) displayed concerted transcription activation at the end of this stage (4 hr <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5</xref>). In <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>, <italic>TIR</italic> genes are activated and required for growth under anaerobic conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abramova et al., 2001</xref>). Given that sterols are an essential component of the cell membrane and that ergosterol biosynthesis is an oxygen-dependent process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Joffrion and Cushion, 2010</xref>), the up-regulation of the <italic>TIR</italic> genes indicates an experience of oxygen deprivation and a need for sterols (presumably for proliferation) by <italic>C. glabrata</italic>.</p><p>Towards the late stage (6–8 hr), genes required for biofilm formation, and iron homeostasis, both of which play critical roles in the pathogenesis process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Rodrigues et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Seider et al., 2014</xref>), became maximal induced (Group 5, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C and D</xref>). In fact, over 70% of the previously identified iron-responsive genes (154 out of 214, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Denecker et al., 2020</xref>) were induced during macrophage infection. As iron homeostasis is necessary for cell growth and proliferation, this observation potentially suggests that the cells are preparing for growth, and this is consistent with the concomitant induction of the biofilm formation genes that are also necessary for proliferation. Altogether, the overall results revealed details of the dynamic stage-wise responses of <italic>C. glabrata</italic> during macrophage infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Identification of potential transcriptional regulators of early temporal response</title><p>We next attempted to identify the potential transcriptional regulators for the chronological transcriptional response. Remarkably, more than 25% of <italic>C. glabrata</italic> transcription factor (TF) genes (n=53) were expressed during macrophage infection (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>), with 39 TF genes showing a temporal induction pattern (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Of note, eleven TFs (Aft1, Ap5, Haa1, Hap4, Hap5, Msn4, Upc2, Yap1, Yap3, Yap6, and Yap7) are known to either bind or control some of the macrophage infection-induced genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref>) as reported by PathoYeastract (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Monteiro et al., 2020</xref>). More importantly, these TFs are known to control genes for response to and survival inside macrophages; e.g., Aft1, Hap4, Yap1, and Yap7 have been shown to regulate iron homeostasis genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Denecker et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Denecker et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Merhej et al., 2016</xref>), Msn4 and Yap1 regulate oxidative stress response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cuéllar-Cruz et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Roetzer et al., 2010</xref>) and Yap6 is important for pH stresses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Zhou et al., 2020</xref>).

In contrast, many distinct CgXbp1<sup>MYC</sup> ChIP-seq peaks were detected throughout the genome in macrophage-phagocytosed cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). A total of 251 CgXbp1<sup>MYC</sup> binding sites were commonly identified in biological replicates by MACS2 (Model-based Analyses for ChIP-seq) peak-calling analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Zhang et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp6">Supplementary file 6</xref>).

This work provides insights into the physiological events occurring at different stages of macrophage infection and identifies a novel transcription regulator important for responding to and proliferating within macrophages as well as the regulation of fluconazole resistance.</p><p>Through mapping genome-wide RNAPII occupancy, our result reveals that about 30% of <italic>C. glabrata</italic> genes are transcribed during the adaptation, survival, and growth inside the alien macrophage microenvironments. The number of genes may be an underestimate of the overall response, as the RNAPII ChIP-seq method has a narrow, low detection range relative to RNAseq and may not be able to detect lowly transcribed genes. Nevertheless, our data reveal dynamic temporal responses during macrophage infection. At the most immediate response (0–0.5 hr), <italic>C. glabrata</italic> activates adherence-related genes to initiate adhesion to host surfaces. Concurrently, <italic>C. glabrata</italic> elicits specific responses to the nutrient-limiting microenvironment inside macrophages. This immediate response is followed by <italic>C. glabrata</italic> efforts to deal with oxidative and DNA-damage stresses (0–2 hr), and at this time the phagocytosed <italic>C. glabrata</italic> cells are arrested at the G1-S phase of the cell cycle. Subsequently (2–4 hr), <italic>C. glabrata</italic> undergoes transcriptional remodeling to adjust its carbon metabolism, presumably to generate energy for future challenges, growth, and/or proliferation. Consistently, processes necessary for growth such as global transcription, ribosome biogenesis, and copper and iron ion homeostasis are activated around this time (2–6 hr). In particular, iron homeostasis probably has an overwhelming role in the pathogenic adaptation of <italic>C. glabrata</italic>, as a large number of iron-responsive genes (n=154) including those with iron uptake functions are transcribed during macrophage infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>). Iron bioavailability in macrophages is presumably limited, and high-affinity iron uptake is pivotal for virulence in <italic>C. glabrata</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bairwa et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Srivastava et al., 2014</xref>). Therefore, these transcriptional activities indicate that <italic>C. glabrata</italic> is still adapting to the macrophage microenvironment at this stage of infection. Lastly (8 hr), <italic>C. glabrata</italic> induced genes associated with cell proliferation and biofilm formation, implying that they have overcome macrophage attacks and are ready to grow and divide.</p><p>It is noteworthy that <italic>C. glabrata</italic>‘s transcriptional responses to macrophages are concerted at stages. For example, despite sensing starvation within the first 0.5 hr upon macrophage engulfment, <italic>C. glabrata</italic> does not activate alternate carbon catabolic pathways until 2 hr. In addition, gene expression and translation-related genes show the lowest transcription levels (i.e. RNAPII occupancy) at this immediate stage (0.5 hr) relative to the other time points (Group 6 genes in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C and D</xref>), indicating global suppression of gene expression in <italic>C. glabrata</italic> upon macrophage phagocytosis. A recent study showed that the fungal pathogen <italic>Cryptococcus neoformans</italic> also down-regulates translation during exposure to oxidative stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Leipheimer et al., 2019</xref>). The global suppression of gene expression under stressful conditions probably helps pathogens to reserve energy and resources for coping with stress such as the hostile, nutrient-limiting macrophage environment.</p><p>Transcriptional responses are determined by the overall TFs activities in a cell. The RNAPII profiles revealed a panel of 53 TF genes expressed during macrophage infection. In particular, 39 of them were temporally induced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>) and are promising candidate regulators for the stage-specific transcription responses. The orthologues of several transcription factors in different fungal pathogens are involved in stress response, macrophage killing, and virulence. For example, <italic>C. glabrata</italic> Yap6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Zhou et al., 2020</xref>) and the conserved CgRim101 orthologues in several fungal pathogens control pH response and is important for host adaptation and virulence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Davis et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">O’Meara et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Peñalva et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Yuan et al., 2010</xref>); <italic>C. albicans</italic> Rtg1 is necessary for adaption to ROS and, therefore, host colonisation and virulence <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Oneissi et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Pérez et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Pérez and Johnson, 2013</xref>; the Zap1 orthologue of <italic>Cryptococcus gattii</italic> controls zinc homeostasis and affect virulence; <italic>C. albicans</italic> Tye7 activates glycolysis genes during macrophage infection to induce glucose competition and, consequently, macrophage killing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Tucey et al., 2018</xref>) and is required for full virulence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Askew et al., 2009</xref>). It is interesting to note that the glycolysis and gluconeogenesis pathways were both induced during infection but the maximal induction occurred at different times of the early to intermediate infection stage, suggesting that that phagocytosed <italic>C. glabrata</italic> is striving to adapt to the nutrient available within the macrophage micro-environment and maintain metabolic homeostasis. A similar observation was found for <italic>C. albicans</italic> which undergoes multiple rounds of metabolic reprogramming during macrophage infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Tucey et al., 2018</xref>). Moreover, transient fluctuation in peroxisome number that indicates metabolic switching has also been reported in phagocytosed <italic>C. glabrata</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Roetzer et al., 2010</xref>). In <italic>C. albicans</italic>, a recent study demonstrated glucose competition as a key strategy of phagocytosed cells to kill macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Tucey et al., 2018</xref>). The up-regulation of the glycolysis genes in our infection time course experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4A</xref>) suggests that <italic>C. glabrata</italic> also metabolises glucose within macrophages. However, unlike <italic>C. albicans</italic>, <italic>C. glabrata</italic> does not cause massive macrophage killing but instead proliferates inside macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kaur et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Seider et al., 2011</xref>). It seems that <italic>C. glabrata</italic> can acquire its carbon nutritional needs without causing glucose depletion in the host, and this may be related to its dependency on autophagy to survive and proliferate in macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Roetzer et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>Of note, four TFs (CgHap3, CgXbp1, CgDal80, and CgRpa12) were strongly activated at the earliest infection stage. In <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, the orthologues of three TFs play negative regulatory roles (i.e. transcriptional repressors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Mai and Breeden, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Marzluf, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Yadav et al., 2016</xref>), suggesting that transcriptional repression plays crucial roles in shaping the early and, consequently, overall transcriptional response to macrophages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). In addition, the <italic>C. albicans HAP3</italic> gene has been implicated in modulating immune cell recognition and response during phagocytosis by dendritic cells through controlling cell wall remodelling genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Tierney et al., 2012</xref>). The upregulation of CgHap3 in <italic>C. glabrata</italic> during the early stage of macrophage infection suggests a similar conserved strategy to escape immune cell recognition.</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Schematic models for the role of CgXbp1 during macrophage infection and in fluconazole resistance.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Upon macrophage infection, the gene of <italic>Cgxbp1</italic> and several transcriptional repressors are transcriptionally induced at the early stage of macrophage infection. CgXbp1 and the other repressors then inhibit the expression of their target genes, which are expressed at the subsequent stages. In the absence of CgXbp1, induction of these intermediate/late response genes is temporally advanced. Therefore, CgXbp1 (presumably the other repressors) acts to delay the expression of different subsets of genes until later. When <italic>C. glabrata</italic> cells are adjusted to the macrophage host, CgXbp1 repression of its target genes is relieved through transcriptional down-regulation, allowing their functions to be expressed. We propose that, in addition to activators, repressors also play an important role in orchestrating the dynamic temporal transcription response of <italic>C. glabrata</italic> during macrophage infection. (<bold>B</bold>) CgXbp1 also has a role in fluconazole resistance. In the absence of fluconazole, CgXbp1 negatively regulates the expression of several drug efflux transporters, which are expressed at low but detectable levels in the wild-type. On the other hand, <italic>Cgxbp1</italic>∆ expresses the drug transporters at a higher level than wild-type cells, so the <italic>Cgxbp1</italic>∆ cell has more efflux transporters and, therefore, can pump out fluconazole (and other drugs) more rapidly. Consequently, <italic>Cgxbp1</italic>∆ cells can adapt better and initiate growth faster than wild type when exposed to fluconazole. After a prolonged exposure to fluconazole, our RNAseq data revealed that both wild-type and <italic>Cgxbp1</italic>∆ cells produce the same transcriptional response to fluconazole, indicating that CgXbp1 is not involved in the response (flu-responsive genes). The lack of CgXbp1 effect also suggests that CgXbp1’s function is inhibited by fluconazole. We propose that CgXbp1 controls the drug efflux potential in wild-type <italic>C. glabrata</italic> cells. This model was created in BioRender (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://BioRender.com/y60k027">https://biorender.com/y60k027</ext-link> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.biorender.com/q03d823">https://www.biorender.com/q03d823</ext-link>).</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-73832-fig7-v2.tif"/></fig><p>The importance of transcriptional repression was confirmed through the functional characterization of CgXbp1, which revealed that many genes were precociously activated in the <italic>Cgxbp1</italic>∆ mutant during macrophage infection. In addition, our ChIP-seq results showed that CgXbp1 directly binds to the promoter of many TFs, indicating that CgXbp1 indirectly represses the activation of many gene regulatory networks. Therefore, CgXbp1 exerts twofold regulation: directly controlling downstream effector genes and indirectly affecting gene networks of diverse pathways <italic>via</italic> their hierarchies (i.e. TFs).</p><p>It is noteworthy that the <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> orthologues of the other two uncharacterized proteins, CgDal80 and CgRpa12, negatively regulate genes involved in nitrogen and lipid metabolism, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hofman-Bang, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Yadav et al., 2016</xref>). We postulate that these repressors also act in the same fashion as CgXbp1 to delay the induction of other groups of genes (such as nitrogen and lipid metabolism genes) that are not immediately necessary for the immediate response but are required at later stages of macrophage infection and/or for proliferation. Therefore, our overall results suggest a mechanistic model for <italic>C. glabrata</italic>’s macrophage response, in which global transcriptional repression is established at the early infection stage to withhold activation of genes whose functions are not immediately needed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). The repression is subsequently relieved by transcriptional down-regulation and protein turnover of the repressors and/or through enhanced activation by pathway-specific transcriptional activators. The interplay between transcriptional activators and repressors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>) is crucial in shaping the dynamic transcriptional response during macrophage infection.</p><p>Our results further highlight the physiological significance of the temporal transcriptional responses of <italic>C. glabrata</italic> during macrophage infection. The precocious activation of numerous virulence genes, such as those involved in carbon and nitrogen metabolism, in the <italic>Cgxbp1</italic>∆ mutant resulted in decreased proliferation within phagocytic cells. This suggests that timely and coordinated expression of virulence genes is crucial for <italic>C. glabrata</italic>’s survival and pathogenic response during macrophage infection. Presumably, the pathogen needs to strategize the utilization of cellular resources to survive and counteract host attacks during infection, and this may also be the reason for the reduced virulence in the Galleria infection model.</p><p>In addition to its role in controlling macrophage response, CgXbp1 also plays a significant role in drug resistance. Our findings demonstrate that CgXbp1 does not affect the expression of ergosterol biosynthesis genes but primarily exerts its effect by repressing the expression of drug transporters, thereby controlling the efflux potential of the cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). Interestingly, even though the levels of CgXbp1 were significantly increased in the presence of fluconazole, we observed no changes in the global transcriptome of the <italic>Cgxbp1</italic>∆ mutant compared to the wild type. This suggests that fluconazole fully suppresses CgXbp1’s transcriptional activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). Presumably, the heightened level of CgXbp1 facilitates rapid gene repression when fluconazole levels decrease.</p><p>Collectively, this study unveils a multifaceted transcriptional regulator that is crucial for survival within macrophages and conferring antifungal drug resistance, two key properties unique to the human fungal pathogen <italic>C. glabrata</italic>.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Culture conditions for <italic>C. glabrata</italic> and THP-1 macrophages</title><p><italic>C. glabrata</italic> strain BG2 was used as the wild-type in all experiments and the parental strain for genetic modifications.

The read count data were obtained by using featureCounts (version 2.0.3 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Liao et al., 2014</xref>), and normalized expression levels are expressed in FPKM (e.g. fragments on CDS/[mapped reads/10^6×CDS Length/10^3]). These count data were used to determine the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) with DEseq2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Love et al., 2014</xref>). Genes with <italic>p</italic>-values less than 0.05 and fold-change greater than 1.5 or less than –1.5 were considered differentially expressed. GO analysis of DEGs was conducted on the FungiExpresZ tool (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Parsania et al., 2023</xref>). The analysis outputs of GO enrichment, correlation, and heatmap were obtained from FungiExpresZ. The volcano plots and dot plots were generated using the online platform SRplot (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.bioinformatics.com.cn">https://www.bioinformatics.com.cn</ext-link>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Tang et al., 2023</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Protein extraction and western blotting</title><p>For protein extraction from macrophage-internalized <italic>C. glabrata</italic> cells, THP-1 macrophages were infected as described above. At the indicated time post-infection, macrophages were lysed in sterile chilled water, and phagocytosed <italic>C. glabrata</italic> cells were recovered and washed with 1 X TBS buffer, transferred into 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tubes, and stored at –80 °C until use. <italic>C. glabrata</italic> cell pellets were resuspended in 1 X lysis buffer (50 mM HEPES, pH 7.5; 200 mM NaOAc, pH 7.5; 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM EGTA, 5 mM MgOAc, 5% Glycerol, 0.25% NP-40, 3 mM DTT and, 1 mM PMSF) supplemented with protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche). Zirconium beads equivalent to 100 µL volume was added in microcentrifuge tubes and resuspended cells were lysed by six rounds of bead beating on a bullet blender. The sample was centrifuged at 12,000 g at 4 °C for 10 min. Supernatant was carefully transferred to a new tube, and the resultant protein sample was quantified using a Biorad protein assay kit (DC protein assay kit, cat. no. 5000116), and stored in a –80 °C freezer. For western analysis, 25 µg of protein samples were resolved on 12% SDS-PAGE gel and blotted on a methanol-activated PVDF membrane (350 mA, 75 min in a cold room). PVDF membrane was transferred to 5% fat-free milk prepared in 1 X TBST for blocking and incubated for 1 hr. Membranes were probed with appropriate primary (anti-c-MYC antibody, Santa Cruz, cat. no. 9E10 and anti-Histone H3 antibody, Abcam, cat. no. ab1791) and secondary (goat anti-mouse IgG, Merck Millipore, cat. no. AP124P) antibodies, and Blots were developed by chemiluminescence based ECL western detection kit (GE Healthcare, cat. no. RPN2236) on Chemidoc gel imaging system.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group

Your article has been reviewed by 4 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Kevin Struhl as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions (for the authors):</p><p>- While the ChIP-seq on Xbp1 is interesting, it is obtained in a condition different from the macrophage infection and makes both datasets difficult to compare, as pointed by three of the reviewers. As commented by one of them, information obtained in quiescent cells can not be easily translated to the highly dynamic macrophage environment. Perhaps this is one of the major technical issues of the work as the comparisons of the datasets may (or may not) be yielding relevant information. Potential ways to solve this would be to (i) successfully repeat the Xbp1 ChipSeq analyses in macrophages or (ii) obtain PolII-ChipSeq data from quiescent cells. Of course, the first one is the preferred one as it would really help to elucidate the role of Xbp1 during early times of infection.</p><p>A plausible reason of why the authors obtained little correlation in such Chip experiments is that Xbp1 levels are rather low and therefore hard to analyze, which could (indirectly) suggest that Xbp1 may not have an important role in this process. This should be addressed/discussed.</p><p>- The relevance of the identified DNA motifs should be further analyzed, particularly as one of them appears quite different from what has been reported in yeast (which could be addressed by having proper PolII data of equivalent datasets, or experimental validation of the motifs through EMSA, DNA footprinting or reporter systems)</p><p>- As indicated by the reviewers it is important to better assess the relevance and real significance of the observed fluconazole resistance: i.e MIC, the strength of the phenotype, etc.</p><p>- It is also suggested to strengthen some of the conclusions derived from the gene expression data with some experimental validations (i.e at 30 minutes, are C. glabrata actually internalized or just associated?, which may explain the difference in adherence genes at early time points). The paper contains interesting datasets that could provide hints of relevant biological events. It becomes important to explicitly distinguish which are suggested mechanisms (only inferred from expression signatures) to likely mechanisms (combining expression data with data that could help validate such ideas)</p><p>There are several other issues pointed out that could be addressed by modifying/editing the text (i.e including relevant references, indicating the new lessons emerging from the dataset, compared with existing microarray datasets, better explaining cut-off values) and that should not require additional experiments.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>While the datasets are valuable and several observations are interesting, it is important to be cautious as the direct targets of CgXbp1 were characterized under one particular condition and the transcriptional analyses were obtained in another condition, one shown to be highly dynamic. Therefore, several inferred targets may or may not be under CgXbp1 control during macrophage infection. Most importantly, as it is, the study does not provide a clear parallel between one list of genes and the other one, to get a glimpse of such concepts. Since CgXbp1 shows to recognize distinct binding motifs, it becomes relevant to understand whether one group behaves differently from the other one in the absence of CgXbp1.</p><p>1. Line 180: &quot;similar number of genes were transcribed in the mutant during macrophage infection (1,471 versus 1,589 genes in Cgxbp1Δ and wildtype, respectively) (Supplementary File 5) and ~90% of the transcribed genes are common between wildtype and the mutant (Figure 2—figure supplement 1C), suggesting that CgXbp1 has little effect on the overall set of genes transcribed during macrophage infection&quot;</p><p>A relevant question that emerges here, is which are the genes that fail to appear activated in the CgXbp1 mutant. Such analysis is not clearly described in the Results section.</p><p>.- Line 265: &quot;While the TCGAG motif is similar to the consensus recognition sequence of <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> Xbp1 ([TCGA], Mai and Breeden, 1997)&quot;</p><p>Please further compare the obtained sequence with other reported consensus sequences for Xbp1, some of which actually share the entire TCGAG core, see</p><p>http://cisbp.ccbr.utoronto.ca/TFreport.php?searchTF=T012464_2.00</p><p>3. Line 269: &quot;Interestingly, the two motifs have different occurrence among the target promoters bound by CgXbp1MYC with the STVCN7TCT motif occurring approximately three times more frequent than the TCGAG sequence&quot;</p><p>While it is true that the authors are performing their ChIP-seq studies in a condition that is quite different from the ones involved in macrophage invasion, it is important to establish some correlative data regarding how these (potentially) two types of promotors behave.</p><p>The ideal experiment would be for them to generate PolII-ChIP-seq data from quiescent cells (or if not then RNAseq data), in order to clearly establish co-regulation patterns among the genes of interest, comparing both WT and CgXbp1 mutant.</p><p>In addition, one would expect to detect that the genes allegedly being direct targets of CgXbp1 would show a certain level of co-regulation in the existing PolII-ChipSeq data, particularly the groups exhibiting similar cis-elements.</p><p>4. Line 332: &quot;at this immediate stage (0.5 h) relative to the other time points (Group 6 genes in Figures 1CandD), indicating global suppression of gene expression in C. glabrata upon macrophage phagocytosis. A recent study showed that the fungal pathogen Cryptococcus neoformans also down-regulate translation during exposure to oxidative stress and suggested that translation suppression may facilitate the degradation of irrelevant transcripts during stress&quot;</p><p>Please notice that the commented strategies imply different mechanisms compared with what the authors observed. Thus, while the authors evidenced decreased overall transcriptional rates (as measured by PolII-ChipSeq), the cited work exemplifies decreased translation which appears to also affect the stability of some mRNAs. Most importantly, the authors are not measuring steady-state levels of transcripts (as would be determined by RNAseq) and therefore for transcripts that exhibit medium to long half-lives, a decrease in transcriptional rates may not be causing a dramatic effect in reduced time scales (as compared with highly unstable transcripts).</p><p>5. Line 351: &quot;In addition, the ChIP-seq experiment revealed that CgXbp1 directly binds to the promoter of many TFs including 10 carbon catabolite regulators (Figure 5G, Supplementary File 11), suggesting that CgXbp1 indirectly represses the activation of many gene regulatory networks. This probably explains the delayed activation of the carbon catabolic pathway genes&quot;</p><p>a. Herein the authors should acknowledge the limitation of their studies as their Xbp1 chip data was obtained under a particular condition, quite different from the dynamic and multi-stimuli environment of a macrophage. Therefore, the identified targets may (or may not) be relevant when interacting with the macrophage.</p><p>b. The authors do not discuss whether these 10 genes appear (i) misregulated (higher expression) in the Xbp1 mutant and (ii) what is their behavior during the time course</p><p>6. Line 357: &quot;Our overall findings suggest a regulatory model in which global transcriptional repression is established at the early infection stage to withhold transcriptional activation of certain genes whose functions are only required at later stages (Figure 7)&quot;</p><p>While this is an interesting model, it is not straightforward to recognize in the dataset that the Xbp1 targets are indeed showing increased expression in the KO during the early stages of infection.</p><p>While Xbp1 binding to promoters is an important observation that strongly suggests that such target genes will be subjected to its repressive effect, it can also occur that some targets may not exhibit major changes upon Xbp1 deletion, It is key that the authors compare their Xbp1 Chipseq dataset with the transcriptional data (Pol II for both WT and mutant). As indicated earlier the most straightforward comparison would be to compare Chip and transcriptomic datasets obtained under the same experimental condition.</p><p>7. Line 380: &quot;Interestingly, the latter motif (STVCN7TCT) was found at a higher frequency (~3 fold) than the common TCGAG motif from the CgXbp1MYC binding sites, suggesting that CgXbp1 can also form a dimer with another transcription factor that recognizes the STVCN7TCT sequence and that this hetero-dimer controls a larger number of genes than by CgXbp1 alone&quot;</p><p>This is an interesting observation and raises the valid question of whether the cohort of genes differing in the type of cis-element present in their promoter show different transcriptional profiles regulated by Xbp1.</p><p>8. The discussion does not analyze the reduced virulence observed in Galleria mellonella.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>This manuscript describes the temporal transcriptional response of Candida glabrata during macrophage infection and characterizes the role of the transcriptional repressor CgXbp1 the process. The manuscript is well written, the experiments were well conducted and the subject is very interesting.</p><p>However, a few issues should be addressed to improve the quality of the manuscript.</p><p>Lines 241-244 – It's difficult to understand the author's justification for failing to obtain reliable ChIP-seq results for Xbp1, when they got them for RNA PolII in the same &quot;ever changing macrophage microenvironment during macrophage infection&quot;. The option for defined media makes it difficult to compare with the RNA PolII dataset. Please discuss this issue more thoroughly and, eventually, try again to obtain reliable ChIP-seq results for Xbp1 during macrophage infection.</p><p>Line 263 – the two &quot;over-represented motifs&quot; are very different from one another, making it hard to believe that they are both functional. I believe that some demonstration (SPR, EMSA, DNA footprinting, or even something simpler as assessing the effect of promoter mutations in Xbp1 effect on reporter gene expression) of which one works, would be really an important addition to the manuscript.</p><p>Line 285 – This section lacks standard MIC determination, to have a clear notion on the impact on fluconazole resistance. Also, the biphasic nature of the fluconazole growth curve is highly unusual. CFU determination conducted along the growth curve would help to assess whether the initial OD variation corresponds to real cell duplication or just changes in cell volume or aggregation.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The authors should include additional information on how the relative fold-change was calculated, and how the Z-score was determined. Without this information, it is hard to determine whether the upregulation is specific to macrophages, media change, temperature, etc., and therefore the comparator should be clearly defined.</p><p>The in-house script should be made available (either methods or github link)</p><p>Line 81-83, the way that it is written obscures the fact that 70% of the genes were not bound by PolII during infection. What does this mean for the ability of this technique to identify lowly transcribed genes that may nonetheless play important roles in biology?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.73832.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions (for the authors):</p><p>- While the ChIP-seq on Xbp1 is interesting, it is obtained in a condition different from the macrophage infection and makes both datasets difficult to compare, as pointed by three of the reviewers.

We think that our failure in obtaining biological repeats is a technical difficulty, because the number of fungal cells (and therefore fungal chromatin material) in the infected macrophage samples is limiting, making the immune-precipitation step more difficult than regular ChIP experiments (e.g. the quiescence Xbp1 ChIP experiment).</p><p>Nonetheless, we have now successfully repeated the Xbp1 ChIP-seq analysis under macrophage infection condition.

For this reason, the results of the previous motif analysis as well as CgXbp1 function during quiescence have been taken away and will be described in a separate manuscript.

This is the basis of our design for the time course experiment. Importantly, multiple observations from our gene expression data also indicate that C. glabrata cells are indeed macrophage-internalized at the 30 min time point. For example, we observed at the 30 min time point induction of genes associated with response to oxidative stress, DNA damage repair, autophagy and nutrient deprivation (Figure 1 —figure supplement 3), which are responses to stresses expected after macrophage internalization. The induced expression of the adherence genes is consistent with the infection process, as these genes are known to be required for adherence to macrophages (Katsipoulaki et al., 2024, PMID: 38832801), which is the very first step in the establishment of infection. Hence, it is expected that they are induced at the earliest stage. Considering these together, we think that the observed gene expression profile represents the early responses of macrophage-internalized C. glabrata cells.</p><p>In addition, we felt a need to better understand the role of CgXbp1 on fluconazole resistance and hence performed additional RNAseq experiments (even though the reviewers did not request them). The results and a model about CgXbp1 role on fluconazole have been added to the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>There are several other issues pointed out that could be addressed by modifying/editing the text (i.e including relevant references, indicating the new lessons emerging from the dataset, compared with existing microarray datasets, better explaining cut-off values) and that should not require additional experiments.</p></disp-quote><p>We have addressed the comments raised by reviewers.

We have now successfully repeated the ChIP-seq experiment of CgXbp1 in the macrophage infection condition (i.e. have matching conditions for both CgXbp1 binding and transcription profiles). With this result, we have decided to rewrite the manuscript focusing on the macrophage infection process and removed the parts about Xbp1’s function in quiescent cells. The comparison between the different motifs identified from Xbp1 binding sites under the two conditions is also taken out from the revised manuscript. We believe that the new flow in the revised manuscript provides a more coherent picture of Xbp1’s function during the early macrophage infection process.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1.

Therefore, the target genes (if controlled by different activators) would not necessarily have the same expression pattern or might be not expressed at all if their activator is not functional under the experimental condition. Nevertheless, we agree that this is a great suggestion. We have done this for the Xbp1 targets identified from the new data under macrophage infection. The result is presented in Figure 2F and lines 220-227 as follows: “Notably, more than half of the CgXbp1-bound genes (130 out of 220) were minimally transcribed (i.e. they have background levels of RNAPII ChIP-seq signal), if any, during macrophage infection (Figure 2f), presumably their transcription activators are not expressed or functional under the condition. Most of the remaining genes had low expression in wildtype C. glabrata during the early stage of macrophage infection when CgXbp1 expression is at the highest level, while their expression was temporally induced subsequently (Group 2 in Figure 2F), suggesting that CgXbp1 represses their expression during the early infection stage.”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4.

Thus, while the authors evidenced decreased overall transcriptional rates (as measured by PolII-ChipSeq), the cited work exemplifies decreased translation which appears to also affect the stability of some mRNAs. Most importantly, the authors are not measuring steady-state levels of transcripts (as would be determined by RNAseq) and therefore for transcripts that exhibit medium to long half-lives, a decrease in transcriptional rates may not be causing a dramatic effect in reduced time scales (as compared with highly unstable transcripts).</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with this reviewer that the commented strategies are different from what we observed. The sentence has been modified (lines 379-386) to “In addition, gene expression and translation-related genes show the lowest transcription levels (i.e., RNAPII occupancy) at this immediate stage (0.5 h) relative to the other time points (Group 6 genes in Figure 1c,d), indicating global suppression of gene expression in C. glabrata upon macrophage phagocytosis. A recent study showed that the fungal pathogen Cryptococcus neoformans also down-regulates translation during exposure to oxidative stress (Leipheimer et al., 2019). The global suppression of gene expression under stressful conditions probably helps pathogens to reserve energy and resources for coping stress such as the hostile, nutrient-limiting macrophage environment.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. Line 351: &quot;In addition, the ChIP-seq experiment revealed that CgXbp1 directly binds to the promoter of many TFs including 10 carbon catabolite regulators (Figure 5G, Supplementary File 11), suggesting that CgXbp1 indirectly represses the activation of many gene regulatory networks. This probably explains the delayed activation of the carbon catabolic pathway genes&quot;</p><p>a. Herein the authors should acknowledge the limitation of their studies as their Xbp1 chip data was obtained under a particular condition, quite different from the dynamic and multi-stimuli environment of a macrophage. Therefore, the identified targets may (or may not) be relevant when interacting with the macrophage.</p></disp-quote><p>As mentioned, we have now gotten the result for CgXbp1 during macrophage infection and rewrote this part according to the new result.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>b.

Line 357: &quot;Our overall findings suggest a regulatory model in which global transcriptional repression is established at the early infection stage to withhold transcriptional activation of certain genes whose functions are only required at later stages (Figure 7)&quot;</p><p>While this is an interesting model, it is not straightforward to recognize in the dataset that the Xbp1 targets are indeed showing increased expression in the KO during the early stages of infection.</p><p>While Xbp1 binding to promoters is an important observation that strongly suggests that such target genes will be subjected to its repressive effect, it can also occur that some targets may not exhibit major changes upon Xbp1 deletion, It is key that the authors compare their Xbp1 Chipseq dataset with the transcriptional data (Pol II for both WT and mutant). As indicated earlier the most straightforward comparison would be to compare Chip and transcriptomic datasets obtained under the same experimental condition.</p></disp-quote><p>The expression pattern of identified CgXbp1 targets during macrophage infection has been added to Figure 2F and supplementary table 6. A comparison of RNA pol II ChIP-seq data between wildtype and CgXbp1Δ mutant upon macrophage infection, demonstrated increased expression of ~48% CgXbp1 targets in the CgXbp1Δ mutant. The result is described on lines 194-196 as follows: “The peaks were located at the promoter of 220 genes (Figure 2D, Supplementary Table 6), of which 48% of them were up-regulated during macrophage infection.”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7. Line 380: &quot;Interestingly, the latter motif (STVCN7TCT) was found at a higher frequency (~3 fold) than the common TCGAG motif from the CgXbp1MYC binding sites, suggesting that CgXbp1 can also form a dimer with another transcription factor that recognizes the STVCN7TCT sequence and that this hetero-dimer controls a larger number of genes than by CgXbp1 alone&quot;</p><p>This is an interesting observation and raises the valid question of whether the cohort of genes differing in the type of cis-element present in their promoter show different transcriptional profiles regulated by Xbp1.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with this reviewer that the observation is interesting and may inform about differential regulations of CgXbp1 target genes between macrophage infection and quiescence. However, we strongly feel that the results would diverge the focus of this manuscript. Hence, we have decided to remove the motif analysis from the revised manuscript and will report the comparisons of Xbp1 bindings under different conditions in a follow up paper.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8. The discussion does not analyze the reduced virulence observed in Galleria mellonella.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added a statement about the reduced virulence phenotype in the Galleria infection model in lines 450-454 of the revised manuscript as the follows: “This suggests that timely and coordinated expression of virulence genes is crucial for C. glabrata’s survival and pathogenic response during macrophage infection. Presumably, the pathogen needs to strategize the utilization of cellular resources to survive and counteract host attacks during infection, and this may also be the reason for the reduced virulence in the Galleria infection model.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>This manuscript describes the temporal transcriptional response of Candida glabrata during macrophage infection and characterizes the role of the transcriptional repressor CgXbp1 the process.

The option for defined media makes it difficult to compare with the RNA PolII dataset. Please discuss this issue more thoroughly and, eventually, try again to obtain reliable ChIP-seq results for Xbp1 during macrophage infection.</p></disp-quote><p>We believed that was a technical difficulty, which we have now overcome. The result of ChIP-seq data of Xbp1 during macrophage infection is now included and described in lines 182-227. As a result of this addition, we have restructured the manuscript to focus on macrophage infection and removed all the data related to quiescent.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 263 – the two &quot;over-represented motifs&quot; are very different from one another, making it hard to believe that they are both functional. I believe that some demonstration (SPR, EMSA, DNA footprinting, or even something simpler as assessing the effect of promoter mutations in Xbp1 effect on reporter gene expression) of which one works, would be really an important addition to the manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>As mentioned, we have now rewritten the manuscript to focus on the infection process. As a result, the motif analysis results are removed from the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 285 – This section lacks standard MIC determination, to have a clear notion on the impact on fluconazole resistance.

Without this information, it is hard to determine whether the upregulation is specific to macrophages, media change, temperature, etc., and therefore the comparator should be clearly defined.</p></disp-quote><p>The information is now provided in lines 556-560 as follows: “Fold changes for the time course experiment were calculated with respect to 0.5 h, while fold changes for DEGs are relative to WT (i.e. ∆ / WT). For the z-score plots, only genes whose expression changes at least two folds between any two or more time points during the macrophage infection experiment were included. Z-scores across the time points were generated using the row clustering option in FungiExpresZ (Parsania et al., 2023).”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The in-house script should be made available (either methods or github link)</p></disp-quote><p>The scripts are now available on github and the github links (https://github.com/RaimenChan/Xbp1_project and https://github.com/zqmiao-mzq/perl_tools/blob/master/zqWinSGR-v4.pl) are given in the text in lines 541 and 581.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 81-83, the way that it is written obscures the fact that 70% of the genes were not bound by PolII during infection. What does this mean for the ability of this technique to identify lowly transcribed genes that may nonetheless play important roles in biology?</p></disp-quote><p>While the PolII ChIP-seq technique is powerful in detecting major transcription events and changes, it does indeed have a limitation in detecting very lowly transcribed genes. As a result, responses of lowly transcribed genes during macrophage infection would have been missed from this study. A statement about this limitation has been added to the Discussion on lines 358-363 as follows: “Through mapping genome-wide RNAPII occupancy, our result reveals that about 30% of C. glabrata genes transcribed during the adaptation, survival, and growth inside the alien macrophage microenvironments. The number of genes may be an underestimate of the overall response, as the RNAPII ChIP-seq method has a narrow, low detection range relative to RNAseq and may not be able to detect lowly transcribed genes. Nevertheless, our data reveal dynamic temporal responses during macrophage infection.”.</p></body></sub-article></article>
