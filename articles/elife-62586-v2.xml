generated by transforming primary B cells with Epstein–Barr virus (EBV) and are used extensively as model systems in viral oncology, immunology, and human genetics research. In this study, we characterized single-cell transcriptomic profiles of five LCLs and present a simple discrete-time simulation to explore the influence of stochasticity on LCL clonal evolution. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) revealed substantial phenotypic heterogeneity within and across LCLs with respect to immunoglobulin isotype; virus-modulated host pathways involved in survival, activation, and differentiation; viral replication state; and oxidative stress. This heterogeneity is likely attributable to intrinsic variance in primary B cells and host–pathogen dynamics. Stochastic simulations demonstrate that initial primary cell heterogeneity, random sampling, time in culture, and even mild differences in phenotype-specific fitness can contribute substantially to dynamic diversity in populations of nominally clonal cells.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Epstein-Barr virus</kwd><kwd>lymphoblastoid cell lines</kwd><kwd>virus infection</kwd><kwd>NFkappaB</kwd><kwd>B-cell differentiation</kwd><kwd>systems modeling</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Virus</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000072</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01-DE025994</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Luftig</surname><given-names>Micah A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000054</institution-id><institution>National Cancer Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>T32-CA009111</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>SoRelle</surname><given-names>Elliott D</given-names></name><name><surname>Dai</surname><given-names>Joanne</given-names></name><name><surname>Luftig</surname><given-names>Micah A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Single-cell RNA sequencing highlights the influence of host–pathogen interactions and stochasticity on transcriptional and phenotypic variance in lymphoblastoid cell lines derived from Epstein–Barr virus-infected primary B cells.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) are immortalized cells prepared by in vitro transformation of resting primary B cells from peripheral blood with Epstein–Barr virus (EBV) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bird et al., 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Anderson and Gusella, 1984</xref>). LCLs are used extensively in research as a model for EBV-associated malignancies including diffuse large B cell lymphoma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Nichele et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Tazzari et al., 1999</xref>) and post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Markasz et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Rea et al., 1994</xref>). Because EBV is a non-mutagenic transformant in this context, LCLs constitute an important renewable source of human cells and genomic DNA that are used in immunological, genetic, and virology research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Çalışkan et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Choy et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Oh et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Stark et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Volkova et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>EBV is a double-stranded oncogenic gammaherpesvirus infecting over 90% of humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Rickinson and Kieff, 2007</xref>). In vivo, the virus typically establishes an asymptomatic persistent latent infection in episomal form (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lindahl et al., 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Nonoyama and Pagano, 1972</xref>) within resting memory B cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Longnecker et al., 2013</xref>). Latent infection can take one of several forms, each characterized by distinct programs of viral gene expression initiated from different promoters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Price and Luftig, 2015</xref>). For example, classical EBV infection within resting memory B cells in vivo is characterized by the Latency I program in which expression from the Q promoter yields a single viral protein, EBV Nuclear Antigen 1 (EBNA1), which functions to maintain the viral episome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hung et al., 2001</xref>). Latency I, termed ‘true latency’, is established only after a complex progression of infection through pre-latency, Latency IIb, Latency III, and restricted forms of latency (e.g., Latency IIa), each occurring in distinct tissues within the body (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Price and Luftig, 2015</xref>). EBV can undergo lytic reactivation as a replication strategy, which is relatively infrequent in cell culture despite being essential for transmission in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bhende et al., 2004</xref>).</p><p>In vitro, the process of LCL production also necessarily involves multiple transitions in viral transcriptional programs. In the immediate-early stage of infection (the pre-latent phase), expression from the W promoter yields EBNA-LP, EBNA2, and several noncoding RNAs (EBERs, BHRF1 miRNAs, and BART miRNAs). A brief burst of lytic gene transcription (without lytic replication) is also observed during pre-latency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Woisetschlaeger et al., 1989</xref>). EBNA-LP and EBNA2 protein levels increase gradually within these early-infected cells, eventually leading to Latency IIb in which EBNA2 activation of the C promoter upregulates expression of EBNA1, EBNA3A, EBNA3B, EBNA3C, and additional EBNA-LP and EBNA2 proteins as well as noncoding RNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alfieri et al., 1991</xref>). Latency IIb gene products induce hyperproliferation, a period of several days during which infected B cells divide every 10–12 hr (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Nikitin et al., 2010</xref>). During hyperproliferation, EBNA1 mediates viral genome replication while EBNA3 proteins inhibit host cell antiviral and tumor-suppression responses. Variance in virally mediated rates of proliferation ensures that some infected cells undergo DNA damage-induced growth arrest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Nikitin et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Nikitin et al., 2014</xref>) while others continue to proliferate, eventually outgrowing as immortalized LCLs. LCLs largely exhibit the Latency III transcriptional profile, characterized by expression of all six EBNAs (EBNA-LP, EBNA1, EBNA2, and EBNAs 3A–3C) in addition to latent membrane proteins 1 and 2 (LMP-1, LMP-2A/B) and noncoding RNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Young and Rickinson, 2004</xref>). In Latency III, EBNA2 stimulates expression of LMP-1, a constitutively active tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFR) homolog (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Mosialos et al., 1995</xref>). LMP-1 signaling drives proliferation and survival via NFκB pathway activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Devergne et al., 1996</xref>), which has been shown to be essential for LCL outgrowth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cahir-McFarland et al., 2000</xref>).</p><p>Although studied extensively, complete characterization of the viral and host determinants of growth arrest versus immortalization of early-infected cells remains elusive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Mrozek-Gorska et al., 2019</xref>). As one consequence, it is unclear whether or to what extent viral transformation may influence the resulting LCL cell populations. The possibility of significant phenotypic diversity within and across LCL samples warrants consideration, given the intrinsic variance of the human primary B cell repertoire (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Morbach et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Perez-Andres et al., 2010</xref>) and the multiplicity of viral transcription programs active in the journey to immortalization. Indeed, we recently described a gene expression program having low expression of LMP1 and NFκB targets which was unique to early infection (Latency IIb) relative to an otherwise identical population of LCLs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Messinger et al., 2019</xref>). The wide distribution in LMP1 and NFκB target expression levels within an LCL has been characterized and ascribed to the dynamic sampling of a distribution of immune evasive states, at the fringes of which growth and survival can be compromised (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brooks et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lam et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lee and Sugden, 2008</xref>).</p><p>In this study, we characterize the transcriptomic profiles of five different LCLs with single-cell resolution to assess inter- and intra-sample heterogeneity. Four of the sampled LCLs (two in-house and two commercial cell lines) were transformed with the prototypical B95-8 strain of EBV derived from an infectious mononucleosis patient (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Miller and Lipman, 1973</xref>), while a fifth sample (in-house) was prepared from cells transformed with the M81 strain isolated from a human nasopharyngeal carcinoma sample (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Desgranges et al., 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Tsai et al., 2013</xref>). Primary cells used in establishing the five LCLs were isolated and transformed from a total of four donors; cells from one donor were transformed concomitantly to establish LCLs with each of the tested EBV strains. We observe B cell genetic heterogeneity in the form of differential heavy chain isotype expression across LCLs and, in three instances, within a sample. Further, comparable patterns of phenotypic variance with respect to NFκB pathway and plasma cell-like differentiation genes are evident in each LCL. Expression of host and viral genes indicate that individual cells within LCLs occupy a continuum of infection states. We also present an initial stochastic model to explore factors beyond the nuances of host–pathogen interactions that may generate profound phenotypic diversity within cultured cell lines. Our findings highlight some of the underappreciated complexity inherent within LCLs and broadly underscore the importance of understanding and accounting for sources of heterogeneity within presumptive cell lines.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>LCL generation and data provenance</title><p>Three LCLs were prepared in-house by infection of PBMCs from two donors (sample numbers 461 and 777) with one of two different EBV strains (B95-8 or M81).

The model assumes a fixed cell death rate across all isotypes in any given division round. The number of simulated trials can be adjusted to capture individual stochastic realizations or probabilistic outcome distributions. Each parameter and assumption can be adjusted by the user for tailored applications.</p><p>Three randomly selected realizations and averaged outcomes (trials = 100) of the model for a fixed sample size (n = 1000 cells) demonstrate the effects of intrinsic stochasticity on the evolution of phenotype proportions over many rounds of cell division (rounds = 300), even when each phenotype confers equivalent fitness (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). In the case of equal fitness and sufficient sample size, initial phenotype frequencies are a key determinant of whether the most prevalent phenotype will change over time because of stochasticity.</p><p>The effect of sample size on inter-trial variance can be substantial, even when cell populations are sampled with replacement to maintain phenotype proportions in each round (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). Mean phenotype proportions are generally conserved, whereas trial standard deviation decreases as the sample size increases (trials = 25, rounds = 300, n = 100, 500, 1000, or 5000 cells). This is generally expected, since undersampling increases the likelihood that phenotype frequencies in the drawn sample will deviate from those of the population, even in the case of replacement.</p><p>It is notable that minor differences in relative fitness (1–2%) can lead to dramatic changes in isotype distributions over time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). The rate of such change is proportional to the magnitude(s) of fitness differences (n = 1000 cells, rounds = 300). Four randomly selected clonal evolution trajectories realized with a modest fitness advantage (2%) for class-switched cells (IgA, IgE, and IgG) reveal the potential for drastic variations when multiple rare phenotypes with a fitness advantage exist (n = 2500 cells, trials = 10, rounds = 1000). Thus, rare cells may become prevalent or even dominant over time if they exhibit only slightly greater fitness relative to other cells in some environmental context (e.g., cell culture). In such cases, observed phenotype frequencies can deviate wildly from expectations of equal fitness over time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>).</p><p>Cluster simulation was implemented by random sampling from four arbitrary, isotype-specific 2D normal distributions based on empirical observations that Ig isotypes yield distinct clusters in dimensionally reduced single-cell RNA-seq data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E–G</xref>).

In all cases, the proportion of observed cells in each cluster fluctuates over time. As expected, the presence or absence of observed phenotypic heterogeneity (in this example, isotype polyclonality) in a cell population is a complex function of relative frequency, fitness, sampling (i.e., bottlenecks), stochasticity, and time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Ewens, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Nowak, 2006</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><sec id="s3-1"><title>Ig isotype heterogeneity in LCLs</title><p>LCL clonality is known to change over time, although the factors involved in this evolution are not fully characterized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Ryan et al., 2006</xref>). PBMC derivation from multiple donors is an obvious source of cellular heterogeneity in the analyzed samples presented herein. B cells from peripheral blood (≈5–10% of all lymphocytes) comprise wide ranges of naïve (≈50–80%, mean ≈ 65%) and memory (≈15–45%, mean ≈ 30%) cells, with immature/transitional and plasmablasts accounting for smaller proportions (≈1–10%, mean ≈ 5% and ≈0.5–4.5%, mean ≈ 2%, respectively; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Perez-Andres et al., 2010</xref>). Within the memory cell compartment, proportions of non-switched (IgM) and switched memory (IgA, IgG, and technically, IgE) are also likely donor-specific. The negligible number of IgE<sup>+</sup> cells present across the samples can be explained by the isotype’s low frequency in the peripheral blood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">He et al., 2017</xref>). A notable limitation of this study is the lack of access to (GM12878 and GM18502) or retention of (LCL_461 and LCL_777) original donor primary B cells and longitudinal sampling, which would have provided direct insights into donor-dependent cellular heterogeneity.</p><p>It is evident from LCL 777 B95-8 and LCL 777 M81 samples that inter-donor differences cannot fully explain the observed isotype heterogeneity in LCLs. While it may be tempting to attribute the observed differences to infection with different viral strains, there is ample experimental evidence that EBV infection does not induce class-switching (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Miyawaki et al., 1991</xref>). The disparity in isotype frequencies is notable since these samples were transformed, cultured, prepared, and sequenced in parallel (i.e., under equivalent conditions and within the same interval).</p><p>The polyclonality exhibited within LCL 777 B95-8 and LCL 777 M81 contrast with the dominance of a single isotype in LCL 461 B95-8 and GM18502 samples (in each case, IgG). The only notable difference between LCL 461 B95-8 and LCL 777 B95-8 is that the former sample was in culture substantially longer prior to single-cell library preparation. Given that the GM18502 line was derived more than a decade ago, these observations implicate the influence of culture period in significantly altering the isotype proportions present within LCLs, which is altogether consistent with known (and profound) challenges associated with cell culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hughes et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Briske-Anderson et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">O’Driscoll et al., 2006</xref>). In this regard, the data from GM12878 merit remark. The finding of polyclonality in this sample is surprising, given that GM12878 has been in culture over a timescale comparable to GM18502 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Anders and Huber, 2010</xref>). Forgoing the possibility of errors in sample handling or procurement, the persistence of genetic heterogeneity in this line is both intriguing and potentially confounding.

Similar profiles of NFκB pathway transcript levels across samples may constitute a snapshot of the most probable distribution arising from stochastic NFκB target expression induced by EBV infection. This may arise from a transcriptional bursting mechanism in which mRNA transcript levels in each cell fluctuate over time (as a Poisson process) while the proportion of cells containing <italic>n</italic> transcripts in a population at any given time is roughly constant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Raj et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Raj and van Oudenaarden, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Weinberger et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Behar and Hoffmann, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">O'Dea et al., 2007</xref>).

While a mechanism imparting causality to this relationship is not yet fully clear, recent time-resolved bulk transcriptomic data revealed that EBV-induced plasma cell phenotypes (including upregulation of <italic>XBP1</italic>) developed as early as the pre-latent phase of infection (1–14 days; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Mrozek-Gorska et al., 2019</xref>).

Single-cell data adds complexity to this finding and its consequences for LCL heterogeneity even after long-term outgrowth. Specifically, EBV transformation in vitro appears to maintain B cells along a continuum of differentiation states, each with varying degrees of similarity to phenotypes observed in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Price and Luftig, 2015</xref>). In the case of LCL generation, the multiple transcriptional programs of the transformant likely constitute an inescapable source of phenotypic heterogeneity.</p><p>The low number of observed lytic cells is likely a consequence of EBV’s predominant latency and the fact that lytic reactivation is by nature somewhat incompatible with single-cell RNA-seq methods. However, these small subpopulations provide an interesting case for examination. The spatial proximity of lytic clusters in LCL 777 B95-8 and LCL 777 M81 to plasma-like clusters resulting from tSNE dimensional reduction implied phenotypic similarity; however, we found that this is likely an artifact of the tSNE algorithm since UMAP dimensional reduction did not preserve this proximity.

Lytic cells also display relatively high and polyclonal Ig heavy chain expression in addition to other shared characteristics with plasma-like cells (reduced expression of NFκB subunits and its targets). By contrast, lytic cells exhibit notably reduced levels of B cell differentiation transcripts. Thus, viral transcription changes in dynamic response to host cell programs (and vice versa) contribute to the observed LCL diversity. Prior work has shown that the viral proteins EBNA3A and EBNA3C suppress plasma-like phenotypes during EBV latency establishment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Styles et al., 2017</xref>). The possibility that EBV may undergo lytic reactivation in response to plasma cell differentiation as a means of maintaining persistent latent infection is a topic of future interest.</p><p>Host genes upregulated within lytic cluster cells (e.g., <italic>NFATC1</italic>, <italic>MIER2</italic>, <italic>SFN</italic>, and <italic>SGK1</italic>) represent a limited subset of transcription factors associated with B (and T) lymphocyte activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Peng et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Tsitsikov et al., 2001</xref>), several of which have been recently identified at various degrees of enrichment within lytic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Frey et al., 2020</xref>).

For LCLs generated from EBV-transformed primary B cells, the list of parameters affecting the cell population’s phenotypic profile includes donor-specific frequencies of non-switched and switched memory B cells, heterogeneous states of viral infection, phenotype-specific differential fitness in culture, stochasticity, and time. By definition, some degree of differential fitness exists among cells in each sample as a consequence of the variability in pro-survival, proliferation, and anti-apoptotic genes. Mechanistically, a portion of this variance is expected to arise from heritable yet transient epigenetic signatures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Shaffer et al., 2020</xref>). Indeed, epigenetic diversity affecting chromatic architecture across LCL subclones from a single donor was recently demonstrated through ChIP-Seq analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Ozgyin et al., 2019</xref>). Lastly, as a principle of evolution, phenotypic differences do not necessarily have to be selected directly; they may simply be carried over in cells possessing other selected features. With respect to the stochastic model presented herein, the simulated phenotype advantage of class-switched memory vs. non-switched memory cells need not be construed as originating from heavy chain isotype expression.</p><p>Experimental procedures including cell passaging and the initial transformation itself may contribute to variance among LCLs. As an illustration, consider that 1 million PBMC has around 25,000 B cells, of which 7500 (30%) on average are memory cells of various classes. If the rate of transformation leading to LCL outgrowth is 10%, then ≈750 memory cells out of 1 million PBMCs define the initial isotype frequency of the eventual LCL. This sample size is small relative to the donor’s total memory B cell compartment and may lead to founder cell effects. Consequently, B cell population undersampling may be a foregone conclusion in the context of LCL preparation.</p><p>Additional studies that utilize time-resolved single-cell sampling from original B cells through early infection and long-term LCL outgrowth in culture will be essential to explore further the factors contributing to longitudinal stability and variation in transcriptional profiles of B cells immortalized by EBV infection.

During the early stages of LCL generation, EBV infection drives cell proliferation by mimicking the process of B cell activation. After successful LCL outgrowth, infected B cells occupy a range of phenotypic states along a continuum between activation and plasma cell differentiation and, in some cases, exhibit signs of lytic reactivation. The diversity observed within LCLs (and cultured lines generally) can originate from intrinsic heterogeneity within primary cells, transcriptional programs of the viral transformant, and the realization of inherently stochastic processes (including certain gene expression programs) over time. The data reported herein enable extensive hypothesis generation and interrogation of aspects of B cell biology, EBV pathogenesis, and host–virus interactions. Moreover, this work highlights the importance of considering the possible sources and experimental consequences of cell population heterogeneity when using cultured cell lines.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Reagent type (species) or resource</th><th valign="top">Designation</th><th valign="top">Source or reference</th><th valign="top">Identifiers</th><th valign="top">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Biological sample (<italic>Homo sapiens</italic>)</td><td valign="top">Whole blood</td><td valign="top">Gulf Coast Regional Blood Center</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">Multiple donors;

PBMCs were isolated from each sample by Ficoll gradient (Sigma, # H8889). CD19<sup>+</sup> B cells were extracted from each PBMC sample through magnetic separation (BD iMag Negative Isolation Kit, BD, # 558007). Purified B cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 media supplemented with 15% fetal calf serum (FCS, vol./vol., Corning), 2 mM L-glutamine, penicillin (100 units/mL), streptomycin (100 μg/mL, Invitrogen), and cyclosporine A (0.5 μg/mL).</p><p>B95-8 and M81 strains of EBV were generated from the B95-8 Z-HT and M81 cell lines, respectively, as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Johannsen et al., 2004</xref>). Separate bulk infections of B cells were performed by incubating donor B cells with B95-8 Z-HT or M81 supernatants for 1 hr at 37°C, 5% CO<sub>2</sub> to produce the following cultures: 777_B95-8, 777_M81, and 461_B95-8. After virus incubation, cells were rinsed in 1× PBS and resuspended in R15 media. LCL outgrowth was achieved from each of these three samples, resulting in LCL_777_B95-8, LCL_777_M81, and LCL_461_B95-8.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Cell lines and culture</title><p>LCL 777_B95-8, 777_M81, and 461_B95-8 were generated in our laboratory by infection of primary human B cells obtained from the Gulf Coast Regional Blood Center with EBV strains B95-8 and M81.

Prior to single-cell sample preparation, LCL_777_B95-8 and LCL_777_M81 were maintained in culture for approximately 1 month, whereas LCL_461_B95-8 was cultured for longer than 6 months.

LCLs GM_12878 and GM_18502 were obtained, prepared, sequenced, and aligned as described by Osorio and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Osorio et al., 2019</xref>). Briefly, these samples were obtained from the Coriell Institute for Medical Research, cultured for several days, and then prepared as single-cell GEMs (Gel bead in Emulsions) with the 10× Genomics Chromium system using version 2 chemistry for total RNA. Single-cell sequencing libraries were generated using established 10× Genomics protocols, and sequencing was performed with a Novaseq 6000 (Illumina, San Diego). Unique Molecular Identifier (UMI) count matrices were generated from these samples by using CellRanger v.2.1.0 with alignment to the hg38 version of the human reference genome. Additional information about the experimental handling and acquisition of data for GM12878 and GM18502 is provided in the original reference (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Osorio et al., 2019</xref>). Gene-barcode matrix files for each sample were downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus (accession ID: GSE126321) and subsequently analyzed along with data from LCL_777_B95-8, LCL_777_M81, and LCL_461_B95-8 samples, while the LCL_461_B95-8 sample was run in a separate experimental batch.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Single-cell RNA sample preparation and sequencing</title><p>Single-cell RNA samples for LCL_777_B95-8, LCL_777_M81, and LCL_461_B95-8 were prepared using the General Sample Preparation demonstrated protocol from 10× Genomics (10×, Manual Part #CG00053) adapted from the original published methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Zheng et al., 2017</xref>).

In brief, GEMs were prepared using the 10× Chromium Controller, after which cDNA synthesis and feature barcoding were performed and sequencing libraries for each sample were constructed. Sequencing runs were performed on an Illumina HiSeq 3000/4000 (Illumina, San Diego). Samples for LCL_777_B95-8 and LCL_777_M81 were sequenced in a pooled run in a single HiSeq lane.</p><p>Raw base call files (*bcl.gz) from sequencing runs were processed using CellRanger v.2.0.0 to generate fastq files (*fastq.gz) via CellRanger’s ‘mkfastq’ command. CellRanger’s ‘count’ command was then used to align reads from the three in-house LCL samples to the human reference genome (hg38) with the Type 1 EBV reference genome (NC_007605) concatenated as an extra chromosome (reflecting the episomal nature of the EBV genome within infected B cells). This process yielded gene-barcode matrices (UMI count matrices) for subsequent analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Sample QC, analysis, and visualization</title><p>UMI count matrices for all five LCL samples were analyzed using the Seurat single-cell analysis package for R (Seurat v.3.1.5; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Satija et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Stuart et al., 2019</xref>). Filtered barcode matrices were loaded into Seurat, after which genes present in fewer than three cells and cells expressing fewer than 200 unique RNA molecules (features) and more than 65,000 unique features were filtered out. Additionally, cells in which mitochondrial genes accounted for greater than 5% of all transcripts were excluded from analysis. Beyond the uniform application of QC steps, we did not investigate the potential for batch-specific effects across the five samples run in four experiments. After QC thresholding, feature data were normalized and scored for cell cycle markers. Cell cycle scoring was used to regress out S and G2M gene features to remove variance (and unwanted effects on clustering) in the data sets arising from cell cycle phase. Cell cycle-corrected data were then scaled, and selection was performed to find the highest-variance features. PCA was performed on selected (n = 2000) variable features, and PCs were subsequently used to define distinct subpopulations within each of the five samples. For visualization, PCs were used to generate clusters at various resolutions and dimensionally reduced using tSNE.

Total mRNA was then used to create cDNA pools for each sample using a High-Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription Kit (Thermo, cat # 4368814). Previously reported primer sequences flanking each heavy (IgM, IgA, and IgG) and light chain (Ig kappa and Ig lambda) gene of interest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Tiller et al., 2008</xref>; listed below) were purchased from Integrated DNA Technologies (IDT) and used to amplify each cDNA pool using standard procedures across a temperature gradient. PCR products and loading dye (Gel Loading Dye, Purple [6×], NEB, cat # B7025) were run on 2% agarose gels with SYBR Safe at 120 V for 45 min with a 100 base pair ladder (NEB, N3231S) and subsequently visualized using a LI-COR Odyssey Fc Imaging System (LI-COR Biosciences). For LCL_777_B95-8 and GM12878, PCR products were sequenced (GeneWiz) and aligned to assess clonality (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://imgt.org/">imgt.org</ext-link>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>ICAM-1 cell sorting, proliferation, and metabolic assays</title><p>LCLs were stained with CD54 (ICAM-1) antibody (PE, Biolegend #HA58) according to the supplier’s manual. Then, cells were sorted on a Beckman Coulter Astrios cell sorter by anti-CD54 fluorescence, with ICAM-1-high and ICAM-1-low being defined as the top 15% and bottom 15%, respectively. 24 hr after sorting of ICAM-1-high and ICAM-1-low LCLs, extracellular acidification rate (ECAR) and oxygen consumption rate (OCR) were measured using the Seahorse XF24 extracellular flux analyzer (Agilent Technologies) Cell Energy Phenotype Test. Suspension LCLs were attached to culture plates by using Cell-Tak (BD Bioscience). ECAR and OCR were measured in Seahorse XF Base Medium supplemented with 1 mM pyruvate, 2 mM glutamine, and 10 mM glucose (Sigma Aldrich). ECAR and OCR values were normalized to cell number. For stress measurements, ECAR and OCR were measured over time after injection of oligomycin and FCCP. Metabolic potential measures the ability of cells to meet energetic demands under conditions of stress and is the percentage increase of stressed over baseline ECAR or OCR.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Stochastic simulations</title><p>The concept of a discrete-time Markov chain was adapted to simulate the evolution of phenotype frequencies, using immunoglobulin heavy chain isotype distributions within LCLs as an example. Briefly, the simulation takes as input a cell population of size n comprising B cells of different Ig heavy chain isotype classes at user-defined initial frequencies, fixed probabilities of proliferation in synchronous rounds of cell division, and a constant cell death rate assumption (also user-defined). Within the scope of computational feasibility, users can specify the number of rounds of cell division to simulate and the number of simulation trials to run. Additionally, users may choose to generate simulated cluster data modeled from distinct 2D normal distributions for each isotype for a specified number of trials at fixed intervals (i.e., every n<sup>th</sup> cell division round). The simulation was implemented in Python, and the code used to generate the simulated data is provided as a supporting file. The code is also available at (add as public GitHub repo) and may be freely implemented and modified.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Source data files</title><p>Raw sequencing data for the three previously unpublished samples (LCL_777_B95-8, LCL_777_M81, and LCL_461_B95-8) are deposited in the NCBI Sequence Read Archive (SRA) and can be accessed along with processed data from the NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO, Series Accession: GSE158275).</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We would like to acknowledge the assistance of the Duke Molecular Physiology Institute Molecular Genomics core (Karen Abramson), the Duke Flow Cytometry Shared Resource (Mike Cook, Lynne and Nancy Martin, and Lynn Martinek), and the Duke School of Medicine Cellular Metabolism Analysis Core Facility (Nancie MacIver and Amanda Nichols) for the generation of key data in this manuscript.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and a Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Erik K Flemington (Reviewer #2).</p><p>Our decision has been reached after consultation between the reviewers. Based on these discussions and the individual reviews below, we regret to inform you that your work will not be considered further for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>The reviewers clearly appreciated your work which, by including five LCL cell lines from different donors and two different virus strains, generates a valuable resource to understand the dynamics between latent and lytic infection in EBV-infected B cells and B cell differentiation versus activation. However, the results and conclusions were not really validated and the work remains quite descriptive. We came to the conclusion, especially taking into regard the comments of reviewer #3, that this work in its current state is not of profound general interest to the readers in the non-EBV field and therefore not suited for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>The authors report single cell RNA sequencing of five LCL lines. Three of them are recently derived, two with the B95-8 and one with the M81 EBV, and two have been in culture for prolonged periods of time. Two LCLs are from the same donor, one B95-8 and one M81 transformed. Three are predominated by IgG switched memory, one by IgA switched memory and only one by IgM, originating from naïve or unswitched memory B cells. Interestingly, B cell activation and NF-kappaB expression correlates inversely with both antibody isotype class switching and plasma cell differentiation. Lytic EBV gene expression can only be observed in a small subset, primarily in the LCLs from the same donor transformed with B95-8 and M81 viruses but is not higher in the M81 transformed LCL. Finally, the authors model how heterogenous LCL composition might evolve, but the GM12878 cell line demonstrates that this does not necessarily drive to clonality in all instances. The authors suggest that LCLs go through a founder bottleneck that renders possibly every LCL different and that this should be taken into account in using these cellular models.</p><p>The study described the comprehensive analysis of five LCLs and generates a valuable resource to understand the dynamics in EBV infected B cells between latent and lytic infection and B cell differentiation versus activation. However, some more information on the correlation of LCL proliferation with gene expression, latent EBV gene expression and antibody isotype composition from uninfected to LCL to lytic reactivation should be provided.</p><p>1) The gene expression analysis suggests inverse correlation of B cell activation and differentiation. Is this reflected by LCL proliferation in vitro? Do the LCLs with higher frequencies of differentiated LCLs proliferate slower than for example LCL777 B95-8.</p><p>2) The authors report lytic EBV gene expression, but presumably latent transcripts were rarely sequenced due to their low transcript number per cell. Nevertheless, it would be interesting if LMP1 expression frequency is elevated in LCLs with higher frequencies of activated cells and diminished in IgA or IgG expressing cells. The authors should attempt to address these questions by alternative means like flow cytometry or immune fluorescence microscopy.</p><p>3) Does lytic EBV reactivation occur in all antibody isotype carrying subpopulations similarly, or is it enriched in XBP1 positive IgG and IgA carrying B cells? Is there any preference between IgA and IgG expressing differentiated B cells?</p><p>4) Do the LCLs reflect peripheral B cell composition of the donors at all? Does for example donor 777 have a higher percentage of IgA positive B cells in the peripheral blood than 461.</p><p>5) GM12878 might argue that LCL composition could be stable over time in some LCLs and not necessarily drift towards monoclonality. Do the authors have any longitudinal information on BCR isotype composition in their investigated LCLs?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>This paper demonstrates fairly wide diversity of cell transcriptomes within EBV derived LCL populations. This intra-cell population diversity extends even to cell lines that have been in culture for many years. This likely speaks to the principles driving transcriptional activation which derives from chance intermolecular interactions that are albeit favored or disfavored based on changes in chromatin and chromatin domain structures. The relevance is that the certain level of randomness of these principles can lead to dynamic changes in entire transcription and differentiation programs even within a single cell population. While there is already evidence for these kinds of issues in cell populations, this work brings out these principles in the context of LCLs/EBV (particularly striking are the findings of the presence of plasma blast-like populations and marker-less subpopulations. Overall, this paper provides important insights into the transcriptional and phenotypic diversity that exists in what might have previously been perceived as mostly uniform cell populations of tissue culture LCLs.</p><p>The authors have also been able to identify unique transcriptome signatures for reactivating cells which is potentially interesting from the standpoint of informing us on the nature of apparently stochastic events that trigger this transition to the EBV lytic phase. Nevertheless, given the lack of detection of BZLF1 (and possibly other lytic transcripts?), it would be helpful if the authors could provide additional evidence that these are true lytic cells vs abortive lytic cells (the latter of which would itself would be an interesting finding). It would be helpful if the authors could plot distributions of the percentage of viral lytic transcript reads to cell transcript reads in these populations of cells (this is hard to gauge from Figure 3C). Since herpesviral lytic infection typically results in a substantial proportion of lytic transcripts (minimum of 10% of all reads), this would help determine whether most of these cells are truly lytic or abortive lytic (perhaps through some epigenetic changes that lead to a higher level of transcriptional bursting of the EBV genome).</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>Summary: Lymphoblastoid Cell Lines (LCLs) are induced by infecting primary B cells with Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) and constitute a widely used cell line model in molecular biology, oncology and immunology. Understanding the intra- and inter-heterogeneity of these cell lines using single-cell analysis is key to design research and interpret experimental results. The authors induced three cell lines using two EBV strains and they performed single cell RNA-seq using the 10x platform and conducted a very classical analysis using Seurat. They added two datasets from the literature (Osorio et al., 2019). They describe that each cell line has a certain level of intra-heterogeneity with different Ig expression patterns, different maturation stages (Figure 1 and 2), as well as exhibit different viral lytic/latent stages (Figure 3) and mitochondrial gene expression (Figure 4).</p><p>General comments: This study is needed and interesting as a resource for the community of scientists using these cell lines but I see major problems in the design of the study and the analysis. Beyond doing scRNA-seq and displaying clustering analysis, the final aim and the novelty of the study are not clear to me. It is neither clear how one can use such analysis to guide his research. As presented, the data analysis is very preliminary (Figure 1—figure supplement 15-19 and Figure 4—figure supplement 1-4) and the study needs substantial improvements before publication in a top-tier journal such as <italic>eLife</italic>. No functional analysis is provided to indeed demonstrate that intra- and inter-variability has implications in study design.</p><p>1) Design of the experiments: the overall scope of the study is very limited with only five different donors and it is not clear what is the contribution of the different viral strains. The rational of the study design is not outlined. The authors have chosen to look at the transcriptome only; we would have expected to have more -omics for a resource paper such as ATAC-seq and methylome to document the underlying heterogeneity of the cells.</p><p>2) The description of the variability of LCLs is not novel. Ozgyin et al., 2019 have already provided a genotype-independent functional genomic variability of the LCLs. This study is not quoted.</p><p>3) The variability between the five LCLs is not clearly delineated. Each cell line is heterogenous (Figure 1 to 4) but the authors have studied the cell lines independently without attempting to merge the data. The inter-heterogeneity is very poorly documented. The data analysis to perform a merge would require substantial computational work that goes beyond the scope of a two-month revision. It would be very important to explain the contribution of the inter-individual genomic variability between donors.</p><p>4) The authors claim in the Abstract that &quot;This heterogeneity is likely attributable to intrinsic variance in primary B cells and host-pathogen dynamics.&quot; In a publication in a top journal such as <italic>eLife</italic>, we expect that such a claim is documented with experiments. The authors claim that &quot;primary cell heterogeneity, random sampling, time in culture, and even mild differences in phenotype-specific fitness&quot; can contribute to such heterogeneity. These are very general claims that do not help and are not supported with experiments.</p><p>[Editors’ note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Single-cell characterization of transcriptomic heterogeneity in lymphoblastoid cell lines&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>.

The authors have used single cell transcriptomics to demonstrate substantial phenotypic heterogeneity within and across LCLs.

What follows is the authors’ response to the first round of review.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The reviewers clearly appreciated your work which, by including five LCL cell lines from different donors and two different virus strains, generates a valuable resource to understand the dynamics between latent and lytic infection in EBV-infected B cells and B cell differentiation versus activation. However, the results and conclusions were not really validated and the work remains quite descriptive. We came to the conclusion, especially taking into regard the comments of reviewer #3, that this work in its current state is not of profound general interest to the readers in the non-EBV field and therefore not suited for publication in eLife.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers and editors for their consideration and recognition of our work. Based on the unanimous conclusion by the reviewers and editors that the work “generates a valuable resource,” we request that the submission be reconsidered as a Tools and Resources article rather than a Research Article.</p><p>We have revised the manuscript with data from three additional experiments that directly address reviewer requests for validation and functional implications of our findings. Further, we have provided responses and references to address other questions raised during the review. These are described further in the point-by-point responses to each review comment. We believe that these revisions have strengthened our manuscript substantially and adequately resolve the reviewers’ concerns.</p><p>We strongly believe this work will be of interest to readers outside of the EBV field because of the widespread use of LCLs in genetic and immunological research (as we noted in the manuscript and in our cover letter accompanying the original submission). The diversity in viral transcription observed within the datasets will certainly be relevant to EBV researchers; the effects of viral transformation on host cell phenotypic heterogeneity for these widely used models are likewise relevant to a more general readership.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>[…]</p><p>1) The gene expression analysis suggests inverse correlation of B cell activation and differentiation. Is this reflected by LCL proliferation in vitro? Do the LCLs with higher frequencies of differentiated LCLs proliferate slower than for example LCL777 B95-8.</p></disp-quote><p>We have provided new data to address this question. We sorted LCLs by ICAM (a marker for activated cells) expression and found that ICAM-high populations exhibit more rapid proliferation than ICAM-low populations in the days immediately after sorting (Figure 2—figure supplement 8 in the revised manuscript). This highlights a functional implication of the observed transcriptomic heterogeneity with respect to cell population growth dynamics.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The authors report lytic EBV gene expression, but presumably latent transcripts were rarely sequenced due to their low transcript number per cell. Nevertheless, it would be interesting if LMP1 expression frequency is elevated in LCLs with higher frequencies of activated cells and diminished in IgA or IgG expressing cells. The authors should attempt to address these questions by alternative means like flow cytometry or immune fluorescence microscopy.</p></disp-quote><p>As recently reported by our lab (Messinger et al., 2019), FACS sorting by ICAM-1 expression serves as a reliable proxy for viral LMP-1 expression due to tight correlation (via EBV induction of NF-κB pathways) [see Figures 1B-D, 2C in Messinger et al., (2019)] and correlates directly to the extent of DNA replication in LCLs [see Figure 3D]. Additional RNA-FiSH data from the cited paper [see Figure 6] confirms that only a fraction of cells within LCL populations express LMP1. These findings are consistent with the newly provided cell proliferation and metabolic data sorted by ICAM status, which collectively indicate the functional role of elevated LMP1 in activated cell subpopulations.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Does lytic EBV reactivation occur in all antibody isotype carrying subpopulations similarly, or is it enriched in XBP1 positive IgG and IgA carrying B cells? Is there any preference between IgA and IgG expressing differentiated B cells?</p></disp-quote><p>The limited number of lytic cells preclude a definitive answer to this question; however, we note that cells expressing each of the three heavy chain isotypes are observed within the lytic cluster in LCL 777 B95-8 at isotype frequencies roughly corresponding to those of the whole cell population (Figure 1—figure supplement 5). This suggests similarity in lytic reactivation rates across isotypes [Note: there are even fewer lytic cells in LCL 777 M81, however the presence of IgA- and IgG-expressing cells is likewise observed (Figure 1—figure supplement 6)].</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Do the LCLs reflect peripheral B cell composition of the donors at all? Does for example donor 777 have a higher percentage of IgA positive B cells in the peripheral blood than 461.</p></disp-quote><p>The diversity among LCLs almost certainly reflects different donor peripheral B cell compositions (as well as other factors including passaging and stochasticity – see Figure 5 simulations and corresponding results/discussion). However, we did not retain (and in the case of GM12878 and GM18502, do not have access to) primary cell samples prior to transformation, so it is not possible to answer this question dispositively for the reported lines. As noted by Heath and Rickinson [Heath et al., PLoS Pathogens (2012), <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://journals.plos.org/plospathogens/article/comments?id=10.1371/journal.ppat.1002697">https://journals.plos.org/plospathogens/article/comments?id=10.1371/journal.ppat.1002697</ext-link>], we would expect that this does reflect B cell composition of donor, however such composition can change over time.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) GM12878 might argue that LCL composition could be stable over time in some LCLs and not necessarily drift towards monoclonality. Do the authors have any longitudinal information on BCR isotype composition in their investigated LCLs?</p></disp-quote><p>We did not acquire longitudinal data in this work.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>[…]</p><p>The authors have also been able to identify unique transcriptome signatures for reactivating cells which is potentially interesting from the standpoint of informing us on the nature of apparently stochastic events that trigger this transition to the EBV lytic phase. Nevertheless, given the lack of detection of BZLF1 (and possibly other lytic transcripts?), it would be helpful if the authors could provide additional evidence that these are true lytic cells vs abortive lytic cells (the latter of which would itself would be an interesting finding). It would be helpful if the authors could plot distributions of the percentage of viral lytic transcript reads to cell transcript reads in these populations of cells (this is hard to gauge from Figure 3C). Since herpesviral lytic infection typically results in a substantial proportion of lytic transcripts (minimum of 10% of all reads), this would help determine whether most of these cells are truly lytic or abortive lytic (perhaps through some epigenetic changes that lead to a higher level of transcriptional bursting of the EBV genome).</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you to reviewer #2 for making this important suggestion. We have re-analyzed the level of host and viral gene expression in the lytic cell clusters and have found that the percentage of lytic transcripts in cells varies across the lytic cluster (LCL 777 B95-8, Figure 3—figure supplement 1 in the revised manuscript). In the highest-expressing cells, the 20 most prevalent lytic genes account for 10-15% of all transcripts, which is consistent with truly lytic cells. Interestingly, about half of the cells in the cluster have less than 10% lytic transcript content. As the reviewer has noted, this could indicate abortive lytic replication; alternatively, these could be cells that had only recently initiated lytic replication at the time of sample preparation. We have added this analysis and corresponding discussion to the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>Summary: Lymphoblastoid Cell Lines (LCLs) are induced by infecting primary B cells with Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) and constitute a widely used cell line model in molecular biology, oncology and immunology. Understanding the intra- and inter-heterogeneity of these cell lines using single-cell analysis is key to design research and interpret experimental results. The authors induced three cell lines using two EBV strains and they performed single cell RNA-seq using the 10x platform and conducted a very classical analysis using Seurat. They added two datasets from the literature (Osorio et al., 2019). They descibe that each cell line has a certain level of intra-heterogeneity with different Ig expression patterns, different maturation stages (Figure 1 and 2), as well as exhibit different viral lytic/latent stages (Figure 3) and mitochondrial gene expression (Figure 4).</p><p>General comments: This study is needed and interesting as a resource for the community of scientists using these cell lines but I see major problems in the design of the study and the analysis. Beyond doing scRNA-seq and displaying clustering analysis, the final aim and the novelty of the study are not clear to me. It is neither clear how one can use such analysis to guide his research. As presented, the data analysis is very preliminary (Figure 1—figure supplement 15-19 and Figure 4—figure supplement 1-4) and the study needs substantial improvements before publication in a top-tier journal such as eLife. No functional analysis is provided to indeed demonstrate that intra- and inter-variability has implications in study design.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank reviewer #3 for acknowledging the utility of our reported work for a broad community of researchers beyond the EBV community. We believe that the newly added data and analysis signify substantial improvements to the manuscript with respect to validation and functional implications for LCLs.</p><p>Respectfully, it is unclear why the reviewer cites 9 out of 38 total figures and figure supplements to broadly assert that the presented data is “very preliminary” – we provided these specific supplements (principal component heatmaps and clustering resolution screens) for completeness and analytical transparency (for example, different clustering resolutions may be required depending on the desired analysis). This assertion does not substantively challenge the key data and findings presented in the main figures.</p><p>Regarding aim and novelty, we note several key aspects of the work including: 1) the first (to our knowledge) evidence of multiclonality in LCLs at single-cell resolution, 2) single-cell characterization of inverse expression patterns for B cell activation and differentiation programs (now supplemented with additional functional and validation data), 3) the first single-cell dataset revealing EBV lytic replication at appreciable levels, and 4) the first report of LCL subpopulations with distinct metabolic profiles.</p><p>With respect to how such analysis might allow one to guide her own research, the datasets clearly identify numerous genes of interest and correlations that can inform (to name just a few areas):</p><p>1) Subsequent targeted studies in B cell activation and metabolism; modeling of host-pathogen dynamics</p><p>2) Guides to developing molecular reporters and other tools for live-cell studies</p><p>3) Transcriptome-wide evaluation of the effects of chemical perturbations including potential therapeutics (for example, the class of drugs that aims to treat viral infection by inducing higher rates of lytic reactivation).</p><p>This work clearly opens new avenues of research, including refinement of a model for B cell functional states and dynamics in the context of EBV infection and associated lymphomas.</p><p>We provide further detailed addresses to reviewer #3’s concerns below, which we believe have resulted in a substantially improved manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1) Design of the experiments: the overall scope of the study is very limited with only five different donors and it is not clear what is the contribution of the different viral strains. The rational of the study design is not outlined. The authors have chosen to look at the transcriptome only; we would have expected to have more -omics for a resource paper such as ATAC-seq and methylome to document the underlying heterogeneity of the cells.</p></disp-quote><p>A previously uncharacterized inverse relationship between activation and differentiation transcriptional signatures at the single cell level is consistently shown in 5 LCLs from different donors prepared and analyzed in different labs. At the same time, notable and meaningful clonal differences are found to exist within and across the LCLs, demonstrating that nominally identical cell populations should not be assumed to be monolithic with respect to identity or fitness. We cite data linking some of these differences to variation in viral transcriptional states and demonstrate the effects on cell proliferation. In and of themselves, these are valuable findings. While inclusion of additional samples may offer further confirmation or refinement of the generalizability of either finding, it is not immediately clear to us that further samples are necessary in this case. The reviewer contends that five samples constitute a limited study but provides no rationale or statistical basis for what defines a study of sufficient size – this is necessarily dependent on the nature and magnitude of what is being investigated/tested. Because the findings of the study were not known <italic>a priori</italic>, defining such a standard would have proven challenging. Whether 100% of LCLs uniformly exhibit the B cell activation / differentiation continuum or what percentage of LCLs display polyclonality are questions best addressed by future studies.</p><p>The contributions from testing different viral strains (B95-8 and M81, the most widely used Type 1 and Type 2 strains, respectively) in cells from the same donor are articulated throughout the manuscript.</p><p>We believe the rationale and aim of the study is clearly defined in the manuscript Introduction: “Although studied extensively, complete characterization of the viral and host determinants of growth arrest versus immortalization of early-infected cells remains elusive.<sup>27</sup> As one consequence, it is unclear whether or to what extent viral transformation may influence the resulting LCL cell populations. The possibility of significant phenotypic diversity within and across LCL samples warrants consideration, given the intrinsic variance of the human primary B cell repertoire<sup>28,29</sup> and the multiplicity of viral transcription programs active in the journey to immortalization.”</p><p>Reviewer #3 is correct that additional -omics data would add layers of functional detail such as epigenetic profiling to the study. While we appreciate the reviewer’s focus and expertise in multi-omics analyses and the importance of these techniques, this work was conceived and executed with a different scope and focus. We feel that the work in its present form provides a rich resource and compelling findings that will be sufficiently valuable to the readership.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The description of the variability of LCLs is not novel. Ozgyin et al., 2019 have already provided a genotype-independent functional genomic variability of the LCLs. This study is not quoted.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank reviewer #3 for providing this reference. We have cited and discussed it within our revised manuscript. The statement that “variability of LCLs is not novel” is rather vague and reductive – the work by Ozgyin characterizes certain aspects of variability within LCLs, and our work characterizes aspects of variability that are distinct from that paper’s scope. Below, we highlight several key differences of our manuscript relative to the work by Ozgyin and colleagues:</p><p>1) Ozgyin et al. provide a thorough exploration of bulk transcriptomic and epigenetic heterogeneity in multiple LCLs cultured from a single donor. By contrast, we report a conserved continuum of transcriptomic heterogeneity across LCLs from multiple donors.</p><p>2) Ozgyin et al. show that heritable epigenetic signatures persist across different samples from the same donor and that these differences may have pharmacological implications. Our work shows that transcriptional differences within LCLs are correlated to different functional states intrinsic to B cell biology and are influenced by heterogeneity in viral programs.</p><p>3) Ozgyin et al. present FACS data showing light chain variability across samples from the same donor (a valuable finding). Our work presents single-cell sequencing data showing heavy chain clonality within and across donors, as well as light chain data.</p><p>4) Ozgyin et al. focus on host cell transcription as influenced by chromatin accessibility. Our work focuses on the effects of host-pathogen interactions by reporting both host cell and viral reads and their relative expression in individual cells within LCLs.</p><p>5) Our work describes a stochastic modeling framework to explore the effects of differential phenotypic fitness and other experimental considerations on LCL evolution.</p><p>6) Notably, both works highlight the broad utility of and interest in LCLs across research disciplines</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The variability between the five LCLs is not clearly delineated. Each cell line is heterogenous (Figure 1 to 4) but the authors have studied the cell lines independently without attempting to merge the data. The inter-heterogeneity is very poorly documented. The data analysis to perform a merge would require substantial computational work that goes beyond the scope of a two-month revision. It would be very important to explain the contribution of the inter-individual genomic variability between donors.</p></disp-quote><p>The revised manuscript provides a characterization of the merged datasets (Figure 1—figure supplement 5 in the revised manuscript). It shows that donor-specific differences are a dominant source of LCL heterogeneity. The fact that donor-specific genomic differences dominate relative to conserved intra-sample trends is unsurprising. This analysis reinforced discussion related to the stochastic model of cell phenotype evolution – that the contribution of inter-individual genomic variability is significant.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The authors claim in the Abstract that &quot;This heterogeneity is likely attributable to intrinsic variance in primary B cells and host-pathogen dynamics.&quot; In a publication in a top journal such as eLife, we expect that such a claim is documented with experiments. The authors claim that &quot;primary cell heterogeneity, random sampling, time in culture, and even mild differences in phenotype-specific fitness&quot; can contribute to such heterogeneity. These are very general claims that do not help and are not supported with experiments.</p></disp-quote><p>These are general and foundational principles. In the case of the effects of host-pathogen dynamics, please refer to the substantial body of research describing EBV LMP1-mediated upregulation of NF-κB signaling pathways and the newly-provided data showing higher proliferation of ICAM-1 – high (an LMP1 proxy) cells within LCLs. In the case of the effects of random sampling, time in culture, and phenotype-specific fitness, we were referring to results of stochastic simulations. While not so dispositive as clean results from wet lab experiments, models and simulations can be valuable tools for research and guide subsequent studies.</p><p>[Editors’ note: what follows is the authors’ response to the second round of review.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Revisions:</p><p>Please include in your discussion the points raised by reviewers #1 and #3 about the limitations of this study:</p><p>Reviewer #1: Due to lack of donor material prior to transformation by EBV the authors could not assess if the heterogeneity of their cell lines was donor dependent.
