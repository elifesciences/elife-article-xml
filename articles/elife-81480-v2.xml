cells (HSCs) that determine the homeostasis of bone and bone marrow. Here, we reasoned that osteocyte may exert a function in regulation of these lineage cell specifications and tissue homeostasis. Using a mouse model of conditional deletion of osteocytes by the expression of diphtheria toxin subunit α in dentin matrix protein 1 (DMP1)-positive osteocytes, we demonstrated that partial ablation of DMP1-positive osteocytes caused severe sarcopenia, osteoporosis, and degenerative kyphosis, leading to shorter lifespan in these animals. Osteocytes reduction altered mesenchymal lineage commitment, resulting in impairment of osteogenesis and induction of osteoclastogensis. Single-cell RNA sequencing further revealed that hematopoietic lineage was mobilized toward myeloid lineage differentiation with expanded myeloid progenitors, neutrophils, and monocytes, while the lymphopoiesis was impaired with reduced B cells in the osteocyte ablation mice. The acquisition of a senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) in both osteogenic and myeloid lineage cells was the underlying cause. Together, we showed that osteocytes play critical roles in regulation of lineage cell specifications in bone and bone marrow through mediation of senescence.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="plain-language-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>A hallmark of aging is the weakening of our muscles and bones, which become more fragile as we get older. These gradual changes can result in a humpback and muscle shrinking among other conditions. At the same time little is known about what role osteocytes – the most abundant type of bone cell – play in the process of bone and muscle aging.</p><p>One way to investigate the role of osteocytes in aging is to remove them and observe what happens to nearby cells as they age. To achieve this Ding, Gao, Gao et al. genetically altered mice so that they would carry and activate a gene called DTA in their osteocytes. DTA is a gene derived from the bacterium that causes diphtheria, and when it is activated, it produces a toxin that accumulates in cells, eventually killing them. In the mice line developed by Ding, Gao, Gao et al. DTA slowly killed osteocytes, leading to adult mice lacking most of their osteocyte population that have a normal embryonic development. This is important because the fact that the mice develop normally before birth allowed the team to rule out embryonic defects when looking at their results.</p><p>Ding, Gao, Gao et al. found that, without enough osteocytes, the nearby bone and bone marrow cells aged faster than expected. Indeed, the skeleton and muscles of adult mice was severely affected by the loss of osteocytes, leading to fragile bones with lower mass and muscle shrinking. These mice looked old in their young age and died earlier.</p><p>At the cellular level, the removal of osteocytes impaired the formation of osteoblasts, the cells that are responsible for making bones. It also led to an increase in the numbers of osteoclasts – the cells that destroy bone tissue to repair it and maintain it – and fat tissue cells. Furthermore, cells in the bone marrow, which go on to make white blood cells, were also affected. The mechanisms through which osteocytes affect the growth of these other cells is yet to be fully understood. However, Ding, Gao, Gao et al. did observe that these cells acquired traits characteristic of aging cells, implying that osteocytes have a role in regulating cellular aging or senescence. Among these senescence traits is the increased production and secretion of molecules that interact with the immune system, a feature known as the ‘senescence-associated secretory phenotype’.</p><p>Overall, the results of Ding, Gao, Gao et al. suggest that reducing the number of osteocytes in mice leads to faster bone aging and affects the balance of the different cell types required for healthy bone and bone marrow growth. Future research could focus on finding drugs that allow osteocytes to keep performing their role during aging, and thus help maintain bone health. The findings of Ding, Gao, Gao et al. also suggest that osteocytes may be playing a previously underappreciated role in age-related diseases, which warrants further investigation.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>osteocyte</kwd><kwd>bone</kwd><kwd>bone marrow</kwd><kwd>muscle</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>82002339</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gao</surname><given-names>Junjie</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>81820108020</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhang</surname><given-names>Changqing</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Shanghai Frontiers Science Center of Degeneration and Regeneration in Skeletal System</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BJ1-9000-22-4002</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhang</surname><given-names>Changqing</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Partial ablation of osteocytes alters lineage cell specifications in bone and bone marrow, resulting in the acceleration of skeletal aging.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The skeletal system is an elaborate organ mainly containing bone, bone marrow, and other connective tissues, whose function includes movement, support, hematopoiesis, immune responses, and endocrine regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Karsenty and Ferron, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Katsnelson, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Quarles, 2011</xref>). The skeletal system hosts at least more than 12 types of cell lineages arising from hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Méndez-Ferrer et al., 2010</xref>). During hematopoiesis, HSCs give rise to lymphoid and myeloid lineage cells, including B cells, neutrophils, monocytes, as well as osteoclasts. Meanwhile, MSCs differentiate into osteoblastic lineage cells, bone marrow adipocytes, and form fibroconnective tissues. The sophisticated processes of differentiation and interaction of these cell lineages are critical not only to skeletal development, but also to the integrity of hematopoietic, immune, and endocrine systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Méndez-Ferrer et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Le et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Yu and Scadden, 2016</xref>). During aging, these cell lineage commitments change rigorously and cause imbalance between myeloid–lymphoid hematopoiesis and adipo-osteogenic differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chen et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Sinha et al., 2022</xref>), which lead to the increased myelopoiesis and adipogenesis as opposed to lymphopoiesis and osteogenesis. While the complex communications between these cell lineages have been documented, it is still unclear what determines these cell lineages to survive and how their cell fates are maintained during development and aging. It has been speculated that cellular senescence, characterized by cell proliferation arrest, altered metabolism, and apoptosis resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gorgoulis et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Tchkonia et al., 2013</xref>), may be responsible for the regulation of lineage cell fates. However, the precise role in aging and age-related diseases remains unclear.</p><p>Osteocytes, as the long-living terminally differentiated cells and the most abundant cells within the bone matrix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Tresguerres et al., 2020</xref>), play vital roles in maintaining the skeletal homeostasis. Apart from mechanical transduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Long, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Sato et al., 2020</xref>), osteocytes have been shown to regulate bone formation, bone resorption, bone marrow hematopoiesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Asada et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Azab et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fulzele et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Xiao et al., 2021</xref>), and generate endocrine signals to mediate function of other organs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Razzaque, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fulzele et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cain et al., 2012</xref>). Osteocytes regulate both the osteoblast and osteoclast activities during bone remodeling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Delgado-Calle and Bellido, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Tresguerres et al., 2020</xref>). Sclerostin, one of the key inhibitors of Wnt signaling pathway, is mainly produced by osteocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Tresguerres et al., 2020</xref>). NO and PGE2 secretion by osteocytes in response to mechanical stimulation have anabolic effects on osteoblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Rochefort et al., 2010</xref>). Receptor activation of nuclear factor-κ B ligand (RANKL), the osteoclast differentiation factor, is mainly produced by osteocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Nakashima et al., 2011</xref>). Osteocytes regulate neutrophil development through secretion of soluble factors like IL19 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Xiao et al., 2021</xref>) and can also regulate myelopoiesis through Gsα-dependent and -independent pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fulzele et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Azab et al., 2020</xref>). In addition, studies have shown that aging is associated with dysfunction of osteocytes. Degeneration of osteocytes lacuna-canalicular network had been observed in older adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Busse et al., 2010</xref>) and the aging animal model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Tiede-Lewis et al., 2017</xref>). Senescent osteocytes and their senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) have been shown to contribute to age-related bone loss (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Farr et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kim et al., 2020</xref>). Together, current data suggest that osteocyte is a singling cell that coordinates activities of bone and bone marrow during skeletal aging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Sfeir et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p>Here, we hypothesize that coordination of bone and bone marrow homeostasis requires the presence of functional osteocytes. Reduction of osteocytes and their function may result in the detrimental impact in altering lineage cell fates and specifications in bone marrow. Using a mouse model of conditional deletion of osteocytes by the expression of diphtheria toxin subunit α (DTA) in dentin matrix protein 1 (DMP1)-positive osteocytes, we showed that osteocytes regulated bone and bone marrow lineage cell specification. Ablation of osteocytes in these mice caused impairment of osteogenesis and lymphopoiesis, and increased osteoclastogenesis and mobilization of myelopoiesis toward myeloid lineage differentiation with expanded myeloid progenitors, neutrophils, and monocytes. These have resulted in the induction of accelerated skeletal aging. Mice with osteocyte ablation have severe sarcopenia, osteoporosis, and kyphosis at the early stage of 13 weeks, resulting in shorter lifespan. Together, we demonstrated that osteocytes play a critical role in regulation of the HSC and MSC lineage cell differentiations by mediation of senescence.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Mice with fewer osteocytes have severe osteoporosis, kyphosis, sarcopenia, and shorter lifespan</title><p>To delineate the role of osteocyte in skeletal tissue development and maturation, we established a mouse model based on DTA-mediated cell knockout using the promoter of DMP1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Breitman et al., 1990</xref>). The latter is a protein highly expressed in late-stage osteocytes but has been shown not to be essential for early skeletal development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Feng et al., 2003</xref>). The results showed that complete ablation of DMP1-positive osteocytes (osteocyte<sup>DMP1</sup>) in <italic>Dmp1</italic><sup>cre</sup> <italic>Rosa26<sup>em1Cin(SA-IRES-Loxp-ZsGreen-stop-Loxp-DTA)</sup></italic> homozygotes (DTA<sup>ho</sup>) caused lethality of mice before birth.

Further, reduced dendrites were also observed in residual osteocytes of DTA<sup>het</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C and D</xref>), indicating the impairment of osteocyte network. To define how osteocyte partial ablation was achieved, we performed the quantification of empty lacunae ratio of DTA<sup>het</sup> mice at 13 weeks. About 80% empty lacunae was observed in DTA<sup>het</sup> mice at 13 weeks, which increased by about 20% compared to 4 weeks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B and C</xref>), indicating that diphtheria toxin (DT) had an accumulative effect with age in DTA<sup>het</sup> mice.

Micro-computed tomography (μCT) examination of the appendicular skeleton revealed a significant decrease in femur bone mineral density (BMD), bone volume fraction (BV/TV), trabecular number (Tb.N), trabecular thickness (Tb.Th), as well as greater trabecular separation (Tb.Sp) in DTA<sup>het</sup> mice compared to those in WT mice at 4 weeks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A and B</xref>). Moreover, ablation of osteocytes also led to cortical bone loss with decreased cortical thickness (Ct.Th) and increased cortical porosity (Ct.Po) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A and C</xref>). At 13 weeks, DTA<sup>het</sup> mice exhibited more bone loss in both trabecular and cortical bone compared to those in WT mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D–G</xref>). The progressive bone loss was observed through the life of DTA<sup>het</sup> mice. The phenotype observed is unique and gender-insensitive (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A–C</xref>).

Furthermore, there was no increase of bone mass of vertebral bodies from 4 to 13 weeks in DTA<sup>het</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2J and K</xref>), suggesting the retardation of vertebral body maturation. At 13 weeks, obvious kyphosis occurred in DTA<sup>het</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2L</xref>) due to serve osteoporosis and vertebral body compression. Whole-body μCT scan revealed that there was a giant increase of thoracic and lumbar curvature of DTA<sup>het</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2M</xref>). At the age of 30 weeks, almost all of DTA<sup>het</sup> mice developed severe kyphosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2N</xref>).

Many myonuclei were mispositioned and became centralized in contrast to those in WT mice. No muscle fibrosis was observed. At 13 weeks, there was continual muscle atrophy, rimmed vacuoles, and inclusion bodies seen within the muscle fibers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F and G</xref>). To preclude the direct target of DMP1 on muscle, we quantified the number of muscle fibers and the results showed that there was no reduction of numbers of muscle fibers after osteocyte ablation at 4 weeks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>) and 13 weeks in DTA<sup>het</sup> mice compared to WT mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>).

Together, these results suggested that DTA<sup>het</sup> mice had systemic muscle atrophy and sarcopenia. It is most likely that sarcopenia was caused by the impairment of osteocyte-muscle crosstalk.

In addition, the number of osteoblasts (N.Ob/BS) and osteoid-covered surface (OS/BS) was remarkably reduced in DTA<sup>het</sup> mice compared to WT mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A and B</xref>). Also, bone marrow fat accumulation in DTA<sup>het</sup> mice was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C and D</xref>).

HSCs give rise to lymphoid and myeloid lineage cells to establish the hematopoietic and immune system. To gain a full insight into the role of osteocyte in bone marrow homeostasis, single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) was performed using 10X Genomics Chromium platform. After rigorous quality control, gene expression data from 26,562 cells (13,835 and 12,727 cells from 4-week littermate WT and DTA<sup>het</sup> mice, respectively) were compiled for clustering analysis and revealed 10 distinct populations visualized with Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) embeddings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A–C</xref>). These 10 distinct populations included B cell, hematopoietic stem cell and progenitor cell (HSPC), megakaryocyte, neutrophil, erythrocyte, monocyte, dendritic cell (DC), macrophage, T cell, and MSC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A and C</xref>). Proportion analysis revealed a significant expansion of neutrophils in DTA<sup>het</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D and E</xref>). Also, the number of B cells was significantly less in DTA<sup>het</sup> mice than that in WT mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D and E</xref>), which implicated that osteocytes ablation induced lymphoid–myeloid malfunction in the bone marrow. To further dissect the differences in the bone marrow development between the two groups, RNA velocity was performed. The result showed that DTA<sup>het</sup> mice had stronger directionality of velocity vectors from the HSPC population to the neutrophil population compared to WT mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>), implying that osteocytes deletion altered HSPC differentiation.

Reduction of osteocytes number results in the detrimental impact of lineage cell fate and specifications in bone and bone marrow. Partial ablation of osteocytes<sup>DMP1</sup> caused severe sarcopenia, osteoporosis, and degenerative kyphosis, which led to shorter lifespan. Acquisition of SASP in both osteogenic and myeloid lineage cells may be an underlying cause that led to the accelerated skeletal aging phenotype of impaired osteogenesis, increased osteoclastogenesis, and myelopoiesis.</p><p>Sarcopenia usually occurs concurrently with osteoporosis during aging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Clynes et al., 2021</xref>). Our study has shown for the first time that osteocyte ablation caused severe sarcopenia and muscle atrophy. Consistent with our observation, previous studies have reported that osteocyte-specific ablation of Cx43 impaired muscle formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Shen et al., 2015</xref>). Osteocyte-derived factors have also been shown to stimulate myogenic differentiation in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Huang et al., 2017</xref>). On the contrary, specific deletion of Mbtps1 in osteocyte promotes soleus muscle regeneration and increase its size with age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gorski et al., 2016</xref>). Sclerostin, an osteocyte-derived circulating protein, is negatively correlated with skeletal muscle mass (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kim et al., 2019</xref>). Previously there has been a study showing weak <italic>Dmp1</italic> expression in skeletal muscle fibers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lim et al., 2017</xref>). This has led us to suggest that sarcopenia may be caused directly by the <italic>Dmp1</italic> expression in muscle. However, our histology finding of no obvious changes in the total number of nuclei of muscle in partial ablation of DMP1-positive osteocytes suggested that the sarcopenia and muscle atrophy phenotype is most likely caused by the disturbance of osteocyte-muscle crosstalk. Certainly, further studies based on a more specific osteocyte ablation model are needed to understand the link of osteocytes between osteoporosis and sarcopenia. Nevertheless, severe kyphosis observed in these osteocyte ablation mice supports our hypothesis of direct osteocyte-muscle crosstalk as kyphosis is the direct result of the significant bone loss and sarcopenia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Wijshake et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Woods et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>Osteocytes regulate the process of bone resorption and coupled bone formation via secreting factors, including sclerostin and RANKL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Tresguerres et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">van Bezooijen et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Nakashima et al., 2011</xref>). Theoretically, osteocyte ablation may lead to lower expression of sclerostin and RNAKL, which in term increased osteogenesis and impaired osteoclastogenesis. However, our results demonstrated that osteocyte ablation impaired osteogenesis and induced osteoclastogenesis. In mice with partial ablation of osteocytes, expression of sclerostin was reduced but the serum RNAKL was increased. In addition, osteogenesis-related pathways, including Wnt signaling pathway, Hedgehog signaling pathway, and Notch signaling pathway, were also downregulated. We speculated that induction of SASP in both osteoprogenitors and myeloid progenitors may account for the underlying cause. Senescent osteoprogenitors have reduced self-renewal capacity and predominantly differentiate into adipocytes as opposed to osteoblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chen et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Li et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Rosen et al., 2009</xref>). Consistently, our model indicated an increased adipogenesis after osteocyte ablation. Also, fat-induction factors inhibit osteogenesis during adipogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chen et al., 2016</xref>). Thus, senescence accumulation in osteoprogenitors led to the impaired osteogenesis. As for enhanced osteoclastogenesis, besides the production of RANKL from osteogenic cells like osteocytes and osteoblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Nakashima et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fumoto et al., 2014</xref>), other cells like adipocyte and T cell, also secret RANKL to regulate bone metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Yu et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hu et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Djaafar et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Takayanagi et al., 2000</xref>). Also, B cell can produce OPG to regulate RANKL/OPG axis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Li et al., 2007</xref>). In our model, increased adipogenesis, T cell expansion (data not shown), and decreased B cell number may compensate for the altered RANKL/OPG axis. Intriguingly, we also found that even under in vitro condition in which osteocyte ablation no longer exists, impairment of osteogenesis and induction of osteoclastogenesis were still observed. Our study has suggested that osteoprogenitors and BMMs have been primed by the altered bone microenvironment in DTA<sup>het</sup> mice before in vitro differentiation. In support of this, previous studies have suggested that progenitor cells can receive a long-lasting impact from the in vivo local microenvironment, where these cells are situated. Isolation of cells for in vitro cell differentiation or even transferring cells to healthy mice would not alter their original in vivo phenotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cao et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Isaac et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Ding et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Edgar et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Li et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p>Bone marrow, embedded in the skeletal system, has a close link with matrix-embedded osteocyte. Previous studies have reported that osteocyte regulates myelopoiesis via Gsα-dependent and -independent signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fulzele et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Azab et al., 2020</xref>). A recent study also reported that osteocyte mTORC1 signaling regulates granulopoiesis via secreted IL-19 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Xiao et al., 2021</xref>). Meanwhile, sclerostin secreted by osteocyte adversely affects B cell survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Horowitz and Fretz, 2012</xref>). In our study, when osteocytes were partially depleted, myelopoiesis, especially granulopoiesis, was significantly induced, but B cell development was significantly impaired. Further studies demonstrated that HSCs were mobilized and shifted to myelopoiesis with increased CMP, GMP, cMoP, and CD11b<sup>+</sup> myeloid cells, in which monocytes and neutrophils were increased, and neutrophil function was also activated after osteocyte ablation. While B cell number was severely reduced with altered development pattern. Interestingly, a previous study has shown that osteoblastic cell supports megakaryopoiesis and platelet formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Xiao et al., 2017</xref>). In our study, the number of MEP (erythrocyte and platelet precursors) was also reduced, and scRNA-seq analysis showed no significant change in erythrocyte population (data not shown), inferring that osteocyte may also participate in regulating platelet formation.</p><p>Bone and bone marrow harbor different cell lineages and form specific niches to maintain complex, delicate and extensive communications between them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hu et al., 2016</xref>). Previous studies have shown that osteocyte controls bone remodeling, regulates hematopoiesis, and even remote organ function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Divieti Pajevic and Krause, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Asada et al., 2015</xref>), via secretion of factors, including sclerostin, RANKL, FGF23, and IL19 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Xiao et al., 2021</xref>). Although our study has shown that osteocytes also influence cell lineage commitments of bone and bone marrow via the mediation of cell senescence, it is still not clear what factors osteocytes produce to regulate this process. Further study is required to identify the mechanism in which osteocytes regulate the homeostasis of bone and bone marrow. Furthermore, as our study only focuses on the effect of osteocyte ablation in muscle, bone, and bone marrow, it is still not clear what is the impact of osteocyte ablation on other organs. Nevertheless, a previous study showed that osteocyte ablation induces lymphoid organ atrophy, thymocyte depletion, and altered fat metabolism in ‘osteocyte-less’ mice model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Sato et al., 2013</xref>), suggesting the role of osteocytes in the extraskeletal system.</p><p>In conclusion, we demonstrated a critical role of osteocytes in regulating senescence of bone and bone marrow (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>).

Briefly, based on the gene set, the gene set variation analysis (GSVA) software package (Hanzelmann, Castelo, and Guinney 2013) was used to calculate the score of SASP in each cells. Ggpubr R package via the Wilcoxin test (https://github.com/kassambara/ggpubr) (version 0.2.4) was used to analyze changes in the scores between WT and DTA<sup>het</sup> mice. We have updated the detail about SASP score methods in the Materials and methods accordantly <italic>(Lines 717725)</italic>.</p><p>To further confirm the senescence phenotype in bone/bone marrow, we performed the senescence β-galactosidase (SA-βGal) staining of frozen sections of WT and DTA<sup>het</sup> mice femur <italic>(Figure 6 —figure supplement 1D)</italic>. There were obvious SA-βGal<sup>+</sup> cells in the primary spongiosa, bone marrow and cortical bone in DTA<sup>het</sup> mice compared to WT mice.

We demonstrated that osteoblast and osteoclast activities were affected in vivo after osteocyte ablation, and intriguingly, we found that in vitro differentiation of osteoblast and osteoclast was also affected even in the absence of osteocytes. Previous studies have demonstrated that altered environment can have a long-lasting effects on cells, when these cells are isolated in vitro or even transferred to another mice, they can still perform similar functions or have similar effects based on their memory (Cao et al. 2020; Isaac et al. 2014; Ding et al. 2022; Edgar et al. 2021; Li et al. 2022). Thus, we hypothesized that osteoprogenitors and BMMs have been primed by the altered bone microenvironment in DTA<sup>het</sup> mice before in vitro differentiation. In our study, bone microenvironment was changed rigorously after osteocyte ablation. After performing the in vitro differentiation of osteogenesis and osteoclastogenesis from different age of mice (4 weeks and 13 weeks) <italic>(Figure 4H-I and Figure 4O-Q)</italic>, we found impaired osteogenesis and promoted osteoclastogenesis, indicating altered bone microenvironment had significant effects on these cells. Importantly, there was a time-dependent accumulative effect on these cells, as when osteoprogenitors and BMMs were collected from older mice, the in vitro osteogenesis and osteoclastogenesis were much more impaired than the cells from younger mice. The underlying mechanism is worth to be further studied. We now have replenished this in Results <italic>(Lines 205-210 and Lines 221-229)</italic> and Discussion <italic>(Lines 391-400)</italic>.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Explore/explain the mechanisms by which osteocyte reduction causes cellular senescence of the surrounding cells. In addition, the authors should consider addressing other concerns raised by the reviewers.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer’s suggestion, and we now have updated this in the Discussion in the revised version <italic>(Line 420-429)</italic>. Different cell lineages harbor in the bone marrow and form specific niches. Each niche has their own specific microenvironment which supports stemness, survival and fates. Also, there are complex cell-cell crosstalk between different niches (Hu et al. 2016). We speculated that osteocytes may regulate cell lineage commitment via releasing factors. As the signaling center, osteocytes have been shown to regulate hematopoiesis, bone remodeling and even remote organs functions (Divieti Pajevic and Krause 2019; Asada, Sato, and Katayama 2015). Our study has provided new finding that osteocyte ablation influences cell lineage commitments and induces senescence. Further study is required to determine factors produced by osteocytes that have impact on lineage commitment and cell senescence.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>Quantification and comparison of numbers of skeletal muscle cells between control and DMP-1 DTA will provide a support to exclude the possible activity of DMP1-cre in muscle cells.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer’s recommendation, and we quantified and compared the number of skeletal muscle numbers between WT and DTA<sup>het</sup> mice.

Premature aging we used in Line 151 means accelerated skeletal aging which occurred at the early stage of the life as opposed to normal aging process which occurred at the late stage of the life (Coppede 2012). As DTA<sup>het</sup> mice had an obviously shortened lifespan, combined with these age-related phenotypes including osteoporosis, kyphosis and sarcopenia, we concluded that DTA<sup>het</sup> mice underwent the premature skeletal aging process.

While SOST produced by osteocytes was decreased <italic>(Figure 4 —figure supplement 1B and C)</italic>, we speculated that induction of SASP in osteoprogenitors may be account for the underlying cause. Senescent osteoprogenitors have reduced self-renewal capacity and predominantly differentiate into adipocytes as opposed to osteoblasts (Chen et al. 2016; Li et al. 2017; Rosen et al. 2009). Consistently, our model indicated an increased adipogenesis after osteocyte ablation, and fat-induction factors inhibit osteogenesis during adipogenesis (Chen, et al. 2016). Thus, osteocyte ablation induced senescence accumulation in osteoprogenitors leading to the cell commitment towards adipogenesis with impaired osteogenesis <italic>(Lines 369-391)</italic>.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The scRNA-seq of the 4-week-old bone marrow cells is key to the hypothesis on the changes in haematopoiesis.

We thus inferred that bone marrow also underwent significant changes and we further performed scRNA-seq at 4-week-old. RNA velocity is a powerful tool to demonstrate cellular lineage differentiation (Karaman et al. 2022; Bergen et al. 2020; Qiao and Huang 2021). In our study, we found that there was stronger directionality of the velocity vectors in the neutrophil cluster (circled in red) of DTA<sup>het</sup> mice compared to WT mice <italic>(Figure 5F)</italic>, thus indicating that HSPC differentiation was altered after osteocyte ablation.</p><p>As DTA<sup>het</sup> mice had accelerated skeletal aging phenotypes including myelopoiesis, osteoporosis, kyphosis and sarcopenia with shortened lifespan, and we found that these phenotypes like osteoporosis, sarcopenia, kyphosis and sarcopenia became severe with age.
