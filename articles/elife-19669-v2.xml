This pattern parallels enrichment for the meiotic chromosome axis proteins Hop1 and Red1. These proteins are important for Spo11-catalyzed double strand break formation; their contribution to crossover recombination remains undefined. Using the sequence-specific <italic>VMA1</italic>-derived endonuclease (VDE) to initiate recombination in meiosis, we show that chromosome structure influences the choice of proteins that resolve recombination intermediates to form crossovers. At a Hop1-enriched locus, most VDE-initiated crossovers, like most Spo11-initiated crossovers, required the meiosis-specific MutLγ resolvase. In contrast, at a locus with lower Hop1 occupancy, most VDE-initiated crossovers were MutLγ-independent. In <italic>pch2</italic> mutants, the two loci displayed similar Hop1 occupancy levels, and VDE-induced crossovers were similarly MutLγ-dependent. We suggest that meiotic and mitotic recombination pathways coexist within meiotic cells, and that features of meiotic chromosome structure determine whether one or the other predominates in different regions.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.19669.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.19669.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.19669.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Inside the cells of many species, double-stranded DNA is packaged together with specialized proteins to form structures called chromosomes. Breaks that span across both strands of the DNA can cause cell death because if the break is incorrectly repaired, a segment of the DNA may be lost. Cells use a process known as homologous recombination to repair such breaks correctly. This uses an undamaged DNA molecule as a template that can be copied to replace missing segments of the DNA sequence. During the repair of double-strand breaks, connections called crossovers may form. This results in the damaged and undamaged DNA molecules swapping a portion of their sequences.</p><p>In meiosis, a type of cell division that produces sperm and eggs, cells deliberately break their chromosomes and then repair them using homologous recombination. The crossovers that form during this process are important for sharing chromosomes between the newly forming cells. It is crucial that the crossovers form at the right time and place along the chromosomes.</p><p>Chromosomes have different structures depending on whether a cell is undergoing meiosis or normal (mitotic) cell division. This structure may influence how and where crossovers form. Enzymes called resolvases catalyze the reactions that occur during the last step in homologous recombination to generate crossovers. One particular resolvase acts only during meiosis, whereas others are active in both mitotic and meiotic cells. However, it is not known whether local features of the chromosome structure – such as the proteins packaged in the chromosome alongside the DNA – influence when and where meiotic crossover occurs.</p><p>Medhi et al. have now studied how recombination occurs along different regions of the chromosomes in budding yeast cells, which undergo meiosis in a similar way to human cells. The results of the experiments reveal that the mechanism by which crossovers form depends on proteins called axis proteins, one type of which is specifically found in meiotic chromosomes. In regions that had high levels of meiotic axis proteins, crossovers mainly formed using the meiosis-specific resolvase enzyme. In regions that had low levels of meiotic axis proteins, crossovers formed using resolvases that are active in mitotic cells. Further experiments demonstrated that altering the levels of one of the meiotic axis proteins changed which resolvase was used.</p><p>Overall, the results presented by Medhi et al. show that differences in chromosome structure, in particular the relative concentration of meiotic axis proteins, influence how crossovers form in yeast. Future studies will investigate whether this is observed in other organisms such as humans, and whether local chromosome structure influences other steps of homologous recombination in meiosis.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.19669.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.19669.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>homologous recombination mechanisms</kwd><kwd>chromosome structure</kwd><kwd>VMA1-derived endonuclease</kwd><kwd>Holliday junction resolvase</kwd><kwd>meiotic chromosome axis</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000054</institution-id><institution>National Cancer Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Intramural Research Program of the NIH through the Center for Cancer Research at the National Cancer Institute</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lichten</surname><given-names>Michael</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000858</institution-id><institution>University of Sheffield</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Graduate tuition grant</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Medhi</surname><given-names>Darpan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Different homologous recombination pathways are dominant in different regions of meiotic chromosomes, indicating that chromosome structure influences recombination biochemistry.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The transition from the mitotic cell cycle to meiosis involves substantial changes in mechanisms of DNA double strand break (DSB) repair by homologous recombination (HR). Most mitotic HR repairs spontaneous lesions, and most repair products are non-crossovers (NCOs) that do not involve exchange of flanking parental sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Kadyk and Hartwell, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Ira et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Pâques et al., 1998</xref>). In contrast, meiotic recombination is initiated by programmed DSBs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Cao et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Sun et al., 1989</xref>) that often are repaired as crossovers (COs) between homologous chromosomes (homologs), with exchange of flanking parental sequences. Inter-homolog COs, combined with sister chromatid cohesion, create physical linkages that ensure faithful homolog segregation during the first meiotic division, avoiding chromosome nondisjunction and consequent aneuploidy in gametes (reviewed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Hunter, 2015</xref>).</p><p>The DSBs that initiate meiotic recombination are formed by Spo11 in complex with a number of accessory proteins, and will be referred to here as Spo11-DSBs (reviewed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Lam and Keeney, 2015</xref>). Spo11-DSBs and resulting recombination events are non-uniformly distributed in the genomes of organisms ranging from budding yeast to humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Baudat and Nicolas, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Blitzblau et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Buhler et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Fowler et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Gerton et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Hellsten et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Pratto et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Singhal et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Smagulova et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Wijnker et al., 2013</xref>). In budding yeast, this non-uniform distribution of Spo11-DSBs is influenced by meiosis-specific proteins, Red1 and Hop1, which are components of the meiotic chromosome axis. The meiotic chromosome axis coordinates sister chromatids and forms the axial element of the synaptonemal complex, which holds homologs in tight juxtaposition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Hollingsworth et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Page and Hawley, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Smith and Roeder, 1997</xref>). Spo11-DSBs form frequently in large (ca 50–200 kb) 'hot' domains that are also enriched for Red1 and Hop1, and these 'hot' domains are interspersed with similarly-sized 'cold' regions where Spo11-DSBs are infrequent and Red1/Hop1 occupancy levels are low (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Baudat and Nicolas, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Blat et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Blitzblau et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Buhler et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Panizza et al., 2011</xref>). Normal Spo11-DSB formation requires recruitment of Spo11 and accessory proteins to the meiotic axis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Panizza et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Prieler et al., 2005</xref>), and Red1/Hop1 are also central to mechanisms that direct Spo11-DSB repair towards use of the homolog as a recombination partner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Carballo et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Niu et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Schwacha and Kleckner, 1997</xref>). Other eukaryotes contain Hop1 analogs that share a domain, called the HORMA domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Rosenberg and Corbett, 2015</xref>), and correlations between these meiotic axis proteins and DSB formation are observed in fission yeast, nematodes and in mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Fowler et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Goodyer et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Wojtasz et al., 2009</xref>). Thus, most meiotic interhomolog recombination occurs in the context of a specialized chromosome structure and requires components of that structure.</p><p>Meiotic recombination pathways diverge after DSB formation and homolog-directed strand invasion. In budding yeast, about half of meiotic events form NCOs via synthesis-dependent strand annealing, a mechanism that does not involve stable recombination intermediates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Allers and Lichten, 2001a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">McMahill et al., 2007</xref>) and is suggested to be the predominant HR pathway in mitotic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Bzymek et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">McGill et al., 1989</xref>). Most of the remaining events are repaired by a meiosis-specific CO pathway, in which an ensemble of meiotic proteins, called the ZMM proteins, stabilize early recombination intermediates and promote their maturation into double Holliday junction joint molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Allers and Lichten, 2001a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Börner et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Lynn et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Schwacha and Kleckner, 1994</xref>). These ZMM-stabilized joint molecules (JMs) are subsequently resolved as COs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Sourirajan and Lichten, 2008</xref>) through the action of the MutLγ complex, which contains the Mlh1, Mlh3, and Exo1 proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Argueso et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Khazanehdari and Borts, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Wang et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Zakharyevich et al., 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">2012</xref>). MutLγ does not appear to make significant contributions to mitotic COs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Ira et al., 2003</xref>). A minority of events form ZMM-independent JMs that are resolved as both COs and NCOs by the structure-selective nucleases (SSNs) Mus81-Mms4, Yen1, and Slx1-Slx4, which are responsible for most JM resolution during mitosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Argueso et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Santos et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">De Muyt et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Ho et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Muñoz-Galván et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">Zakharyevich et al., 2012</xref>; reviewed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Wyatt and West, 2014</xref>). A similar picture, with MutLγ forming most meiotic COs and SSNs playing a minor role, is observed in several other eukaryotes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Berchowitz et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Holloway et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Plug et al., 1998</xref>).</p><p>To better understand the factors that promote the unique biochemistry of CO formation during meiosis, in particular MutLγ-dependent JM resolution, we considered two different hypotheses. In the first, expression of meiosis-specific proteins and the presence of high levels of Spo11-DSBs results in nucleus-wide changes in recombination biochemistry, shifting its balance towards MutLγ-dependent resolution of JMs, wherever they might occur. In the second, local features of meiotic chromosome structure, in particular enrichment for meiosis-specific chromosome axis proteins, provides an in cis structural environment that favors MutLγ-dependent JM resolution. However, because Spo11-DSBs form preferentially in Red1/Hop1-enriched regions, and because these proteins are required for efficient Spo11-DSB formation and interhomolog repair, it is difficult to distinguish these two models by examining Spo11-initiated recombination alone.</p><p>To test these two hypotheses, we developed a system in which meiotic recombination is initiated by the sequence- and meiosis-specific <italic>VMA1</italic> derived endonuclease, VDE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Gimble and Thorner, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Nagai et al., 2003</xref>). VDE initiates meiotic recombination at similar levels wherever its recognition sequence (<italic>VRS</italic>) is inserted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Fukuda et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Neale et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Nogami et al., 2002</xref>). VDE- catalyzed DSBs (hereafter called VDE-DSBs) form independent of Spo11 and meiotic axis proteins. However, like Spo11-DSBs, VDE-DSBs form after pre-meiotic DNA replication and are repaired using end-processing and strand invasion activities that also repair Spo11-DSBs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Fukuda et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Neale et al., 2002</xref>). We examined resolvase contributions to VDE-initiated CO formation, and obtained evidence that local enrichment for meiotic axis proteins promotes MutLγ-dependent CO formation; while recombination that occurs outside of this specialized environment forms COs by MutLγ-independent mechanisms. We also show that CO formation at a locus, and in particular MutLγ-dependent CO formation, requires Spo11-DSB formation elsewhere in the genome.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Using VDE to study meiotic recombination at ‘hot' and 'cold’ loci</title><p>The recombination reporter used for this study contains a VDE recognition sequence (<italic>VRS</italic>) inserted into a copy of the <italic>ARG4</italic> gene on one chromosome, and an uncleavable mutant recognition sequence (<italic>VRS103</italic>) on the homolog (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>).

In contrast, Spo11-DSBs infrequently occur at the same place on both sister chromatids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">Zhang et al., 2011</xref>). While the consequences of this difference remain to be determined, we note that inserts at both <italic>HIS4</italic> and <italic>URA3</italic> are cleaved by VDE with equal frequency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>).

VDE-initiated COs at <italic>HIS4</italic> are similar to those initiated by Spo11, in that most depend on MutLγ. In contrast, VDE-initiated COs at the 'cold' locus, <italic>URA3</italic>, more closely resemble mitotic COs, which are independent of MutLγ, but are substantially dependent on SSNs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Ho et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Ira et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Muñoz-Galván et al., 2012</xref>). Locus-dependent differences in MutLγ-dependence are reduced in <italic>pch2∆</italic> mutants, as are differences in Hop1 occupancy at later times in meiosis I prophase. Based on these findings, we suggest that local chromosome context exerts an important influence on the biochemistry of CO formation during meiosis, and that factors responsible for creating DSB-hot and -cold domains also create corresponding domains where different DSB repair pathways are dominant. An attractive hypothesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>) is that regions enriched for meiosis-specific axial element proteins create a chromosomal environment that promotes meiotic DSB formation, limits inter-sister recombination, preferentially loads ZMM proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Joshi et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Serrentino et al., 2013</xref>), and is required for recruitment of MutLγ. In such regions, where most Spo11-dependent events occur, recombination intermediates will have a greater likelihood of being captured by axis-associated ZMM proteins, and consequently being resolved as COs by MutLγ. Regions with lower axial element protein enrichment are less likely to recruit ZMM proteins and MutLγ; DSB repair and CO formation in these regions are more likely to involve non-meiotic mechanisms. In short, the meiotic genome can be thought of as containing two types of environment: meiotic axis protein-enriched regions, where 'meiotic' recombination pathways predominate; and meiotic axis protein-depleted regions, in which recombination events more closely resemble those seen in mitotic cells.<fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.19669.016</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Different resolvase functions in different genome domains.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Early crossover decision model for meiotic recombination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bishop and Zickler, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Hollingsworth and Brill, 2004</xref>) illustrating early noncrossover formation, a major pathway where recombination intermediates form in the context of ZMM proteins and are resolved by MutLγ to form crossovers, and a minor pathway where ZMM-independent intermediates are resolved by SSNs as both crossovers and noncrossovers.

In addition, it is important to keep in mind that ChIP-based values for meiotic axis protein-enrichment and molecular measures of CO resolvase-dependence are both population-based averages, and do not detect cell-to-cell heterogeneity. It is possible that meiotic axis protein enrichment at <italic>HIS4</italic> varies across a population, and most SSN-dependent COs form in cells where <italic>HIS4</italic> is not meiotic axis protein-enriched. Alternatively, it is possible that meiotic axis protein enrichment at <italic>HIS4</italic> is uniform across a population, but that MutLγ is recruited to JMs with less than unit efficiency, and that when MutLγ is not recruited, SSNs resolve JMs. Finally, it is important to recognize that, while meiotic axis protein occupancy is an attractive candidate as a determinant of resolvase contributions to VDE-induced CO formation, other explanations are possible.

In light of this suggestion, it is interesting that the meiotic defects of <italic>spo11</italic> mutants in a variety of organisms are often only partially rescued by DSBs caused by exogenous agents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bowring et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Celerin et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Dernburg et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Loidl and Mochizuki, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Pauklin et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Storlazzi et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Thorne and Byers, 1993</xref>).

At <italic>HIS4</italic>, where MutLγ predominates, <italic>ssn</italic> mutants still display a modest reduction in VDE-initiated COs when MutLγ is active, but an even greater relative reduction in the absence of MutLγ. These findings are consistent with previous studies suggesting that, in the absence of MutLγ, SSNs serve as a back-up that resolves JMs to produce both COs and NCOs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Argueso et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">De Muyt et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">Zakharyevich et al., 2012</xref>).

However, in our studies, JMs are more efficiently resolved in <italic>mlh3∆</italic> mutants than in <italic>ssn</italic> mutants, which display persistent unresolved JMs. Therefore, if MutLγ acts as a back-up resolvase, it can do so in only a limited capacity, possibly reflecting a need for a specific chromosome structural context in which MutLγ can be efficiently loaded and activated.

However, the 140–190 Spo11-DSBs that form in each meiotic cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Buhler et al., 2007</xref>) are also expected to induce a nucleus-wide DNA damage-response, and to compete with other DSBs for repair activities whose availability is limited, and both have the potential to alter recombination biochemistry at VDE-DSBs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Johnson et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Neale et al., 2002</xref>).

In other words, the transition to meiosis from the mitotic cell cycle does not involve a global inhibition of 'mitotic' recombination pathways.

The aqueous layer was transferred to a fresh tube and DNA was precipitated from input samples as with immunoprecipitate samples.</p><p>qPCR analysis of purified DNA from input and immunoprecipitated samples used primer pairs that amplify two regions: chromosome III coordinates 65350–65547 and 68072–68271, Saccharomyces Genome Database, flanking the <italic>HIS4</italic> gene, and chromosome V coordinates 115119–115317 and 117728–117922, flanking the <italic>URA3</italic> gene (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Kevin Struhl (Senior Editor) and three reviewers, one of whom, Bernard de Massy (Reviewer #1), is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Joao Matos (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>In this study Medhi et al. have analyzed the contribution of different Holliday junction resolvases to VDE-initiated CO-formation in recombination reporters inserted at HIS4 and URA3 loci. One known and documented difference between these two loci is the occupancy for the chromosome axis protein Hop1, high at HIS4 and low at URA3. The authors find that VDE-initiated COs at HIS4 are strongly dependent on MutLγ, similar to those initiated by Spo11. VDE-induced COs at URA3 are more dependent on SSNs. The authors also show that <italic>pch2∆</italic> mutants, which have smaller differences in Hop1 occupancy between HIS4 and URA3, display smaller locus-dependent differences in formation of COs by MutLγ. The authors conclude that local chromosome context is important for the biochemistry of CO formation during meiosis.</p><p>The data is of high quality and the striking differences between insertions at the HIS4 and URA3 loci are clearly documented. These results provide significant, interesting and novel insights into the regulation of meiotic recombination by properties of chromosome structure.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>In order to fully validate the interpretations, some additional experiments are needed using the tools that the authors have used in the present experiments. In addition, the authors should not over interpret the data which is based on the comparison of two loci (HIS4 and URA3) with a correlation with HOP1 occupancy. There are a large number of possible differences between these loci aside from the ones the authors focus on, and it remains possible that the direction of the correlation seen with these two loci remains purely coincidental. Pch2 mutant fits the expectation but absence of Pch2 has likely several other consequences. The Abstract and conclusions should be modified accordingly. Use of SEM should me revised.</p><p>1) In order to evaluate the generality of their findings (see general comment above), the authors could compare published ChIP-seq data of Hop1 with available genome wide recombination maps from resolvase mutants.</p><p>2) One important experiment missing in this paper is to demonstrate the requirement for <italic>ssn</italic> in <italic>pch2</italic> mutant and thus to analyze intermediates, COs and NCOs in <italic>pch2 mms4 yen1 slx1</italic> mutant.</p><p>3) Since there are only two replicate datasets for several analyses, error bars should show range rather than SEM for the time-course plots. Bar graphs should be replaced with univariate scatter plots, but if the authors wish to retain the bar graphs, then error bars should show range, not SEM.

The Serrentino paper is mentioned briefly in passing in the preceding paragraph, but I doubt a reader would realize from this mention that paper had documented differences in crossover vs. noncrossover outcome between different loci.

This pattern is altered in <italic>pch2</italic> mutants where Hop1 appears to be more homogenously distributed.</p><p>The experimental strategy, experiments and interpretations are very clear and convincing. These results provide significant, interesting and novel insights into the regulation of meiotic recombination by properties of chromosome structure.</p><p>Major comment:</p><p>The only experimental validation missing in this paper is to demonstrate the requirement for <italic>ssn</italic> in <italic>pch2</italic> mutant and thus to analyze intermediates, COs and NCOs in <italic>pch2 mms4 yen1 slx1</italic> mutant.</p><p>General comments:</p><p>1) Several observations and interpretations should be more precisely discussed:</p><p>How these observations relate to previous genetic studies on the effect of MutLg and <italic>ssn</italic> on CO in different intervals?</p><p>2) How do the authors explain that the ratio NCO/CO (for VDE induced events) is similar is both contexts (His4 vs. Ura3)? According to the model proposed, higher density of meiosis axial elements should lead to increase capture of ZMM and decreased NCO/CO.</p><p>3) Why JMs are detected in <italic>ssn</italic> mutant and not or weakly in Mlh3 mutant? In addition, if intermediates are distinct (nicked single/double HJ?) how could resolvases partially substitute, how could Mlh be used as a backup? The discussion in the first paragraph of the subsection “The interplay of resolvase activities is chromosome context-dependent”, does not clarify these questions.</p><p>In the absence of Spo11: CO are Mlh-independent, how is Hop1 or Hop1 phosphorylation distributed?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>Much information has been accumulated concerning the genetic control of meiotic recombination pathways that lead to formation of crossover or noncrossover recombination products. However, much of this work tends to focus on one or two individual genomic loci, so it has remained unclear to what extent observed genetic pathways operate uniformly (or not) across the genome. This intriguing paper documents a substantial difference between two positions in the yeast genome for use of MutLgamma and other Holliday junction resolving activities. The experimental design is clever, taking advantage of site-specific DSBs made by the VDE nuclease. The data are of excellent quality and the striking differences between insertions at HIS4 and URA3 are clearly documented. This is an interesting and important study.</p><p>There were a few concerns about the framing of some of the interpretations and about how some of the data are displayed. While these are important points, they can be easily remedied with text fixes.</p><p>1) A significant concern has to do with interpreting differences between the HIS4 and URA3 loci in terms of chromosome structure and/or abundance of Hop1 or other chromosome axis proteins. The main issue is that the authors are trying to argue based on a two-point correlation, but there are a large number of possible differences between these loci aside from the ones the authors focus on, and it remains possible that the direction of the correlation seen with these two loci remains purely coincidental. The <italic>pch2</italic> experiments are consistent with the authors' preferred interpretation, but fall short of providing convincing support: while it is true that Hop1 occupancy changes, it is also the case that other things probably change as well in the absence of Pch2. So, it is a stretch to ascribe the effects of this mutation as being solely or even primarily via effects on Hop1 localization. What this paper clearly demonstrates is context dependence for recombination protein utilization. The title of the paper is thus spot-on. But the Discussion needs to be more cautious in interpreting the possible causes of the context dependence, because there is just not enough information here to make strong conclusions.</p><p>2) In the subsection “Local chromosome structure influences meiotic CO formation”, second paragraph: There is little or no mention of prior studies of context-dependence for crossover-noncrossover likelihood (Mancera et al. 2008; Serrentino et al. 2013; deBoer et al. 2015) or interhomolog vs. intersister partner choice (Hyppa &amp; Smith 2010; Fowler et al. 2014). The Serrentino paper is mentioned briefly in passing in the preceding paragraph, but I doubt a reader would realize from this mention that paper had documented differences in crossover vs. noncrossover outcome between different loci. There are also studies documenting the different recombination behavior for DSBs within pericentromeric regions (Chen et al. 2008; Vincenten et al. 2015). These prior studies should be discussed in comparison to the context dependence documented here. (This is also relevant to the statement in the subsection “Concluding remarks”, at the end of the first paragraph.)</p><p>3) Throughout: SEM is used for error bars, but in most cases this is for experiments with only two replicates. SEM is rarely a good choice for displaying information about experimental variability, but is particularly fraught (as is SD) with just two measurements. It would be better to use error bars to indicate range when there are only two measurements, and SD (or range) for instances where there are larger numbers of replicates. A related point: in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>, it's a little unclear if the error bars are SEM here, but if so, the data seem to indicate &gt;100% recovery of arg4-VRS103 for at least one of the experiments at URA3. Is this right? In any case, it would be better to use univariate scatterplots to show the individual values from each replicate rather than using bar graphs with SEM error bars (or more complicated error bars as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>. If the authors wish to stick to bar graphs, then the error bars should show the range. This paper in PLoS Biology provides an excellent discussion of pitfalls for bar graphs and suggests other strategies for data display: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002128">http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002128</ext-link></p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>In this study Medhi et al. have analyzed the contribution of different Holliday junction resolvases to VDE-initiated CO-formation in recombination reporters inserted at HIS4 and URA3. HIS4 is &quot;hot&quot; whereas URA3 is &quot;cold&quot; for occupancy by the chromosome axis proteins Hop1 and Red1.</p><p>The authors find that VDE-initiated COs at HIS4 are strongly dependent on MutLγ, similar to those initiated by Spo11. VDE-induced COs at URA3 are more dependent on SSNs. The authors also show that <italic>pch2∆</italic> mutants, which have smaller differences in Hop1 occupancy between HIS4 and URA3, display smaller locus-dependent differences in formation of COs by MutLγ. The authors conclude that local chromosome context is important for the biochemistry of CO formation during meiosis.</p><p>The data is of high quality and the work is overall interesting. If the authors address the issues listed below, I would strongly recommend it for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>1) The authors infer general chromosome behavior from 2 loci. It would be important to expand the analysis to at least another pair of &quot;hot&quot; and &quot;cold&quot; loci. Alternatively, the authors could compare published ChIP-seq data of Hop1 with available genome wide recombination maps from resolvase mutants.</p><p>2) Since VDE cuts both sister chromatids, could the authors reduce VDE expression to obtain a more comparable type of cleavage to Spo11. Otherwise, it may be inappropriate to extrapolate the obtained results to those of naturally occurring DSBs.</p><p>3) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, the authors show that CO formation at HIS4 is reduced by 60% in <italic>mlh3</italic> mutants, 30% in <italic>ssn</italic> mutants and 75% in a combination of the two. How are COs made in such mutant and why isn't the reduction at least the sum of both <italic>mlh3</italic> and <italic>ssn</italic> mutants (expected ~90% reduction)? The exact opposite is observed at URA3: The <italic>mlh3 sse</italic> mutant is more defective than the sum of the two pathways.</p><p>4) In the subsection “Altered Hop1 occupancy in <italic>pch2</italic> mutants is associated with altered MutLγ− dependence of VDE-initiated Cos”, last paragraph: Why would COs that are Mlh3-dependent increase at URA3 relative to HIS4 (37% vs. 20%) in <italic>pch2∆</italic> mutants. If the Hop1 occupancy is similar, as argued by the authors, why is this value so different?</p><p>5) The finding that MLH3-dependent COs are absent in spo11 mutants is not surprising. However, it is surprising that the formed COs are also largely SSN-independent (~70%). How do the authors explain this? The authors should analyze the <italic>mlh3∆ ssn∆</italic> mutant. It is possible that SSNs can backup completely for MLH3 in this case (and MLH3 provides a significant backup for SSNs). Which would suggest that actually Mlh1-Mlh3 does at least part of the job in the WT, but one does not see it because SSNs can compensate for it.</p><p>6) How do the authors explain that the dependency on pathway usage at &quot;hot&quot; and &quot;cold&quot; regions is so limited. 60% vs. 30% contribution is not what one would expect if the genome is really partitioned and this is a major biochemical determinant of pathway usage. The authors should discuss this in more detail.</p><p>7) CO and NCO frequency is the same at URA3 and HIS4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). If at one locus HJ cleavage is mediated by MutLγ and at the other by SSNs, wouldn't one expect a different NCO/CO ratio? Nucleases have been shown by the Lichten lab (Dayani 2011) to generate a mixture of both, while MutLγ would generate exclusively COs (Zakharyevich 2012).</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.19669.020</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>[…]</italic></p><p><italic>Essential revisions:</italic> </p><p><italic>In order to fully validate the interpretations, some additional experiments are needed using the tools that the authors have used in the present experiments.

We have rewritten the Abstract to modify its overall emphasis, and have also added text to the Discussion that explicitly addresses the above concern about coincidence:</p><p>“The observation that some COs at <italic>HIS4</italic> are SSN-dependent, even though most are MutLγ-dependent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>), indicates that this division is not absolute. […] It remains possible that the association seen at <italic>HIS4</italic> and <italic>URA3</italic>, rather than being directly causative, reflects another underlying aspect of meiotic chromosome structure or function, and that other differences betweenthese two loci cause the observed differences in resolvase usage.”</p><p>It should be noted that an emerging consensus is that Pch2’s primary activity involves remodeling HORA-domain proteins (see Rosenberg and Corbett, JCB 2015 for discussion). This makes it likely that the varied meiotic phenotypes of <italic>pch2</italic> mutants are all a consequence of altered Hop1 distributions, but of course altering Hop1 occupancy will affect many different meiotic processes; thus, the text above, in particular the last two sentences.</p><p><italic>1) In order to evaluate the generality of their findings (see general comment above), the authors could compare published ChIP-seq data of Hop1 with available genome wide recombination maps from resolvase mutants.</italic> </p><p>This is a great idea. Unfortunately, currently there are not sufficient tetrad data to make a locus-by-locus comparison. The only available SSN mutant data are for a <italic>mms4</italic> meiotic depletion strain (Oke et al., PLOS Genetics 2014), with a total of 596 crossovers in 7 tetrads analyzed, or a scored crossover density of about 1/17kb. Nishant K.T. and collaborators have (unpublished) crossover data for 19 <italic>mlh3</italic> tetrads from an S288c-YJM789 hybrid strain that they have made available to us, but even at this higher crossover number (1224, 1CO/8 kb), there are not enough to confidently score differences between wild-type and <italic>mlh3</italic> on a locus-by-locus basis. We are currently exploring strategies to divide the genome into bins with different Hop1 enrichment levels and examine relative Mlh3-dependence of crossovers in each bin, but this is a complex problem that is going to require considerable work before we even know if the current <italic>mlh3</italic> dataset is of sufficient size.</p><p><italic>2) One important experiment missing in this paper is to demonstrate the requirement for ssn in pch2 mutant and thus to analyze intermediates, COs and NCOs in pch2 mms4 yen1 slx1 mutant.</italic> </p><p>We did these experiments and they are presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplements 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">2</xref>; corresponding text has also been changed (subsection “Altered Hop1 occupancy in <italic>pch2</italic> mutants is associated with altered MutLγ−dependence of VDE-initiated Cos”, last paragraph).</p><p><italic>3) Since there are only two replicate datasets for several analyses, error bars should show range rather than SEM for the time-course plots. Bar graphs should be replaced with univariate scatter plots, but if the authors wish to retain the bar graphs, then error bars should show range, not SEM. This paper in PLoS Biology provides an excellent discussion of pitfalls for bar graphs and suggests other strategies for data display: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002128">http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002128</ext-link> </italic></p><p>Error bars were changed to range in all but <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C, D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C, D</xref>, where error bars were removed (see below). Figure legends were appropriately changed.</p><p>We did not convert bar graphs to scatter plots, as they do not report primary data. Primary data are presented as line graphs and also in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Supplementary file 2</xref>. The bar graphs are used to summarize features of the data, with the goal of visually communicating conclusions.</p><p>Weissgerber et al., cited in the reviewers’ comments, object to bar (and line) graphs because they do not “allow readers to critically evaluate continuous data”. In our paper, data are clearly presented in other figure panels and in a data supplement, so the interested reader has plenty of opportunity for evaluation. Weissgerber et al. dislike bar graphs because they conceal differences in distributions (including outliers), in sample size, and in relationships between dependent variables. In our data, there are no differences in sample size (2, in each case), in distribution relative to the mean (can’t be, with 2 values), and variables are independent. Therefore, the issues that motivate Weissgerber et al. are not relevant to our paper.</p><p>In the case of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref>, panels C and D, it is not possible to convert error bars to “range”. This is because the values are the mean of 8 and 9 hr samples in two independent experiments with the indicated mutant (all 4 values averaged), divided by a similar mean for the indicated wild-type strain. Since the values are the ratio of two means, range is not applicable. In addition, values are a mix of dependent (8 and 9 hr samples from the same time course) and independent values (everything else), so formally it is not legitimate to calculate standard deviations. Instead, we removed error bars and representations of significance from these panels, and figure legends have been appropriately adjusted. We believe that these bar graphs still have value (see below), in that they enhance comprehensibility. We would prefer to retain them, but will remove them if requested. If error bars are deemed necessary, then we can calculate standard deviations for these ratios (we agree that S.E.M. was not correct), keeping in mind that such a calculation is not strictly legitimate.</p><p>(The following contains Michael Lichten’s views, not necessarily those of the other authors, and is included here by way of discussion with the editor, editorial staff, and reviewers. Please feel free to delete it from the public review record or include it, as you see fit.)</p><p>Despite current trends to the contrary, there is a definite value to summary plots and statistics, if they enhance clarity and comprehensibility but are not the only form in which data are presented, and if they are not used to hide data features that are relevant to the analysis. Univariate scatter plots (a.k.a. “confetti plots”), currently so popular, actually can make data less comprehensible and more obscure, especially when sample sizes are so large that individual points cannot be distinguished. It is hoped that the suggestions of Weissgerber et al., which are certainly well taken, will not be blindly imposed on every paper that is submitted to <italic>eLife</italic>, but rather will be used in situations where they are appropriate.</p><p><italic>4) The authors should explicitly indicate that in most meiosis VDE cuts both sister chromatids and that the consequences of this on pathway choices are unknown.</italic> </p><p>The following text was added:</p><p>“Thus, in most cells, both sister chromatids are cut by VDE (Gimble and Thorner, 1992; Neale et al., 2002). In contrast, Spo11-DSBs infrequently occur at the same place on both sister chromatids (Zhang et al., 2011). While the consequences of this difference remain to be determined, we note that inserts at both <italic>HIS4</italic> and <italic>URA3</italic> are cleaved by VDE with equal frequency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Thus, any effects due simultaneous sister chromatid-cutting should be equal at the two loci.”</p><p><italic>5) In the subsection “Local chromosome structure influences meiotic CO formation”, second paragraph: There is little or no mention of prior studies of context-dependence for crossover-noncrossover likelihood (Mancera et al. 2008; Serrentino et al. 2013; deBoer et al. 2015) or interhomolog vs. intersister partner choice (Hyppa &amp; Smith 2010; Fowler et al. 2014). The Serrentino paper is mentioned briefly in passing in the preceding paragraph, but I doubt a reader would realize from this mention that paper had documented differences in crossover vs. noncrossover outcome between different loci. There are also studies documenting the different recombination behavior for DSBs within pericentromeric regions (Chen et al. 2008; Vincenten et al. 2015). These prior studies should be discussed in comparison to the context dependence documented here. (This is also relevant to the statement in the subsection “Concluding remarks”, at the end of the first paragraph.)</italic> </p><p>We agree that previous findings were given short shrift, and included more of this information in the paper. However:</p><p>1) Mancera et al. say that CO/NCO ratios differ at different loci, but this is likely a consequence of small sample size and uneven distribution of polymorphic markers.</p><p>2) Serentino et al. showed that three DSB sites with lower Zip3 occupancy/DSB ratios had fewer COs (measured by genetic distance, cM) than a DSB site with higher Zip3 occupancy. Please note that, because NCOs were not scored, this could be because of changes in CO/NCO <italic>or</italic> in IH/IS ratios. Their calculations used ssDNA data from Buhler et al. as a proxy for DSB levels; when the calculation is made using Pan et al.’s more recent Spo11-oligo data, the differences between loci become much less marked, and Zip3 occupancy correlates fairly well with Spo11 oligo levels (ML, unpublished).</p><p>Rather than include an extensive discussion of these issues, we wrote the following:</p><p>“Serrentino et al. (2013) showed that enrichment for the budding yeast ZMM protein, Zip3, at DSB sites is correlated with interhomolog CO levels. […] Locus-specific differences in CO/NCO ratios also have been observed in mouse meiosis (de Boer et al., 2015), locus-specific differences in partner choice have been reported in <italic>S. pombe</italic> (Hyppa and G. R. Smith, 2010), and crossover suppression by centromeres is observed in many species (Talbert and Henikoff, 2010).”</p></body></sub-article></article>
