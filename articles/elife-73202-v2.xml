Here, we explore this phenomenon in Müller glia, which are specialized radial astroglia that are the predominant glial type of the vertebrate retina. Müller glia extend fine filopodia-like processes into retinal synaptic layers, in similar fashion to brain astrocytes and radial glia that exhibit perisynaptic processes. Using two-photon volumetric imaging, we found that during the second postnatal week, Müller glial processes were highly dynamic, with rapid extensions and retractions that were mediated by cytoskeletal rearrangements. During this same stage of development, retinal waves led to increases in cytosolic calcium within Müller glial lateral processes and stalks. These regions comprised distinct calcium compartments, distinguished by variable participation in waves, timing, and sensitivity to an M1 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor antagonist. However, we found that motility of lateral processes was unaffected by the presence of pharmacological agents that enhanced or blocked wave-associated calcium transients. Finally, we found that mice lacking normal cholinergic waves in the first postnatal week also exhibited normal Müller glial process morphology. Hence, outgrowth of Müller glial lateral processes into synaptic layers is determined by factors that are independent of neuronal activity.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>When it comes to studying the nervous system, neurons often steal the limelight; yet, they can only work properly thanks to an ensemble cast of cell types whose roles are only just emerging.</p><p>For example, ‘glial cells’ – their name derives from the Greek word for glue – were once thought to play only a passive, supporting function in nervous tissues.

There, beautifully intricate Müller glial cells display fine protrusions (or ‘processes') that intermingle with synapses, the busy space between neurons where chemical messengers are exchanged. These messengers can act on Müller cells, triggering cascades of molecular events that may influence the structure and function of glia. This is of particular interest during development: as Müller cells mature, they are exposed to chemicals released by more fully formed retinal neurons.</p><p>Tworig et al. explored how neuronal messengers can influence the way Müller cells grow their processes. To do so, they tracked mouse retinal glial cells ‘live’ during development, showing that they were growing fine, highly dynamic processes in a region rich in synapses just as neurons and glia increased their communication. However, using drugs to disrupt this messaging for a short period did not seem to impact how the processes grew. Extending the blockade over a longer timeframe also did not change the way Müller cells developed, with the cells still acquiring their characteristic elaborate process networks. Taken together, these results suggest that the structural maturation of Müller glial cells is not impacted by neuronal signaling, giving a more refined understanding of how glia form in the retina and potentially in the brain.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>retina development</kwd><kwd>neuron-glia interactions</kwd><kwd>two-photon calcium imaging</kwd><kwd>glial morphology</kwd><kwd>spontaneous activity</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DGE 1752814</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tworig</surname><given-names>Joshua M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01EY019498</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tworig</surname><given-names>Joshua M</given-names></name><name><surname>Feller</surname><given-names>Marla B</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01EY013528</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tworig</surname><given-names>Joshua M</given-names></name><name><surname>Feller</surname><given-names>Marla B</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000053</institution-id><institution>National Eye Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P30EY003176</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tworig</surname><given-names>Joshua M</given-names></name><name><surname>Feller</surname><given-names>Marla B</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>During development, lateral processes of retinal Müller glia are highly motile, and this motility persists when retinal waves and calcium transients are blocked, suggesting that Müller glial morphology is established independent of neuronal activity.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Bidirectional signaling between neurons and glia is essential for circuit formation and function throughout the nervous system. Across developmental steps from neurogenesis to circuit maturation, glia monitor their environment and in turn regulate neuronal production, migration, and differentiation, promote synapse turnover, and regulate synaptic function via neurotransmitter uptake and ion buffering (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Allen and Lyons, 2018</xref>). In the vertebrate retina, for example, Müller glia exhibit neurogenic potential (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bernardos et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Ji et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Guimarães et al., 2018</xref>), promote circuit-specific wiring via secretion of synaptogenic molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Koh et al., 2019</xref>), regulate phagocytosis of neuronal debris (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bejarano-Escobar et al., 2017</xref>), and limit neurotransmitter spillover via transporter activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Bringmann et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>There is extensive evidence that neuronal signaling influences glial physiology in the adult brain. Individual astroglia extend fine processes that contact thousands of synapses and express an array of neurotransmitter receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Allen and Eroglu, 2017</xref>). This enables glia to rapidly integrate neuronal activity, often involving intracellular calcium mobilization. Neuronal activity-evoked calcium events in astroglia range in size from small membrane-proximal microdomains to global cytosolic events mediated by various transmembrane proteins and calcium sources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Shigetomi et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bindocci et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Nimmerjahn and Bergles, 2015</xref>). Pharmacological studies suggest compartmentalized and global calcium events are mediated by separate mechanisms and evoke different functional responses within astroglia, which lead to differential effects on neurotransmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Di Castro et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chen et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Srinivasan et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Here, we use the mouse retina as a model to explore mechanisms and a possible function of neuron-glia signaling during development. In the retina, Müller glia are the predominant glial type, tiling the entire retinal space and interacting with every retinal cell type (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Wang et al., 2017</xref>). Similar to Bergmann glia of the cerebellum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">De Zeeuw and Hoogland, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lippman et al., 2008</xref>), Müller glia exhibit a radial structure with a stalk extending from the soma, lateral processes extending from the stalk within synaptic layers, and endfeet contacting neuronal somata, axons, and vasculature.

During both mouse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Rosa et al., 2015</xref>) and zebrafish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Zhang et al., 2019</xref>) development, Müller glia undergo calcium transients in response to retinal waves, a term used to describe spontaneous bursts of depolarization that propagate across the retina. The functional relevance of wave-associated calcium signaling in Müller glia is not known.</p><p>One potential role for wave-associated calcium-signaling in Müller glia is in modulating outgrowth of lateral processes, which initiates and progresses during the same developmental window as retinal waves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Wang et al., 2017</xref>). In other brain regions and model systems, neuronal activity-evoked calcium transients lead to morphological changes in astroglial processes. For example, in the hippocampus and somatosensory cortex, perisynaptic astrocytic processes undergo spatially localized, glutamate-evoked calcium transients which are essential for activity-evoked ensheathment of synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bernardinelli et al., 2014</xref>). In the cerebellum, Bergmann glial processes are highly motile during synaptogenic periods, and their ensheathment of Purkinje cells is impaired when glial glutamate transporters are knocked out (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lippman et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Miyazaki et al., 2017</xref>).

By eye opening, after P12, processes arborized throughout the IPL and began to resemble their adult distribution, characterized by fewer processes in IPL sublayers S2/S4 than in S1/S3/S5.

To characterize process motility, we conducted volumetric two-photon imaging of sparsely labeled processes at a rate of roughly 1 volume every 2 min for 10-min epochs. We characterized motility that occurred during the imaging period by grouping events into distinct categories as follows: new processes that branched from stalks or from existing processes, extension of existing processes, retraction of processes without elimination, elimination of existing processes, or stable for processes that did not change length. We made several observations based on this analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). First, Müller glial cell lateral processes were highly motile across the IPL throughout the entire second postnatal week. Second, there was a slight bias toward new process sprouting rather than process loss. Third, we found there were roughly equal proportions of extending and retracting processes over 10-min epochs of imaging, highlighting their rapid turnover during this period of development. Finally, we observed a sharp developmental transition toward stability a few days after eye opening (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C, E and F</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>).</p><p>To assure that we could observe and quantify changes in process motility, we applied two manipulations. First, we slowed process motility with pharmacological agents that disrupt cytoskeletal proteins. Process motility was reduced by bath application of the microtubule-disrupting agent nocodazole (10 µM) and the actin polymerization inhibitor cytochalasin-D (5 µM), the combination of which led to processes stabilization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref>). It is unlikely that this loss of motility resulted from damaged cell health, as Müller glial process morphology remained normal in the presence of cytochalasin and nocodazole. Müller glia, like astroglia throughout the brain, exhibit reactive gliosis associated with hypertrophy and expression of filamentous membrane processes when exposed to damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Graca et al., 2018</xref>), which we did not observe here. Second, we enhanced process motility by bath application of epidermal growth factor (EGF; one unit [100 ng]/ml; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp5">Supplementary file 5</xref>), which activates EGF receptors (EGFRs). EGFRs are expressed by Müller glia during the second postnatal week (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Close et al., 2006</xref>) and increase motility in other cells via activation of Rac- and Rho-GTPase-dependent pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Pena et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Liu and Neufeld, 2004</xref>). Taken together, these results indicate that lateral process motility is facilitated by turnover of actin filaments and microtubules and may be modulated by growth factor signaling, pathways that potentially interact with neuronal activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Georgiou et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lavoie-Cardinal et al., 2020</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Retinal waves activate compartmentalized calcium transients in Müller glia</title><p>Much of the morphological development of Müller glia occurs when retinal waves are present (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Wang et al., 2017</xref>).

However, these studies did not assess whether there are distinct calcium compartments within Müller glia that could potentially have distinct impacts on lateral process motility. The two compartments in Müller glia we focused on were their central stalks and their lateral processes within the IPL.</p><p>We conducted simultaneous two-photon calcium imaging of Müller glial stalks and processes and voltage-clamp recordings from retinal ganglion cells (RGCs). Several strategies for calcium imaging from Müller glia were used.

Second, a subset of retinas were isolated from WT mice and bath-loaded with the chemical calcium dye Cal520, which selectively labels Müller glia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Rosa et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Uckermann et al., 2004</xref>).

Bath application of pirenzepine (5 µM), a selective antagonist of M1 mAChRs, led to a significant reduction in wave-associated calcium transients in stalks and lateral processes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). The magnitude of this effect was age- and compartment-dependent, as wave-associated transients in Müller glial stalks had greater sensitivity to M1 mAChR block at P9/10 than at P11/12, and pirenzepine sensitivity was significantly greater in stalks than in lateral processes at early ages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B and C</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp8 supp9 supp10 supp11">Supplementary files 8–11</xref>).

For example, a plexus of glial processes provides a diffusional barrier for neurotransmitters and other signaling molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Bringmann et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Syková, 2001</xref>), undergoes contact-mediated signaling with neurites to modulate synapse formation and function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Filosa et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Murai et al., 2003</xref>), and participates in synaptic pruning via activation of phagocytic pathways in glia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Chung et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Across brain regions, neuron-glia signaling impacts glial morphology in diverse ways. We found in the retina that Müller glial lateral process motility during development was not impacted by neuron-glia signaling via release of neurotransmitter. This is similar to Bergmann glia, radial glia of the cerebellum, whose process motility is developmentally regulated and not directly affected by perturbations of neuronal activity or calcium influx (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lippman et al., 2008</xref>). Similarly in microglia, another highly motile cell type, chelation of calcium with BAPTA-AM slightly slowed but did not block process motility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Pozner et al., 2015</xref>). In striatal astrocytes, FRET-based synaptic proximity assays have shown that although fine branches interact with synapses, these interactions are stable and unaffected by neuronal activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Octeau et al., 2018</xref>). These findings stand in contrast to the perisynaptic processes of hippocampal astrocytes, in which metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluR) activation leads to localized increase in intracellular calcium which promotes process motility and coverage of dendritic spines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bernardinelli et al., 2014</xref>). This divergence between Müller glia and hippocampal astrocytes might be reflective of differences in ultrastructural interactions between astroglial processes and synapses in these two systems: perisynaptic processes of hippocampal astrocytes engage in true tripartite synapses in a brain region with high plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Ventura and Harris, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Haber et al., 2006</xref>), while there is currently no published evidence revealing similar structures in the retina. Further, astrocytic processes express specific actin-binding proteins such as ezrin which enable coupling of cytoskeletal dynamics with signaling through mGluRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lavialle et al., 2011</xref>), which were previously shown to have minimal contribution to retinal wave-associated responses in Müller glia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Rosa et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Multiple pathways independent of neuronal activity may regulate morphological dynamics in Müller glial processes. One possibility is the release of growth factors from neurons or other nearby cells, which has been implicated in morphological changes among astrocytes in other systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Wu et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Liu and Neufeld, 2007</xref>). This hypothesis is supported by our finding that application of exogenous EGF enhanced process motility prior to eye opening. Interestingly, EGFR expression in Müller glia is high prior to eye opening and declines with a developmental time course that matches our observed decline in motility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Close et al., 2006</xref>). Another intriguing possibility is that repulsive homotypic interactions between lateral processes from neighboring Müller glia underly their motility. This idea is supported by single-cell photoablation experiments in zebrafish Müller glia and mouse Schwann cells, in which processes from non-ablated cells filled in the territory vacated by ablated cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Williams et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Brill et al., 2011</xref>). Further study will be required to determine whether these or other alternative pathways mediate Müller glial lateral process motility during development.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Calcium compartments in Müller glia</title><p>We observed two distinct calcium compartments in Müller glia activated by retinal waves. Compartmentalization of calcium within Müller glial stalks was achieved via activation of glial M1 mAChRs, while lateral processes exhibited non-M1 mAChR-mediated transients with a smaller latency than those in stalks. We observed an age-dependent reduction in stalk participation in waves, while lateral processes continued to respond through P12. (Note, our observation that lateral processes continue to respond to retinal waves from P9 to P12 contrasts with a previous study that reported an overall reduction in Müller glial responses to waves at these ages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Rosa et al., 2015</xref>]. We attribute this difference to improved sensitivity of GCaMP6f over GCaMP3). The reduced stalk participation observed in older animals may be due to downregulation of M1 mAChRs prior to eye opening, or to a reduction in volume release of acetylcholine during the transition to glutamatergic waves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Ford et al., 2012</xref>). Our observation that gabazine application during glutamatergic waves caused wave-associated stalk transients to return in an M1 mAChR-dependent manner suggests that the latter is true.</p><p>Gabazine application also enhanced wave-associated calcium transients in lateral processes via a mechanism independent of M1 mAChR activation. We suspect this is due to enhanced release of other excitatory neurotransmitters following relief of GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor-mediated inhibition in the presence of gabazine during retinal waves. This is similar to the action of TBOA, which blocks glutamate transporters and subsequently increases retinal wave frequency and wave-associated Müller glial calcium transients due to an increase in extracellular glutamate levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Rosa et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Because astroglia and neurons both express neurotransmitter receptors and transporters, it is interesting to consider which of these cell populations is targeted by the antagonists used in this study. Current RNA-sequencing datasets suggest that Müller glia do not express GABA receptors at an appreciable level and therefore it is unlikely that gabazine directly impacts signaling in these cells. That said, Müller glia express GABA transporters which might contribute to signaling during retinal waves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Bringmann et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Macosko et al., 2015</xref>). They also express glutamate transporters (EAAT1) which are targeted by TBOA. At 25 μM, the concentration of TBOA used to modulate retinal waves in this study was likely too low to effectively inhibit glial EAAT1 (IC<sub>50</sub>: 70 μM), and more likely affects retinal wave properties via neuronal EAATs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Jabaudon et al., 1999</xref>). Furthermore, although we did not test whether pirenzepine acts on neuronal mAChRs, it is possible that blockade of non-Müller glial M1 mAChRs by pirenzepine indirectly affects glial responses to retinal waves, as previous studies have revealed expression of these receptors in retinal interneurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Macosko et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Strang et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Strang et al., 2015</xref>). However, our observation that retinal wave-associated EPSC amplitude and IWI remained normal in the presence of pirenzepine is consistent with the interpretation that pirenzepine acts directly on glial M1 mAChRs rather than on wave-generating circuits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4E</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Roles of calcium compartmentalization in astroglia</title><p>Subcellular calcium compartmentalization plays a variety of roles in neuron-glia signaling and tissue homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Wang et al., 1997</xref>). Hippocampal astrocytic processes undergo at least two types of spatiotemporally distinct calcium transients in response to nearby synaptic activity, depending on the type of synaptic activity that occurs. This calcium signaling is thought to regulate synaptic transmission within the astrocytic territory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Di Castro et al., 2011</xref>). Similarly, compartmentalized calcium transients during startle response frequently occur in distal branches, and less frequently in somata of hippocampal astrocytes in awake mice. Distinct signaling pathways, including those involving transmembrane calcium channels or transporters, adrenergic receptors, and IP3 receptors, differentially contribute to calcium transients in branches versus somata (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Denizot et al., 2019</xref>). Another study used a computational approach to reveal how calcium influx in fine astrocytic branches can be mediated by glutamate transporter-dependent activity of Na<sup>+</sup>/Ca<sup>++</sup> exchangers, while somatic calcium can be modulated by mGluR-dependent activation of IP<sub>3</sub> signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Oschmann et al., 2017</xref>). Compartmentalization between Müller glial stalks and processes may arise by a similar mechanism.</p><p>We found that wave-associated compartmentalized calcium activity is not required for Müller glial process motility, so this activity likely plays a role in other functions of Müller glia during retinal development. These functions include calcium-dependent neurovascular coupling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Biesecker et al., 2016</xref>), release of gliotransmitters such as ATP or D-serine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Newman, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Newman, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Sullivan and Miller, 2010</xref>), or secretion of synaptogenic molecules such as thrombospondin or growth factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Koh et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">de Melo Reis et al., 2008</xref>). Our identification of M1 mAChR as a driver of wave-associated calcium transients in stalks provides a target for selective perturbation in Müller glia to better define a role for these transients in retinal circuit development.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom">Reagent type (species) or resource</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Designation</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Source or <break/>reference</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Identifiers</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Strain, strain background (<italic>Mus musculus</italic>;

Eyes were enucleated and retinas dissected in oxygenated (95% O<sub>2</sub>/5% CO<sub>2</sub>) artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF) at room temperature under bright field (less than P10) or infrared (P10 and above) illumination. ACSF contained (in mM) 119.0 NaCl, 26.2 NaHCO3, 11 glucose, 2.5 KCl, 1.0 K2HPO4, 2.5 CaCl2, and 1.3 MgCl2. Isolated retinas were mounted ganglion cell side up on filter paper (Millipore) and transferred into the recording chamber of an upright microscope for imaging and electrophysiological recording. Retinas were continuously superfused with oxygenated ACSF (2–4 ml/min) at 32–34°C for the duration of experiments and kept in the dark at room temperature in oxygenated ACSF when not imaging or recording. In a subset of experiments, WT retinas were bath-loaded with the organic calcium dye Cal520 (12 µM) for 1.5–2 hr prior to performing calcium imaging.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Two-photon imaging</title><p>Two-photon imaging of Müller glia in the IPL was performed using a modified movable objective microscope (MOM; Sutter Instruments) equipped with an Olympus 60×, 1.0 NA, LUMPlanFLN objective (Olympus America). Two-photon excitation was evoked with an ultrafast pulsed laser (Chameleon Ultra II; Coherent) tuned to 920 nm for all fluorophores. The microscope was controlled by ScanImage software (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.scanimage.org">http://www.scanimage.org</ext-link>). Scan parameters were (pixels/line×lines/frame [frame rate in Hz]): 256×256 (1.48–2.98), at 1–2 ms/line. When imaging GCaMP6f fluorescence in Müller glial stalks and processes, the focal plane was set to ~1/3 the distance from the ganglion cell layer to the inner nuclear layer. Volumetric imaging of motility in mGFP-expressing Müller glial processes and of surrounding tdTomato-expressing cells was achieved by acquiring sequential two-channel Z-stacks through the entire IPL, with slices 1 µm apart and averaging four frames per slice. Volumes were taken every 2 min for a total of 10 min of imaging lateral process dynamics. A similar procedure was used for imaging motility in a subset of cells after filling them with fluorescent dye.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Electrophysiological recordings</title><p>Whole-cell voltage-clamp recordings were made from whole-mount retinas while simultaneously imaging GCaMP6f fluorescence. Under infrared illumination, RGC somas were targeted for voltage-clamp recordings using glass microelectrodes with resistance of 3–5 MΩ (PC-10 pipette puller; Narishige) filled with an internal solution containing (in mM) 110 CsMeSO<sub>4</sub>, 2.8 NaCl, 20 HEPES, 4 EGTA, 5 TEA-Cl, 4 Mg-ATP, 0.3 Na<sub>3</sub>GTP, 10 Na<sub>2</sub>Phosphocreatine, and QX-Cl (pH 7.2 and 290 mOsm). The liquid junction potential correction for this solution was –10 mV. Signals were acquired using pCLAMP10 recording software and a MultiClamp 700A amplifier (Molecular Devices), sampled at 20 kHz and low-pass filtered at 2 kHz.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Pharmacology</title><p>For pharmacology experiments, after 5–10 min of recording data in ACSF, pharmacological agents were added to the perfusion, and experimental recordings were obtained 5 min afterward. Drug concentrations were as follows: 5 µM cytochalasin-D (Avantor), 10 µM nocodazole (Sigma-Aldrich), 1 unit (100 ng)/ml EGF (Cytoskeleton, Inc), 5 µM pirenzepine (Tocris), 5 µM gabazine (Tocris), 25 µM DL-TBOA (Tocris), 20 µM DNQX (Tocris), 50 µM AP5 (Tocris), and 200 µM BAPTA-AM (Tocris). DL-TBOA and BAPTA-AM were prepared in 0.1% DMSO. For calcium chelation experiments, whole-mount retinas were incubated in BAPTA-AM or vehicle (ACSF/0.1% DMSO) for 1.5–2 hr, and then moved to ACSF for 30 min prior to imaging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Shigetomi et al., 2008</xref>). To verify that BAPTA-AM loading abolished retinal waves and residual calcium activity in cytosolic and membrane-proximal compartments, we measured calcium activity in neurons and Müller glia using cyto-GCaMP6f<sup>flox</sup> (crossed with <italic>PDGFRα-</italic>Cre) or Lck-GCaMP6f<sup>flox</sup> (crossed with <italic>Slc1a3-</italic>CreER) at P10–P12 before and after BAPTA-AM loading.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Focal agonist iontophoresis</title><p>For focal agonist application to mGFP-expressing lateral processes in <italic>Slc1a3-</italic>CreER;mTmG retinas, carbachol (10 mM, Tocris), or glutamic acid (10 mM, Sigma-Aldrich) was loaded into sharp electrodes pulled on a P-97 Micropipette Puller (Sutter) with a resistance of 100–150 MΩ. Electrodes also contained 2 mM Alexa-594 for verification of iontophoresis and to visualize electrodes under two-photon illumination. While imaging at 920 nm and visualizing fluorescence from mGFP and Alexa-594, electrodes were driven into the IPL at a ~15° angle using a micromanipulator set to the ‘DIAG’ function. For each cell, the tip of the electrode was placed 1–5 µm from the arbor of lateral processes of interest. Iontophoresis of agonist or control was achieved by applying continuous current using pCLAMP10 software. To apply carbachol, which is positively charged at physiological pH, continuous current of +4 nA was used, while –4 nA current was used to apply glutamate, which is negatively charged. Current of opposite polarity to that used for each respective agonist application was applied as a control, and the order of control versus agonist application was shuffled to negate potential effects resulting from damage caused by the electrode. In a separate set of experiments, iontophoresis of agonist was performed in <italic>Slc1a3</italic>-CreER;cyto-GCaMP6f<sup>flox</sup> or <italic>Slc1a3-</italic>CreER;Lck-GCaMP6f<sup>flox</sup> retinas to verify that this method reliably evoked calcium transients in lateral processes.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Müller glial sharp fills</title><p>For a subset of experiments testing the role of retinal wave-evoked calcium transients in Müller glial motility (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>), and to compare Müller glial morphology in WT and β2-nAChR-KO retinas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>), sharp electrodes were pulled as described above, and the tip was bent 15–20° using a microforge. Electrodes were loaded with 2 mM Alexa-488 in water, and iontophoresis of dye into single Müller glial cells was achieved by applying a –10 nA pulse for 500 ms in MultiClamp 700A software while the electrode was on the membrane of Müller glial endfeet in the ganglion cell layer. Electrodes were withdrawn as soon as cells started to fill with dye, and cells were imaged 1–5 min after filling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Ding et al., 2016</xref>). Two-photon volumetric images of dye-filled lateral processes of single Müller glial cells in the IPL were acquired using the same image parameters used for imaging motility, as described above.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Image processing and analysis: calcium imaging</title><p>All images were processed using custom scripts in FIJI/ImageJ (National Institutes of Health) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Schindelin et al., 2012</xref>) and MATLAB (MathWorks). For calcium imaging movies, following non-rigid motion correction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Pnevmatikakis and Giovannucci, 2017</xref>), ROIs were semi-automatically placed over stalks using a filtering algorithm based on a Laplace operator and segmented by applying a user-defined threshold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Dorostkar et al., 2010</xref>). The Distance Transform Watershed function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Legland et al., 2016</xref>) in FIJI was used to segregate nearby stalks in binarized images. This method defined most of the ROIs that an experienced user would recognize by eye. Manual adjustments were made to include stalks that were missed and to remove ROIs that were erroneously placed on structures other than stalks, which were defined as semiregularly spaced, punctate regions of fluorescence 2–3 µm in diameter in average intensity projection images. Lateral process ROIs were subsequently defined by randomly placing 250 2.5×2.5 µm<sup>2</sup> squares in regions that did not overlap with stalk ROIs. Fluorescence intensity is reported as the average intensity across all pixels within the area of each ROI, and normalized as the relative change in fluorescence (ΔF/F) as follows:<disp-formula id="equ1"><mml:math id="m1"><mml:mrow><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">Δ</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">F</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">F</mml:mi></mml:mfrac><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">F</mml:mi><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">F</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mn>0</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mo>/</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">F</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mn>0</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>,</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:math></disp-formula></p><p>where F is the instantaneous fluorescence at any time point and F<sub>0</sub> is the baseline fluorescence, defined as the median fluorescence value over the duration of the trace.</p><p>ΔF/F traces were smoothed using a two-frame median filter and analyzed to detect calcium transients using custom MATLAB code. Traces were Z scored, and a threshold Z score of 3 was used to define calcium transients, which were then further defined as wave-associated if they occurred within 3 s of the peak of a wave-associated EPSC. Intercompartment latency was defined as the difference, in seconds, between wave-associated transients in stalks and the median wave-associated transient time for all lateral processes within the FOV, for each retinal wave.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Image processing and analysis: Müller glial morphology</title><p>For volumetric images of Müller glial process morphology, images were bandpass filtered in XY space to reduce noise while maintaining the structure of fine processes, and registered using the Correct 3D Drift plugin in FIJI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Parslow et al., 2014</xref>). 10-minute volumetric time series were corrected for photobleaching using the ‘Histogram matching’ setting within FIJI’s Bleach Correction plugin. Time series were collapsed into temporally color-coded images to facilitate identification of motile and stable processes in 3D. The Cell Counter tool within FIJI was used to count lateral processes and define their morphological dynamics as one of the following: extending, retracting, new process, lost process, extension followed by retraction, retraction followed by extension, and stable. Locations of process tips within the IPL were recorded and binned into one of five equally sized sections, corresponding to putative sublayers S1 through S5, defined by their distance from the INL and GCL borders as identified using membrane-tdTomato fluorescence on somas.</p><p>Volumetric images of sharp-filled Müller glia were traced using the Simple Neurite Tracer plugin (FIJI) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Arshadi et al., 2021</xref>). We traced each glial stalk and subsequently any visible processes branching from the stalk, creating distinct paths for each process and preserving branch order relationships. Measurements including number of tips, total process length, total branch points, and primary branches from stalk were derived from traced paths. For Sholl and convex hull analyses, paths were converted to binary skeletons and registered to correct for XY displacement of the stalk between the GCL and INL. Sholl analysis was performed using concentric rings spaced 1 µm apart (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Ferreira et al., 2014</xref>). For the XY plane, the center of each Sholl radius was placed on the registered stalk, and intersections were counted at each radius overlayed on a maximum projection image. For the XZ and YZ planes, the center of each Sholl radius was placed on the end of the stalk closest to the INL in orthogonal projections of traced cells. Sholl radii were normalized to the total IPL thickness. Convex hull area was defined as the area of the smallest convex polygon enclosing the entire skeleton in an XY maximum projection image.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Group measurements are expressed as mean ± standard error of mean (SEM) except when nonparametric test results are reported, in which case median, 1st, and 3rd quartiles are reported. MATLAB and RStudio were used to carry out all statistical tests. Chi-squared tests of goodness-of-fit were used to test for nonuniformity in lateral process distribution across the IPL within each age. Chi-squared tests for independent proportions were used to test for age-dependent differences in process distribution across the IPL (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1 supp2">Supplementary files 1 and 2</xref>). When comparing the proportion of total stable processes between control and experimental manipulations, we applied Wilcoxon signed-rank tests when cells were paired between conditions, and Wilcoxon rank-sum tests for unpaired cells. When there were less than five cells in a particular condition, we pooled process counts between cells and reported chi-square test statistics for these comparisons as well (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3 supp4 supp5 supp20">Supplementary files 3–5 and 20</xref>).

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Gary Westbrook as the Senior and Reviewing Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Edward S Ruthazer (Reviewer #2). The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Senior Editor has drafted this letter to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary</p><p>The reviewers were in agreement that this is a high quality manuscript that makes a substantial contribution to the field. There are a few essential points that we think will either require additional data or a more balanced discussion of the limitations of the experiments.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1. There was concern that the observations in Figure 5 were underpowered. The statistics used are well described but the n is small. Please either increase the sample size or explicitly state the limitations on interpretations imposed by the small sample.</p><p>2. Due diligence in the BAPTA-AM experiments to rule out any Ca transients remaining in tiny processes, e.g. by using Lck-GCaMP. We understand that it is very hard to rule out residual Ca activity w/o membrane-localized GCaMP. Please either provide that evidence or tone down conclusions from that experiment.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The paper by Tworig et al., reports high quality data from careful experiments aimed at addressing an important question related to how Muller glial (astrocyte-like cells) move during development and during neuronal activity. The authors have used developmental biology and physiology of the retina to great effect to explore in a systematic way the questions mentioned. The paper is beautifully written and very clear. The data are of high quality and the presentation of the results and discussion balanced, candid and fair.</p><p>I am very excited to see such quality work as in this manuscript. I have several suggestions to improve the paper and to make it more impactful for the readers. These could be addressed fairly easily with a round of revisions. Overall, I think this is an excellent paper. Congratulations to the authors on high quality work that addresses an idea that has been lingering in the literature for a long time but one that has never been satisfactorily nailed. I very much look forward to citing this paper when it is published.</p><p>1. I would encourage the authors to include an additional figure that shows something similar to Figure 1C, but in a way that is larger. Showing that at a larger scale early on will help the reader more easily follow the paper and importantly allow them to get a sense of the raw data and what was measured.</p><p>2. Although the figures are very well constructed and very clear, there are a few areas of improvement. The words Wave 1 and Wave 2 are really hard to see in Figure 2a. In Figure 2, the authors should add the concentration of pirenzepne to the figure panels (also add drug concentrations to all the figure panels). The representative images in Figure 6A,B, C are very nice but too small. I suggest remaking this figure to make these panels larger.</p><p>3. The authors performed several pharmacological experiments to explore if neurons affect Muller glia motility and calcium. Do they have data using antagonists of ATP P2Y receptors? If they do, this result could be added. However, I don't think it is critical and so new experiments are strictly not needed, but the result could be added if they have the data at hand. This is relevant as several labs have shown astrocytes and neurons release ATP. I suspect nothing will happen and it would be useful to say that, if indeed that is the case.</p><p>4. I think the discussion is very fair and balanced. There is only one previous paper that comes to mind that used a complex FRET assay and also found that astrocyte processes did not move relative to synapses even when astrocyte calcium went up during afferent stimulation. That paper could be usefully cited and does not detract from the current study – in fact supports it. However, this is not essential and it's up to the authors to decide if they want to cite it. If they do choose to cite it, the Pubmed ID is PMID: 29621490 and relevant data are towards the end of the results.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1. Was there a consistent difference in process to stalk latency with GCaMP vs Cal520? A serious concern associated with the use of any Ca dye but especially with large protein-based genetically encoded Ca indicators is that they may physically hinder the free diffusion of Ca within the cell. Performing this experiment using an organic dye as well as a GECI permits this issue to be addressed, but the paper does not clearly distinguish between latency data obtained with the two imaging methods. Could this be compared and discussed?</p><p>2. While the existing data presented are adequately compelling, it might have been interesting to apply a manipulation that altered wave interval rather than intensity to demonstrate unambiguously that the drugs used are acting via neurons rather than through some possible receptor binding on the MG themselves.</p><p>3. The demonstration that BAPTA-AM prevented Ca transients is important in MG but less meaningful for neurons where membrane voltage fluctuations could continue to signal in the absence of any intracellular Ca changes. Is the quantification shown mainly for glial Ca or for neuronal Ca? Again, I am willing to accept that if it works on neurons it likely works on glia but what was measured in this case could be made clearer in the text.</p><p>4. My main criticism is in the morphometric analysis section where the two major manipulations that might test neuronal activity's influence on glial motility suffered from:</p><p>a) being fairly underpowered with N's of 5 and 4.

Even so the effects were reported as showing a non-significant trend. Is there any way to either repeat these experiments in the absence of the upregulating compounds or at least to do the statistical comparisons to the baseline in the absence of that upregulating compound. As far as I could tell baselines for these experiments compared upregulation vs upreg+ downreg which would have been an outstanding control if there had been a positive result but which is less convincing with a marginal negative result. Because the main conclusion of the entire paper largely rests on these experiments, I would prefer to see them done properly.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Overall this is a strong and exciting manuscript investigating important questions about neural interactions by using the retina as a model system.

The authors have used developmental biology and physiology of the retina to great effect to explore in a systematic way the questions mentioned. The paper is beautifully written and very clear. The data are of high quality and the presentation of the results and discussion balanced, candid and fair.</p><p>I am very excited to see such quality work as in this manuscript. I have several suggestions to improve the paper and to make it more impactful for the readers. These could be addressed fairly easily with a round of revisions. Overall, I think this is an excellent paper. Congratulations to the authors on high quality work that addresses an idea that has been lingering in the literature for a long time but one that has never been satisfactorily nailed. I very much look forward to citing this paper when it is published.</p><p>1. I would encourage the authors to include an additional figure that shows something similar to Figure 1C, but in a way that is larger. Showing that at a larger scale early on will help the reader more easily follow the paper and importantly allow them to get a sense of the raw data and what was measured.</p></disp-quote><p>We have included a new figure supplement with larger images from the cells shown in Figure 1C (Figure 1—figure supplement 3).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. Although the figures are very well constructed and very clear, there are a few areas of improvement. The words Wave 1 and Wave 2 are really hard to see in Figure 2a. In Figure 2, the authors should add the concentration of pirenzepne to the figure panels (also add drug concentrations to all the figure panels). The representative images in Figure 6A,B, C are very nice but too small. I suggest remaking this figure to make these panels larger.</p></disp-quote><p>All figure panels were adjusted to increase visibility as needed. Where there was space within figure panels, drug concentrations were included. All drug concentrations can be found in figure legends and in the <italic>Pharmacology</italic> subsection within the Materials and methods section (pages 18-19).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. The authors performed several pharmacological experiments to explore if neurons affect Muller glia motility and calcium. Do they have data using antagonists of ATP P2Y receptors? If they do, this result could be added. However, I don't think it is critical and so new experiments are strictly not needed, but the result could be added if they have the data at hand. This is relevant as several labs have shown astrocytes and neurons release ATP. I suspect nothing will happen and it would be useful to say that, if indeed that is the case.</p></disp-quote><p>We have not performed experiments in the presence of ATP P2Y antagonists for this study. However, a previous study from our lab revealed that the nonselective P2 antagonist suramin did not block wave-associated calcium transients in Muller glia, suggesting that ATP does not contribute to wave-associated responses in these cells during retinal waves (Rosa et al., <italic>eLife</italic>, 2015).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. I think the discussion is very fair and balanced. There is only one previous paper that comes to mind that used a complex FRET assay and also found that astrocyte processes did not move relative to synapses even when astrocyte calcium went up during afferent stimulation. That paper could be usefully cited and does not detract from the current study – in fact supports it. However, this is not essential and it's up to the authors to decide if they want to cite it. If they do choose to cite it, the Pubmed ID is PMID: 29621490 and relevant data are towards the end of the results.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for bringing this study to our attention.

Direct comparison of latencies between GCaMP6f and Cal520-loaded Muller glia in this subset of experiments revealed a systematically higher latency in Cal520-loaded retinas than in GCaMP6f-expressing retinas. This could be due to a number of factors, including better signal-to-noise with Cal520, more robust loading of stalks with Cal520 versus expression of GCaMP6f in stalks, contamination of lateral process responses with fast neuronal responses due to nonspecific Cal520 loading, or changes in free diffusion of calcium in the presence of Cal520 vs. GCaMP6f.

Because multiple age groups and conditions were examined for each figure, each with varying numbers of cells, lateral processes, and animals, we opted to list all sample sizes in statistical tables instead of figure legends to enable easier reading and shorter legends. Mice of both sexes were used for all experiments, as described in the Methods section (line 433).</p></body></sub-article></article>
