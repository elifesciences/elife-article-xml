While the biosynthesis of mycofactocin is well established, the gene <italic>mftG</italic>, which encodes an oxidoreductase of the glucose-methanol-choline superfamily, remained functionally uncharacterized. Here, we show that MftG enzymes are almost exclusively found in genomes containing mycofactocin biosynthetic genes and are present in 75% of organisms harboring these genes. Gene deletion experiments in <italic>Mycolicibacterium smegmatis</italic> demonstrated a growth defect of the ∆<italic>mftG</italic> mutant on ethanol as a carbon source, accompanied by an arrest of cell division reminiscent of mild starvation. Investigation of carbon and cofactor metabolism implied a defect in mycofactocin reoxidation. Cell-free enzyme assays and respirometry using isolated cell membranes indicated that MftG acts as a mycofactocin dehydrogenase shuttling electrons toward the respiratory chain. Transcriptomics studies also indicated remodeling of redox metabolism to compensate for a shortage of redox equivalents. In conclusion, this work closes an important knowledge gap concerning the mycofactocin system and adds a new pathway to the intricate web of redox reactions governing the metabolism of mycobacteria.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Mycolicibacterium smegmatis</kwd><kwd>Mycofactocin</kwd><kwd>mycobacteria</kwd><kwd>respiration</kwd><kwd>redox-cofactor</kwd><kwd>oxidoreductase</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100007569</institution-id><institution>Carl-Zeiss-Stiftung</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Graça</surname><given-names>Ana Patrícia</given-names></name><name><surname>Lackner</surname><given-names>Gerald</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001655</institution-id><institution>Deutscher Akademischer Austauschdienst</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Al-Jammal</surname><given-names>Walid K</given-names></name><name><surname>Nikitushkin</surname><given-names>Vadim</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The <italic>mftG</italic> gene, present in the majority of mycofactocin gene clusters, encodes an oxidoreductase that facilitates ethanol utilization by reoxidation of mycofactocins and channeling electrons towards the respiratory chain.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Mycobacteria are a metabolically versatile group of microorganisms that are able to utilize various organic compounds for their carbon and energy metabolism. Especially environmental mycobacteria like <italic>M. smegmatis</italic> utilize for instance sugars, polyols, small organic acids, fatty acids, or sterols for their growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Tsukamura, 1966</xref>). While obligate pathogens like <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>, the causative agent of tuberculosis, are more limited in their menu, they still retain the ability to metabolize various nutrients available in the host organism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bloch and Segal, 1956</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Zimmermann et al., 2017</xref>). Intriguingly, alcohols like ethanol are readily consumed by many mycobacterial species, but the metabolic pathway for ethanol consumption requires genes related to the biosynthesis of the unusual redox cofactor mycofactocin (MFT; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Haft, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Krishnamoorthy et al., 2019</xref>). Indeed, the inactivation of the mycofactocin biosynthetic gene cluster <italic>mftA-F</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) showed a severe impact on the growth of <italic>M. smegmatis</italic> and <italic>M. marinum</italic> cultivated on ethanol as the sole carbon source. For <italic>M. tuberculosis,</italic> a similar growth deficit on media containing ethanol and cholesterol was observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Krishnamoorthy et al., 2019</xref>). In <italic>M. smegmatis</italic>, it was shown that the gene MSMEG_6242, encoding a MFT-associated alcohol dehydrogenase (termed Mno or Mdo), is strictly required for alcohol utilization. Mno/Mdo was also demonstrated to catalyze methanol metabolism in the same organism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dubey et al., 2018</xref>) and involvement of mycofactocin in this process was suggested (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dubey and Jain, 2019a</xref>). Furthermore, a metabolomics study conducted in our lab revealed that MFT production in <italic>M. smegmatis</italic> was significantly increased on ethanol as carbon source in comparison to a control cultivated on glucose (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Peña-Ortiz et al., 2020a</xref>). Recently, a homolog of Mdo was shown to be essential for MFT-dependent ethylene glycol oxidation in <italic>Rhodococcus jostii</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Shimizu et al., 2024</xref>). All of this evidence supported the hypothesis that mycofactocin enables alcohol metabolism by acting as an electron acceptor of alcohol dehydrogenases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Haft, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Krishnamoorthy et al., 2019</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>The mycofactocin redox system.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic representation of the <italic>mft</italic> gene cluster of <italic>M. smegmatis. mftA-F:</italic> MFT biosynthetic genes. <italic>mftR</italic>: TetR-like regulator. <italic>mftG</italic>: GMC oxidoreductase (subject of this study).

Intriguingly, the MFT gene locus seems to be de-repressed by long-chain fatty acid-CoA esters in <italic>M. smegmatis,</italic> which bind to the repressor MftR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Mendauletova and Latham, 2022</xref>). Furthermore, a comparison of the proteome of active and dormant cells revealed that <italic>mftD</italic> (Rv0694) was upregulated in the dormant state, which is associated with the persistence of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> in macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Nikitushkin et al., 2022</xref>). Lastly, a study on the impact of mycofactocin inactivation (∆<italic>mftD</italic>) on <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> showed increased growth on glucose containing media as well as a decreased number of mycobacterial cells in a mouse model after the onset of hypoxia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Krishnamoorthy et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>Mycofactocin is a ribosomally synthesized and post-translationally modified peptide (RiPP; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Ayikpoe et al., 2019</xref>). After translation, the precursor peptide MftA is bound by its chaperone MftB and undergoes several modifications until it matures into a redox-active molecule. More precisely, its C-terminal core peptide (Val-Tyr) is decarboxylated and cyclized by the radical <italic>S</italic>-adenosyl methionine (rSAM) maturase MftC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Khaliullin et al., 2017</xref>). The cyclized core peptide (AHDP) is liberated from the precursor by the peptidase MftE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Ayikpoe et al., 2018</xref>). The flavoenzyme MftD further deaminates AHDP to premycofactocin (PMFT) thus creating a redox-active ketoamide moiety (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Ayikpoe and Latham, 2019</xref>). In vivo, mycofactocins exist in oligoglycosylated forms (MFT-n), where n denotes the number of <italic>β</italic>–1,4-linked glucose moieties. The glycosylation requires the presence of the glycosyltransferase MftF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Peña-Ortiz et al., 2020a</xref>). In some mycobacteria, the glycosyl chain of MFT-n is further modified by methylation at the second sugar moiety (yielding MMFT-n) by the mycofactocin-associated methyltransferase MftM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ellerhorst et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p>The reduction of M/MFT-n to M/MFT-nH<sub>2</sub> during growth on ethanol is likely to be catalyzed by the above-mentioned alcohol dehydrogenase Mno/Mdo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Krishnamoorthy et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dubey and Jain, 2019a</xref>). However, two important questions remained open concerning the mycofactocin system. First, it is unclear how MFT-nH<sub>2</sub> is re-oxidized to MFT-n after reduction by Mno/Mdo or other enzymes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Such a step would be crucial to regenerate the cofactor and allow for further electron transfer to terminal electron acceptors such as oxygen. Second, the role of the <italic>mftG</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), the terminal gene in the <italic>mft</italic> gene cluster of mycobacteria, encoding a flavoenzyme of the glucose-methanol-choline (GMC) oxidoreductase superfamily remained unknown. GMC oxidoreductases are present in bacteria, fungi, plants, and insects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Sützl et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cavener, 1992</xref>) and are known to catalyze redox reactions using a variety of different types of substrates and electron acceptors. Prominent examples are the fungal glucose oxidases, which are used in portable glucose biosensors for diabetes patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Ferri et al., 2011</xref>). Other important representatives are the alcohol oxidases from the methylotrophic yeast <italic>Pichia pastoris,</italic> which uses oxygen as an electron acceptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Koch et al., 2016</xref>), or the choline dehydrogenase of <italic>E. coli</italic>, which feeds electrons into the electron transport chain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Landfald and Strøm, 1986</xref>). We therefore hypothesized that MftG may be an oxidoreductase involved in mycofactocin-related metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Haft, 2011</xref>). Here, we show that <italic>mftG</italic> (MSMEG_1428), encoding a flavoenzyme of the GMC family, is crucial for ethanol metabolism of the model organism <italic>Mycolicibacterium smegmatis</italic>. We further present evidence that MftG acts as a mycofactocin dehydrogenase and promotes MFT regeneration via electron transfer to the respiratory chain of mycobacteria.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Phylogeny and co-occurrence of <italic>mftG</italic> and mycofactocin</title><p>Primary sequence alignments with known members of the GMC family and AlphaFold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Varadi et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jumper et al., 2021</xref>) prediction of the tertiary structure of MftG (WP_014877070.1) from <italic>M. smegmatis</italic> MC<sup>2</sup> 155 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>) confirmed that MftG is a protein of the GMC superfamily with an intact FAD binding pocket and a conserved active site histidine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aleksenko et al., 2020</xref>).

To the MftG candidates, we added further GMC-superfamily enzymes from the same genome set as well as sixteen experimentally characterized GMC enzymes used in a previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aleksenko et al., 2020</xref>). Maximum Likelihood analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>) clustered the MftG candidates described by TIGR03970 into a well-supported clade, which comprised MftG proteins from <italic>Rhodococcus</italic>, other <italic>Nocardiaceae</italic> and <italic>Mycobacteriaceae</italic>. The <italic>Gordonia</italic> and <italic>Dietzia</italic> MftG candidates were also phylogenetically related to the main MftG clade. We therefore defined all sequences belonging to this clade as MftG. Two sequences previously annotated as MftG, however, were placed outside of the proposed MftG clade. Their corresponding genomes (<italic>Nocardia terpenica</italic> and <italic>Peterkaempfera bronchialis</italic>) did not contain any MftC candidate and the MftG candidates were therefore treated as misannotations. We conclude that all MftG candidates are monophyletic. To further improve the annotations, the gene neighborhood of the <italic>mftG</italic> candidates was investigated, confirming that <italic>mftG</italic> candidates are frequently located within a 5 kb distance from <italic>mft</italic> genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2, table S1</xref>). After refinement of the MftG annotation, we proceeded with co-occurrence analysis of <italic>mftC</italic> and <italic>mftG</italic> in our microbial genome set. In a total of 312 genomes that contained either <italic>mftC</italic> or <italic>mftG</italic>, 311 harbored an <italic>mftC</italic> homolog, and 235 a putative <italic>mftG</italic> homolog. In 234 genomes the two genes co-occurred (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Only one genome (<italic>Herbiconiux</italic> sp.

However, close inspection revealed the presence of <italic>mftD</italic>, <italic>mftF</italic>, and a potential <italic>mftA</italic> gene but a loss of <italic>mftB, C and E</italic> in this organism. This result reinforced the hypothesis that MftG enzymes strictly require mycofactocin. On the other hand, about 25% of the genomes encoding MftC lack an MftG enzyme. It remains an open question for future investigations, whether other enzymes can complement the function of MftG or whether the function of MftG is dispensable in these organisms.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>The role of MftG in growth and metabolism of mycobacteria</title><p>To investigate the physiological role of MftG, a <italic>mftG</italic> deletion mutant (Δ<italic>mftG</italic>) was generated in <italic>M. smegmatis</italic> MC<sup>2</sup> 155.

The growth of WT and mutant strains was not supported by 10 g L<sup>–1</sup> methanol, 5 g L<sup>–1</sup> hexanol, 0.01 g L<sup>–1</sup> acetaldehyde as sole carbon sources as previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Krishnamoorthy et al., 2019</xref>). Notably, WT and ∆<italic>mftG</italic> cells displayed significant growth with 5 g L<sup>–1</sup> acetate or 10 g L<sup>–1</sup> glycerol. However, evaluation of the growth using other alcohols showed differential behavior. A prolonged lag phase of the Δ<italic>mftG</italic> strain was detected on 1-propanol (29 h), 1-butanol (18 h), and 1,3-propanediol (20 h) compared to the WT strain. Interestingly, a putative 1,3-propanediol dehydrogenase (MSMEG_6239) is present in the same operon as MSMEG_6242, indicating that 1,3-propanediol degradation might be also MFT-dependent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dubey and Jain, 2019b</xref>). We further assessed the growth of Δ<italic>mftG</italic> using a panel of phenotype microarrays. While no further defect regarding carbon source utilization was detected, the Δ<italic>mftG</italic> mutant showed the ability to grow to a small extent on formic acid in contrast to the WT. Besides the different usage of carbon sources, only minor differences in bacterial growth were found in some of the sensitivity plates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>) demonstrating that the lack of the <italic>mftG</italic> gene did not induce relevant sensitivity towards antibiotics and stressors compared to WT when grown on glucose alone.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>The role of Δ<italic>mftG</italic> in ethanol metabolism of mycobacteria</title><p>Since the utilization of ethanol was the process that was most strikingly impacted by <italic>mftG</italic> inactivation, it was investigated further. First, the complementation of the Δ<italic>mftG</italic> deletion using an integrative vector carrying the <italic>mftG</italic> gene (Δ<italic>mftG attB</italic>::pMCpAINT-<italic>mftG</italic>, here named Δ<italic>mftG-mftG</italic>) was performed and resulted in the restoration of growth on 10 g L<sup>–1</sup> ethanol. Intriguingly, the growth curve of the complemented strain, which could be dysregulated in <italic>mftG</italic> expression, displayed a shorter lag phase, a faster second exponential growth phase, and a higher final biomass yield compared to the WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Altered growth kinetics of complement mutants on ethanol are a known phenomenon, albeit not always well understood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kpebe et al., 2023</xref>). However, duplication of the <italic>mftG</italic> gene using the same vector in the WT strain (WT <italic>attB</italic>::pMCpAINT-<italic>mftG</italic>, here named WT<italic>-mftG</italic>) also showed enhanced growth. These results indicate that MftG might catalyze a rate-limiting step during ethanol utilization.</p><p>To further characterize the metabolic processes during ethanol consumption, the amount of ethanol and acetic acid present in the growth media with and without mycobacterial strains (WT, Δ<italic>mftG</italic>, Δ<italic>mftG-mftG,</italic> and WT<italic>-mftG</italic>) was measured (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C and E</xref>). As reported previously, ethanol consumption during exponential growth of WT mycobacteria was accompanied by acetic acid production (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>), a process known as overflow metabolism where the rate of ethanol oxidation to acetate exceeds the rate of carbon assimilation for biomass formation during fast growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Peña-Ortiz et al., 2020a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Peña-Ortiz et al., 2020b</xref>). Although the ∆<italic>mftG</italic> strain could achieve residual growth after 45 h, the consumption of ethanol and the production of acetic acid remained at a very low level. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C and E</xref>). While this finding is in line with the occurrence of a metabolic roadblock in the ∆<italic>mftG</italic> mutant, it indicates, however, that enzymatic activities supporting ethanol oxidation to acetate are not completely abolished in ∆<italic>mftG</italic> mutants. This interpretation is also supported by growth curves recorded on a combination of ethanol and glucose, where a simultaneous feeding enhanced the growth yield of the ∆<italic>mftG</italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>) suggesting at least partially intact ethanol utilization in ∆<italic>mftG</italic> cells.</p><p>Typically, ethanol is oxidized to acetaldehyde first, which is further oxidized to acetic acid. To test whether the metabolic roadblock affects acetaldehyde formation or consumption, we also quantified acetaldehyde from supernatants of WT and Δ<italic>mftG</italic> cells grown on ethanol or ethanol combined with glucose (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). Interestingly, when comparing WT and the Δ<italic>mftG</italic> mutant<italic>,</italic> we noticed that both strains produced a similar amount of acetaldehyde regardless of whether ethanol was used as the sole carbon source or supplemented (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>), indicating that acetaldehyde formation is not altered in the mutant strain. At this point, it may be helpful to revisit the fact that Δ<italic>mftG</italic> mutants grew well on acetate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). This observation together with the detection of acetaldehyde and acetate in the supernatants of Δ<italic>mftG</italic> cultures excludes the hypothesis that <italic>mftG</italic> is required for acetaldehyde and acetate assimilation.</p><p>When investigating the carbon metabolism of the Δ<italic>mftG-mftG</italic> (complement) and WT<italic>-mftG</italic> (overexpression) strains, an inverted phenotype became visible. Parallel to the accelerated and enhanced growth described above (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>), the overexpression strains displayed higher rates of ethanol consumption as well as an earlier onset of acetate overflow metabolism and acetate consumption (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). These results indicate that MftG activity is, at least indirectly, related to ethanol oxidation. Notably, the accelerated turnover of the volatile substrate ethanol, which is subject to substantial evaporation during the cultivation process, to acetate, which is less volatile, could explain the enhanced final growth yield of the complement and overexpression strains.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>The impact of ethanol on survival and cell division of Δ<italic>mftG</italic> mutants</title><p>To investigate whether the reduced growth of ∆<italic>mftG</italic> mutants on ethanol is due to limited carbon and energy supply or rather a consequence of insufficient ethanol detoxification, we cultivated bacteria on combinations of glucose and ethanol and recorded growth curves. Surprisingly, simultaneous feeding with 10 g L<sup>–1</sup> glucose and 10 g L<sup>–1</sup> ethanol even promoted the growth of the ∆<italic>mftG</italic> mutant. In addition, we determined the percentage of dead cells upon cultivation with different carbon sources using propidium iodide staining followed by flow cytometry quantification (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Regardless of the genotype, the bacterial cultures grown on glucose or ethanol as the sole carbon source and under starvation displayed a similar percentage of dead cells after a cultivation period of 72 h. We, therefore, conclude that the inability of ∆<italic>mftG</italic> cells to grow on ethanol alone is not due to ethanol toxicity. This conclusion was further supported by measurements of the transmembrane potential that did not reveal any disturbance of the proton motif force (PMF) in the mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). Previous studies of the transmembrane potential of <italic>M. smegmatis</italic> ∆<italic>mftC</italic> cells<italic>,</italic> another mutant unable to grow on ethanol as a carbon source, showed the same pattern with no differences compared to WT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Krishnamoorthy et al., 2019</xref>). However, unexpectedly, an elevated proportion of dead cells was detected when ∆<italic>mftG</italic> was cultivated on combined carbon sources, while the WT tolerated this condition well.

The identification of elongation and replication sites was achieved by the sequential incubation of the cells with the fluorescent <sc>d</sc>-amino acid labeling probes NADA (green) and RADA (red; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C–E</xref>). These probes are incorporated via extracellular routes of mycobacterial peptidoglycan assembly, labeling both elongation poles as well as the sidewall (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">García-Heredia et al., 2018</xref>). The <italic>M. smegmatis</italic> WT and ∆<italic>mftG-mftG</italic> cultivated on glucose as the sole carbon source appear elongated with mainly polar growth (accumulation of RADA at the poles indicates the most recent active site of peptidoglycan incorporation). NADA occurs mainly at a non-polar location (previous active replication site). The ∆<italic>mftG</italic> mutant grown on glucose, however, showed few yellow cells (overlap of green and red) indicating growth arrest on a small part of the culture. Some cells are not actively synthesizing peptidoglycan and thus not growing, which leads to the overlap of both dyes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>).</p><p>Mycobacteria grown on glucose and ethanol showed a regular dispersion profile of both dyes, with polar RADA, non-polar NADA, and occasional mid-cell septum formation with no obvious differences between the three genotypes. In contrast, cultivation on 10 g L<sup>–1</sup> ethanol alone as well as under starvation condition (no carbon source) had a strong influence on peptidoglycan synthesis as the dyes show decreased incorporation into the cell wall. The simultaneous incorporation of both dyes in WT and ∆<italic>mftG-mftG</italic> cells grown on ethanol as the sole carbon source reflected the reduced growth rate, as shown by the growth curves (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A and B</xref>) compared to the glucose condition. Interestingly, ∆<italic>mftG</italic> mutant cells struggled to divide on ethanol displaying multiple septa and extreme elongation compared to WT on ethanol, leading to a higher ratio of foci per cell compared to WT grown on the same condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D and E</xref>). Independent of the genotype, the cultivation in the presence of ethanol significantly decreased cell size. A similar phenotype was previously observed in <italic>Mycobacterium vaccae</italic> cells exposed to ethanol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Pacífico et al., 2018</xref>). Starving cells were also significantly reduced in size in WT and ∆<italic>mftG</italic> strains compared to growth on glucose alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C and E</xref>), reflecting the limitation of resources available for propagation and elongation. Especially under starvation conditions, the cells appeared predominantly yellow, suggestive of growth arrest. A previous study on the effect of starvation on mycobacteria also showed the formation of large cells with multiple septa as a hallmark of starvation, from which after 14 days, mildly starved cells (with traces of carbon source available) remodeled into small resting cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Wu et al., 2016</xref>). Our results indicated that the major phenotype of ∆<italic>mftG</italic> on ethanol as a sole source of carbon is a growth defect comparable to a starvation effect. When incubated solely with this carbon source, ∆<italic>mftG</italic> cells are almost unable to divide, but remain alive and in a metabolically active state, most likely consuming ethanol in trace amounts.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Impact of <italic>mftG</italic> on mycobacterial cofactor metabolism</title><p>Based on the results above, we concluded that MftG is crucial for proper ethanol metabolism in mycobacteria. However, deletion of its corresponding gene still allowed for basal metabolic activity and ethanol oxidation. One way to explain these findings is that MftG is involved in cofactor regeneration during growth on ethanol as a carbon source. The genetic linkage of <italic>mftG</italic> with mycofactocin biosynthesis supported the hypothesis that MftG might be responsible for mycofactocin regeneration. However, before directly addressing mycofactocin metabolism, we decided to monitor the central respiratory redox cofactor NAD. We therefore determined the NADH/NAD<sup>+</sup> ratios of WT and knockout during the exponential phase when bacteria were grown on glucose or ethanol as the sole carbon sources. However, the presence or absence of <italic>mftG</italic> did not significantly influence the NADH/NAD<sup>+</sup> ratio of bacteria grown on either carbon source (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). This finding indicated that NAD homeostasis remained intact in the <italic>∆mftG</italic> mutant. Notably, when looking at absolute NAD<sup>+</sup> levels, (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>) an increase of the NAD pool in cells growing on ethanol was detected, however, independent of the genotype. Along with central redox (NAD<sup>+</sup>) metabolism, we also monitored the central energy metabolism of the cells by determining ADP/ATP ratios. These clearly supported the hypothesis that <italic>∆mftG</italic> cells suffered from starvation.

These results strongly supported the hypothesis that MFT regeneration was hampered in the ∆<italic>mftG</italic> mutant while MFT reduction was still taking place, thus resulting in a near-total conversion of mycofactocinones to mycofactocinoles. This phenotype was also observed when ∆<italic>mftG</italic> cells were cultivated on glucose and ethanol combined (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>) and even on glucose alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). Complementation of the ∆<italic>mftG</italic> mutant (∆<italic>mftG-mftG</italic>) reverted the MMFTH<sub>2</sub> to MMFT ratio back to WT levels. In contrast, the overexpression strain WT-<italic>mftG</italic> grown in ethanol contained significantly more MMFT-8 (oxidized) compared to other strains in the same condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>), thus providing further evidence that MftG is involved in reoxidation of mycofactocin and re-enforcing that this step might even represent a rate-limiting step during ethanol utilization.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>MFT dehydrogenase assay with recombinant MftG</title><p>To further support the hypothesis that MftG is responsible for MFT reoxidation, purification of MftG as a recombinant fusion protein with hexahistidine tag followed by in-vitro enzyme assays was attempted.

The restoration of the growth on ethanol of the ∆<italic>mftG-mftG</italic>His<sub>6</sub> expression strain indicated that the recombinant protein was produced in an active form.

The influence of mycofactocin on mycobacterial respiration was tested using isolated membranes from <italic>M. smegmatis</italic> WT supplemented with either NADH, succinate, synthetic PMFTH<sub>2</sub>, or purified MMFT-2H<sub>2</sub>. In these respiration assays, the consumption of oxygen after supplementation with NADH or succinate was highly increased showing the expected respiratory activity of the isolated membranes via NADH or succinate dehydrogenases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). The addition of PMFTH<sub>2</sub> or MMFT-2H<sub>2</sub> stimulated oxygen consumption to a rate that was comparable to succinate-induced respiration of the WT strain. In <italic>M. smegmatis</italic>, cyanide is a known inhibitor of the cytochrome <italic>bc1-aa3</italic> but not of cytochrome <italic>bd</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kana et al., 2001</xref>). Therefore, the decrease of oxygen consumption in the presence of KCN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>) revealed that MFT-induced oxygen consumption is indeed linked to mycobacterial respiration.</p><p>The membrane fraction of the ∆<italic>mftG</italic> strain showed a decreased consumption of oxygen compared to WT. Although the auto-respiration, i.e., the consumption of oxygen in the absence of a stimulant, was lower in the ∆<italic>mftG</italic> strain, the supplementation of NADH and succinate stimulated oxygen consumption demonstrating that the membranes contained a functional electron transport chain. The addition of reduced mycofactocins to the reaction revealed strongly reduced respiration when compared to the WT membrane. To test whether increased O<sub>2</sub> consumption was linked to the oxidation of mycofactocinols, we also carried out LC-MS analysis of the samples used in the respiration assays. Indeed, mycofactocinols were oxidized to mycofactocinones (e.g. PMFTH<sub>2</sub> to PMFT) under active assay conditions, while only low amounts of PMFTH<sub>2</sub> were oxidized in membranes of the ∆<italic>mftG</italic> strain or by membranes treated with KCN. Two observations suggest a low level of MftG-independent mycofactocin oxidation: (I) The residual induction of oxygen consumption in the ∆<italic>mftG</italic> strain by mycofactocinols, (II) the formation of low amounts of oxidized mycofactocins in the ∆<italic>mftG</italic> strain (at a similar level to WT inhibited by KCN).</p><p>From the respirometry experiments, we conclude that MftG catalyzes the electron transfer from mycofactocinol to membrane-bound components of the respiratory chain. These could be the quinone pool as known from succinate dehydrogenase complex, or cytochromes. For example, MftG in mycobacteria might play a similar role as the subunit II of the pyrroquinoline quinone-dependent alcohol dehydrogenase (PQQ-ADH) complex from acetic acid bacteria. The subunit II transfers electrons from the alcohol dehydrogenase (subunit I/III) to the ubiquinone pool, from which further electron transfer to oxygen occurs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Yakushi and Matsushita, 2010</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-8"><title>Transcriptomic analysis of <italic>M. smegmatis</italic> ∆<italic>mftG</italic> cells</title><p>To monitor genome-wide regulatory adaptation caused by <italic>mftG</italic> deletion, we employed high-throughput sequencing to record transcriptomic changes in WT and ∆<italic>mftG</italic> cells when grown to exponential phase (60 h of incubation for ∆<italic>mftG</italic> on ethanol) on glucose or ethanol. In the glucose condition, only nine out of 6506 annotated genes were classified as significantly upregulated in ∆<italic>mftG</italic> when compared to the WT (adjusted p-value &lt;0.05 and log2FoldChange &gt;2). Since these genes showed neither functional nor spatial clustering, we conclude that no meaningful differences in the mycobacterial transcriptome between WT and mutant grown on glucose were observed (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>, Table S2).</p><p>On the contrary, transcriptomics analysis of ∆<italic>mftG</italic> and WT grown on ethanol detected 578 genes as significantly up-regulated and 697 as down-regulated (adjusted p-value &lt;0.05 and log2FoldChange &gt;2 or &lt;-2) in the mutant when compared to the WT (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref> Table S2).

Downregulated processes were related to ATP binding and ATPase transmembrane movement, respiration, and DNA replication (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>). Significant changes, presumably due to energy limitation, took place in the ∆<italic>mftG</italic> mutant compared to the WT. For instance, the <italic>nuo</italic> genes (MSMEG_2050–2063) encoding NADH dehydrogenase I (NADH-I), were amongst the most highly expressed genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref> Table S2). In mycobacteria, two NADH dehydrogenases (NDH-I and II) are active, while in <italic>M. smegmatis</italic> the NADH-I dehydrogenase typically contributes only a low proportion of total NADH activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cook et al., 2014</xref>). Notably, enhanced expression of the high-efficiency, proton-pumping NADH-I (<italic>nou</italic>) system was previously observed under energy-limited starvation conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Berney and Cook, 2010</xref>). In addition, alternative dehydrogenases fostering electron transfer from other electron donors to the respiratory chain were strongly upregulated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>). These comprise enzymes like proline dehydrogenase (MSMEG_5117), pyruvate dehydrogenase (MSMEG_4710–4712), carbon monoxide oxidase (MSMEG_0744–0749), the hydrogenases 1 (<italic>huc</italic> operon, MSMEG_2261–2276) and 2 (MSEMG_2720–2719). Furthermore, quinone-dependent succinate dehydrogenase SDH1 (MSMEG_0416–0420) was highly upregulated when compared to the WT. Again, similar patterns were previously described in cultures growing under carbon limitation and can be seen as an attempt of the cell to compensate for poor loading of the electron transport chain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Berney and Cook, 2010</xref>).

Therefore, the impact of alcohols on commensal and clinically important bacterial strains has high relevance. However, ethanol metabolism in mycobacteria is still poorly characterized. While it is established that the cofactor mycofactocin plays a major role in this process, the fate of electrons during alcohol oxidation remained unknown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Krishnamoorthy et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Krishnamoorthy et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>Based on bioinformatics analysis, we hypothesized that MftG homologs, flavoenzymes of the GMC superfamily, might be involved in redox metabolism connected to MFT-dependent alcohol metabolism. Using <italic>M. smegmatis</italic> as a model system, we showed that MftG is indeed essential for ethanol metabolism, a process known to depend on both an intact mycofactocin biosynthetic pathway as well as the putative MFT-dependent alcohol-dehydrogenase Mdo/Mno. Mutants lacking the <italic>mftG</italic> gene incubated on ethanol as the sole carbon source displayed strongly impaired growth. Super-resolution microscopy combined with peptidoglycan labeling, transcriptomics as well as direct measurements of ADP/ATP ratios demonstrated that mutants grown on ethanol suffer from energy limitation and growth arrest similar to a mild starvation condition. However, the mutant maintained a level of functional metabolism, conserving its transmembrane potential. The ethanol oxidation pathway was proven to be affected in the knockout strain but not fully interrupted as suggested by partially intact co-metabolism with glucose and production of intermediate products.</p><p>Investigation of cofactor metabolism revealed that deletion of <italic>mftG</italic> resulted in a drastic increase in the ratio of reduced/oxidized mycofactocins in the mycobacterial cell while the NADH/NAD<sup>+</sup> ratio remained unchanged. This finding prompted the hypothesis that MftG could be involved in MFT cofactor regeneration. Assays with homologously and heterologously produced, semi-purified enzymes showed that MftG indeed oxidized PMFTH<sub>2</sub> and MMFT-2H<sub>2</sub>, but only reactions reminiscent of a single-turnover process could be observed. Respirometry studies further demonstrated that reduced mycofactocins feed redox equivalents into the intact mycobacterial respiratory chain. Strikingly, this process was severely hampered in Δ<italic>mftG</italic> mutants, suggesting that MftG, while directly accepting electrons from mycofactocinol, delivers electrons either directly or indirectly into the respiratory chain. Transcriptomic analysis revealed a profound re-organization of the respiration machinery when MftG was absent suggestive of starvation and low availability of redox equivalents to the respiratory chain.</p><p>We, therefore, conclude that MftG is a mycofactocin dehydrogenase requiring electron acceptors associated with the membrane-bound respiratory chain. This assumption is plausible considering that other members of the GMC superfamily, for example choline dehydrogenase from <italic>E. coli</italic>, were reported to couple substrate oxidation with the electron transport chain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Landfald and Strøm, 1986</xref>). While the exact electron acceptor remains a subject for future studies, it is plausible that cytochromes might fulfill this function. Interestingly, cellobiose dehydrogenase, a fungal GMC enzyme, is a multidomain enzyme where the dehydrogenase domain (GMC) is linked to a cytochrome domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Tan et al., 2015</xref>). This situation is reminiscent of pyrroloquinoline quinone (PQQ)-dependent alcohol dehydrogenases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Anthony, 2001</xref>). Those enzymes, that mainly occur in the periplasm of Gram-negative bacteria, are typically coupled to a dedicated cytochrome c subunit, which is genetically clustered along with the other subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Anthony, 2001</xref>). It is also likely that the membrane-associated quinone pool serves as the electron acceptor. For instance, the GMC-family oxidoreductase enzymes PhcC and PhcD from <italic>Sphingobium</italic> sp. involved in lignin oxidation were suggested to transfer electrons to the ubiquinone pool (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Takahashi et al., 2015</xref>).

However, other redox coenzymes, redox proteins or protein complexes of the respiratory chain might act as direct reaction partners of MftG.</p><p>Our study sets the ground for future investigations into the connection of the mycofactocin system to further (known or unknown redox) systems.

The counts' tables were used as an input to the R package DESeq2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Love et al., 2014</xref>) to compute fold changes and false discovery rates of differentially expressed genes between the control condition and each experiment condition.</p></sec><sec id="s4-20"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>The data retrieved in this study were further plotted and analyzed statistically using GraphPad Prism 9. Significance was calculated using either two-way ANOVA with Tukey’s multiple comparisons test once interaction index was not significant, or one-way ANOVA for multiple comparisons. Significance values were plotted directly on the graphs and only more relevant comparisons are shown.</p></sec><sec id="s4-21"><title>Materials availability statement</title><p>Materials are available from the authors upon request.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Validation, Investigation, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Formal analysis, Methodology, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Data curation, Validation, Methodology, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Validation, Methodology, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con8"><p>Validation, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con9"><p>Conceptualization, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Validation, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con10"><p>Conceptualization, Funding acquisition, Validation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con11"><p>Supervision, Funding acquisition, Validation, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con12"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Validation, Visualization, Writing – original draft, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s6"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="supp1"><label>Supplementary file 1.</label><caption><title>Sequences of the plasmids generated in this study.</title></caption><media xlink:href="elife-97559-supp1-v1.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="supp2"><label>Supplementary file 2.</label><caption><title>Set of organisms encoding MftG or MftC homologs (co-occurrence table).</title><p>The co-occurrence table (sheet 1) contains accession numbers of MftG and MftC candidate proteins, as well as further GMC proteins found in each organism.

They found that MftG was essential for growth in the presence of ethanol as the sole carbon source, but not for the metabolism of ethanol, evidenced by the equal production of acetaldehyde in the mutant and wild type strains when grown with ethanol (Fig 3). The phenotypic characterization of ΔmftG cells revealed a growth-arrest phenotype in ethanol, reminiscent of starvation conditions (Fig 4). Investigation of cofactor metabolism revealed that MftG was not required to maintain redox balance via NADH/NAD<sup>+</sup>, but was important for energy production (ATP) in ethanol. Since mycobacteria cannot grow via substrate-level phosphorylation alone, this pointed to a role of MftG in respiration during ethanol metabolism. The accumulation of reduced mycofactocin points to impaired cofactor cycling in the absence of MftG, which would impact the availability of reducing equivalents to feed into the electron transport chain for respiration (Fig 5). This was confirmed when looking at oxygen consumption in membrane preparations from the mutant and wild type strains with reduced mycofactocin electron donors (Fig 7). The transcriptional analysis supported the starvation phenotype, as well as perturbations in energy metabolism.</p><p>The link between mycofactocin oxidation and respiration is shown by whole-cell and membrane respiration measurements.

The authors hypothesise that MftG functions as a mycofactocin dehydrogenase, regenerating mycofactocin by shuttling electrons to the respiratory chain of mycobacteria. Although the study primarily uses <italic>M. smegmatis</italic> as a model microorganism, the findings have more general implications for understanding mycobacterial metabolism.

Since mycobacteria cannot grow via substrate-level phosphorylation alone, this pointed to a role of MftG in respiration during ethanol metabolism. The accumulation of reduced mycofactocin points to impaired cofactor cycling in the absence of MftG, which would impact the availability of reducing equivalents to feed into the electron transport chain for respiration (Fig 5). This was confirmed when looking at oxygen consumption in membrane preparations from the mutant and would type strains with reduced mycofactocin electron donors (Fig 7). The transcriptional analysis supported the starvation phenotype, as well as perturbations in energy metabolism, and may be beneficial if described prior to respiratory activity data.</p><p>The data and conclusions support the role of MftG in ethanol metabolism.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the positive evaluation of our manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>The work by Graca et al. describes a GMC flavoprotein dehydrogenase (MftG) in the ethanol metabolism of mycobacteria and provides evidence that it shuttles electrons from the mycofactocin redox cofactor to the electron transport chain.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>Overall, this study is compelling, exceptionally well designed and thoroughly conducted.

The authors hypothesise that MftG functions as a mycofactocin dehydrogenase, regenerating mycofactocin by shuttling electrons to the respiratory chain of mycobacteria. Although the study primarily uses <italic>M. smegmatis</italic> as a model microorganism, the findings have more general implications for understanding mycobacterial metabolism. Identifying the specific partner to which MftG transfers its electrons within the respiratory chain of mycobacteria would be an important next step, as pointed out by the authors.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>The authors have used a wide range of tools to support their hypothesis, including co-occurrence analyses, gene knockout and complementation experiments, as well as biochemical assays and transcriptomics studies.</p><p>An interesting observation that the mftG deletion mutant grown on ethanol as the sole carbon source exhibited a growth defect resembling a starvation phenotype.</p><p>MftG was shown to catalyse the electron transfer from mycofactocinol to components of the respiratory chain, highlighting the flexibility and complexity of mycobacterial redox metabolism.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>Could the authors elaborate more on the differences between the WT strains in Fig. 3C and 3E? in Fig. 3C, the ethanol concentration for the WT strain is similar to that of WT-mftG and ∆mftG-mftG, whereas the acetate concentration in thw WT strain differs significantly from the other two strains. How this observation relates to ethanol oxidation, as indicated on page 12.</p></disp-quote><p>This is a good question, and we agree with the reviewer that the sum of processes leading to the experimental observations shown in Figure 3 are not completely understood. For instance, when looking at ethanol concentrations, evaporation is a dominating effect and the situation is furthermore confounded by the fact that the rate of ethanol evaporation appears to be inversely correlated to the optical density of the samples (see Figure 3E and compare media control as well as the samples of D<italic>mftG</italic> and D<italic>mftG</italic> at OD<sub>600</sub> = 1). Additionally, the growth rate and thus the OD<sub>600</sub> of all strains monitored are different at each time point, thus further complicating the analysis. This is why we assume that the rate of ethanol oxidation is mirrored more clearly by acetate formation, at least in the early phase before 48 h (Figure 3E),i.e., before acetate consumption becomes dominant in D<italic>mftG-mftG</italic> and WT-<italic>mftG</italic>. Here, we see that the rate of acetate formation is zero for media controls, low for D<italic>mftG,</italic> but high for WT as well as D<italic>mftG-mftG</italic> and WT-<italic>mftG.</italic> The latter two strains also showed an earlier starting point of growth as well as acetate formation and the following phase of acetate depletion.</p><p>All of these observations are in line with our general statement, i.d., “Parallel to the accelerated and enhanced growth described above (Figure 3A), the overexpression strains displayed higher rates of ethanol consumption as well as an earlier onset of acetate overflow metabolism and acetate consumption (Figure 3D).” We are still convinced that this summary describes the findings well and avoids unnecessary speculation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors conclude from their functional assays that MftG catalyses single-turnover reactions, likely using FAD present in the active site as an electron acceptor. While this is plausible, the current experimental set up doesn't fully support this conclusions, and the language around this claim should be softened.</p></disp-quote><p>This is a fair point. We revised our claim accordingly. In particular, we changed:</p><p>Page 28: we added “possibly”</p><p>Page 28 we changed “single-turnover reactions” to “reactions reminiscent of a single-turnover process”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors suggest in the manuscript that the quinone pool (page 24) may act as the electron acceptor from mycofactocinol, but later in the discussion section (page 30) they propose cytochromes as the potential recipients. If the authors consider both possibilities valid, I suggest discussing both options in the manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>This is true. However, no change to the manuscript is necessary, since both options were discussed on page 30.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Recommendations for the authors:</bold></p><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p><p>The authors addressing some of the original recommendations is appreciated e.g. title change.

I read this sentence several times and I am still somewhat confused and not sure what exactly is meant here. I suggest to rephrase, e.g., to &quot;Here, we show that in 75% of all organisms that harbour the mft biosynthetic genes, MftG enzymes are also encoded and functionally associated with these genes&quot; (if that was meant; also the abbreviation mft should be introduced in the abstract or otherwise the full name be used).</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the good hint.
