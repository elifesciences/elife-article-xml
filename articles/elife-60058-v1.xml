formation of gametocytes in the human blood. The sexual conversion rate, the proportion of asexual parasites that convert into gametocytes at each multiplication cycle, is variable and reflects the relative parasite investment between transmission and maintaining the infection. The impact of environmental factors such as drugs on sexual conversion rates is not well understood. We developed a robust assay using gametocyte-reporter parasite lines to accurately measure the impact of drugs on sexual conversion rates, independently from their gametocytocidal activity. We found that exposure to subcurative doses of the frontline antimalarial drug dihydroartemisinin (DHA) at the trophozoite stage resulted in a ~ fourfold increase in sexual conversion. In contrast, no increase was observed when ring stages were exposed or in cultures in which sexual conversion was stimulated by choline depletion. Our results reveal a complex relationship between antimalarial drugs and sexual conversion, with potential public health implications.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Malaria</kwd><kwd>Artemisinin</kwd><kwd>sexual conversion rate</kwd><kwd>PfAP2-G</kwd><kwd>Gametocytes</kwd><kwd>sexual commitment</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>P. falciparum</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003329</institution-id><institution>Ministerio de Economía y Competitividad</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SAF2016-76190-R</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cortes</surname><given-names>Alfred</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000780</institution-id><institution>European Commission</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2016-1346</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Portugaliza</surname><given-names>Harvie P</given-names></name><name><surname>Pell</surname><given-names>Christopher</given-names></name><name><surname>Rosanas-Urgell</surname><given-names>Anna</given-names></name><name><surname>Cortes</surname><given-names>Alfred</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Treatment of malaria parasites with the frontline antimalarial drug artemisinin can increase the proportion of parasites that convert into transmission forms.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p><italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> is responsible for the most severe forms of human malaria. Repeated rounds of its ~48 hr intraerythrocytic asexual replication cycle result in an exponential increase in parasite numbers and are responsible for all clinical symptoms of malaria. At each round of replication, a small subset of parasites commits to differentiation into non-replicative sexual forms termed gametocytes, which are the only form transmissible to a mosquito vector. Sexual commitment is marked by epigenetic activation of the expression of the master regulator PfAP2-G, a transcription factor of the ApiAP2 family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Josling et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kafsack et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Llorà-Batlle et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Poran et al., 2017</xref>). This is followed by sexual conversion, which according to our recently proposed definitions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bancells et al., 2019</xref>) is marked by the expression of gametocyte-specific proteins absent from any replicating blood stages. After sexual conversion, parasites at the sexual ring stage develop through gametocyte stages I to V in a maturation process that lasts for ~10 days (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Josling et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Ngotho et al., 2019</xref>). While immature gametocytes are sequestered in organs such as the bone marrow (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Venugopal et al., 2020</xref>), mature gametocytes (stage V) are released into the circulation, where they are infectious to mosquitoes for several days or even weeks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Cao et al., 2019</xref>). To eliminate malaria, which the World Health Organization has adopted as a global goal, it is necessary to block transmission, as well as killing asexual parasites to cure patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">World Health Organization, 2017</xref>).</p><p>To secure within-host survival and between-host transmission, the proportion of parasites that convert into sexual forms at each replicative cycle, termed sexual conversion rate, is variable and tightly regulated. In human infections, gametocyte densities are always much lower than asexual parasite densities, and basal <italic>P. falciparum</italic> sexual conversion rates in vivo are estimated to be ~1% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Cao et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Eichner et al., 2001</xref>). This reveals a reproductive restraint for which multiple alternative hypotheses have been proposed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">McKenzie and Bossert, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Mideo and Day, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Taylor and Read, 1997</xref>). Whatever the reason for the low levels of sexual conversion, multiple observations suggest that malaria parasites can respond to changes in the conditions of their environment by adjusting the trade-off between transmission and within-host survival. From an evolutionary perspective, the ability to adjust sexual conversion rates depending on the host conditions would be clearly advantageous for the parasite (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Carter et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Schneider et al., 2018</xref>). In <italic>P. falciparum</italic>, several conditions have been shown to increase sexual conversion rates, and sexual conversion is viewed by some as a response to stress, although this remains controversial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Baker, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Bousema and Drakeley, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Dyer and Day, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Josling et al., 2018</xref>). The most commonly used method to enhance sexual conversion and obtain large numbers of gametocytes in vitro relies on overgrowing blood-stage cultures (the ‘crash method’) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Delves et al., 2016</xref>) and/or maintaining the cultures with parasite-conditioned (spent) medium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Brancucci et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Fivelman et al., 2007</xref>). Recent research has established that depletion of the human serum lipid lysophosphatidylcholine (LysoPC) underlies the stimulation of sexual conversion by high asexual parasitemia or spent medium, providing the first mechanistic insight into how environmental conditions can influence the rate of sexual conversion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Brancucci et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Brancucci et al., 2017</xref>). Low plasma LysoPC levels were also associated with increased sexual conversion rates in human infections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Usui et al., 2019</xref>). Depletion of LysoPC or choline, a downstream metabolite in the same metabolic pathway, has now been used by several groups to stimulate sexual conversion under culture conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Brancucci et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Filarsky et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Portugaliza et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Artemisinin and its derivatives (collectively referred to as ARTs) are potent antimalarial drugs that rapidly kill asexual parasites. After activation by cleavage of their endoperoxide bond by hemoglobin degradation products, ARTs produce reactive oxygen species and free radicals that result in widespread damage in parasite proteins and lipids. However, because ARTs have a very short elimination half-life in the human circulation (~1–3 hr), their application as monotherapy was discontinued to avoid infection recrudescence and development of drug resistance. Artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs), consisting of ART and a long-acting partner drug, are the current frontline treatment for uncomplicated as well as severe malaria cases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Blasco et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">de Vries and Dien, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Haldar et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Talman et al., 2019</xref>). Resistance to ARTs has emerged in South-East Asia in the form of delayed parasite clearance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Dondorp et al., 2009</xref>). ART resistance is associated with mutations in the PfKelch13 protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ariey et al., 2014</xref>) that prevent hemoglobin degradation in early ring-stage parasites. This in turn prevents ART activation, resulting in resistance of early rings to the drug (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Birnbaum et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Yang et al., 2019</xref>). Nowadays, ART resistance is frequently accompanied by simultaneous resistance to partner drugs such as mefloquine, piperaquine, or amodiaquine, resulting in high rates of treatment failure and limiting treatment options (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Mairet-Khedim et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Phyo et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">van der Pluijm et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Treatment with antimalarial drugs such as chloroquine (CQ) or sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine is usually associated with increased gametocytemia (density of gametocytes in the blood) on the days following drug administration, whereas treatment with ACTs results in reduced gametocytemia and transmission to mosquitoes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Ippolito et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Okell et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Price et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Sawa et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">von Seidlein et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">WWARN Gametocyte Study Group, 2016</xref>). Despite the efficacy of ACTs in reducing gametocytemia, successfully treated patients can remain infectious for several days and contribute to transmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bousema et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bousema et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Karl et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Targett et al., 2001</xref>). The higher capacity of ACTs to reduce gametocytemia compared to other drugs is attributable to several factors: (i) faster killing of asexual parasites, which prevents the formation of new gametocytes; (ii) more efficient killing of immature gametocytes; (iii) partial clearance of mature gametocytes, which are insensitive to most other clinically relevant drugs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adjalley et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Chotivanich et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Plouffe et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Although it has been proposed that the increase of gametocytemia observed after treatment with some drugs may reflect stimulation of sexual conversion, there is no direct linear relationship between conversion rates and the prevalence and density of circulating gametocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Carter et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Koepfli and Yan, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Reece and Schneider, 2018</xref>). The dynamics of circulating gametocyte densities after treatment can be explained without invoking an adjustment of sexual conversion rates: first, gametocytes are sequestered away from the circulation until ~10 days after sexual conversion, implying that the peaks of gametocytemia observed after treatment with some drugs (within less than 10 days) may reflect the dynamics of asexual parasite growth before treatment, rather than post-treatment changes in sexual conversion. Second, the effects of the drugs on sexual conversion rates in human infections cannot be disentangled from other drug-mediated actions such as the release of sequestered parasites or gametocyte clearance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Babiker et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Bousema and Drakeley, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Butcher, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Koepfli and Yan, 2018</xref>).</p><p>To directly address the effect of drug treatment on sexual conversion, a small number of studies have used <italic>P. falciparum</italic> in vitro cultures, yielding inconsistent results. While some studies reported increased sexual conversion upon exposure to specific doses of drugs such as CQ or ART (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Buckling et al., 1999b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Peatey et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Rajapandi, 2019</xref>), others did not observe this effect with ART (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Brancucci et al., 2015</xref>), or reported reduced sexual conversion upon exposure to low doses of CQ or pyrimethamine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Reece et al., 2010</xref>). Although the discrepancies may reflect methodological differences between these studies and limited accuracy in determining sexual conversion rates, the divergent conclusions also suggest a complex scenario in which conditions such as the specific drug used, the parasite stage at the time of exposure, and drug concentration may determine the effect of treatment on sexual conversion.</p><p>Given the widespread use of ACTs for malaria treatment and in mass drug administration campaigns aimed at malaria elimination, understanding the impact of ARTs on sexual conversion is an urgent research priority. Here we developed a robust assay based on recently described gametocyte-reporter parasite lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Portugaliza et al., 2019</xref>) to accurately measure the impact of drugs on sexual conversion rates, independently from their gametocytocidal activity. Using this assay, we tested the effect of exposing parasites to dihydroartemisinin (DHA, the active metabolite of all ARTs) at different stages and under different metabolic conditions, to provide an accurate and comprehensive description of the direct effect of this drug on sexual conversion rates. We also tested the effect of another drug, CQ, and a different type of stress, heat shock, on sexual conversion rates.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Exposure to DHA at the trophozoite stage enhances sexual conversion</title><p>To examine the effect of ARTs on <italic>P. falciparum</italic> sexual conversion, we administered a 3 hr pulse of DHA to synchronous cultures of the <italic>NF54-gexp02-Tom</italic> reporter line.

Generation 0 is the growth cycle at which the culture is exposed to different conditions (e.g., choline removal, or drugs), with parasite age indicated in h post-invasion (hpi). In all cases, the sexual conversion rate (SC) is calculated as the percentage of Generation 1 parasites that develop into non-replicative sexual forms (gametocytes). The total parasitemia (sexual + asexual parasites) at Generation 1 is measured by flow cytometry using fluorescent markers that stain DNA in all parasites (green dots) or active mitochondria in viable parasites (not represented here), by immunofluorescence assay using a fluorescent DNA stain (blue dots) or by light microscopy using Giemsa-stained smears (pale blue marks). Gametocytemia is measured by flow cytometry based on tdTomato signal (red marks), by immunofluorescence based on Pfs16 signal (pale green marks), or by light microscopy using Giemsa-stained smears (gametocyte-shaped pale blue marks). In immunofluorescence assays, the number of parasites and gametocytes in a given number of fields is determined instead of parasitemia and gametocytemia, but since both total parasites and gametocytes are determined simultaneously from the same samples (i.e., the total erythrocytes denominator is the same for both parameters), this does not affect the sexual conversion rate calculation.

Importantly, total gametocytemia (determined at the next multiplication cycle after drug exposure, i.e., early gametocytes) was also clearly higher in DHA-exposed cultures than in control cultures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). This result indicates that the increase in the sexual conversion rate is not only attributable to the lower number of asexual parasites after drug treatment, but also to a net increase in the number of gametocytes produced. By contrast, in cultures in which sexual conversion was already stimulated by choline depletion, DHA treatment did not result in a further increase in the sexual conversion rate or in the absolute number of gametocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C–E</xref>). Similar results were obtained in experiments in which sexual conversion rates were calculated based only on viable parasites as identified by a marker of active mitochondria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>), using an analogous reporter line generated in the 3D7-E5 genetic background that has lower levels of basal sexual conversion than NF54 (<italic>E5-gexp02-Tom</italic> line, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Portugaliza et al., 2019</xref>), and using a transgenic line with the fluorescent reporter under the control of the <italic>etramp10.3</italic> (PF3D7_1016900) gametocyte-specific promoter (<italic>NF54-10.3-Tom</italic> line) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Portugaliza et al., 2019</xref>). Using this latter parasite line, we measured sexual conversion rates by flow cytometry, by immunofluorescence assay (IFA) detecting the Pfs16 (PF3D7_0406200) early gametocyte marker and by light microscopy analysis of Giemsa-stained blood smears (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>).

A 2 nM DHA pulse did not have a measurable effect on parasite growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5B</xref>), but in choline-supplemented cultures it consistently resulted in a &gt; twofold increase in the sexual conversion rate and the total number of gametocytes (although not statistically significant; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5C–D</xref>). Drug doses &lt; 2 nM did not have a detectable effect on sexual conversion.</p><p>We also tested the impact on sexual conversion of higher DHA doses up to 30 nM, a concentration that kills ~90% of the parasites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s6">Figure 1—figure supplement 6A–B</xref>). In choline-supplemented cultures, both sexual conversion rates and total gametocytemia were clearly enhanced upon exposure to DHA concentrations up to 15 nM, but the increase was lower upon exposure to higher concentrations. In choline-depleted cultures, increasing DHA doses resulted in a progressive reduction of sexual conversion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s6">Figure 1—figure supplement 6C–D</xref>). However, it is important to note that the determination of sexual conversion rates is less accurate when the majority of the parasites are killed by the drug. Thus, given that maximum induction was observed at 10 nM and the difficulties to estimate sexual conversion accurately in experiments with higher drug doses, we used 5 and 10 nM DHA pulses for the majority of experiments described in the next sections.</p><p>Gametocytes of the <italic>NF54-gexp02-Tom</italic> line produced in cultures treated with 5 nM DHA at the trophozoite stage (in the presence of choline) matured through stages I to V without any apparent morphological alteration. Furthermore, mature, stage V gametocytes were able to exflagellate after activation and to infect mosquitoes productively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). As expected from the increase in the number of early gametocytes in DHA-treated cultures, the gametocytemia 10–13 d later (mature gametocytes) and the number of exflagellation centers were also higher in DHA-treated cultures compared to control cultures (no DHA). Likewise, when using these cultures to infect mosquitoes, the number of oocysts and sporozoites per mosquito was higher in mosquitoes fed with DHA-treated cultures than in mosquitoes fed with control cultures. The magnitude of the increase was similar to that observed in mosquitoes fed with cultures in which sexual conversion was stimulated by choline depletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). While only differences in the number of exflagellation centers and oocysts/mosquito were statistically significant (p&lt;0.05) between DHA-treated and control cultures (which is likely attributable to the intrinsic variability of mosquito feeding experiments), a clear increase was observed in all independent biological replicates for all parameters tested.</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Mosquito infection by gametocytes from cultures exposed to dihydroartemisinin (DHA).</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic representation of the assay.

Additionally, ACTs may be widely administered in mass drug administration campaigns aimed at malaria elimination. Given that the success of malaria control and elimination efforts largely depends on preventing disease transmission, understanding the impact of ARTs on the production of transmission forms is of paramount importance. Our results show a complex effect of DHA on the trade-off between asexual proliferation and the formation of transmission forms. Exposure of parasites at the trophozoite stage to subcurative doses of DHA resulted in a large increase in sexual conversion rates and total number of gametocytes, which were viable and infectious to mosquitoes. However, this was not observed when parasites were exposed to the same drug doses at the ring stage. Furthermore, in cultures in which sexual conversion was already stimulated at the metabolic level (i.e., by depletion of choline), DHA did not further stimulate sexual conversion at either stage. The accurate determination of the impact of DHA on sexual conversion rates at different stages was possible thanks to the development of an assay that uses a short drug pulse and reporter parasite lines that enable very early detection of gametocytes by flow cytometry. A limitation of our study is that we only used wild type parasite lines that do not carry mutations in the PfKelch13 protein associated with artemisinin resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ariey et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Birnbaum et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Yang et al., 2019</xref>). Future studies should assess the effect of DHA on sexual conversion in parasite lines carrying such mutations, to determine whether or not the effect of the drug on sexual conversion is linked to its effect on parasite survival.</p><p>The overall impact of a drug on the transmission potential of an infection depends on its effect on the sexual conversion rate, and on several other factors. In the case of ARTs, the stimulation of sexual commitment at the trophozoite stage may not result in an overall increase in transmission due to rapid clearance of asexual parasites, which prevents new rounds of gametocyte production, and to the activity of the drug against developing and mature gametocytes. Indeed, several studies have observed that treatment with drug combinations containing ARTs reduce gametocyte density and the duration of gametocyte carriage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bousema et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bousema et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Ippolito et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Karl et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Okell et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Price et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Sawa et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Targett et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">von Seidlein et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">WWARN Gametocyte Study Group, 2016</xref>). Notwithstanding the net reduction of transmission potential commonly observed after ART treatment, it is possible that patients in which many of the parasites are at the trophozoite stage at the time of ART administration may experience a peak of circulating gametocytes ~ 10 days after treatment (the time required for gametocyte maturation), if the drug does not kill all parasites. In this regard, it is noteworthy that the largest stimulation of sexual conversion was observed at subcurative doses of the drug. Such low drug concentrations may occur during treatment with substandard or underdosed drugs, through poor compliance with the prescribed regimen, as a consequence of drug malabsorption, or as the drug is eliminated following its natural pharmacokinetics profile. Treatment associated with low ARTs concentration may enable survival of some parasites, and at the same time enhance the probability of sexual conversion. Thus, our findings have potential public health implications for the use of ARTs in treatment and elimination strategies. While the benefits of ARTs for malaria treatment clearly outweigh the potential risks, the possibility that ARTs increase the transmission potential of some patients should be taken into account when considering their massive use in preventive treatment or elimination campaigns.</p><p>There is ongoing debate regarding whether human malaria parasites can modulate their level of investment in producing transmission forms as a response to ‘stress’ (i.e., a condition that reduces the asexual multiplication rate). Whether the impact of stress on sexual conversion rates is positive (enhancement) or negative (reduction) also remains controversial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Buckling et al., 1999a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Buckling et al., 1999b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Buckling et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Koepfli and Yan, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Peatey et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Schneider et al., 2018</xref>). Evolutionary theory for life histories predicts that treatment with low doses of antimalarial drugs results in reproductive restraint (reduced sexual conversion) to facilitate within-host survival, whereas treatment with high doses that kill the majority of the parasites elicits terminal investment (increased sexual conversion). The results of a recent study using a murine model of malaria were consistent with this prediction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Schneider et al., 2018</xref>). Our experiments with in vitro cultured <italic>P. falciparum</italic> exposed to low doses of DHA at the ring stage were also consistent with these prediction, as this resulted in moderately reduced sexual conversion rates. In contrast, experiments in which a pulse of DHA or CQ at a low dose was administered at the trophozoite stage showed the opposite trend, such that the subcurative treatment stimulated sexual conversion. This latter result is in line with some previous studies using <italic>P. falciparum</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Buckling et al., 1999b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Peatey et al., 2009</xref>) or a murine malaria model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Buckling et al., 1999a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Buckling et al., 1997</xref>). A possible explanation for the discrepancy with the predictions of evolutionary theory (when exposure occurs at the trophozoite stage) is that in the absence of stress, sexual conversion in <italic>P. falciparum</italic> is already restrained, with estimated conversion rates of ~1% in human infections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Cao et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Eichner et al., 2001</xref>). Thus, a further reduction of the investment in transmission upon exposure to low drug doses would not have a substantial impact on within-host survival, implying that this response would not provide a selective advantage, whereas the opposite response can enhance the chances of transmission. Of note, the absence of LysoPC and choline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Brancucci et al., 2017</xref>), or heat shock, all of which reduce the multiplication rate of <italic>P. falciparum</italic> cultures and therefore can also be considered as sublethal stress signals, also stimulate sexual conversion. Together, the results of experiments with <italic>P. falciparum</italic> cultures exposed to low level of stress at the trophozoite stage do not support the predictions of evolutionary theory, whereas for murine malaria parasites different studies reported conflicting results. In this regard, it is possible that different <italic>Plasmodium</italic> species use different strategies to adjust sexual conversion rates upon stress: although the role of AP2-G as the master regulator of sexual conversion appears to be widely conserved in all malaria parasite species, upstream events involved in the regulation of sexual conversion are remarkably different between human and murine parasites. The latter show higher conversion rates, do not alter sexual conversion in response to LysoPC restriction, and their genomes lack a <italic>gdv1</italic> ortholog (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Ngotho et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Our experiments establish that sexual conversion can be stimulated by exposure to DHA at the trophozoite stage, but not at the early ring stage. Of note, stimulation of sexual conversion by depletion of choline (as a proxy for LysoPC depletion) or by exposure to CQ shows a similar stage dependency, suggesting that the ring stage is largely insensitive to stimulation of sexual conversion. At the ring stage, some types of stress, such as exposure to DHA, may induce latency of a rather small fraction of the parasites as a means of population survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Barrett et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Talman et al., 2019</xref>), rather than enhancing sexual conversion. Furthermore, we found that in cultures in which sexual conversion is stimulated by choline depletion, it cannot be further stimulated by drugs, such that there are no additive or synergistic effects between drugs and choline depletion. Together, these observations suggest that the different stimuli converge into the same mechanism of <italic>pfap2-g</italic> activation, which likely involves cellular components that are absent during the ring stage. Because stimulation of sexual conversion by choline depletion has been shown to involve GDV1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Filarsky et al., 2018</xref>), which is only expressed in the second half of the intraerythrocytic development cycle and is absent from ring stage parasites, we hypothesize that stimulation by DHA may also depend on GDV1. A possible explanation for the similar effects of DHA and choline depletion on sexual conversion is that treatment with DHA may result in choline depletion: DHA induces damage on membrane lipids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hartwig et al., 2009</xref>), which may increase the use of LysoPC or choline, resulting in a reduction of their levels. However, heat shock, a completely different type of stress that is not known or predicted to affect LysoPC or choline levels, also enhanced sexual conversion. This result suggests that stimulation of sexual conversion can occur without the involvement of choline metabolism. As an alternative model, parasites may be able to sense a state of mild to moderate ‘stress’ or growth restriction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Schneider et al., 2018</xref>): the drug doses that result in increased sexual conversion, as well as LysoPC or choline restriction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Brancucci et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Portugaliza et al., 2019</xref>) and heat shock, were all associated with a &lt; 50% reduction of growth rates. The observation that a 2 nM pulse of DHA, which does not have any measurable effect on parasite survival, appears to stimulate sexual conversion may indicate that sexual conversion is triggered by the response associated with moderate stress, rather than by growth restriction per se. In this regard, activation of the cellular stress response has been proposed to be associated with enhanced gametocyte production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Chaubey et al., 2014</xref>), and DHA triggers such a stress response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Bridgford et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Zhang et al., 2017</xref>). Further research is needed to establish the molecular mechanisms underlying the modulation of sexual conversion rates by different environmental conditions.</p><p>Altogether, here we provide a detailed characterization of the changes in <italic>P. falciparum</italic> sexual conversion rates that occur in response to a pulse of DHA. We demonstrate remarkable plasticity in sexual conversion rates, and a complex response that depends on the stage of the parasites at the time when they are exposed to the drug, the drug dose, and the metabolic state (presence or absence of choline). This complex scenario may explain the discrepant results obtained by previous studies. The assay that we have developed to test the impact of DHA on sexual conversion rates can be used to test the impact of any other drug or condition, as shown here for CQ and heat shock. Of note, the success of malaria elimination efforts largely depends on the ability to reduce or interrupt transmission. Although our results are not of immediate public health concern because the overall impact of treatment with ACTs is a reduction of the transmission potential, at least when compared with other drugs, the capacity of ARTs to induce sexual conversion must be taken into account. Otherwise, under certain conditions, treatment may result in an increase in transmission that could jeopardize efforts to eliminate malaria.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type <break/>(species) or <break/>resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or <break/>reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Gene (<italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic>)</td><td><italic>pfap2-g</italic></td><td>PlasmoDB</td><td>PF3D7_1222600</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Gene (<italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic>)</td><td><italic>gexp02</italic></td><td>PlasmoDB</td><td>PF3D7_1102500</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Cell line (<italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic>)</td><td><italic>NF54-gexp02-Tom</italic></td><td>PMID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31601834">31601834</ext-link></td><td/><td>Maintained in culture with 2 mM choline</td></tr><tr><td>Cell line (<italic>Plasmodium</italic> <break/><italic>falciparum</italic>)</td><td><italic>E5-gexp02-Tom</italic></td><td>PMID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31601834">31601834</ext-link></td><td/><td>Maintained in culture with 2 mM choline</td></tr><tr><td>Cell line (<italic>Plasmodium</italic> <break/><italic>falciparum</italic>)</td><td><italic>NF54-10.3-Tom</italic></td><td>PMID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31601834">31601834</ext-link></td><td/><td>Maintained in culture with 2 mM choline</td></tr><tr><td>Commercial assay or kit</td><td>RNeasy Mini Kit</td><td>Qiagen</td><td>Cat.

Erythrocytes were obtained from the Catalan official blood bank (Banc de Sang i Teixits). To obtain cultures of a well-defined age window, we used Percoll/sorbitol synchronization. In brief, Percoll-purified schizonts were used to establish a fresh culture that 5 or 10 hr later was subjected to 5% D-sorbitol lysis to obtain cultures of a defined 0–5 or 0–10 hpi age window. For heat shock experiments, synchronized cultures at the trophozoite stage were transferred for 3 hr to an incubator at 41.5°C and then placed back at 37°C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Rovira-Graells et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Cultures for the production of mature gametocytes for mosquito infection were maintained in a semi-automated shaker incubator system as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Mogollon et al., 2016</xref>).

Drug pulses with DHA (Sigma-Aldrich no. D7439) or CQ (Sigma-Aldrich no.

We define day 0 (D0) as the first day of the next cycle after drug exposure, which corresponds to the first day of Generation one in the schematics in the figures. D1 corresponds to the day when new sexual parasites become stage I gametocytes. When using the <italic>NF54-gexp02-Tom</italic> and <italic>E5-gexp02-Tom</italic> lines, the sexual conversion rate was calculated as the sexual stage parasitemia divided by the total (sexual + asexual) parasitemia, and expressed as percentage. Asexual and sexual parasites were quantified by flow cytometry at ~30–35 hpi or ~30–40 hpi (D1) of the cycle after drug treatment, in the absence of chemicals that inhibit asexual replication. When using the <italic>NF54-10.3-Tom</italic> line, the sexual conversion rate was measured by dividing the gametocytemia on day 3 (D3) by the initial ring stage parasitemia on D0. In this case, cultures were treated with 50 mM N-acetyl-D-glucosamine (GlcNAc; Sigma-Aldrich no. A8625) from D1 onwards to inhibit asexual replication. In experiments with the <italic>NF54-10.3-Tom</italic> line, gametocytemia was also measured on D0 to identify gametocytes already present in the culture at the beginning of the experiment, but it was found to be negligible. In any case, it was subtracted from D3 gametocytemia, such that only gametocytes newly formed during the assay were considered. Unless otherwise indicated, statistical analysis of differences in sexual conversion was performed using one-way ANOVA with Tukey HSD as the post hoc test. Variance was assumed to be homogenous because the sample size was the same for all groups, and they contain the same type of data.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Flow cytometry</title><p>Flow cytometry analysis to measure parasitemia at the cycle of drug exposure was performed using the nucleic acid stain SYTO 11 (0.016 μM) (Life Technologies no.

To measure asexual and tdTomato-positive sexual parasites, we used a BD LSRFortessa machine as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Portugaliza et al., 2019</xref>), with small modifications after the addition of the mitochondrial membrane potential MitoTracker Deep Red FM fluorescent dye (Invitrogen no.M22426) at 0.6 µM to identify live parasites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s7">Figure 1—figure supplements 7</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s8">8</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Amaratunga et al., 2014</xref>). Briefly, the erythrocyte population was defined using the side scatter area (SCC-A) versus forward scatter area (FSC-A) plot, followed by singlet gating using the forward scatter height (FSC-H) versus FSC-A plot. From the singlet population, the parasites were simultaneously analyzed for tdTomato fluorescence (laser: 561 nm; filter: 582/15; power: 50 mW), SYTO 11 fluorescence (laser: 488 nm; Filter: 525/50-505LP; power: 50 mW), and MitoTracker fluorescence (laser: 640 nm; Filter: 670/14-A; power: 40 mW).

malaria parasites from humans to mosquitoes depends on the formation of sexual blood stages, the gametocytes. Here, Portugaliza et al., capitalize on reporter parasite lines expressing fluorescence markers in early gametocytes to measure the effects of artemisinin, the front-line antimalarial drug, on <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> sexual conversion. The study reveals that exposure to subcurative doses of dihydroartemisinin stimulates parasite sexual conversion, in a dose and stage-dependent manner. This work illustrates the complex interplay between drug exposure, parasite stage and metabolic conditions in the trade-off between asexual proliferation and formation of transmission forms.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Artemisinin exposure at the trophozoite stage enhances sexual conversion in the malaria parasite <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic>&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Dominique Soldati-Favre as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Catherine Lavazec (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>As the editors have judged that your manuscript is of interest, but as described below that additional experiments are required before it is published, we would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). First, because many researchers have temporarily lost access to the labs, we will give authors as much time as they need to submit revised manuscripts. We are also offering, if you choose, to post the manuscript to bioRxiv (if it is not already there) along with this decision letter and a formal designation that the manuscript is &quot;in revision at <italic>eLife</italic>&quot;. Please let us know if you would like to pursue this option. (If your work is more suitable for medRxiv, you will need to post the preprint yourself, as the mechanisms for us to do so are still in development.)</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This is an interesting and well-presented study showing that exposure to subcurative doses of antimalarial drugs stimulates sexual conversion in the malaria parasite <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic>.</p><p>The authors exploited recently published gametocyte-reporter parasite lines to measure the impact of drug treatment on sexual conversion in <italic>P. falciparum</italic> cultures. They found that exposure to subcurative doses of dihydroartemisinin at the trophozoite stage results in an increase in sexual conversion, mimicking depletion of choline in the culture medium. This effect is associated with an upregulation of AP2G, the master regulator of sexual conversion. Sexual conversion is also enhanced by exposure to another antimalarial drug, chloroquine, albeit to a lesser extent. In contrast, the ring stage appears to be insensitive to sexual conversion stimulation by artemisinin or choline depletion.</p><p>Stress, including drug-induced stress, is known to stimulate sexual conversion in <italic>P. falciparum</italic>, so the conceptual novelty is somewhat limited.

DHA arrests ring stages before killing them, so DHA-treated rings might require a longer latent period before conversion to gametocyte. The authors should measure conversion at least 24-48hours after their measurement for DHA-treated trophozoites. In Figure 2, Did the authors test other concentrations of DHA on rings? Since they show that the DHA effect at the trophozoite stage is dose-dependent, one may expect that DHA affects the sexual conversion at the ring stage with concentrations higher than 10 nM.</p><p>2) Assessment of sexual conversion.</p><p>It is not clear how and when the total % of gametocytes was measured following drug treatments (data presented in Figure 1E and Figure 2E) and whether DHA increases both the proportion of early gametocyte and subsequent development into mature gametocyte after 10-14 days or if this increase was driven merely by a reduction in asexual forms or increased RBC lysis following drug exposure. In this study, and in the previous article by Portugaliza et al., (2019), the authors define the sexual conversion rate as the proportion of parasites that convert into sexual forms at each replicative cycle, which can be estimated as the gametocytemia divided by the initial parasitemia. This is indeed how the authors calculated the sexual conversion rate when using the NF54-10.3-Tom line (measured by dividing the gametocytemia on day 3 (D3) by the initial ring stage parasitemia on D0). However, when using the NF54-gexp02-Tom reporter line, the authors used another calculation (subsection “Determination of sexual conversion rates”) (&quot;the sexual conversion rate was calculated as the sexual stage parasitemia divided by the total (sexual + asexual) parasitemia, and expressed as percentage&quot;). This corresponds to the proportion of gametocytes and not exactly to the sexual conversion rate, which is over-estimated when the number of asexual parasites is reduced due to the effects of the drug. Therefore, the axis label in graphs 1D, 2D, 3B, 4B, 5C, etc…should be changed to something like &quot;proportion of gametocytes&quot;. The authors should consider using a more accurate calculation of the sexual conversion, as they did in their 2019 paper with the NF54-gexp02-Tom parasites or in this study with the NF54-10.3-Tom.</p><p>3) A major question is whether DHA exposure induction of sexual conversion is via a choline-dependent or independent pathway. Choline depletion induces sexual conversion and may present as a confounding effect in DHA treated trophozoites since DHA alkylates lipids, especially in trophozoites. Choline measurements should have been done in the DHA or CQ treated parasites.</p><p>4) It seems that only one single transmission experiment was performed (Supplementary figure 5), with a very small number of mosquitoes. The authors should repeat this experiment to strengthen the conclusion that ART enhances production of functional gametocytes.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.60058.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Summary:</p><p>This is an interesting and well-presented study showing that exposure to subcurative doses of antimalarial drugs stimulates sexual conversion in the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum.</p><p>The authors exploited recently published gametocyte-reporter parasite lines to measure the impact of drug treatment on sexual conversion in P. falciparum cultures.

Thus, whether or not drugs can induce sexual conversion remains a highly controversial subject that we hope to settle with our approach and the data presented in this manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Effect on ring stages</p><p>A main novel finding here is that ring stages of Pf are refractory to sexual conversion following drug and metabolic changes.

We measured gametocytemia by flow cytometry at ~24 and ~48 hpi of the next multiplication cycle. These experiments did not reveal any difference between sexual conversion rates determined at the two time points (new Figure 3—figure supplement 3), indicating that the reduction in sexual conversion after DHA exposure at the ring stage is not attributable to a slowdown of sexual development or conversion in DHA-treated cultures. This is now discussed in the text (subsection “DHA exposure at the ring stage does not enhance sexual conversion”). We also tested the effect of exposing parasites at the ring stage to higher DHA concentrations, as suggested by the reviewers, and found that sexual conversion rates progressively decrease with higher DHA concentration (data included in the new Figure 3—figure supplement 3, and described in subsection “DHA exposure at the ring stage does not enhance sexual conversion”).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Assessment of sexual conversion.</p><p>It is not clear how and when the total % of gametocytes was measured following drug treatments (data presented in Figure 1E and Figure 2E) and whether DHA increases both the proportion of early gametocyte and subsequent development into mature gametocyte after 10-14 days or if this increase was driven merely by a reduction in asexual forms or increased RBC lysis following drug exposure.

From the reviewers’ comments we feel that we did not explain our methods with sufficient clarity in the first version of the manuscript. Therefore, we have now added Figure 1—figure supplement 1 in which the different methods that we used to determine sexual conversion rates are described in detail.</p><p>In all of our approaches and with all parasite lines, the determination involves calculating the proportion of Generation 1 parasites that develop into sexual forms (Generation 0 are the parasites that are exposed to the different conditions and Generation 1 are the parasites of the next cycle), as in our previous studies. Please note that the “total (asexual + sexual) parasitemia” used in experiments with the <italic>gexp02-Tom</italic> reporter lines is indeed equivalent to the “initial ring stage parasitemia on Day 0” used with other parasite lines (see Figure 1—figure supplement 1). Gametocytemia was measured at different times depending on the marker used, but given that gametocytes are non-replicating, this does not affect the determination of sexual conversion rates. Using the <italic>gexp02-tdTom</italic> line we previously showed that gametocytemia is stable between 10-15 and 96-101 hpi, such that sexual conversion rates determined by analysis at these different times were almost identical (Portugaliza et al., 2019).</p><p>Regarding the question of how and when parasitemia and gametocytemia were determined in Figure 1E and Figure 3E, they were determined by flow cytometry in Generation 1. Values in panels E are from the same flow cytometry determination used to calculate conversion rates, which was performed at the time indicated in the schematic (panel A) included in each figure. To make this more clear, we have included this information in several figure legends (Figure 1E, Figure 3E, Figure 4C, Figure 5C, Figure 6D and several Supplementary figures) and in Results sectionsubsection “Exposure to DHA at the trophozoite stage enhances sexual conversion”. Figure 1E shows that the increase in the sexual conversion rate shown in Figure 1D does not result merely from a reduction in asexual forms, but rather from a net increase in gametocytemia, as explained in the text (subsection “Exposure to DHA at the trophozoite stage enhances sexual conversion”). No erythrocyte lysis was observed in any of our experiments at any of the drug concentrations tested.</p><p>Furthermore, as part of the mosquito infection experiments (new Figure 2, see below), we measured gametocytemia on day ≥10, and found that the observed increase in sexual conversion rate and early gametocytemia in DHA-treated cultures (pulse at the trophozoite stage) results in an increase in gametocytemia measured at day ≥10 (mature gametocytes).</p><p>We hope that the new figure and the changes in the figure legends and the text make our methods to determine the sexual conversion rate more clear, and the reviewers agree that the labeling of the axis is correct in all figures.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) A major question is whether DHA exposure induction of sexual conversion is via a choline-dependent or independent pathway. Choline depletion induces sexual conversion and may present as a confounding effect in DHA treated trophozoites since DHA alkylates lipids, especially in trophozoites. Choline measurements should have been done in the DHA or CQ treated parasites.</p></disp-quote><p>We fully agree with the reviewers that understanding the mechanism of stimulation of sexual conversion by DHA and the potential involvement of LysoPC/ choline in this mechanism would be of great interest, but we consider that this is beyond the scope of this manuscript. In addition, addressing this molecular mechanism would involve using metabolomics techniques that are not established technologies in our laboratories (e.g., mass spectrometry determination of the metabolites in the biochemical pathways in which choline and LysoPC are involved). This would be a full new study in itself, because to address the mechanism meaningfully these experiments should be performed under different conditions and at multiple stages. We hope that the reviewers agree that the publication of our findings, including the first comprehensive characterization of the effect of DHA on sexual conversion, should not be delayed to perform experiments on the underlying mechanisms, which should be the subject of future investigations.</p><p>However, we have performed a new set of experiments in which we found that a heat shock at the trophozoite stage also enhances sexual conversion. While we are aware that these experiments do not directly address the mechanism of induction of sexual conversion by DHA, these observations suggest that sexual conversion can be stimulated by types of stress that are not known or predicted to have an impact on choline levels. We have included these new results in the manuscript (new Figure 7, described and discussed in the Discussion section).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) It seems that only one single transmission experiment was performed (Figure S5), with a very small number of mosquitoes. The authors should repeat this experiment to strengthen the conclusion that ART enhances production of functional gametocytes.</p></disp-quote><p>We performed new mosquito infection experiments that confirmed the idea that gametocytes produced from DHA-treated cultures are fully viable and infectious. In these experiments we observed an increase in the number of mature gametocytes and exflagellating centers in cultures treated with 5 nM DHA, following the increase in sexual conversion (relative to control cultures). In addition, when mosquitoes were fed with these cultures, an increase in the number of oocysts per mosquito and sporozoites per mosquito (relative to control cultures) was observed. The data from these additional experiments strongly suggests that exposure to low concentration DHA at the trophozoite stage enhances not only sexual conversion but also transmission to mosquitoes. The new results are presented in the new main Figure 2 and described in subsection “Exposure to DHA at the trophozoite stage enhances sexual conversion”.</p></body></sub-article></article>
