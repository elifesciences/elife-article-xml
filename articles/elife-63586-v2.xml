To produce high-affinity peptides, we previously isolated autonomous 3–6 kDa knob domains from bovine antibodies. Here, we show that binding of four knob domain peptides elicits a range of effects on the clinically validated drug target complement C5. Allosteric mechanisms predominated, with one peptide selectively inhibiting C5 cleavage by the alternative pathway C5 convertase, revealing a targetable mechanistic difference between the classical and alternative pathway C5 convertases. Taking a hybrid biophysical approach, we present C5-knob domain co-crystal structures and, by solution methods, observed allosteric effects propagating &gt;50 Å from the binding sites. This study expands the therapeutic scope of C5, presents new inhibitors, and introduces knob domains as new, low molecular weight antibody fragments, with therapeutic potential.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Antibodies are proteins produced by the immune system that can selectively bind to other molecules and modify their behaviour. Cows are highly equipped at fighting-off disease-causing microbes due to the unique shape of some of their antibodies. Unlike other jawed vertebrates, cows’ antibodies contain an ultra-long loop region that contains a ‘knob domain’ which sticks out from the rest of the antibody. Recent research has shown that when detached, the knob domain behaves like an antibody fragment, and can independently bind to a range of different proteins.</p><p>Antibody fragments are commonly developed in the laboratory to target proteins associated with certain diseases, such as arthritis and cancer. But it was unclear whether the knob domains from cows’ antibodies could also have therapeutic potential. To investigate this, Macpherson et al. studied how knob domains attach to complement C5, a protein in the inflammatory pathway which is a drug target for various diseases, including severe COVID-19.</p><p>The experiments identified various knob domains that bind to complement C5 and inhibits its activity by altering its structure or movement. Further tests studying the structure of these interactions, led to the discovery of a common mechanism by which inhibitors can modify the behaviour of this inflammatory protein.</p><p>Complement C5 is involved in numerous molecular pathways in the immune system, which means many of the drugs developed to inhibit its activity can also leave patients vulnerable to infection. However, one of the knob domains identified by Macpherson et al. was found to reduce the activity of complement C5 in some pathways, whilst leaving other pathways intact. This could potentially reduce the risk of bacterial infections which sometimes arise following treatment with these types of inhibitors.</p><p>These findings highlight a new approach for developing drug inhibitors for complement C5. Furthermore, the ability of knob domains to bind to multiple sites of complement C5 suggests that this fragment could be used to target proteins associated with other diseases.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>complement C5</kwd><kwd>bovine immunoglobulin</kwd><kwd>knob-domain peptides</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><funding-statement>No external funding was received for this work.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Structural and functional analysis of a new class of low-molecular-weight antibody fragments, derived from bovine immunoglobulins, reveals their therapeutic potential against C5, a target for refractory inflammatory diseases.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>By the end of 2019, over 60 peptide drugs have received regulatory approval, with an estimated 400 more in active development globally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lau and Dunn, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lee et al., 2019</xref>). As a potential route to discover therapeutic peptides, we previously reported a method for deriving peptides from the ultra-long heavy chain complementarity determining region 3 (ul-CDRH3), which are unique to a subset of bovine antibodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Macpherson et al., 2020</xref>). We have shown that knob domains, a cysteine-rich mini-domain common to all ul-CDRH3, can bind antigen autonomously when removed from the antibody scaffold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Macpherson et al., 2020</xref>). This allows peptide affinity maturation to be performed in vivo, harnessing the cow’s immune system to produce peptides with complex stabilising networks of disulphide bonds.</p><p>For the discovery of knob domain peptides, immunisation of cattle is followed by cell sorting of B-cells using fluorescently labelled antigen. A library of antigen-specific CDRH3 sequences is created by performing a reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT PCR) on the B-cell lysate, followed by a PCR using primers specific to the conserved framework regions which flank CDRH3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Macpherson et al., 2020</xref>). Upon sequencing, ul-CDRH3s are immediately evident and the knob domains can be expressed recombinantly as cleavable fusion proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Macpherson et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>This method for the discovery of knob domain peptides was established using complement component C5, and we reported peptides which bound C5 with affinities in the pM–low nM range (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Macpherson et al., 2020</xref>). Herein, we use these novel peptides to probe the structural and functional aspects of C5 activation.</p><p>C5 is the éminence grise of the complement cascade’s druggable proteins, and the target of effective therapies for diseases with pathogenic complement dysregulation, of which paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Rother et al., 2007</xref>) and atypical haemolytic uraemic syndrome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Nürnberger et al., 2009</xref>) are notable examples. Six monoclonal antibodies targeting C5 have reached, or are entering, clinical trials, closely followed by C5-targeting immune evasion molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Romay-Penabad et al., 2014</xref>), aptamers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Biesecker et al., 1999</xref>), cyclic peptides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Ricardo et al., 2014</xref>), interfering RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Borodovsky et al., 2014</xref>), and small molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jendza et al., 2019</xref>). Currently, C5 inhibitors are being trialled for the treatment of acute respiratory distress syndrome arising from severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Smith et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Wilkinson et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Zelek et al., 2020</xref>) and for the neuromuscular disease myasthenia gravis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Albazli et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>C5 is the principal effector of the terminal portion of the complement cascade. At high local C3b concentrations, arising from activation of either or both of the classical (CP) and mannose binding lectin (LP) pathways, aided by the amplificatory alternative pathway (AP), C5 is cleaved into two moieties with distinct biological functions. Cleavage is performed by two convertases: C4bC2aC3b, formed in response to CP or LP activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Takata et al., 1987</xref>) (henceforth the CP C5 convertase), and C3bBbC3b, formed in response to AP activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">DiScipio, 1981</xref>) (henceforth the AP C5 convertase). Although the constitutive components of the C5 convertases differ, they are thought to be mechanistically identical. Once cleaved, the C5a fragment is the most proinflammatory anaphylatoxin derived from the complement cascade. When signalling through C5aR1 and C5aR2, C5a is a strong chemoattractant recruiting neutrophils, eosinophils, monocytes, and T lymphocytes to sites of complement activation, whereupon it activates phagocytic cells, prompting degranulation. C5b, meanwhile, interacts with C6, recruiting C7–C9 to form the terminal C5b-9 complement complex or TCC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lachmann and Thompson, 1970</xref>). Once inserted into a cell membrane, the TCC is referred to as the membrane attack complex (MAC), a membrane-spanning pore which can lyse sensitive cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Götze and Müller-Eberhard, 1970</xref>).</p><p>Aspects of the structural biology of C5 are well understood due to a crystal structure of the apo form (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fredslund et al., 2008</xref>) and a number of co-crystal structures of C5 with various modulators. By virtue of its constitutive role in the terminal pathway, C5 is a recurrent target for immune evasion molecules and structures have been determined of C5 in complex with an inhibitory molecule derived from <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic>, SSL-7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Laursen et al., 2010</xref>), as well as several structurally distinct examples from ticks: OmCI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Jore et al., 2016</xref>), RaCI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Jore et al., 2016</xref>), and Cirp-T (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Reichhardt et al., 2020</xref>). Additionally, the structures of C5 with the inhibitory monoclonal antibody (mAb) eculizumab (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Schatz-Jakobsen et al., 2016</xref>), of C5 with a small molecule inhibitor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jendza et al., 2019</xref>), and of C5 with the complement-depleting agent cobra venom factor (CVF) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Laursen et al., 2011</xref>) have all been determined.</p><p>Here, we probe C5 with knob domain peptides and explore the molecular processes which underpin allosteric modulation of this important drug target.

Using this approach, we obtained four knob domain peptides: K8, K57, K92, and K149, which we have shown to display tight binding to human C5. Previously we reported equilibrium dissociation constants of 17.8 nM for K8, 1.4 nM for K57, &lt;0.6 nM for K92, and 15.5 nM for K149 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Macpherson et al., 2020</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Functional characterisation of anti-C5 bovine knob domain peptides</title><p>For functional characterisation of the peptides, we performed complement assays for CP and AP activation in human serum, assessing C5b neo-epitope formation and C5a release (schematically presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A, B</xref>), in combination with orthogonal ELISAs, measuring C3b and C9 deposition. Here, we show that K57 was a potent and fully efficacious inhibitor of C5 activation, preventing release of C5a, and deposition of C5b and C9. As expected, there was no effect on C3b, which is upstream of C5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C, D</xref>). In contrast, K149 was a high-affinity silent binder with no discernible effect on C5a release, formation of C5b neo-epitope or C9 deposition, even at peptide concentrations in excess of 100 × K<sub>D</sub> (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref> Section 1).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Functional modulation of C5 via knob domain peptides.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) shows an abridged schematic for classical pathway (CP) activation. Following activation of C1q via antibody Fc, C4 and C2 are cleaved and form C4bC2a (the CP C3 convertase) which cleaves C3 into C3a (not shown) and C3b. At high C3b concentrations, C4bC2aC3b (the CP C3 convertase) forms and cleaves C5 into C5a and C5b. C5b associates with C6 and forms the membrane attack complex (MAC) with C7, C8, and multiple copies of C9. (<bold>B</bold>) shows an abridged schematic for surface phase alternative pathway (AP) activation in assays (where generation of C3b from the CP/LP is virtually excluded); tick-over of C3 generates C3a (not shown) and C3b. In the presence of factor B and factor D, C3bBb (the AP C3 convertase) generates additional C3b, prompting formation of C3bBbC3b (the AP C5 convertase), which cleaves C5 into C5a and C5b, driving MAC formation. CP-driven ELISAs (<bold>C</bold>) and AP-driven ELISAs (<bold>D</bold>) are shown. For both pathways, the inhibition of C3d (the surface-associated domain of C3b, which is upstream of C5 inhibition), C5a release, and C5b neo-epitope formation and C9 deposition were tracked within the MAC. Haemolysis assays with sheep erythrocytes, for the CP (<bold>E</bold>), and rabbit erythrocytes, for the AP (<bold>F</bold>), show that K57 is a potent and efficacious inhibitor of both pathways. K92 is selective, partial antagonist of the AP, while K8 is a weak antagonist of the CP but did not show efficacy in the AP haemolysis assay, below 10 µM. For the AP assays, 5% serum (v/v) gives a putative C5 concentration of 20 nM. For the CP assays, 1% serum (v/v) gives a putative C5 concentration of 4 nM, based on a reported C5 serum concentration of 397 nM/75 µg/mL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Sjöholm, 1975</xref>).</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-63586-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig><p>K8 and K92 exerted more nuanced allosteric effects on C5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C, D</xref>). By ELISA, K92 partially prevented C5 activation by the AP, but, intriguingly, no effect was observed in CP assays, suggesting K92 selectively inhibits C5 activation by the AP C5 convertase, but not the CP C5 convertase. Partial antagonists, where the degree of inhibition for the asymptotic concentrations of a dose–response curve (E<sub>max</sub>) is below 100%, are an impossible mode of pharmacology for orthosteric antagonists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Klein et al., 2013</xref>), and we therefore propose that K92 operates by a non-steric mechanism. K8 was also demonstrably allosteric, partially inhibiting both the AP and CP in ELISA experiments. For K8 and K92, no effect on C3b deposition was detected.</p><p>When tested in CP and AP haemolysis assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E, F</xref>), K57 was a potent and fully efficacious inhibitor of complement-mediated cell lysis. Consistent with the ELISA data, K92 was active solely in the AP-driven haemolysis assay, achieving E<sub>max</sub> values of 30–40%; while K8 was efficacious in the CP assay but did not show activity in the AP assay below 10 µM, potentially a consequence of the increased serum concentration and stringency of the haemolysis endpoint.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Cooperativity in C5 binding by knob domain peptides</title><p>To test for cross blocking, arising from overlapping epitopes, or cooperativity between knob domains, we performed a surface plasmon resonance (SPR) cross blocking experiment, where, using a Biacore 8K, we saturated a C5-coated sensor chip with two 20 µM injections of knob domain peptide before injecting a different peptide at 20 µM to assess its capacity to bind.

We have shown that K92 is not an orthosteric inhibitor of either the CP or the AP convertase, thereby precluding binding of the convertase to a cleft between the MG1–MG5 domains. As the K92 epitope is entirely contained within the SSL7 binding site, this is compatible with the CVF model for C5 activation, with a co-crystal structure of the ternary complex of C5, CVF, and SSL7 (PDB accession code 3PRX6), demonstrating that the CVF and SSL7 binding sites do not cross block. Also consistent with the CVF model for C5 activation, binding of K8 to the MG8 domain would not appear to sterically block the catalytic unit. We therefore sought to further explore the apparent conformational changes in our structures.</p></sec><sec id="s2-9"><title>Solution techniques reveal allosteric networks</title><p>To validate the apparent conformational changes occurring in C5 due to the binding of K8 and K92 as revealed by our crystal structures, we analysed the C5-knob domain complexes by two-solution biophysical techniques – small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) and hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometry (HDX-MS).</p><p>SEC-SAXS, where size exclusion chromatography (SEC) immediately precedes the solution X-ray experiment ensuring a monodispersed sample, was performed in concert with SEC multi-angle laser light scattering (SEC-MALLS).

For K92 and K57, the discrepancies observed in the mid s range indicate an overall change in flexibility of C5 upon binding of these peptides, and this tuning of dynamics may contribute to their mechanism.</p><p>Consistent with earlier observations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fredslund et al., 2008</xref>), comparison of the C5-apo experimental data with the theoretical scattering curve revealed discrepancies in the lowest angle range, indicating C5 adopts a more elongated conformation in solution than the crystal structure would suggest (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B</xref>). To better approximate C5 in solution, we performed a normal mode model analysis (NMA) using SREFLEX (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Panjkovich and Svergun, 2016</xref>) and found that elongation of the C5 model improved the χ<sup>2</sup> from &gt;13 to 1.55. The fit of the C5-K92 complex was also markedly improved by the NMA, whereby elongation and incorporation of the peptide improved the model from an initial χ² of &gt;20, to 2.5 (with an overall root mean square [RMS] of 3.8 in both cases).</p><p>When using the C5-K8 co-crystal structure for fitting of the C5-K8 SAXS data, the absence of the C345c domain was problematic. The generation of a hybrid model where the C345c domain was reinstated initially produced a poor fit (χ²=75). A restrained rigid body analysis of this model followed by NMA refinement allowed us to significantly reduce the discrepancy to χ²=4.1 indicating an overall acceptable fit. The χ² value is still somewhat larger than those observed for the other complexes, which may suggest an increased flexibility around the C345c linker. This result correlates with the absence of clear electron density for the C345c domain in the crystal structure. The latter may be a consequence of K8 inducing additional flexibility to this region, which again could contribute to the efficacy of the peptide.</p><p>The discrepancies between the crystal structures and the solution scattering data indicate that while permitting elucidation of the molecular interaction of the epitopes, the constraints of the crystal lattice may impede the detection of more subtle, global changes, leading to underestimation of the conformational changes induced by the peptide.</p><p>To further explore such effects in solution, we used HDX-MS to provide molecular-level information on local protein structure and dynamics. HDX-MS measures the exchange of backbone amide hydrogen to deuterium in the solvent, with the rate of HDX determined by solvent accessibility, protein flexibility, and hydrogen bonding. To interpret the impact of peptide binding on C5 structural dynamics, we performed differential HDX (ΔHDX) analysis, comparing C5-knob domain complexes to apo C5, where shielding of C5 residues through participation in a binding interface will prevent deuteration, while conformational changes may increase or decrease deuterium uptake, in relation to the degree of solvent exposure.</p><p>For C5-K8, the sole protected region of C5 corresponded to the epitope on the MG8 domain (L1380<sub>C5</sub>-E1387<sub>C5</sub>), although the interface was not entirely defined (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>, see also <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1,</xref> Table 3.2).

There were also effects distal to the K92 binding site, notably in C5d (I1169<sub>C5</sub>-F1227<sub>C5</sub>) and neighbouring CUB domain (L1303<sub>C5</sub>-L1346<sub>C5</sub>), indicating a K92-induced conformational change. Interestingly, the allosteric network can be visualised by changes in solvent exposure which propagate from the K92 epitope through MG2 domain (L126<sub>C5</sub>-V145<sub>C5</sub>) and into the C5d and CUB domains. For the C5-K57 complex, the absence of a co-crystal structure meant we had no prior knowledge of the K57 epitope. However, clear protection was observed in the MG5 domain, immediately adjacent to the K92 epitope (N483<sub>C5</sub>-L540<sub>C5</sub>), with sparse areas of increased solvent exposure located in the MG6 (Q572<sub>C5</sub>-L590<sub>C5</sub>), MG8 (L1379<sub>C5</sub>-A1388<sub>C5</sub>), and C5d (K1048<sub>C5</sub>-Y1064<sub>C5</sub>) domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>).

Although in the structure of the C5-K92 complex the Bb-cleavage site is more buried compared to that in the C5-K8 complex. Taken in the context of the other changes, notably in the C5d and CUB domains, it is more probable that they affect more global changes in C5 which lower the affinity for C3b or the C5 convertases. The HDX-MS data are in good agreement with our crystallographic data, with the K8 and K92 epitopes defined as clear areas of solvent protection. The conformational change in the C5d domain and significant rotational moment of the C5 α-chain, which were evident upon alignment of the MG1 domain of apo C5 with the C5-K8 and C5-K92 co-crystal structures, also appears to manifest in solution in response to binding of the knob domains.</p></sec><sec id="s2-10"><title>Putative K57 binding site</title><p>To further home in on the K57 binding site, we measured binding to C5b and C5b-6 in an SPR single-cycle kinetics experiment (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1,</xref> Table 4.1). Upon cleavage of C5a, the remaining domains of the α-chain undergo a substantial conformational change, mediated by rearrangement of the MG8, CUB, and C5d domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hadders et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aleshin et al., 2012</xref>). The resulting C5b subunit is metastable and prone to aggregation and decay, which leaves it unable to bind C6 or form the MAC. By SPR, K8 did not bind C5b but could C5b-6. However, K57, K92, and K149 all bound C5b and C5b-6 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref> Table 4.2). For C5b, this was within twofold of their previously published affinities for C5 (17.8 nM for K8, 1.4 nM for K57, and &lt;0.6 nM for K92; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Macpherson et al., 2020</xref>), except for K149, which displayed threefold higher affinity for both C5b and C5b-6 than previously reported for C5 (15.5 nM; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Macpherson et al., 2020</xref>). K92 did exhibit lower affinity for C5b-6 complex than C5, binding the complex at 6.7 nM, relative to &lt;0.6 nM for C5 alone.

Knob domain peptides rely on the bovine immune system to achieve high-affinity binding through optimisation of amino acid composition, 3D structure, and disulphide bond network. They have only been recently isolated as a practicable antibody fragment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Macpherson et al., 2020</xref>), and therefore, structural and functional analysis of the complexes with their clinical targets will greatly aid their development as therapeutics.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Function</title><p>Functional characterisation at the level of individual complement pathways identified K57 as a novel C5 inhibitor, which is a fully efficacious inhibitor of the terminal pathway in response to both CP and AP activation, and a potential therapeutic candidate for complement-mediated disorders, such as paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria and atypical haemolytic uraemic syndrome. Additionally, the discovery of K149 as a ‘silent binder’ of C5 may be of considerable value as a non-inhibitory reagent for the detection of native C5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). K8 and K92 both displayed allosteric inhibitory activity against C5. K92 achieved selective inhibition of the AP through a non-competitive mechanism (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). To our knowledge, this is the first reported example of complement pathway-specific inhibition through C5 and the first experimental evidence reported for mechanistic differences between the AP and CP C5 convertases. This suggests an expanded therapeutic scope for C5, whereby tuning of the conformational ensemble or dynamics with allosteric compounds can bias activation to leave certain complement pathways intact. Complete inhibition of the terminal pathway has been shown to increase the susceptibility of eculizumab patients to <italic>Neisseria meningitidis</italic> infections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">McNamara et al., 2017</xref>). Selective inhibition of C5-cleavage by the AP C5-convertase, and not the CP C5-convertase, may partially preserve serum bactericidal activity, thereby lowering the risk of meningococcal disease.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Structure</title><p>Structural analyses, utilising X-ray crystallography, revealed the unique topologies of knob domain peptides K8 and K92 and their distinctive binding modes in C5. Due to the apparent structural homology of knob domains with certain venomous peptides, of which conotoxins and spider venoms are examples, it has been proposed that the knob domains of ul-CDRH3 might be similarly predisposed to target the concave epitopes of ion channels. Likewise, structural homology with defensin peptides has garnered hypotheses regarding an improved ability to bind viral capsid coats. Indeed, bovine antibodies with ul-CDRH3 have been raised against the viral capsid of HIV with exceptional efficiency, given the challenging nature of the antigen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Sok et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Stanfield et al., 2020</xref>). However, the study presented here shows that, in the case of C5, concave epitopes are not the knob domain’s sole preserve. Notably, the MG8 domain epitope of K8 offers a planar pharmacophore and, while the K92 epitope is more undulating, casual inspection of the C5 structure reveals numerous deeper cavities available (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). This may mean that knob domains can be raised to inhibit flat surfaces involved in protein–protein interactions, which might not offer binding sites for orthosteric small molecules.</p><p>We note that the structural architecture of the knob domains varies for the epitope. Their immune derivation means that, unlike cysteine-rich peptides derived from other natural sources, such as venoms, the bovine immune system can be used to define specificity for any antigen. Comparative structural analysis suggests that knob domain paratopes are differentiated from conventional antibodies and the structures of known cyclic peptides, offering a different binding architecture to other small antibody fragments, such as the camelid VHH. While firm conclusions are hampered by limited examples, the number of interactions does not seem dissimilar from cyclic peptides or mAbs, both of which have been successfully applied to tackling high-affinity protein–protein interactions.</p><p>Our structures demonstrate that the importance of the network of disulphide bonds goes beyond a stabilising role. An apparent paucity of secondary structure would suggest that while stabilisation of the domain is indeed critical, disulphide bonds also participate in sulphur–π interactions to sustain intra- and inter-chain interactions. The structures of knob domains bound to their target antigen demonstrate both the diversity and versatility afforded to the bovine immune repertoire by these sequences.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Mechanism</title><p>Structural alignment of the C5-K92 co-crystal structure with the apo C5 structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>), using the MG5 domain, revealed a rotational movement of the MG1 causing the α-chain to adopt a twisted conformation accompanied by a rotational movement in the C5d domain, in response to knob domain binding. Comparison of the C5-K8 structure with the apo C5 structure revealed a similar conformation but with less movement in the C5d domain. The helical C5d domain is the target of two immune evasion molecules which have evolved in ticks, OmCI and RaCI, both of which inhibit C5 by crosslinking C5d to neighbouring domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Jore et al., 2016</xref>). Additionally, it has been shown that polyclonal antibodies raised against C5d inhibit binding of C5 to C3b (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">DiScipio, 1981</xref>). The binding site of OmCI is contained within the CUB and C5d domains, with only a single, non-bonded interaction to the C345c domain visible in the crystal structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Jore et al., 2016</xref>), which appears mediated by crystal contacts. Interestingly, the C5-OmCI-RaCI crystal structure (PDB accession code 5HCC) reveals similar conformational changes in C5d, relative to the apo C5 structure. We therefore propose that rearrangement of C5d can lower the affinity, or preclude the interaction, of C5 for the convertases and that this may be a common inhibitory mechanism for OmCI, RaCI, K8, and K92. Should K92 and K8 inhibit C5 by modulating the C5d domain, in the case of K92, this occurs at a range of over 50 Å. Such remote effects are not unprecedented; allosteric structural changes can be propagated at over 150 Å in response to drug binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Haselbach et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Subsequent solution biophysics methods substantiate our crystallographic observations. HDX-MS analysis revealed areas of solvent protection changes in the MG8 domain, resulting from the binding of K8, and in the MG1 and MG5 domains of the C5-K92 complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>), corresponding to their respective epitopes, as identified with X-ray crystallography (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) and confirmed by site-directed mutagenesis analysis. Changes in solvent exposure were also observed in the α-chain for C5-K92, providing a route to visualise the allosteric network. As similar conformational or dynamic changes occur both in solution and in the crystal structure, this suggests that the effects are ligand induced and are not the result of crystal packing interactions. SAXS analysis also suggests that K8 and K92 increase the flexibility of C5 and effects on dynamics may be a contributing factor in realising efficacy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>).</p><p>For K57, which had an E<sub>max</sub> of 100% for both pathways and was not demonstrably allosteric, HDX-MS and biacore experiments with the metastable C5b suggested a putative epitope on the MG5 domain. This could support an orthosteric mechanism of action as CVF, which can form a stable C5 convertase, contacts the MG5 domain in the C5-CVF co-crystal structure (PDB accession code 3PVM). However, by SAXS, similar changes in conformation and/or dynamics to the C5-K8 and C5-K92 complexes were apparent and an allosteric network, including changes in the C5d domain, was observed in the C5-K92 complex by HDX-MS. These observations could support an allosteric mechanism for K57.</p><p>Importantly, we also saw a high degree of negative cooperativity between the different knob domains by SPR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), suggesting that all the functional knob domains perturb the conformational state or dynamics of C5. K57 also showed cooperativity with other functional knob domains, suggesting providing further evidence that it stabilises a conformation of C5 that is less energetically favourable for binding of the other ligands.</p><p>Our observations with K92 suggest that further work may be required to elucidate the mechanism of action of another binder of the MG1 and MG5 domains, SSL7. Given that SSL7 can be a partial inhibitor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Laursen et al., 2010</xref>), even with co-binding of IgA, this precludes a steric mechanism and invites biophysical studies in solution. Additionally, another tick-derived inhibitor, Cirp-T, was also recently reported as predominantly binding to the MG4 domain, with an orthosteric mechanism of action attributed. However, we note that published data only showed an E<sub>max</sub> of &lt;90% in AP-driven assays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Reichhardt et al., 2020</xref>), indicating that it is an allosteric C5 inhibitor for the AP, and potentially also the CP, C5 convertase, which may merit further investigation.</p><p>In conclusion, we introduce knob domains as a new peptide modality, with unexplored therapeutic potential for the modulation of proteins and protein–protein interactions. This study is the first application of knob domain peptides and reveals an unexpectedly high incidence of allosteric modulators of complement C5, expanding its scope for complement-targeted therapies and providing important mechanistic tools for the study of C5 convertases. Knob domains can offer a range of advantages over the current macromolecular C5 inhibitors, including their use as peptide therapeutics, while grafting knob domains into the CDRH3 of well-characterised Fabs or using Fc tags could provide routes to extend half-life in vivo by attenuating renal clearance.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Complement proteins</title><p>Human C5 was affinity purified using an E141A, H164A OmCI column (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Macpherson et al., 2018</xref>).

Peptide–serum solutions were then incubated in the wells of microtiter plates for 35 min for CP assays (both C3b and C9 detection) or 35 min for AP (C3b) or 60 min for AP (C9), at 37°C. Complement activation was assessed through detection of deposited complement activation factors using specific antibodies against C3b (rat anti-human C3d HM2198, Hycult, Uden, The Netherlands) and C9 (goat anti-human C9, A226, Complement Technologies Tyler, TX) at a 1:1000 dilution. Bound primary antibodies were detected with horse rdischHRP-conjugated goat anti-rat (ab97057, Abcam, Cambridge, UK) or rabbit anti-goat (P0449, Agilent Dako, Santa Clara, CA) secondary antibodies at a 1:1000 dilution. Bound HRP-conjugated antibodies were detected using TMB One solution (Eco-TEK – manufactured by Bio-TEK, Winooski, VT) with absorbance measured at 450 nm.</p><p>For the C5b ELISA, assays were run using the CP and AP Complement functional ELISA kits (Svar Life Science, Malmö, Sweden). For sample preparation, serum was diluted as per the respective protocol for the CP and AP assays. Serial dilutions of peptides were prepared and allowed to incubate with serum for 15 min at room temperature prior to plating.</p><p>For the C5a ELISA, assays were run using the Complement C5a Human ELISA Kit (Invitrogen, Renfrew, UK). For sample preparation, at the end of the 37°C incubation of the serum/peptide samples on the C5b ELISA plate, 50 µL of the diluted, activated serum was transferred to a C5a ELISA plate containing 50 µL/well of assay buffer. All subsequent experimental steps were performed as described in the protocol.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Haemolysis assays</title><p>GVB<sup>++</sup> or Mg EGTA buffers, which had been supplemented with 2.5% glucose (w/v), were used for the CP and AP assays, respectively. For the AP, 150 µL of rabbit erythrocytes (TCS Biosciences, Botolph Claydon, UK) were washed twice, by addition of 1 mL of buffer and centrifugation at 800 ×<italic>g</italic> for 1 min, and finally resuspended in 500 µL of buffer. For the CP, 150 µL sheep erythrocytes (TCS Biosciences, Botolph Claydon, UK) were washed twice with 1 mL of buffer and sensitised with a 1/1000 dilution of rabbit anti-sheep red blood cell stroma antibody (S1389, Sigma Aldrich, Gillingham, UK). After a 30°C/30 min incubation, with shaking, the cells were rewashed and resuspended with 500 µL of buffer. Serial dilutions of peptide were prepared in the respective buffers and normal human serum was added at 1% for the CP and 4.5% for the AP (corresponding to CH50 of the serum). Also, 90 µL of peptide–serum mixtures were plated into a V-bottom 96-well microtiter plate (Corning) and 10 µL of erythrocytes were added. Plates were incubated for 30 min at 37°C, with shaking.

Overnight dialysis into assay buffer (7.5 mM Tris-HCl, 1.5 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, pH 7.9) was performed using 2 kDa slide-a-lyzer cassettes (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Horsham, UK). Chymotrypsin (sequencing grade, Roche Applied Sciences) was reconstituted to 1 µg/µL in assay buffer, and 5 µL of reconstituted enzyme was added to 80 µL of sample. Once mixed, the sample was incubated at 37°C for 1.5 hr before being quenched with 5 µL of 1% TFA. Samples were diluted 1 in 10 and 5 µL was loaded onto the analytical column.</p><p>Liquid chromatography electrospray ionisation mass spectrometry was acquired using an Ultimate 3000 UHPLC system (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Horsham, UK) coupled with a Q-Exactive Plus Orbitrap (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Horsham, UK). Separations were performed using gradient elution (A: 0.1% formic acid; B: 0.1% formic acid in acetonitrile) on an Acquity UPLC BEH C18 column (130 Å, 1.7 µm, 2.1 × 150 mm; Waters Corp., Milford, MA) with the column temperature maintained at 40°C.</p><p>The following analytical gradient at 0.2 mL/min was used: 1% B was held for 2 min, 1–36% B over 28 min, 36–50% over 5 min, and 50–99% B over 0.5 min. There were sequential wash steps with changes in gradient of 99%–1% B over 0.5 min (at a higher flow rate of 0.5 mL/min) before equilibration at 1% B for 6.5 min (at the original 0.2 mL/min).</p><p>A full MS/dd-MS2 (Top 5) scan was run in positive mode.

The source conditions of the MS were capillary voltage, 3 kV; S-lens RF level, 50; sheath gas flow rate, 25; auxiliary gas flow rate, 10; auxiliary gas heater temperature, 150°C; and the MS inlet capillary was maintained at 320°C.</p><p>Data were acquired using XcaliburTM 4.0 software (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Horsham, UK), and raw files were analysed by peptide mapping analysis using Biopharma Finder 2.0 software (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Horsham, UK) by performing a disulphide bond search with a chymotrypsin (medium specificity) digest against the K92 peptide sequence. Assignments and integrations from Biopharma Finder were filtered to include only peptides identified as containing a single disulphide bond and with an experimental mass within |5| ppm of the theoretical mass. Intensities for all peptides containing the same cysteines pairing were summed and percentages were obtained from the summed against total intensities.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>SPR multicycle kinetics</title><p>Kinetics were measured using a Biacore 8K (GE Healthcare, Amersham, UK) with a CM5 chip, which was prepared as follows: 1-ethyl-3-(−3-dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide hydrochloride (EDC)/N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS) was mixed at 1:1 ratio (flow rate, 10 µL/min; contact time, 30 s), and human C5 at 1 µg/mL in pH 4.5 sodium acetate buffer was injected over flow cell one only (flow rate, 10 µL/min; contact time, 60 s). Final immobilisation levels in the range of 2000–3000 RUs were obtained to yield theoretical Rmax values of ~50–60 RU. Serial dilutions of K8 and K92 knob domains, and various mutants, were prepared in HBS-EP (0.01 M HEPES pH 7.4, 0.15 M NaCl, 3 mM EDTA, 0.005% v/v Surfactant P20) buffer and injected (flow rate, 30 µL/min; contact time, 240 s; dissociation time, 6000 s). After each injection, the surface was regenerated with two sequential injections of 2 M MgCl<sub>2</sub> (flow rate, 30 µL/min; contact time, 30 s). Binding to the reference surface was subtracted, and the data were fitted to a single-site binding model using Biacore evaluation software.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Binding pose metadynamics</title><p>Simulation structures were prepared using Schrodinger’s Maestro Protein preparation wizard. The molecular dynamics runs were performed using the Schrodinger’s default implementation of the binding pose metadynamics with the peptide chain considered in place of a ligand.

Data was collected with inline SEC mode using the Agilent 1260 Infinity II Bio-inert LC. Also, 50 μL of complement component C5 at 31.6 μM (5.96 mg/mL) was injected onto a Superdex 200 Increase 5/150 column (GE Healthcare, Amersham, UK) at a flow rate of 0.35 mL/min. The mobile phase comprised 20 mM Tris pH 7.35, 75 mM NaCl, and 3% glycerol. The column elute was directly streamed to the SAXS capillary cell, and throughout the 15-min run, 900 frames of 1 s exposure were collected. After data reduction and radial averaging, the program CHROMIXS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Panjkovich and Svergun, 2018</xref>) was employed. Around 100 statistically similar buffer frames were selected and used for background subtraction of the sample frames from the chromatographic peak. This results in the final I(s) vs s scattering profiles, where s = 4πsinθ/λ, 2θ is the scattering angle, and λ = 1.24 Å. The scattering data in the momentum transfer range 0.05 &lt; s &lt; 0.32 nm<sup>−1</sup> were collected with a PILATUS 6M pixel detector at a distance of 3.1 m from the sample.</p><p>ATSAS 2.8 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Franke et al., 2017</xref>) was employed for further data analysis and modelling. The program PRIMUS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Konarev et al., 2003</xref>) was used to perform Guinier analysis (lnI(s) versus s<sup>2</sup>) from which the radius of gyration, R<sub>G</sub>, was determined. Distance probability functions, p(r), were calculated using the inverse Fourier transformation method implemented in GNOM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Svergun, 1992</xref>) that provided the maximum particle dimension, D<sub>max</sub>. The concentration-independent molecular weight estimate, MW<sub>VC</sub>, is based on the volume of correlation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Rambo and Tainer, 2013</xref>).

For this, the program partitions the structure into pseudo-domains and hierarchically employs NMA to find the domain rearrangements minimising the discrepancy χ<sup>2</sup> between the SAXS curve computed from the refined model and the experimental data. Because of the absence of electron density for the C345c domain in the C5-K8 complex structure, we included a round of restrained rigid body refinement followed by NMA to obtain an improved fit.</p><p>On the same day, MALLS data were collected with a separate SEC run under the same experimental conditions (set-up, buffer, run parameters, etc.). For this, a Wyatt Technologies miniDAWN TREOS MALLS detector coupled to an OptiLab T-Rex differential refractometer for protein concentration determination (dn/dc was taken as 0.185) was used. The MALLS system was calibrated relative to the scattering from toluene. The MWMALLS distribution of species eluting from the SEC column were determined with the Wyatt ASTRA7 software package.</p><p>The experimental SAXS data and the models derived from them were deposited to the Small Angle Scattering Biological Data Bank (SASBDB accession number SASDJA6).</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Hydrogen/deuterium mass spectrometry</title><p>A 6 µM of C5 was incubated with 10 µM of peptide (K8, K92, or K57) to achieve complex during deuterium exchange conditions. Then, 4 μL of C5 or the C5-peptide complex were diluted into 57 μL of 10 mM phosphate in H<sub>2</sub>O (pH 7.0) or into 10 mM phosphate in D<sub>2</sub>O (pD 7.0) at 25°C. The deuterated samples were then incubated for 0.5, 2, 15, and 60 min at 25°C. After the reaction, all samples were quenched by mixing at 1:1 (v/v) with a quench buffer (4 M guanidine hydrochloride, 250 mM Tris (2-carboxyethyl) phosphine hydrochloride, 100 mM phosphate) at 1°C. The final mixed solution was pH 2.5. The mixture was then immediately injected into the nanoAcquity HDX module (Waters Corp., Milford, MA) for peptic digest using an enzymatic online digestion column (Waters Corp., Milford, MA) in 0.2% formic acid in water at 20°C and with a flow rate of 100 μL/min. All deuterated time points and undeuterated controls were carried out in triplicate with blanks run between each data point.</p><p>Peptide fragments were then trapped using an Acquity BEH C18 1.7 μM VANGUARD chilled pre-column for 3 min. Peptides were eluted into a chilled Acquity UPLC BEH C18 1.7 μm 1.0 × 100 using the following gradient: 0 min, 5% B; 6 min, 35% B; 7 min, 40% B; 8 min, 95% B, 11 min, 5% B; 12 min, 95% B; 13 min, 5% B; 14 min, 9 5% B; and 15 min, 5% B (A: 0.2% HCOOH in H2O; B: 0.2% HCOOH) in acetonitrile. The trap and UPLC columns were both maintained at 0°C. Peptide fragments were ionised by positive electrospray into a Synapt G2-Si mass spectrometer (Waters Corp., Milford, MA). Data acquisition was run in ToF-only mode over an m/z range of 50–2000 Th using an MSE method (low collision energy, 4 V; high collision energy: ramp from 18 V to 40 V). Glu-1-Fibrinopeptide B peptide was used for internal lock mass correction. To avoid significant peptide carry-over between runs, the on-line Enzymate pepsin column (Waters Corp., Milford, MA) was washed three times with pepsin wash (0.8% formic acid, 1.5 M Gu-HCl, 4% MeOH) and a blank run was performed between each sample run.</p><p>MSE data from undeuterated samples of C5 were used for sequence identification using the Waters Protein Lynx Global Server 2.5.1 (PLGS). Ion accounting files for the three control samples were combined into a peptide list imported into DynamX v3.0 software (Waters Corp., Milford, MA). The output peptides were subjected to further filtering in DynamX. Filtering parameters used were minimum and maximum peptide sequence length of 4 and 25, respectively, minimum intensity of 1000, minimum MS/MS products of 2, minimum products per amino acid of 0.2, and a maximum MH + error threshold of 10 ppm. DynamX was used to quantify the isotopic envelopes resulting from deuterium uptake for each peptide at each time point. Furthermore, all the spectra were examined and checked visually to ensure correct assignment of m/z peaks and only peptides with a high signal to noise ratios were used for HDX-MS analysis.</p><p>Following manual filtration in DynamX, confidence intervals for differential HDX-MS (ΔHDX) measurements of individual time point were calculated using Deuteros (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lau et al., 2019</xref>) software. Only peptides which satisfied a ΔHDX confidence interval of 98% were considered significant.

Flow cells were activated using a standard immobilisation protocol: EDC/NHS was mixed at 1:1 ratio (flow rate, 10 µL/min; contact time, 30 s). C5b, at 1 µg/mL, or C5b-6 (Complement Technologies, Tyler, TX), at 2 µg/mL, in pH 4.5 sodium acetate buffer, were immobilised on flow cell two only (flow rate, 10 µL/min; contact time, 420 s).

A final immobilisation level of 500–700 RUs was obtained for C5b and 1000–1150 RUs were obtained for C5b-6. Single-cycle kinetics were measured using a seven-point, threefold serial dilution (spanning a range of 1 µM to 1.4 nM) in HBS-EP buffer (GE Healthcare, Amersham, UK).

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by John Kuriyan as the Reviewing Editor and the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>In this paper the authors present structural and biochemical evidence for how &quot;knob&quot; domain peptides, derived from cow CDR3s, bind to and inhibit complement protein C5.

In particular, mutagenesis studies are conspicuously absent. The two binding sites defined by crystallography are not validated by mutagenesis in the peptides although this appears straightforward with the methodology presented by authors.

The authors manage to fit the data in a reasonable manner by NMA for apo-C5 and C5-K92, but not for K8. It is suggested that flexibility of the C345c domain is the reason. Perhaps the fit to the data can be improved by switching to rigid body refinement, taking into account the known structural properties of C5 and considering the whole ensemble of known C5 conformations as starting model one at a time rather than relying on the NMA approach. If data cannot be fitted by a single model, ensemble optimization perhaps could model the system if C345c flexibility is the only problem. It may also be worth investigating whether the standard deviations for the K8-C5 SEC-SAXS data are correct. In other words, is the high chi<sup>2</sup> value due to an inability to fit the curve or is it due to underestimated standard deviations?</p><p>2) Related to this, and also a serious concern due to the suggested importance of allosteric coupling between the binding sites for the knob peptides, it is surprising that no analysis of the overall conformation of C5-K8 and C5-K92, and comparison with known structures of C5 that clearly exhibit different overall conformations, is presented. Such an analysis would strengthen the manuscript substantially and possibly allow a better interpretation of the SPR and HDX data presented.</p><p>3) The crystal structures presented in this manuscript represent among the first structures of knob peptides derived from bovine immunoglobulins. Unfortunately, the manuscript presents only cursory analysis of the structures. The manuscript can be substantially strengthened by including the following analyses:</p><p>i) The crystal structure of the K92-C5 complex must be better documented. The difference mFo-DFc map presented at 1σ in Figure S2.4 is not that convincing, and 1σ is really low for a difference map whereas the 3σ used for K8-C5 is normal. What is the Rfree increase if K92 is omitted, and what is the average B-factor of K92 compared to that of C5? Is it possible that occupancy is significantly &lt; 1? Perhaps it would be wise to down-weight the details concerning K92 binding and focus on the overall location and effects that can be detected by non-crystallographic methods.</p><p>ii) Structural comparisons with other cysteine-constrained peptides including natural toxins and engineered molecules, e.g, those from peptide libraries.

Because of the enormous diversity of disulfide bonding and loop patterns, immunization of cows present a novel mechanism to identify small, stable, target binding peptides.

The knob domains seem to act as allosteric inhibitors and the structural perturbations by the knob domains strongly suggest long-range allosteric coupling in C5, which informs a new way to control C5.

We anticipated this need and have produced a number of K8 and K92 peptide mutants for a follow-up study, so have been able to include an additional section in the revised manuscript addressing the presentation of these data. As can be seen in the revised manuscript, we have now validated the binding modes observed in the crystal structures of the complexes between C5 and the K8 and K92 peptides. For K8 we assessed R23A and R32A mutants targeting the two salt-bridge interactions with C5. Whilst for R23A we observed only a modest 2-fold reduction in binding, R32A resulted in a &gt;700-fold drop in K<sub>D</sub>. For K92 we targeted an H-bond interaction with C5 sustained by H25 and the neighbouring aromatic residues of the interface with W21A and F26A mutants. Whilst we were unable to produce the H25A mutant, the loss of aromatics in W21A and F26A markedly abridged affinity with an &gt;1200-fold and &gt;45-fold drop in K<sub>D</sub>, respectively.
