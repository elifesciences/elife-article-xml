Here, we performed deep mutational scanning and covariance analysis of two previously proposed self-cleaving ribozymes (LINE-1 and OR4K15). We found that the regions essential for ribozyme activities are made of two short segments, with a total of 35 and 31 nucleotides only. The discovery makes them the simplest known self-cleaving ribozymes. Moreover, the essential regions are circular permutated with two nearly identical catalytic internal loops, supported by two stems of different lengths. These two self-cleaving ribozymes, which are shaped like lanterns, are similar to the catalytic regions of the twister sister ribozymes in terms of sequence and secondary structure. However, the nucleotides at the cleavage site have shown that mutational effects on two twister sister-like (TS-like) ribozymes are different from the twister sister ribozyme. The discovery of TS-like ribozymes reveals a ribozyme class with the simplest and, perhaps, the most primitive structure needed for self-cleavage.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>self-cleaving ribozyme</kwd><kwd>deep mutational scanning</kwd><kwd>RNA structure</kwd><kwd>covariation</kwd><kwd>catalytic RNA</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002858</institution-id><institution>China Postdoctoral Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2021M702295</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhang</surname><given-names>Zhe</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>22350710182</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhou</surname><given-names>Yaoqi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000923</institution-id><institution>Australian Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DP180102060</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhou</surname><given-names>Yaoqi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000925</institution-id><institution>National Health and Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1121629</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhou</surname><given-names>Yaoqi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000923</institution-id><institution>Australian Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DP210101875</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhou</surname><given-names>Yaoqi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The minimal twister sister (TS)-like self-cleaving ribozymes, revealed by deep mutational scanning, represent some of the very few human/primate ribozymes.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Ribozymes (catalytic RNAs) are thought to have dominated early life forms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Benner et al., 1989</xref>) until they were gradually replaced by more effective and stable proteins.

They include two hammerhead ribozymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">de la PeÃ±a and GarcÃ­a-Robles, 2010a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Perreault et al., 2011</xref>), an hepatitis delta virus (HDV)-like cytoplasmic polyadenylation element-binding protein 3 (CPEB3) ribozyme within the transcript of a single-copy gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Salehi-Ashtiani et al., 2006</xref>), and self-cleaving ribozymes associated with olfactory receptor <italic>OR4K15</italic> (olfactory receptor family 4 subfamily K member 15), insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (<italic>IGF1R</italic>), and a <italic>LINE-1</italic> (Long Interspersed Nuclear Element-1) retrotransposon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Salehi-Ashtiani et al., 2006</xref>). All these ribozymes were discovered by using selection-based biochemical experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Salehi-Ashtiani et al., 2006</xref>). More recently, the hovlinc ribozyme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chen et al., 2021</xref>) was identified by genome-wide screening against RNAs with the specific 5â²-hydroxyl termini resulted from self-cleavage, followed by a combination of RNA structure prediction as well as deletion analysis and mutation-based validation for determining its secondary structure. It has been shown that single-nucleotide polymorphism in CPEB3 ribozyme was associated with an enhanced self-cleavage activity along with a poorer episodic memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Vogler et al., 2009</xref>). Inhibition of the highly conserved CPEB3 ribozyme could strengthen hippocampal-dependent long-term memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bendixsen et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chen et al., 2024</xref>). However, little is known about the other human self-cleaving ribozymes.</p><p>Previous studies on self-cleaving ribozymes found in retrotransposons suggested their importance in the overall size, structure, and function of different genomes. Most self-cleaving ribozymes found in retrotransposons belong to three widespread ribozyme families: twister ribozyme variants in non-LTR retrotransposons of <italic>Schistosoma mansoni</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Liu et al., 2021</xref>), HDV-like ribozymes in R2 elements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Eickbush and Eickbush, 2010</xref>) and L1Tc retrotransposon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">SÃ¡nchez-Luque et al., 2011</xref>) and hammerhead ribozymes in short interspersed nuclear elements of Schistosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Ferbeyre et al., 1998</xref>), Penelope-like elements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cervera and De la PeÃ±a, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">LÃ¼nse et al., 2017</xref>), and retrozymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cervera et al., 2016</xref>). Unlike the wide occurrence of hammerhead ribozymes in different types of retrotransposons, HDV-like ribozymes usually locate in the 5â² UTR region of the retrotransposons only, and were found in different species including <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dawid and Rebbert, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Roiha et al., 1981</xref>), <italic>Bombyx mori</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Eickbush and Robins, 1985</xref>), arthropods, nematodes, birds, and tunicates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Ruminski et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Webb et al., 2009</xref>). These ribozymes are important for co-transcriptional processing of the full-length transcript and translation of the downstream open reading frame. This suggests that the LINE-1 ribozyme found in the human genome may also play an active role in co-transcriptional processing during evolution.</p><p>Typically, self-cleaving ribozymes are in non-coding regions of the genome. For example, the CPEB3 ribozyme is located inside the intron of the <italic>CPEB3</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Salehi-Ashtiani et al., 2006</xref>), hammerhead ribozyme found in the 3â² UTR of <italic>Clec2</italic> genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Martick et al., 2008</xref>), hammerhead and HDV motifs associated with retrotransposable elements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cervera et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Ruminski et al., 2011</xref>). However, the OR4K15 ribozyme is located at the reverse strand of the coding region of the olfactory receptor gene <italic>OR4K15</italic>, suggesting a potentially novel functional mechanism for this ribozyme.</p><p>Previously, we performed deep mutational scanning of a self-cleaving ribozyme (CPEB3) by using error-prone PCR to generate mutants in a large scale. The relative activities of these mutants can be obtained by counting the cleaved and uncleaved sequences of each mutant from high-throughput sequencing data. These activities can be utilized to analyze mutational covariation and infer accurate base-pairing structures by developing a computational tool called CODA (covariation-induced deviation of activity) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Zhang et al., 2020</xref>). Here, using the same technique, we located the regions essential for the catalytic activities (the functional regions) of LINE-1 and OR4K15 ribozymes in their original sequences, which were generated from the selection of randomly fragmented human genomic DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Salehi-Ashtiani et al., 2006</xref>). We showed that these two ribozymes shared essentially the same base-pairing structural elements but with a circular permutation. The structural elements, which are shaped like the Chinese lantern, are homologous to the catalytic cores of the more complex twister sister self-cleaving ribozymes in terms of sequence and secondary structure, suggesting a more primitive origin for twister sister ribozymes. However, the homology model of the twister sister-like (TS-like) ribozyme generated from the twister sister ribozyme may not be the true structure for its function due to the lack of a stem-loop for its stabilization and two mismatches from the twister sister in the internal loops as well as different responses to mutations.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Deep mutational scanning of LINE-1 and OR4K15 ribozymes</title><p>Our previous work indicates that deep mutational scanning can lead to covariation signals for highly accurate inference of base-pairing structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Zhang et al., 2020</xref>). Here, the same technique was applied to the original LINE-1 ribozyme (146 nucleotides, LINE-1-ori) and OR4K15 ribozyme (140 nucleotides, OR4K15-ori). These original sequences were generated from a randomly fragmented human genomic DNA selection-based biochemical experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Salehi-Ashtiani et al., 2006</xref>). Thus, their functional and structural regions are unknown. It needs to be noted that there is no exact match for LINE-1-ori and OR4K15-ori in the human genome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). This should be related to mutations accumulated during the selection. In deep mutational scanning, high-throughput sequencing can directly measure the relative cleavage activity (RA) (see Materials and methods) of each variant in the mutant libraries of these two ribozymes according to the ratio of cleaved to uncleaved sequence reads of the mutant, relative to the same ratio of the wild-type sequence. The relative activities of single mutations at each position indicate the sensitivity of cleavage activity to the mutations in that position. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> shows the average RA for a given sequence position for all LINE-1-ori mutants with single mutations at the position. Mutations in most positions in LINE-1-ori did not lead to large changes in RA. In other words, these sequence positions are unlikely to contribute to the specific structure required for the ribozyme to be functional. The activity of the LINE-1-ori ribozyme is only sensitive to the mutations in two short segments (54â71 and 83â99) where the RA can be reduced to nearly zero. Thus, the two terminal ends and the central region between bases 72 and 82 are not that important for LINE-1 self-cleavage activity. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, a similar distribution of RA was observed in OR4K15-ori. Only sequence positions inside the two short segments (70â84 and 101â116) are sensitive to mutations, which suggests that only these regions are required to form the functional RNA structure of the OR4K15 self-cleaving ribozyme. Thus, we have identified the contiguous functional regions of LINE-1 ribozymes (54â99, LINE-1-rbz) and OR4K15 ribozymes (70â116, OR4K15-rbz).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Deep mutational scanning results of the LINE-1 and OR4K15 ribozymes.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Genomic locations of the sequences with the highest similarity to the LINE-1 (left) and OR4K15 (right) ribozymes.

CODA employed support vector regression to establish an independent-mutation model and a naive Bayes classifier to separate bases paired from unpaired (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Zhang et al., 2020</xref>). Moreover, incorporating Monte-Carlo simulated annealing with an energy model and a CODA scoring term (CODA+MC) could further improve the coverage of the regions under-sampled by deep mutations. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D, E</xref> highlights the base pairs within the region 54â99 of LINE-1-ori (LINE-1-rbz) and the region 70â116 of OR4K15-ori (OR4K15-rbz), respectively. The CODA result for LINE-1-ori shows four base pairs (A14U34, A16U32, G17C31, C18G30) in one possible stem region, and another two base pairs (A4U43, A6A41) in the second possible stem region. Due to the lower mutational coverage, the CODA result for OR4K15-ori shows fewer base pairs than LINE-1-ori. Only two base pairs (U1A47, U3A45) in one possible stem region, and one lone base pair (A13U34) have been observed. The low mutation coverage for OR4K15-ori was due to the mutational bias (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cadwell and Joyce, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Keohavong and Thilly, 1989</xref>) of error-prone PCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplements 1</xref>â<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">4</xref>).</p><p>A few but strong covariation signals from CODA analysis can be expanded by Monte-Carlo (MC) simulated annealing as demonstrated previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Zhang et al., 2020</xref>). Several contiguous base-paired regions were detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D, E</xref>). LINE-1-rbz has two highly reliable stem regions with a length of 6 nt, including one non-WatsonâCrick pair A6A41. For OR4K15-rbz, the functional region has two reliable stem regions with lengths of 5 nt and 4 nt, respectively, including one non-WatsonâCrick pair G14U33. Most of the base pairs discovered by MC simulated annealing are non-AU pairs, whose covariations are difficult to capture by error-prone PCR because of mutational biases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cadwell and Joyce, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Keohavong and Thilly, 1989</xref>). In addition, these two stems are consistent with the single mutation profiles. For example, two single mutations G14A and U33C showed high RA, 1.55 and 1.82, respectively, suggesting the high possibility of a G14U33 pair at these positions, because these two separate mutations change the wobble GU pair to the WatsonâCrick AU and GC pairs, respectively, and lead to a more stable structure and higher activity. If G14U33 is true, a natural extension of the stem region is G15C32 for another canonical WatsonâCrick pair. This pairing region was missed by the CODA+MC result. There are some other base pairs that appeared in low probabilities after MC simulated annealing. They are considered as false positives because of low probabilities and lack of support from the deep mutational scanning results. The appearance of false positives is likely due to the imperfection of the experiment-based energy function employed in current MC simulated annealing.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Further validation of base-pairing information by deep mutational scanning of LINE-1-rbz</title><p>To further improve the signals, we employed the contiguous functional segment (54â99, LINE-1-rbz) for the second round of deep mutational scanning (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1âfigure supplement 5</xref>). Performing the second round was necessary because the deep mutational scanning of the original LINE-1 ribozyme had a low 18.5% coverage of double mutations (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). This low coverage was not sufficient for accurate inference of the secondary structure in the full coverage. This second round employed a chemically synthesized doped library with a doping rate of 6%, rather than a mutant library generated from error-prone PCR biased toward the sequence positions with A/T nucleotide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplements 1</xref>â<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). In addition, to amplify the signals of cleaved RNAs after in vitro transcription of the mutant library of LINE-1-rbz, we selectively captured cleaved RNAs by employing RtcB ligase and a 5â²-desbiotin, 3â²-phosphate modified linker because they only react with the 5â²-hydroxyl termini that exist only in cleaved RNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Tanaka et al., 2011</xref>).

The latter clearly shows two stems with lengths of 6 nt and 5 nt, respectively, due to nearly 100% coverage of single and double mutations for the functional region. Moreover, it suggests a non-canonical pair 6A41A at the end of the first stem, although the signal is weak. Such a weak signal is expected because the non-canonical pairs are typically less stable than standard base pairings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lemieux and Major, 2002</xref>). There are some additional weak signals in the LINE-1-rbz result. Most of these signals are for the base pairs at a few sequence distances apart (|<italic>i</italic> â <italic>j</italic>| &lt; 6, local base pairs). We found that some of them are caused by a high relative activity (RAâ²) of the double mutant and are not likely to be true positives because the corresponding single mutations are not very disruptive (RAâ² &gt; 0.5). The consistency between base pairs inferred from deep mutational scanning of the original sequences and that of the identified functional regions confirmed the correct identification of functional regions for LINE-1 ribozyme.</p><p>Probabilistic CODA results were further refined by MC simulated annealing (CODA+MC). The resulting base pairs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, upper triangle) removed mostly local false positives. However, the non-canonical AA pair was removed as well, likely because the energy function does not account for non-canonical pairs. A new 18C30G pair added is a natural extension of the second stem. Two separate consecutive base pairs (7G37C, 8C36G) with relatively low signals were also added in the CODA+MC result. These two base pairs are likely false positives because they do not appear in all the models generated from MC simulated annealing with a low probability of 0.52.

No involvement of the nucleobase part (U38 in LINE-1-core, C8 in OR4K15-core) in the modeled structures is compatible with the mismatches U38C and U38A found in the comparison, as changes of the nucleobase part did not have a big influence on the H-bonded interactions involving U38 (C8 in OR4K15-core) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Thus, it is not entirely clear whether the model structure of TS-like ribozymes built from the twister sister will remain stable in the absence of any tertiary interactions with the stem-loop SL2 or it will deviate significantly from the twister sister.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>Differences in mutational responses in the L1s between the TS-like and the twister sister ribozymes</title><p>Considering the high similarity of the internal loops, we further investigated the mutational effects on the internal loop L1s. Most nucleotides in the L1 region of LINE-1-rbz are relatively conserved, as single mutations showed RAâ² &lt; 0.2 according to deep mutational scanning results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). The conservation is consistent with the stacking and hydrogen-bonding interactions in the catalytic region. By comparison, mutations of C62 (C54 in three-way junctional twister sister ribozyme) at the cleavage site did not lead to a major change on the cleavage activity in previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Liu et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Zheng et al., 2017</xref>). This can be compared to the fact that single mutations of the corresponding nucleotide in LINE-1-rbz (C10) had relative activities as low as 0.07 in the deep mutational scanning result. To further confirm the above result, we performed cleavage assays on several mutations at the cleavage site of LINE-1-core. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>, mutations on C10 showed either partial (C10U, C10G) or complete loss (C10A) in cleavage activity. While the corresponding mutations in the four-way junctional twister sister ribozyme showed pronounced (C62U, C62A) or somewhat reduced (C62G) cleavage activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Liu et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Zheng et al., 2017</xref>). More interestingly, A11U in LINE-1-core showed partial cleavage activity, whereas the corresponding mutation A63U in the four-way junctional twister sister ribozyme showed complete loss of cleavage activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Liu et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Zheng et al., 2017</xref>). These different mutation effects indicate that LINE-1-core may not adopt exactly the same structure and catalytic mechanism as the twister sister ribozyme. In other words, TS-like ribozymes may not be simply a minimal version of twister sister ribozymes.</p><p>We further examined the interactions around the cleavage site C10-A11 in LINE-1-rbz (C40-A41 in OR4K15-core). The corresponding nucleotides in twister sister ribozymes (C62-A63 in four-way junctional twister sister ribozyme, C54-A55 in three-way junctional twister sister ribozyme) adopt either a splayed-apart or a base-stacked conformation, with the scissile phosphate H-bonded to the G5 (four-way junctional twister sister ribozyme) or C7 (three-way junctional twister sister ribozyme). In our modeled structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3âfigure supplement 4D</xref>), the bases at the cleavage site C10-A11 in LINE-1-core (C40-A41 in OR4K15-core) are splayed away, with A11 (A41 in OR4K15-core) directed inwards and C10 (C40 in OR4K15-core) directed outwards. In addition, H-bonded interactions between C10 (C40 in OR4K15-core) and the two nucleotides 3â² of C10 could be found (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3âfigure supplement 4D</xref>). These structure differences may partially explain why mutations of C10 were detrimental to the catalysis in TS-like ribozymes. Moreover, we did not observe interactions between C10 (C40 in OR4K15-core) and G36/C37 (G6/C7 in OR4K15-core) although they were important to anchor the cytosine in twister sister ribozymes. This may be due to the replacement of the non-canonical pair G5U64 (G6U57 in three-way junctional twister sister ribozyme) by A12G36 (G6A42 in OR4K15-core) in TS-like ribozymes. Thus, the stability of the current model structure based on the template from the twister sister ribozyme is uncertain.</p></sec><sec id="s2-8"><title>Activity confirmation and biochemical analysis of LINE-1-core and OR4K15-core</title><p>To confirm the cleavage activity of the core region (without the stem-loop linker), we obtained the segments (54â71 for LINE-1, 101â116 for OR4K15) as the substrate strands with the cleavage site and the segments (83â99 for LINE-1, 70â84 for OR4K15) as the enzyme strands (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>), as they made up the LINE-1-core and OR4K15-core.

They are the simplest and the second simplest self-cleaving ribozymes reported so far. In all previously reported self-cleaving ribozyme families, the self-cleaving reaction occurs through an internal phosphoester transfer mechanism, in which the 2â²-hydroxyl group of the â1 (relative to the cleavage site) nucleotide attacks the adjacent phosphorus resulting in the release of the 5â² oxygen of +1 (relative to the cleavage site) nucleotide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">FerrÃ©-DâAmarÃ© and Scott, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Harris et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Li et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Roth et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Weinberg et al., 2015</xref>). We confirmed that both LINE-1-core and OR4K15-core employed the same cleavage mechanism because the analogous RNAs that lacked the 2â² oxygen atom in the â1 nucleotide (dC10 for LINE-1-core, dC40 for OR4K15-core) were unable to cleave (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). We also investigated whether TS-like ribozymes can cleave when Mg<sup>2+</sup> was replaced by Co(NH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>6</sub><sup>3+</sup> in the reaction. Co(NH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>6</sub><sup>3+</sup> is isosteric with Mg(H<sub>2</sub>O)<sub>6</sub><sup>2+</sup>, but the divalent cations cannot directly participate in catalysis as the amino ligands cannot readily dissociate. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C and a</xref> total loss of cleavage activity in Co(NH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>6</sub><sup>3+</sup> in the absence of Mg<sup>2+</sup> indicates that the TS-like ribozymes require the binding of divalent cations not only for structure folding, but also for catalysis.</p><p>As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>, we further examined the dependence of the metal ions on TS-like ribozymesâ cleavage activity. At a concentration of 1 mM, ribozyme cleavage can be observed with Mg<sup>2+</sup>, Mn<sup>2+</sup>, Co<sup>2+</sup>, and Zn<sup>2+</sup> but little or none with Ca<sup>2+</sup>, Cu<sup>2+</sup>, Ba<sup>2+</sup>, Ni<sup>2+</sup>, Na<sup>+</sup>, K<sup>+</sup>, Li<sup>+</sup>, Cs<sup>+</sup>, or Rb<sup>+</sup>, indicating that direct participation of specific hydrated divalent metal ions is required for self-cleavage. More interestingly, we found that the TS-like ribozymes have an equivalent or even higher cleavage ratio with Mn<sup>2+</sup> than Mg<sup>2+</sup>. For LINE-1-core, the cleaved fractions were ~57% for Mg<sup>2+</sup>, ~74% for Mn<sup>2+</sup>. For OR4K15-core, the cleaved fractions were ~9% for Mg<sup>2+</sup>, ~79% for Mn<sup>2+</sup>. We further characterized the cleavage rates of these two ribozymes under different concentrations of Mg<sup>2+</sup> and Mn<sup>2+</sup> by using a fluorescence resonance energy transfer-based method, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5âfigure supplements 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">3</xref>. We used the first-order rate constant (<italic>k</italic><sub>obs</sub>) to represent the efficiency of the cleavage reaction. The <italic>k</italic><sub>obs</sub> of LINE-1-core under single-turnover condition was ~0.05 min<sup>â1</sup> when measured in 10 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub> and 100 mM KCl at pH 7.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s4">Figure 5âfigure supplement 4</xref>). Only a slightly lower value of <italic>k</italic><sub>obs</sub> (~0.03 min<sup>â1</sup>) was observed for LINE-1-rbz (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s5">Figure 5âfigure supplement 5</xref>). This confirms that the stem-loop region SL2 does not contribute much to the cleavage activity of the TS-like ribozymes. Cleavage activities of the two TS-like ribozymes were highly dependent on the concentration of divalent metal ions. The steep increase in rate constants of two TS-like ribozymes plateaued at Mg<sup>2+</sup> concentrations above 100 mM, while for Mn<sup>2+</sup> it plateaued at concentrations of 10 mM. Consistent with the PAGE result, LINE-1-core showed higher cleavage rates than OR4K15-core when they were incubated with Mg<sup>2+</sup>. However, the cleavage rates of OR4K15-core were only lower than LINE-1-core when the concentrations of Mn<sup>2+</sup> were less than 20 mM, but higher, otherwise. Thus, there may exist an important difference between OR4K15-core and LINE-1-core to explain this different bias toward ions. A detailed explanation for this difference may require high-resolution structure determination of the TS-like ribozymes.</p></sec><sec id="s2-9"><title>Homology search of two TS-like ribozymes</title><p>To locate close homologs of the two TS-like ribozymes, we performed cmsearch based on a covariance model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Eddy and Durbin, 1994</xref>) built on the sequence and secondary structural profiles. In the human genome, we got 1154 and 4 homolog sequences for LINE-1-rbz and OR4K15-rbz, respectively. For OR4K15-rbz, there was an exact match located at the reverse strand of the exon of the <italic>OR4K15</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). The other three homologs of OR4K15-rbz belong to the same olfactory receptor family 4 subfamily K (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). However, there was no exact match for LINE-1-rbz (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). Interestingly, a total of 1154 LINE-1-rbz homologs were mapped to the LINE-1 retrotransposon according to the RepeatMasker (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.repeatmasker.org">http://www.repeatmasker.org</ext-link>) annotation. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref> shows the distribution of LINE-1-rbz homologs in different LINE-1 subfamilies in the human genome. Only three subfamilies L1PA7, L1PA8, and L1P3 (L1PA7-9) can be considered as abundant with LINE-1-rbz homologs (&gt;100 homologs per family). The consensus sequences of all homologs obtained are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>. To investigate the self-cleavage activity of these homologs, we mainly focused on the mismatches in the more conserved internal loops. The major differences between the five consensus sequences are the mismatches in the first internal loop. The widespread A12C substitution can be found in the majority of LINE-1-rbz homologs, this substitution leads to a one-base pair extension of the second stem (P2) but almost no activity (RÃâ²: 0.03) based on our deep mutational scanning result. Then we selected three homologs without A12C substitution for LINE-1-rbz for in vitro cleavage assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>). However we did not observe significant cleavage activity, this might be caused by GU substitutions in the stem region. For three homologs of OR4K15-rbz, we only found one homolog of OR4K15 with pronounced self-cleavage activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>). In addition, we performed a similar bioinformatic search of the TS-like ribozymes in other primate genomes. Similarly, the majority (15 out of 18) of primate genomes have a large number of LINE-1 homologs (&gt;500) and the remaining three have essentially none. However, there was no exact match. Only one homolog has a single mutation (U38C) in the genome assembly of Gibbon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6âfigure supplement 1</xref>). The majority of these homologs have three or more mismatches (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6âfigure supplement 1</xref>).

Most self-cleaving ribozymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Deng et al., 2023</xref>) are in non-coding regions of the hosting genome. For example, the CPEB3 ribozyme in the intron of the <italic>CPEB3</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Salehi-Ashtiani et al., 2006</xref>), hammerhead ribozyme in the 3â² UTR of <italic>Clec2</italic> genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Martick et al., 2008</xref>), hammerhead and HDV motifs associated with retrotransposons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Eickbush and Eickbush, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">SÃ¡nchez-Luque et al., 2011</xref>). LINE-1 belongs to the family of retrotransposons, they make up about 17% of the human genome, with over 500,000 copies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Brouha et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lander et al., 2001</xref>). The retrotransposition process of LINE-1 increases the copy number of repeats and generates insertional mutations in the genome, which contributes to genetic novelties as well as genomic instability. To date the known examples of self-cleaving ribozymes in retrotransposons are the afore-mentioned hammerhead, HDV-like and twister ribozymes. Especially, the HDV-like ribozymes have been found inside the 5â² UTR regions of the autonomous retrotransposons, including rDNA-specific (R2, R4, and R6) elements, RTEs (retrotransposon-like elements), telomere-specific SART, Baggins, L1Tc, etc. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Ruminski et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Weinberg et al., 2019</xref>). Interestingly, those retrotransposon-related self-cleaving ribozymes have not been observed in mammalian genomes except for the Long Interspersed Nuclear Element-1 (LINE-1) ribozyme discussed in this study. However, we found that even this LINE-1-rbz sequence has at least two mismatches with the ancient human LINE-1 families, which led to the loss of self-cleavage activity. Similarly, most TS-like ribozyme homologs found in the primate LINE-1 retrotransposons seem to be inactive due to mutations, except for one homolog (U38C) found in Gibbon. Considering the location of the LINE-1 ribozyme inside the 5â² UTR, it suggests that this ribozyme might be related to the transcriptional regulation of the LINE-1 retrotransposon during evolution, like the HDV-like ribozymes. Since the majority of the LINE-1 retrotransposons inside the genome are âDNA fossilsâ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Beck et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lander et al., 2001</xref>), which means that they were active in a specific period but became extinct (dysfunctional) during evolution. This suggests that the self-cleavage activity of the TS-like ribozymes in the LINE-1 retrotransposons may share a common evolutionary path with retrotransposition activity. By comparison, the OR4K15 ribozyme is located at the reverse strand of the coding region of the olfactory receptor gene <italic>OR4K15</italic>, suggesting a potentially novel functional mechanism for this ribozyme as antisense transcription is ubiquitous in mammals and may affect the gene regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Vivancos et al., 2010</xref>). However, the progress in understanding the functional roles of LINE-1 and OR4K15 self-cleaving ribozymes was slow because of lacking structural clues.</p><p>The centerpiece of structural clues is the RNA base-pairing structure resulted from the complex interplay of secondary and tertiary interactions. Previously, we developed a technique (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Zhang et al., 2020</xref>) for inferring the base-pairing information of the self-cleaving ribozymes by deep mutational scanning. In this paper, we applied this technique to the LINE-1 and OR4K15 ribozymes, to obtain the functional regions and the base-pairing information. As both LINE-1 and OR4K15 ribozymes were discovered from the randomly fragmented human genomic DNA selection-based biochemical experiments, the original full-length (wild-type) sequences of the ribozymes do not necessarily represent the functional region of the RNAs. However, the functional regions could cleave when they were transcribed along with the upstream and downstream sequences, and, thus, they are more likely to be active in the cellular environment.</p><p>Indeed, we found that the functional regions for both ribozymes are very short (35 and 31 nucleotides for LINE-1 and OR4K15, respectively) and surprisingly in the same class in a circular-permutated form. We are confident about the secondary structures obtained because of the consistency between the results from the deep mutational study of the original sequence and the functional region of the LINE-1 ribozyme. The obtained secondary structure is further confirmed by the discovery of the functional regions of the two TS-like ribozymes in the circular-permutated form from one another (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). From the mutational information of LINE-1-rbz, the only mismatch (U38C) from OR4K15 in the catalytic region has an RAâ² of 0.6. While the corresponding mismatch mutation C8U in OR4K15 has an RA of 1.54, or 0.65 for U8C. This consistency in activity reduction for the UâC mutation further confirmed that these two ribozymes belong to the same class in a circular-permutated form. Currently, three classes of self-cleaving ribozymes, the hammerhead (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">de la PeÃ±a and GarcÃ­a-Robles, 2010b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jimenez et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Przybilski et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Seehafer et al., 2011</xref>), twister (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Roth et al., 2014</xref>), and the hairpin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Weinberg et al., 2021</xref>) ribozymes are found in different species in multiple circular-permutated forms. The discovery of permutated TS-like ribozymes in the human genome for the first time suggests that we can find additional examples of circular-permutated TS-like ribozymes in other species.</p><p>More interestingly, we found that the internal loop regions of the TS-like ribozymes share a high similarity with the known catalytic region of the twister sister ribozyme (two mismatches only, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). The conserved cleavage sites suggest a similar structure and mechanism as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>. However, the maximum observed rate constant (<italic>k</italic><sub>obs</sub>) for the twister sister ribozyme was ~5 min<sup>â1</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Weinberg et al., 2015</xref>), compared to ~0.11 Â± 0.01 min<sup>â1</sup> for the TS-like ribozymes. This rate difference is not mainly caused by mismatches in the catalytic core between the twister sister and LINE-1/OR4K15 ribozymes. In fact, deep mutational scanning results indicate that one mismatch (U38C) in the catalytic region of OR4K15-rbz (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>) has an RAâ² of 0.6. Two mismatches (A12U and U38A) in the catalytic region of the twister sister ribozyme (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>) have the RAâ² of 0.28 and 0.47, respectively, whereas the coexistence of these two mismatches only has the RAâ² of 0.09. Thus, a more sophisticated structure along with long-range interactions involving the SL4 region in the twister sister ribozyme must have helped to stabilize the catalytic region for improved catalytic activity. Similarly, previous studies have demonstrated that peripheral regions of hammerhead (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">De la PeÃ±a et al., 2003</xref>), hairpin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Zhao et al., 2000</xref>), and HDV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Tinsley and Walter, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Webb et al., 2016</xref>) ribozymes could greatly increase their self-cleavage activity. Given the importance of the peripheral regions, the absence of this tertiary interaction in the TS-like ribozyme may not be able to fully stabilize the structural form generated from homology modeling. Moreover, it is important to note that the catalytic regions of our TS-like ribozymes and the env-33 sequence from the multiple sequence alignment of twister sister ribozyme in a previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Weinberg et al., 2015</xref>) are quite identical (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s5">Figure 3âfigure supplement 5</xref>), with only one mismatch in OR4K15-rbz and no mismatch in LINE-1-rbz. This high similarity further indicates that the TS-like ribozymes identified in this study should share the same origin as the twister sister ribozymes.</p><p>Indeed, we found some differences between the responses to mutations in the catalytic regions around the cleavage sites of TS-like ribozymes and those of twister sister ribozymes. Although there are pronounced differences around the cleavage sites in previous twister sister ribozyme structures, both cytosines at the cleavage sites were found to be insensitive to mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Liu et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Zheng et al., 2017</xref>). However, unlike twister sister ribozymes, the cytosine at the cleavage site of TS-like ribozyme was sensitive to mutations in our mutation assays. According to our modeled structures, the H-bonding interactions associated with the cleavage site C10-A11 (C40-A41 in OR4K15-core) in TS-like ribozymes show that the cytosine (C10 in LINE-1-core, C40 in OR4K15) is relatively conserved, which is consistent with the mutation assay results. In the modeled structure, we did not observe direct contacts that helped to stabilize the scissile phosphate and the in-line alignments required for the catalytic step. This may suggest that conformational changes may be required to generate the active conformation prior to the catalytic step as in the twister sister ribozyme structures. Or this is due to inexact structures generated from homology modeling, because Mg<sup>2+</sup> was not included during homology modeling. Our experimental results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5BâD</xref>) showed that Mg<sup>2+</sup> is essential for both structure folding and catalysis. The absence of Mg<sup>2+</sup> during modeling might lead to the conformational change of the tertiary structures. Thus, further studies are needed to illustrate the possible structural and mechanistic differences between TS-like ribozymes and twister sister ribozymes.</p><p>According to the bioinformatic analysis result, there are some TS-like ribozymes (one LINE-1-rbz homolog in the Gibbon genome, and some OR4K15-rbz homologs) with in vitro cleavage activity in primate genomes. Unlike the more conserved CPEB3 ribozyme which has a clear function, the function of the TS-like ribozymes is not clear, as they are not conserved, belong to the pseudogene or are located at the reverse strand. While the in vivo activities and functions of these two circular-permutated TS-like ribozymes require further studies, their discovery may have important therapeutics and biotech implications. First, the TS-like ribozymes have the simplest secondary structure with two stems and two internal loops, compared to all naturally occurring self-cleaving ribozymes. Previous studies also have revealed some minimized forms of self-cleaving ribozymes, including hammerhead (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Epstein and Gall, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">LÃ¼nse et al., 2017</xref>) and HDV-like (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Riccitelli et al., 2014</xref>) ribozymes. However, when comparing the conserved segments, they (â¥36 nt) are not as short as the TS-like ribozymes (31 nt) found here. Second, this TS-like ribozyme after removing the stem-loop region only requires a 15-nucleotide enzyme strand and a 16-nucleotide substrate strand for its function. Thus, it can be easily modified into a trans-cleaving ribozyme, which was found useful for bioengineering and RNA-targeting therapeutics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Huang et al., 2019</xref>). A recent intracellular selection-based study has shown that hammerhead ribozyme can be engineered into a trans-acting ribozyme with consistent gene knockdown ability on different targeted mRNA either in prokaryotic or eukaryotic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Huang et al., 2019</xref>). The TS-like ribozyme, the simplest one known, may have an unprecedented advantage, compared to existing trans-cleaving ribozymes.</p><p>What is also important is that this work further confirms the usefulness of deep mutational scanning and high-throughput sequencing for RNA structural inference by CODA analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kobori and Yokobayashi, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Zhang et al., 2020</xref>). The method is not limited to self-cleaving ribozymes, if combined with other functional or phenotypic selection techniques. Moreover, the structural and full mutational information provided by this method could be utilized to discover additional functional RNAs and thus help us to investigate the hidden side of non-coding RNAs.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>All the oligonucleotides listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>, except for the doped library, were purchased from IDT (Integrated DNA technologies) and Genscript.

Very few human/primate ribozymes have been published and this manuscript presents a relatively detailed analysis of two of them. The minimized domains appear to be some of the smallest known self-cleaving ribozymes.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>The manuscript is rooted in deep mutational analysis of the OR4K15 and LINE1 and subsequently in modeling of a huge active site based on the closely-related core of the TS ribozyme. The experiments support the HTS findings and provide convincing evidence that the ribozymes are structurally related to the core of the TS ribozyme, which has not been found in primates prior to this work.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>(1) Given that these two ribozymes have not been described outside of a single figure in a Science Supplement, it is important to show their locations in the human genome, present their sequence and structure conservation among various species, particularly primates, and test and discuss the activity of variants found in non-human organisms. Furthermore, OR4K15 exists in three copies on three separate chromosomes in the human genome, with slight variations in the ribozyme sequence. All three of these variants should be tested experimentally and their activity should be presented. A similar analysis should be presented for the naturally-occurring variants of the LINE1 ribozyme. These data are a rich source for comparison with the deep mutagenesis presented here. Inserting a figure (1) that would show the genomic locations, directions, and conservation of these ribozymes and discussing them in light of this new presentation would greatly improve the manuscript. As for the biological roles of known self-cleaving ribozymes in humans, there is a bioRxiv manuscript on the role of the CPEB3 ribozyme in mammalian memory formation (doi.org/10.1101/2023.06.07.543953), and an analysis of the CPEB3 functional conservation throughout mammals (Bendixsen et al. MBE 2021). Furthermore, the authors missed two papers that presented the discovery of human hammerhead ribozymes that reside in introns (by de la PeÃ{plus minus}a and Breaker), which should also be cited. On the other hand, the Clec ribozyme was only found in rodents and not primates and is thus not a human ribozyme and should be noted as such.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank this Reviewer for his/her input and acknowledgment of this work. To improve the manuscript, we have included the genomic locations in Figure 1A, Figure 6A and Figure 6C. And we have tested the activity of representative variants found in the human genome and discussed the activity of the variants in other primates. All suggested publications are now properly cited.</p><p>Line 62-66: It has been shown that single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in CPEB3 ribozyme was associated with an enhanced self-cleavage activity along with a poorer episodic memory (14). Inhibition of the highly conserved CPEB3 ribozyme could strengthen hippocampal-dependent long-term memory (15, 16). However, little is known about the other human self-cleaving ribozymes.</p><p>Line 474-501: Homology search of two TS-like ribozymes. To locate close homologs of the two TS-like ribozymes, we performed cmsearch based on a covariance model (38) built on the sequence and secondary structural profiles. In the human genome, we got 1154 and 4 homolog sequences for LINE-1-rbz and OR4K15-rbz, respectively. For OR4K15-rbz, there was an exact match located at the reverse strand of the exon of OR4K15 gene (Figure 6A). The other 3 homologs of OR4K15-rbz belongs to the same olfactory receptor family 4 subfamily K (Figure 6C). However, there was no exact match for LINE-1-rbz (Figure 6A). Interestingly, a total of 1154 LINE-1-rbz homologs were mapped to the LINE-1 retrotransposon according to the RepeatMasker (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.repeatmasker.org">http://www.repeatmasker.org</ext-link>) annotation. Figure 6B showed the distribution of LINE-1-rbz homologs in different LINE-1 subfamilies in the human genome. Only three subfamilies L1PA7, L1PA8 and L1P3 (L1PA7-9) can be considered as abundant with LINE-1-rbz homologs (&gt;100 homologs per family). The consensus sequences of all homologs obtained are shown in Figure 6D. In order to investigate the self-cleavage activity of these homologs, we mainly focused on the mismatches in the more conserved internal loops. The major differences between the 5 consensus sequences are the mismatches in the first internal loop. The widespread A12C substitution can be found in majority of LINE-1-rbz homologs, this substitution leads to a one-base pair extension of the second stem (P2) but almost no activity (RAâ: 0.03) based on our deep mutational scanning result. Then we selected 3 homologs without A12C substitution for LINE-1-rbz for in vitro cleavage assay (Figure 6E). But we didnât observe significant cleavage activity, this might be caused by GU substitutions in the stem region. For 3 homologs of OR4K15-rbz, we only found one homolog of OR4K15 with pronounced self-cleavage activity (Figure 6F). In addition, we performed similar bioinformatic search of the TS-like ribozymes in other primate genomes. Similarly, the majority (15 out of 18) of primate genomes have a large number of LINE-1 homologs (&gt;500) and the remaining three have essentially none. However, there was no exact match. Only one homolog has a single mutation (U38C) in the genome assembly of Gibbon (Figure S15). The majority of these homologs have 3 or more mismatches (Figure S15). For OR4K15-rbz, all representative primate genomes contain at least one exact match of the OR4K15-rbz sequence.</p><p>Line 598-602: According to the bioinformatic analysis result, there are some TS-like ribozymes (one LINE-1-rbz homolog in the Gibbon genome, and some OR4K15-rbz homologs) with in vitro cleavage activity in primate genomes. Unlike the more conserved CPEB3 ribozyme which has a clear function, the function of the TS-like ribozymes is not clear, as they are not conserved, belong to the pseudogene or located at the reverse strand.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) The authors present the story as a discovery of a new RNA catalytic motif. This is unfounded. As the authors point out, the catalytic domain is very similar to the Twister Sister (or &quot;TS&quot;) ribozyme. In fact, there is no appreciable difference between these and TS ribozymes, except for the missing peripheral domains. For example, the env33 sequence in the Weinberg et al. 2015 NCB paper shows the same sequences in the catalytic core as the LINE1 ribozyme, making the LINE1 ribozyme a TS-like ribozyme in every way, except for the missing peripheral domains. Thus these are not new ribozymes and should not have a new name. A more appropriate name should be TS-like or TS-min ribozymes. Renaming the ribozymes to lanterns is misleading.</p></disp-quote><p>Although we observed some differences in mutational effects, we agree with the reviewer that it is more appropriate to call them TS-like ribozymes. We have replaced all âlantern ribozymeâ with âTS-like ribozymeâ as suggested.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) In light of (2) the story should be refocused on the fact the authors discovered that the OR4K15 and LINE1 are both TS-like ribozymes. That is very exciting and is the real contribution of this work to the field.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank this Reviewer for their acknowledgement of this work. To improve the manuscript, we have re-named the ribozymes as suggested.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) Given the slow self-scission of the OR4K15 and LINE1 ribozymes, the discussion of the minimal domains should be focused on the role of peripheral domains in full-length TS ribozymes. Peripheral domains have been shown to greatly speed up hammerhead, HDV, and hairpin ribozymes. This is an opportunity to show that the TS ribozymes can do the same and the authors should discuss the contribution of peripheral domains to the ribozyme structure and activity. There is extensive literature on the contribution of a tertiary contact on the speed of self-scission in hammerhead ribozymes, in hairpin ribozyme it's centered on the 4-way junction vs 2-way junction structure, and in HDVs the contribution is through the stability of the J1/2 region, where the stability of the peripheral domain can be directly translated to the catalytic enhancement of the ribozymes.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate your question and the valuable suggestions provided. We have included the citations and discussion about the peripheral domains in other ribozymes.</p><p>Line 570-576: Thus, a more sophisticated structure along with long-range interactions involving the SL4 region in the twister sister ribozyme must have helped to stabilize the catalytic region for the improved catalytic activity. Similarly, previous studies have demonstrated that peripheral regions of hammerhead (49), hairpin (50) and HDV (51, 52) ribozymes could greatly increase their self-cleavage activity. Given the importance of the peripheral regions, absence of this tertiary interaction in the TS-like ribozyme may not be able to fully stabilize the structural form generated from homology modelling.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) The argument that these are the smallest self-cleaving ribozymes is debatable. LÃ1/4nse et al (NAR 2017) found some very small hammerhead ribozymes that are smaller than those presented here, but the authors suggest only working as dimers. The human ribozymes described here should be analyzed for dimerization as well (e.g., by native gel analysis) particularly because the authors suggest that there are no peripheral domains that stabilize the fold. Furthermore, Riccitelli et al. (Biochemistry) minimized the HDV-like ribozymes and found some in metagenomic sequences that are about the same size as the ones presented here. Both of these papers should be cited and discussed.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for any confusion caused by our previous statement. To clarify, we highlighted â35 and 31 nucleotides onlyâ because 46 and 47 nt contain the variable hairpin loops which are not important for the catalytic activity. By comparing the conserved segments, the TS-like ribozyme discussed in this paper is the shortest with the simplest secondary structure. And we have replaced the terms âsmallestâ and âshortestâ with âsimplestâ in our manuscript. The title has been changed to âMinimal twister sister (TS)-like self-cleaving ribozymes in the human genome revealed by deep mutational scanningâ. All the publications mentioned have been cited and discussed. Regarding possible dimerization, we did not find any evidence but would defer it to future detailed structural analysis to be sure.</p><p>Line 605-608: Previous studies also have revealed some minimized forms of self-cleaving ribozymes, including hammerhead (19, 53) and HDV-like (54) ribozymes. However, when comparing the conserved segments, they (&gt;=36 nt) are not as short as the TS-like ribozymes (31 nt) found here.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(6) The authors present homology modeling of the OR4K15 and LINE1 ribozymes based on the crystal structures of the TS ribozymes. This is another point that supports the fact that these are not new ribozyme motifs. Furthermore, the homology model should be carefully discussed as a model and not a structure. In many places in the text and the supplement, the models are presented as real structures. The wording should be changed to carefully state that these are models based on sequence similarity to TS ribozymes. Fig 3 would benefit from showing the corresponding structures of the TS ribozymes.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for pointing these out and we have already fixed them. We have replaced all âlantern ribozymeâ with âTS-like ribozymeâ as suggested. The term âModelled structuresâ were used for representing the homology model. And we have included the TS ribozyme structure in Fig 3.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>This manuscript applies a mutational scanning analysis to identify the secondary structure of two previously suggested self-cleaving ribozyme candidates in the human genome. Through this analysis, minimal structured and conserved regions with imminent importance for the ribozyme's activity are suggested and further biochemical evidence for cleavage activity are presented. Additionally, the study reveals a close resemblance of these human ribozyme candidates to the known self-cleaving ribozyme class of twister sister RNAs. Despite the high conservation of the catalytic core between these RNAs, it is suggested that the human ribozyme examples constitute a new ribozyme class. Evidence for this however is not conclusive.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>The deep mutational scanning performed in this study allowed the elucidation of important regions within the proposed LINE-1 and OR4K15 ribozyme sequences. Part of the ribozyme sequences could be assigned a secondary structure supported by covariation and highly conserved nucleotides were uncovered. This enabled the identification of LINE-1 and OR4K15 core regions that are in essence identical to previously described twister sister self-cleaving RNAs.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>I am skeptical of the claim that the described catalytic RNAs are indeed a new ribozyme class. The studied LINE-1 and OR4K15 ribozymes share striking features with the known twister sister ribozyme class (e.g. Figure 3A) and where there are differences they could be explained by having tested only a partial sequence of the full RNA motif. It appears plausible, that not the entire &quot;functional region&quot; was captured and experimentally assessed by the authors.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank this Reviewer for his/her input and acknowledgment of this work. Because a similar question was raised by reviewer 1, we decided to name the ribozymes as TS-like ribozymes. Regarding the entire regions, we conducted mutational scanning experiments at the beginning of this study. The relative activity distributions (Figure 1B, 1C) have shown that only parts of the sequence contributes to the self-cleavage activity. That is the reason why we decided to focus on the parts of the sequence afterwards.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>They identify three twister sister ribozymes by pattern-based similarity searches using RNA-Bob. Also comparing the consensus sequence of the relevant region in twister sister and the two ribozymes in this paper underlines the striking similarity between these RNAs. Given that the authors only assessed partial sequences of LINE-1 and OR4K15, I find it highly plausible that further accessory sequences have been missed that would clearly reveal that &quot;lantern ribozymes&quot; actually belong to the twister sister ribozyme class. This is also the reason I do not find the modeled structural data and biochemical data results convincing, as the differences observed could always be due to some accessory sequences and parts of the ribozyme structure that are missing.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer for raising this question. As we explained in the last question, we now called the ribozymes as TS-like ribozymes. We also emphasize that the relative activity data of the original sequences have indicated that the other part did not make any contribution to the activity of the ribozyme. The original sequences provided in the Science paper (Salehi-Ashtiani et al. Science 2006) were generated from biochemical selection of the genomic library. It did not investigate the contribution of each position to the self-cleavage activity.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Highly conserved nucleotides in the catalytic core, the need for direct contacts to divalent metal ions for catalysis, the preference of Mn2+ oder Mg2+ for cleavage, the plateau in observed rate constants at ~100mM Mg2+, are all characteristics that are identical between the proposed lantern ribozymes and the known twister sister class.</p><p>The difference in cleavage speed between twister sister (~5 min-1) and proposed lantern ribozymes could be due to experimental set-up (true single-turnover kinetics?) or could be explained by testing LINE-1 or OR4K15 ribozymes without needed accessory sequences. In the case of the minimal hammerhead ribozyme, it has been previously observed that missing important tertiary contacts can lead to drastically reduced cleavage speeds.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this question. We now called the ribozymes as TS-like ribozymes. As we explained in the last question, the relative activity data of the original sequences have proven that the other part did not make any contribution to the activity of the ribozyme. Moreover, we have tested different enzyme to substrate ratios to achieve single turn-over kinetics (Figure S13). The difference in cleavage speed should be related to the absence of peripheral regions which do not exist in the original sequences of the LINE-1 and OR4K15 ribozyme. We have included the publications and discussion about the peripheral domains in other ribozymes.</p><p>Line 458-463: The kobs of LINE-1-core was ~0.05 min-1 when measured in 10mM MgCl2 and 100mM KCl at pH 7.5 (Figure S13). Furthermore, the single-stranded ribozymes exhibited lower kobs (~0.03 min-1 for LINE-1-rbz) (Figure S14) when comparing with the bimolecular constructs. This confirms that the stem loop region SL2 does not contribute much to the cleavage activity of the TS-like ribozymes.</p><p>Line 570-576: Thus, a more sophisticated structure along with long-range interactions involving the SL4 region in the twister sister ribozyme must have helped to stabilize the catalytic region for the improved catalytic activity.

According to the original Science paper (Salehi-Ashtiani et al. Science 2006), the human genomic DNA (isolated from whole blood) was purchased from Clontech (Cat. 6550-1). In our study, we directly employed the sequences provided in Figure S2 of the Science paper for gene synthesis.

However, there is another region between approx. 124-131 nt and possibly even at positions 47 and 52 (to ~55), that could contribute to effective RNA cleavage, especially given the library design flaws (see below) and the lower mutational coverage for OR4K15. A possible correlation of the mutations in these regions is even visible in the CODA+MC analysis shown in Figure 1D on the left. Why are these regions ignored in ongoing experiments?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this question. As shown in Table S1, although the double mutation coverage of OR4K15-ori was low (16.2 %), we got 97.6 % coverage of single mutations. The relative activity of these single mutations was enough to identify the conserved regions in this ribozyme. Mutations at the positions mentioned by the reviewer did not lead to large reductions in relative activity. Since the relative activity of the original sequence is 1, we presumed that only positions with average relative activity much lower than 1 might contribute to effective cleavage.</p><p>Regarding the corresponding correlation of mutations in CODA+MC, they are considered as false positives generated from Monte Carlo simulated annealing (MC), because lack of support from the relative activity results.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Have the authors performed experiments with their &quot;functional regions&quot; in comparison to the full-length RNA or partial truncations of the full-length RNA that included, in the case of OR4K15, nt 47-131? Also for LINE-1 another stem region was mentioned (positions 14-18 with 30-34) and two additional base pairs. Were they included in experiments not shown as part of this manuscript?</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer for raising this question. We only compared the full-length or partial truncations of the LINE-1 ribozyme. Since the secondary structure predicted from OR4K15-ori data was almost the same as LINE-1, we didnât perform deep mutagenesis on the partial truncation of the OR4K15. However, the secondary structure of OR4K15 was confirmed by further biochemical experiments.</p><p>Regarding the second question, the additional base pairs were generated by Monte Carlo simulated annealing (MC). They are considered as false positives because of low probabilities and lack of support from the deep mutational scanning results. The appearance of false positives is likely due to the imperfection of the experiment-based energy function employed in current MC simulated annealing.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Are there other examples in the literature, where error-prone PCR generates biases towards A/T nucleotides as observed here?
