Here, we disentangled the effect of the host and the diet on the coexistence of four closely related <italic>Lactobacillus</italic> species colonizing the honey bee gut. We serially passaged the four species through gnotobiotic bees and in liquid cultures in the presence of either pollen (bee diet) or simple sugars. Although the four species engaged in negative interactions, they were able to stably coexist, both in vivo and in vitro. However, coexistence was only possible in the presence of pollen, and not in simple sugars, independent of the environment. Using metatranscriptomics and metabolomics, we found that the four species utilize different pollen-derived carbohydrate substrates indicating resource partitioning as the basis of coexistence. Our results show that despite longstanding host association, gut bacterial interactions can be recapitulated in vitro providing insights about bacterial coexistence when combined with in vivo experiments.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Microbes colonize nearly every environment on Earth, from the ocean and soil to the inner and outer surfaces of animals, such as the gut or skin. They form communities that are usually made up of a diverse range of bacteria, often containing closely related species – a key factor for a successful community.</p><p>But closely related bacteria can battle for the same resources, so it is unclear how they manage to live alongside each other without competing against one another. While diet is thought to play a key role in enabling closely related bacterial species to co-exist in the gut of an animal, experimental evidence is lacking, due to the difficulty in replicating these systems in the laboratory.</p><p>One strategy for investigating microbial communities is using honeybees. A major dietary source for honeybees is pollen, which can also be applied in the laboratory to grow diverse types of bacteria found in the honeybee gut. In addition, scientists can generate bees that lack microbial communities in the gut, allowing them to add specific types of bacteria to study their impact.</p><p>Brochet et al. used this approach with Western honeybees to assess whether diet enables closely related bacteria to live alongside one another in the gut. First, they colonized bees that lacked gut microbes with four closely related bacteria of the genus <italic>Lactobacillus</italic>, alone or together, and fed the bees either sugar water or sugar water and pollen. After five days, the gut bacteria were analysed. This revealed that bees fed on sugar water only had one dominant <italic>Lactobacillus</italic> species present in their gut, while bees fed with additional pollen harboured all four <italic>Lactobacillus</italic> species. Further analysis of these four bacterial species revealed that each of them activates distinct genes when grown on pollen, allowing the different species to consume specific nutrients from broken down pollen.</p><p>These findings show that closely related bacteria can coexist in the gut by sharing the different nutrients provided in the diet of the host. Consequently, differences in dietary intake in honeybees and other animals may affect the diversity of gut bacteria, and potentially the health of an animal.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>honey bee</kwd><kwd>lactobacillus firm5</kwd><kwd>gut microbiota</kwd><kwd>bacterial coexistence</kwd><kwd>niche partitioning</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010663</institution-id><institution>H2020 European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>714804</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Brochet</surname><given-names>Silvia</given-names></name><name><surname>Engel</surname><given-names>Philipp</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001711</institution-id><institution>Swiss National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>31003A_179487</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Quinn</surname><given-names>Andrew</given-names></name><name><surname>Neuschwander</surname><given-names>Nicolas</given-names></name><name><surname>Engel</surname><given-names>Philipp</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001711</institution-id><institution>Swiss National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>51NF40_180575</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Engel</surname><given-names>Philipp</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001711</institution-id><institution>Swiss National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>31003A_160345</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Engel</surname><given-names>Philipp</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000854</institution-id><institution>Human Frontier Science Program</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RGY0077/2016</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Engel</surname><given-names>Philipp</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Experiments in gnotobiotic bees and culture tubes can recapitulate gut microbiota coexistence patterns observed in nature.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Gut microbial communities are usually dominated by few bacterial phyla and families, but contain a high extent of species- and strain-level diversity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Ley et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dethlefsen et al., 2007</xref>). According to the competition-relatedness hypothesis, the more closely two organisms are related the more likely it is that they will compete and exclude each other due to overlapping niches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Elton, 1946</xref>). Therefore, it has remained unclear how closely related microbes can be maintained in the gut, or in any other natural microbial ecosystem.</p><p>The high concentration of nutrients and the structured environment of the gut may allow functionally redundant species or strains to coexist (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Ley et al., 2006</xref>). The host may even select for such redundancy, as it can increase the stability and resilience of the microbiota against environmental disturbance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Ley et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Foster et al., 2017</xref>). Phage predation can also contribute to the maintenance of diversity by imposing kill-the-winner dynamics and hindering the outgrowth of a single dominant strain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Koskella and Brockhurst, 2014</xref>). Another possibility is that closely related species, and even strains of the same species, have functionally diverged from each other and occupy distinct ecological niches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chesson, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bittleston et al., 2019</xref>). The genomic flexibility of bacteria facilitates adaptation to different nutrients, provided in the diet or by the host (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Berasategui et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Martens et al., 2008</xref>), or result from interactions with other bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Madi et al., 2020</xref>), such as cross-feeding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Goldford et al., 2018</xref>) or cooperative glycan breakdown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Rakoff-Nahoum et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Few experimental studies have investigated the coexistence of bacteria in host-associated microbial communities. The high diversity in these ecosystems and the resistance of many host-associated bacteria to experimental manipulations introduce considerable challenges for such approaches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Ortiz et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Venturelli et al., 2018</xref>). Moreover, community dynamics observed in vivo can be difficult to reproduce under laboratory conditions, as the host presents a highly specialized nutritional and spatial environment. Thus, there is a need for in vitro models that can reproduce ecological interactions observed in vivo, from simple co-culturing setups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Li et al., 2019</xref>) to sophisticated ‘organoids-on-a-chip’ systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Jalili-Firoozinezhad et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Nikolaev et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>The gut microbiota of the Western honey bee (<italic>Apis mellifera</italic>) is composed of a few deep-branching phylogenetic lineages (phylotypes) belonging to the Firmicutes, Actinobacteria, and Proteobacteria phyla (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Martinson et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kwong and Moran, 2016</xref>). Most of these lineages are composed of several closely related sequence-discrete populations, hereafter referred to as species, each of which contains further diversity at the strain-level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Ellegaard and Engel, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ellegaard and Engel, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Engel et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Ellegaard et al., 2015</xref>). Microbiota-depleted bees can be generated and experimentally colonized with synthetic communities of different strains. Moreover, most community members can be cultured in pollen, which is the major dietary source of honey bees (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kešnerová et al., 2017</xref>). This experimental tractability offers an excellent opportunity to probe the coexistence of bacteria in the gut of their native host and in controlled laboratory cultures using similar nutritional conditions.</p><p>One of the most abundant and diverse phylotype of the honey bee gut microbiota is <italic>Lactobacillus</italic> Firm5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ellegaard and Engel, 2019</xref>). This phylotype consists of facultative anaerobes that ferment sugars into organic acids and utilize various pollen-derived glycosylated plant compounds, such as flavonoids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kešnerová et al., 2017</xref>). <italic>Lactobacillus</italic> Firm5 is specific to social bees but has diverged into many different species of which four are specifically associated with the Western honey bee, <italic>Apis mellifera: Lactobacillus apis</italic> (Lapi), <italic>Lactobacillus helsingborgensis</italic> (Lhel), <italic>Lactobacillus melliventris</italic> (Lmel), and <italic>Lactobacillus kullabergensis</italic> (Lkul). The four species are consistently present in the gut of individual honey bees suggesting that they can share the available niches and stably coexist despite their phylogenetic relatedness. Genomic analysis has revealed that these species share &lt;85% pairwise average nucleotide identities (gANI) and exhibit high levels of genomic variation in terms of carbohydrate metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ellegaard and Engel, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Ellegaard et al., 2015</xref>). However, whether the coexistence is facilitated by adaptation to different nutritional niches, and to what extent the host environment, the diet, or the interactions with other community members matter is currently unknown.</p><p>Here, we tested under which conditions the four <italic>Lactobacillus</italic> Firm5 species can coexist and investigated the underlying molecular mechanism. We serially passaged the four species in vivo through gnotobiotic bees and in vitro in liquid cultures, and applied RNA sequencing and metabolomics analysis. Our results show that the coexistence of the four species is mediated by the partitioning of nutrients derived from the pollen diet of bees and is largely independent from the presence of the host or other community members.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>The coexistence of four related <italic>Lactobacillus</italic> species in the honey bee gut depends on the host diet</title><p>All experiments in this study were conducted with four bacterial isolates representing the four <italic>Lactobacillus</italic> Firm5 species (Lapi, Lhel, Lmel, and Lkul) associated with the Western honey bee. We first tested if the four species can establish in the gut of gnotobiotic bees under two different dietary conditions. To this end, we colonized microbiota-depleted bees with each of the four species, alone or together, and fed bees either sterilized sugar water (SW) or sterilized sugar water and pollen (SW+PG). Five days post-colonization, we assessed the bacterial loads in the gut by counting CFUs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>). When mono-colonized, the four species established in the gut of microbiota-depleted bees independent of the dietary treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). In the SW treatment, the colonization levels were generally lower than in the SW+PG treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, ANOVA q-value &lt; 0.01) confirming previous results that pollen increases the total bacterial load in the gut (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kešnerová et al., 2020</xref>). There was no statistically significant difference between the total bacterial loads of the mono-colonizations and the co-colonizations in either dietary treatment, with the exception of the mono-colonization with Lkul, which showed higher loads than the co-colonizations in SW (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, ANOVA q-value &lt; 0.01). Consequently, the sum of the bacterial loads of the mono-colonizations exceeded the total bacterial load of the co-colonizations in both dietary treatments, suggesting that the species engage in negative interactions when colonizing the honey bee gut together.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>The presence of dietary pollen facilitates the stable coexistence of the four <italic>Lactobacillus</italic> species in the honey bee gut.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Bacterial abundance (CFUs) in the gut of gnotobiotic bees (n = 7–10) colonized with the four species separately or together under two different dietary conditions.

Therefore, the average limit of detection and the 95% confidence intervals are shown.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-68583-fig1-v4.tif"/></fig><p>To test if the four species can stably coexist in the bee gut, we serially passaged the community seven times in microbiota-depleted bees under both dietary conditions (SW and SW+PG). After each passage (i.e. after 5 days of colonization), we used amplicon sequencing of a discriminatory housekeeping gene fragment (see Materials and methods) in combination with CFU counting to determine the absolute abundance of each species in the community. We observed clear differences between the two dietary conditions in the ability of the four species to coexist across the passages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B–C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref>). In the SW treatment, all species were initially detectable in most samples (P1, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). However, three species (Lapi, Lmel and Lkul) steadily decreased in abundance in the subsequent passages resulting in a rapid dominance of Lhel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Lmel and Lkul reached the detection limit and Lapi decreased to around 10<sup>4</sup> bacteria/gut by passage five (P5, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Only Lhel was stably maintained across all seven passages and was present at around 1000x higher abundance than Lapi at the end of the experiment (~10<sup>7</sup> bacteria/gut, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). In the contrary, in the SW+PG treatment, all four species were detectable in all passages at around 10<sup>6</sup> to 10<sup>8</sup> bacteria/gut, and displayed a highly stable abundance profile over time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>).</p><p>In summary, these findings show that the four species can stably coexist in vivo when bees are fed pollen, but not when they are only fed sugar water. This is consistent with the idea that pollen facilitates niche partitioning in the honey bee gut by offering competing species different ecological niches facilitating their coexistence.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>In vitro co-culture experiments recapitulate the nutrient-dependent coexistence of the four <italic>Lactobacillus</italic> species</title><p>We next tested if the four species can also coexist in vitro, outside of the host environment, under different nutrient conditions. To this end, we cultured the species alone or together in minimal medium supplemented with either glucose (G), pollen extract (PE), or entire pollen grains (PG). All four species were able to grow when cultured alone under the three nutrient conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>). Growth yields of Lhel, Lkul, and the co-culture were slightly lower in PE and PG than in G, and Lmel showed lower growth yields than some of the other species in PE and G (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>, ANOVA q-value &lt; 0.01). As in vivo, the total bacterial loads of the co-cultures were not consistently different from those of the mono-cultures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>), suggesting that the four species have overlapping metabolic niches and engage in negative interactions with each other.</p><p>We then serially passaged the co-cultures 21 times under the three different nutrient conditions by transferring an aliquot after 24 hr of growth into fresh culture medium (1:20). The absolute abundance of each strain was determined after every other passage by combining amplicon sequencing with qPCR (see Materials and methods). As for the in vivo experiment, we observed clear differences in the growth dynamics of the four species, both over time and between the glucose and the pollen culture conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref>). In the presence of glucose, three of the four species (Lhel, Lmel, and Lkul) steadily decreased in abundance over time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>), with two of them reaching the limit of detection (&lt;10<sup>5</sup> bacteria/ml) after about 11 passages (P11). In contrast, Lapi was stably maintained at high abundance (10<sup>9</sup> bacteria/ml) until the last passage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>) and hence dominated the co-culture for most of the transfer experiment. In the presence of PE or PG, the four species revealed very different growth behaviors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B and C</xref>).

In three of the four species (Lmel, Lhel, and Lkul), this category was significantly enriched among the upregulated genes (Fisher’s exact test, p&lt;0.01, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp6">Supplementary file 6</xref>). The largest fraction of the upregulated COG G genes encoded PTS transporters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp5">Supplementary file 5</xref>), followed by other sugar transporters (e.g. ABC transporters), and enzymes involved in sugar cleavage and conversion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>).

While most of the differentially expressed genes (89%) belonged to gene families with homologs in multiple species, differential expression was typically observed for just one of the species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E–F</xref>). This suggests that the presence of pollen triggers distinct transcriptional changes in the four species during gut colonization. Indeed, gene annotation analysis allowed us to identify several species-specific metabolic functions among the differentially regulated genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp5">Supplementary file 5</xref>). For example, Lhel specifically upregulated three PTS gene clusters for the uptake and metabolism of sugar alcohols and one gene cluster for ribose utilization. In contrast, Lmel upregulated several gene clusters involved in the cleavage of xylose, mannose, rhamnose, and arabinose from polysaccharides or other glycosylated compounds. Lmel also upregulated a gene cluster for the synthesis and the transport of bacteriocins in the presence of pollen. Lkul upregulated a starch utilization gene cluster, which in part was also differentially regulated in Lmel. In addition, this species upregulated an oligopeptide transporter gene cluster that was present in some of the other strains but not differentially regulated. The fourth species, Lapi, also differentially expressed genes belonging to COG ‘G’ (mainly PTS transporters), but fewer ones, and with similar functional annotations as found in the other three species. However, Lapi was the only species that upregulated two conserved deoxycytidine kinase genes encoding enzymes involved in nucleoside salvage pathways.</p><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>The four <italic>Lactobacillus</italic> species upregulate different carbohydrate metabolism functions during gut colonization of gnotobiotic bees.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Lhel, (<bold>B</bold>) Lmel, (<bold>C</bold>) Lkul, (<bold>D</bold>) Lapi.

Lhel, Lmel, and Lkul upregulated genes for the uptake and metabolism of glycerol.

As in vivo, Carbohydrate transport and metabolism (COG ‘G’) was the predominant functional category among the upregulated genes in the presence of pollen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>) and enriched in all eight comparisons (four species, each alone or in co-culture, Fisher’s exact test p-value &lt; 0.01, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp8">Supplementary file 8</xref>). Moreover, 25.3–36.9% of the genes upregulated in vivo were also upregulated in vitro in the presence of pollen. In particular, the species-specific carbohydrate metabolism functions described above (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>) showed a similar transcriptional response to pollen in vivo and in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). In contrast, most of the putative adhesin genes upregulated in vivo were not upregulated in vitro during growth in pollen or had relatively low transcripts per million (TPM). This suggests that these genes are either expressed in response to the host environment, or the presence of entire pollen grains or sugar water, both of which were only included in the in vivo but not in the in vitro experiment (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp9">Supplementary file 9</xref>). It is also noteworthy that fewer genes were downregulated than upregulated in pollen relative to glucose, and that the COG category ‘G’ was not enriched among the downregulated genes, which is concordant with our in vivo transcriptome analysis. (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp8">Supplementary file 8</xref>). Based on these results, we conclude that each species upregulates specific operons for the transport and utilization of different carbohydrates (e.g. sugar alcohols and glycans) in response to the presence of pollen, independent of the host environment.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>The presence of other community members has little impact on the transcriptional profile of the four species</title><p>We found that a large fraction of the genes upregulated in PE relative to G in the mono-cultures were also upregulated in the co-cultures (58.2–87.8%, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>).

This was confirmed by the direct comparison of mono-culture and co-culture conditions. In comparison to the nutritional treatments, fewer genes (9–149 genes) were differentially expressed between co-culture and mono-culture treatments (log<sub>2</sub>FC ≥ |2| and p-value≤0.01), (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>).</p><p>We could not find any consistent pattern across the four species in terms of COG category enrichment (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp8">Supplementary file 8</xref>).

Citrate fermentation genes were upregulated in Lkul in co-culture relative to mono-culture when grown in pollen, whereas in Lhel the opposite was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>). Also of note, the oligopeptide transporter system which was upregulated in vivo in Lkul in the presence of pollen, was also upregulated in vitro in the presence of pollen, but only when other species were present. These two specific examples show that a few metabolic functions are differentially regulated in response to other bacteria, but not always in the same direction across species, or only in a specific nutrient condition.

All four species showed mixed substrate utilization, that is they utilized several substrates simultaneously. Moreover, most substrates were utilized by all four species, but often at different rates. Many metabolites that we identified with the GC-MS had annotations comparable to the ones found in the Q-TOF-based experiment. For example, we detected a compound annotated as sugar alcohol, that is glucitol, that was consumed most efficiently by Lhel as observed in the previous analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>).

This could indicate that Lmel has specialized in the metabolism of pollen-derived glycosylated compounds (such as rutin, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B–C</xref>) at the expense of fast consumption of generic substrates, which accords with the upregulation of several gene clusters for the cleavage of such sugars from polysaccharides or other glycosides (e.g. flavonoids) in presence of pollen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>).</p><p>In summary, our metabolomics results show that the four species specialize in the utilization of different pollen-derived compounds, and that the observed metabolite changes are to some extent consistent with the transcriptional changes observed in the presence of pollen relative to the presence of simple sugars.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Ecological processes governing the coexistence of microbes have been probed in the laboratory using microbial communities of different complexity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Goldford et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Ortiz et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Wright and Vetsigian, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Friedman et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Piccardi et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Deines et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Logan, 2017</xref>).

In particular, little is known about the extent to which closely related species and strains can be stably maintained (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bittleston et al., 2019</xref>). We capitalized on the experimental tractability of honey bees and their gut microbiota and used a bottom-up approach to study the coexistence of four closely related, naturally co-occurring <italic>Lactobacillus</italic> species. We disentangled the effect of the diet and the host on the interactions between the four species by serially passaging them through gnotobiotic bees or in culture tubes, under two nutrient conditions (pollen versus simple sugars). Our results show that the dynamics in the four-species community is governed by negative interactions, because the growth of each member was lower in co-culture than in mono-culture, independent of the environment (host or culture tube) and the nutrient condition (pollen or simple sugars). This is consistent with previous observations that negative interactions predominate in nutrient-rich environments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Piccardi et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Foster and Bell, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Berry and Widder, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Coyte et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Ghoul and Mitri, 2016</xref>). Moreover, the four <italic>Lactobacillus</italic> species harbor relatively small genomes (1.5–2 Mb) with a conserved and streamlined core metabolism and similar auxotrophies, suggesting overlapping nutritional requirements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Ellegaard et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Ellegaard et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kwong and Moran, 2016</xref>).</p><p>The coexistence of bacterial symbionts can be facilitated by the host, for example by providing a spatially structured environment that results in the physical separation of competing strains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gude et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kim et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Mitri et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hallatschek et al., 2007</xref>), or by secreting metabolites that support niche specialization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Schluter and Foster, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">McLoughlin et al., 2016</xref>). However, in the case of the four <italic>Lactobacillus</italic> species, such host-related features seem not to be sufficient to support coexistence, because the four-species community was rapidly dominated by a single species, when passaged through gnotobiotic bees that were fed a simple sugar diet. In contrast, when providing a more diverse nutrition in the form of pollen, we found that the four species were stably maintained both in vivo and in vitro. We thus conclude that the coexistence of the four <italic>Lactobacillus</italic> species in the honey bee gut primarily depends on the pollen diet of the host and not the host environment itself.</p><p>The challenges in replicating the native environment such that it is possible to study relevant interactions of host-associated microbes in vitro are formidable. These were highlighted in a recent study on the microbial community associated with the freshwater polyp hydra that could not recapitulate the coexistence of the dominant microbiota members in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Deines et al., 2020</xref>). Here, we aimed to approximate the nutritional conditions in the honey bee gut by culturing the bacteria in pollen infused media, that is the natural diet of bees. In both the in vivo and in vitro transfer experiment, we assessed the effect of pollen on the dynamics of the community by comparing it to a simple sugar treatment. Although not identical, the nutritional conditions in vitro were sufficiently similar as to recapitulate the overall community dynamics observed in vivo: pollen nutrients supported the stable coexistence of the four species, while the simple sugars led to the dominance of a single species. As the bee and members of the bee gut microbiota pre-digest pollen and sugars upstream of the rectum, it is difficult to exactly replicate the metabolic environment of the rectum. For example, sucrose is largely absorbed via the midgut epithelium and cleaved into glucose and fructose by host enzymes, while fermentative bacteria such as <italic>Gilliamella apicola</italic> degrade and modify a diverse range of carbohydrates in the ileum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kešnerová et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Crailsheim, 1988</xref>). These metabolic alterations may explain some of the differences observed between the in vivo and in vitro experiments, such as the dominance of different species in the simple sugar conditions (sucrose and glucose, respectively). We therefore suspect that different species would dominate in vitro or in vivo with an alternative simple sugar composition.</p><p>Our findings are consistent with the consumer-resource model, which predicts that the number of species that can coexist depends on the number of available resources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Tilman, 1986</xref>). Correspondingly, in the presence of a single substrate, such as in the case of glucose in vitro, competition for the same nutrient results in the competitive exclusion of all but one species. However, depending on the nutrient availability, the dietary transit time, the crosstalk with the host, or the spatial structure of the gut, the ecological processes governing bacterial coexistence may differ across host-associated microbiomes. For example, the <italic>Lactobacillus</italic> species of the honey bee gut microbiota primarily colonize the luminal space of the rectum, where partially digested pollen accumulates. In contrast, some of the Proteobacteria of the bee gut microbiota adhere to the epithelial surface of the ileum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Zheng et al., 2018</xref>). We expect that in the latter case interactions with the host play a more important role for microbial coexistence than in the case of the Lactobacilli in the rectum.</p><p>Although ecological interactions in bacterial communities have been investigated across a wide range of experimental systems, few studies have tackled the molecular mechanisms underlying coexistence. In some cases, cross-feeding of metabolic by-products facilitates the maintenance of diversity in bacterial communities, such as after passaging leaf and soil samples in single carbon sources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Goldford et al., 2018</xref>). However, cross-feeding does not seem to play an important role in maintaining coexistence of the four <italic>Lactobacillus</italic> species in this study. Unlike the above example, feeding a single carbon source led to the extinction of all but one species. Our metabolomics analysis also did not reveal any major metabolites that could potentially be cross-fed, that is were produced by one species and utilized by another. Finally, we identified no transcriptional changes that would suggest cross-feeding activities when comparing mono-cultures and co-cultures of the four <italic>Lactobacillus</italic> species.</p><p>Instead, our combined transcriptomics and metabolomics analyses suggest that coexistence is facilitated by specialization toward distinct pollen-derived nutrients. We found that all four species upregulated carbohydrate transport and metabolism functions dedicated to the utilization of different carbon sources in the presence of pollen when colonizing the bee gut, and these changes were reproducible in vitro. Our metabolomics analysis identified a number of pollen-derived glycosides that were utilized in a species-specific manner. In particular, Lmel specialized in the utilization of flavonoids at the expense of simple sugars, which may explain why this species rapidly went extinct in presence of only simple sugars during the transfer experiments. While the importance of pollen-derived flavonoids in niche partitioning needs to be validated, the species-specific deglycosylation of these secondary plant compounds illustrates that the four species have different hydrolytic capabilities that may also be involved in the cleavage of other carbohydrates. The metabolic specialization on plant glycans may be a common phenomenon in animal gut communities, as similar transcriptional changes have been described in other gut symbionts when the host diet was supplemented with specific plant glycans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Sonnenburg et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Zheng et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>In contrast to the species specific metabolism of glycoside, we observed few differences in the utilization of simple saccharides among the four species in our time-resolved GC-MS analysis. While this may seem surprising, theoretical work has established that resource preference for at least one substrate is sufficient to explain coexistence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Meszéna et al., 2006</xref>). Moreover, it is plausible that the four species utilize the same sugars, but extract them from different pollen-derived glycans, such as starch, hemicellulose, flavonoids, or other glycosylated secondary plant metabolites.</p><p>While this work focused on niche partitioning based on degradation of complex carbohydrates, it is noteworthy that all four <italic>Lactobacillus</italic> species engaged to a variable extent in co-fermentation of the carboxylic acids citrate and malate present in pollen. The two species, Lkul and Lhel, that upregulated citrate fermentation pathways in the presence of pollen also consumed citrate at the fastest rate. Citrate co-fermentation has been linked to competitive advantages in lactic acid bacteria, though whether the varying levels of co-fermentation contribute to colonization stability in this system remains an outstanding question (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Laëtitia et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Magni et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Jimeno et al., 1995</xref>).</p><p>Previous work suggested that the large diversity of carbohydrate transport and metabolism functions in the accessory gene pool of <italic>Lactobacillus</italic> Firm5 is an adaptation to the pollen-based diet of the host and a consequence of the nutrient competition with closely related species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ellegaard and Engel, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Ellegaard et al., 2019</xref>). Our findings support this hypothesis and provide the first experimental evidence for a link between the coexistence of the four <italic>Lactobacillus</italic> species, the large diversity of carbohydrate metabolism functions in their genomes, and the pollen diet of the host. Moreover, these results suggest that dietary differences between host species or natural variation in pollen diversity influence the diversity of <italic>Lactobacillus</italic> Firm5 and could, for example explain why the Asian honey bee, <italic>Apis cerana,</italic> harbors only one species of this phylotype in its gut (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Ellegaard et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>However, we have only tested a single strain of each of the four species. Therefore, given the extensive genomic diversity within these species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ellegaard and Engel, 2019</xref>), more work is needed to determine if the identified patterns of coexistence reflect stable ecological niches occupied by the four species or are rather the result of the specific strains selected for our experiments. In a recent study on pitcher plant microbiomes, it was shown that even strains that differ by only a few base pairs can have different ecological trajectories in communities and coexist over extended period of time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bittleston et al., 2019</xref>). Expanding our approach to strains within species presents an exciting next step to understand at which level discrete ecological niches are defined in the bee gut and how diversity can be maintained in such ecosystems.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type <break/>(species) or resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th valign="top">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Strain, strain background (<italic>Lactobacillus apis</italic>)</td><td>Lapi</td><td><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.2003467">https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.2003467</ext-link></td><td>Genome ID: 2684622912</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td>Strain, strain background (<italic>Lactobacillus helsingborgensis</italic>)</td><td>Lhel</td><td><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.2003467">https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.2003467</ext-link></td><td>Genome ID: 2684622914</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td>Strain, strain background (<italic>Lactobacillus melliventris</italic>)</td><td>Lmel</td><td><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.2003467">https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.2003467</ext-link></td><td>Genome ID: 2684622913</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td>Strain, strain background (<italic>Lactobacillus kullabergensis</italic>)</td><td>Lkul</td><td><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.2003467">https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.2003467</ext-link></td><td>Genome ID: 2684622911</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td>Commercial assay or kit</td><td>QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit</td><td>Qiagen</td><td>#Cat 28706X4</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td>Commercial assay or kit</td><td>Nucleospin RNA clean-up kit</td><td>Macherey-Nagel</td><td>#Cat 740903</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td>Commercial assay or kit</td><td>Zymo-Seq RiboFree Total RNA Library kit</td><td>Zymo Research</td><td>#Cat R3000</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td>Software, algorithm</td><td>R Studio software</td><td>R Studio (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.rstudio.com">https://www.rstudio.com</ext-link>)</td><td>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_000432">SCR_000432</ext-link></td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td>Software, algorithm</td><td>Integrative Genomics Viewer</td><td>Integrative Genomics Viewer (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://software.broadinstitute.org/software/igv/">https://software.broadinstitute.org/software/igv/</ext-link>)</td><td>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_011793">SCR_011793</ext-link></td><td valign="top"/></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec id="s4-1"><title>Culturing of bacterial strains</title><p>We used the following four bacterial strains of Lhel, Lmel, Lapi, and Lkul for our experiments: ESL0183, ESL0184, ESL0185, and ESL0186 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kešnerová et al., 2017</xref>).

Counts per million were calculated and only genes with at least one count per million were used for the analysis. EdgeR fits negative binomial models to the data. The counts were normalized for RNA composition by adjusting the log<sub>2</sub>FC according to the library size, and the quantile-adjusted conditional maximum likelihood (qCML) method was used to estimate the common dispersion and the tag-wise dispersion. Finally, the differential gene expression was determined using the exact test with a false discovery rate (FDR) &lt;5%. COG annotations were obtained from IMG/mer, and the enrichment analysis for COG categories tested using the Fisher’s exact test. Transcripts per million (TPM) were visualized using the Integrated Genome Browser software (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Freese et al., 2016</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Untargeted metabolomics</title><p>Metabolites were extracted from liquid cultures supplemented with 10% (w/v) pollen extract at the inoculation time and after 16 hr of incubation at 34°C. For each liquid culture sample, 300 μL was collected and centrifuged (20,000 g, 4°C, 30 min), then 200 μL supernatant was transferred to a new tube and stored at −80°C. After collection of all samples, they were prepared for metabolomics analysis. The samples were thawed on ice and centrifuged again (20,000 g, 4°C, 5 min), then diluted 10 times with ddH<sub>2</sub>O. For metabolomics analysis, 25 μL of each diluted sample was sent in a 96-well plate on dry ice to the laboratory of Prof. Uwe Sauer for analysis (ETH Zürich, Switzerland). Three replicates of a pollen-extract dilution series (10 serial 2x dilutions) as well as undiluted pollen-extracts and water used for performing the dilution series were included in the metabolomics analysis. Because of the insolubility of flavonoid aglycones in a water matrix, metabolites from liquid cultures supplemented with rutin were extracted using a methanol-extraction protocol at the time of inoculation and after 16 hr of growth by adding 200 μL of methanol pre-cooled to −20°C to 100 μL of culture. Tubes were vortexed thoroughly and incubated for 5 min (4°C, shaking 14,000 rpm). Samples where then incubated at −20 °C for 1 hr and centrifuged (20’000 g, 5 min). A total of 200 μL of the supernatant was transferred to a new tube and diluted 10 times in 70% methanol and 25 μL of each diluted sample was sent to Zürich in Eppendorf tubes sealed with parafilm on dry ice. For untargeted metabolomics analysis, each sample was injected twice (technical replicate) into an Agilent 6550 time-of-flight mass spectrometer (ESI-iFunnel Q-TOF, Agilent Technologies) as detailed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kešnerová et al., 2017</xref>. In brief, m/z features (ions) were annotated by matching their accurate mass-to-sum formulas of compounds in the KEGG database accounting for deprotonation (-H<sup>+</sup>). Alternative annotation can be found in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp10">Supplementary file 10</xref>. When available, metabolites categories were assigned to ions based on KEGG ontology.</p><p>Metabolomics data analysis was carried out using R version 3.6.3. Variation of raw ion intensities obtained from untargeted metabolomics analysis for the two technical replicates was determined by assessing the correlation between ion intensities of the respective technical replicates. Then, mean ion intensities of technical replicates were calculated. Time point comparisons (T = 0 hr vs T = 16 hr) were performed using t-tests with Benjamini-Hochberg (BH) correction for multiple testing. log<sub>2</sub>FC values between the two time-points were calculated with respect to the mean intensity in the T0 time point. To identify pollen-derived ions, and distinguish them from background originating from culture medium and experimental noise, the ion intensities of the pollen dilution series were plotted for each ion and the R (2) of the obtained linear fit was extracted. In addition, we calculated the log<sub>2</sub>FC difference between undiluted pollen and water. The R (2) values were then plotted against the log<sub>2</sub>FC values, and stringent thresholds (R<sub>2</sub> &gt; 0.75 and log<sub>2</sub>FC &gt; 2) were chosen to discriminate ions that are likely pollen-derived (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3</xref>). All ions were included for downstream analysis (e.g. PCA) and then they were discriminated between pollen-derived and non-pollen-derived.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Semi-targeted metabolomics via GC-MS</title><p>Soluble metabolites were extracted from liquid cultures supplemented with 10% pollen extract (w/v) at the inoculation time and after 8, 16, and 24 hr of incubation. For each liquid culture sample, 300 μL was collected and centrifuged (15,000 g, 4°C, 15 min). Then, 200 μL was transferred to a new tube, snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80°C. Once that all the samples were collected, soluble metabolites were extracted. To extract soluble metabolites, tubes were thawed on ice, and 75 μL of sample was combined with 5 μL of 20 mM internal standard (norleucine and norvaline, (Sigma-Aldrich) and U-<sup>13</sup>C<sub>6</sub> glucose [Cambridge Isotope laboratories]). A volume of 825 μL of cold methanol:water:chloroform (5:2:2) solution was added to the sample and vortexed for 30 s. The tubes were incubated at −20°C for 90 min and vortexed 2x for 30 s during the incubation. Tubes were centrifuged for 5 min at 10,000 g at 4°C. The supernatant was removed and extraction was repeated using 400 μL of ice cold chloroform:methanol (1:1), tubes were vortexed and left on ice for 30 min. Tubes were centrifuged 5 min at 8000 rpm at 4°C and the liquid phase was transferred to the previous extracted aqueous phase. A total of 200 μL of water was added and tubes were centrifuged 5 min at 8000 rpm. The aqueous phase was transferred to a 2 mL microcentrifuge tube. The aqueous extract was dried using a vacuum concentrator at ambient temperature overnight (Univapo 150 ECH vacuum concentrator centrifuge). Once dried, the samples were dissolved in 50 μL of 20 mg/ml methoxyamine hydrochloride in pyridine for 1.5 hr at 33°C followed by derivatization with N-Methyl-N-(trymethylsolyl)trifluoroacetamide (MSTFA, Sigma Aldrich) for 2 hr at 35°C.</p><p>Aliquots (1 μL) were injected on an Agilent 8890/5977B GC-MSD. The samples were injected in split mode (20:1) with an inlet temperature of 250°C. The VF-5ms (30 m x 250 μm x 0.25 μm) column was held initially at 125°C for 2 min, ramped at 5°C / min to 250°C, ramped at 15°C to 300°C, and held for 5 min. The MS was run in full scan mode (50–500 m/z) at a speed of 5 Hz. Peaks from the total ion chromatogram (TIC) were identified by matching retention times and spectra to an in-house library that was built by comparing selected T=0h and T=24h samples against the NIST library, as well as our library of analytical standards. Compounds are noted as either confirmed with our own standards, or the best match and associated matching factor against the NIST library are reported (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp10">Supplementary file 10</xref>). Peaks were picked and integrated using the Agilent MassHunter Quantitative Analysis software. Peak areas were normalized to the internal standards. The data were processed using R version 3.6.3 and mean intensities and log<sub>2</sub>FC between time-points were calculated as described above for the untargeted metabolomics analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Analysis-code and data availability</title><p>The complete custom code for all the analyses is available on GitHub: (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/silviabrochet/Brochet_2021_eLife">https://github.com/silviabrochet/Brochet_2021_eLife</ext-link>, copy archived at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://archive.softwareheritage.org/swh:1:dir:16c27686b491f4891b450ee51815d6fe11fdcdec;origin=https://github.com/silviabrochet/Brochet_2021_eLife;visit=swh:1:snp:77902562ef58804af850328001cd27a512f2f5a0;anchor=swh:1:rev:237a27f757296372f0333d298dfb7c765686fe03">swh:1:rev:237a27f757296372f0333d298dfb7c765686fe03</ext-link>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brochet, 2021</xref>).

To address this question, the authors use an elegant model, relying on honeybees colonized with a defined bacterial community. They provide compelling empirical evidence that a nutritionally complex diet, together with microbial metabolic diversity, play a key role, enabling species partitioned resource utilization and co-existence of closely related honeybee gut microbiota.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Niche partitioning facilitates coexistence of closely related gut bacteria&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, including Karina Xavier as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Christian Rutz as Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision letter to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential Revisions (for the authors):</p><p>In general, all three reviewers found the work exciting and solid, and thus suitable for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>. Below is a list of essential revisions to help improve the clarity and presentation of the work. Additionally, you can find at the end of this letter, for context, the separate &quot;recommendations for the authors&quot; written by the individual reviewers. We hope you will use this information to improve your manuscript, but you do not need to reply to the comments raised by the reviewers -- you will only need to reply to the following essential points summarized here:</p><p>1) The experimental design chosen for the in vitro cultures is not clear. It is not clear why a sucrose solution (SW) was used for the in vivo studies and glucose was used for the in vitro studies and why a &quot;simple sugar + pollen&quot; group was not included in the in vitro study. Since we believe it is unlikely to affect the major findings of the paper where comparisons of simple sugars and more complex diets are made, we are not asking for additional experiments. But we think it is important that you explain your rationale, and discuss if and how these choices may impact your results.</p><p>2) You do not explore much the mechanisms that can explain the lack of persistence observed under the simple diet. We acknowledge that a comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms involved in the simple diet are beyond the scope of the present paper, given that here you provide a clear proposal of the more interesting problem, that is the co-existence and persistence in the complex diet. However, we think that the paper could improve with an added analysis and/or discussion with the current data of possible mechanisms involved (see major comment 1 of Reviewer #1, point 4 of Reviewer #2, and point 2 of Reviewer #3).</p><p>3) Please justify more clearly your choice of study organisms, and in the discussion, comment on how your findings can be extended to the related bumble bee gut microbiome (see point 5 of Reviewer #2, and point 1 of Reviewer #3).</p><p>4) It is important to make available the genome-wide data for the RNA-seq results, not just for selected genes.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1. The current study does not explore what happens in the simplified diet both in vitro and in the Bee gut. The authors propose in the discussion that in the presence of few and simple carbon sources (sugars) there is competition for nutrients and competitive exclusion is driving extinction of most species and domination of a single species. However, there is not much experimental support for this conclusion. Can this be explained by competitive exclusion? Is there transcriptomics (or genomic data) in this study that supports this possibility? If the data cannot provide strong hypothesis for competitive exclusion by nutrition competition in the simplified environment the authors should discuss other possible mechanisms that could explain such phenotypes in the simplified diets.</p><p>2. One point that it is not address is the number of calories provided by the different diets. Could it be that the simplified diet is also lower in calories (and thus more a limiting) and that differences in calories (as opposed to the different number of nutrient sources) could contribute to the results observed?</p><p>3. Regarding experimental design it is not clear why a sucrose solution (SW) was used for the in vivo studies and Glucose was used for the in vitro studies. Additionally, in vitro the results with pollen grains were better in promoting persistence than the Pollen extracts, but the follow up studies were performed with pollen extract that enables persistence but not as well. The authors should explain the rationale for these choices and discuss if these choices may or may not have impact on the results obtained.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Overarching comments:</p><p>1. My ability to make specific comments was hindered by the lack of line numbers and page numbers in the merged document. Perhaps these fell out of the compiled version, but if not, I urge the authors to include page numbers and line numbers in their future submissions.</p><p>2. I found it confusing that the bee diet conditions contrasted were pollen+sugar water or just sugar water, but the culture conditions contrasted were pollen (extract or granulated) or sugar water. I think that this may impact some statements that the authors are making regarding the comparison between in vitro and in vivo. I've noted specific cases in my comments below but wanted to reiterate this overarching concern here. Could the authors comment on the decision to exclude the conditions pollen only bee diet and/or in vitro pollen+sugar water from this study?</p><p>Introduction</p><p>3. You are covering a lot of ground in the introduction- one thing that got lost for me until the second read through was that I think you specifically choose the Firm5 subset of the bee gut microbiota because of close taxonomic relatedness. Consider motivating the paragraph beginning &quot;One of the most prevalent phylotypes…&quot; so that this is clearer.</p><p>4. I think that you have very well thought out reasons for choosing the species and strains for this study, and I think that it would strengthen the manuscript to spend a little more time on this in the introduction. I'm not very familiar with the bee gut system, and my first impression was to wonder why so few strains were tested, and why the strains chosen were representative/good choices. Some of this you mentioned in the discussion- I think it would strengthen the manuscript to present these details sooner. Specific questions that I think need to be addressed in the introduction are: Why were <italic>Lactobacilli</italic> chosen specifically, over other major phylotypes? What fraction of the total bee gut diversity does this phylotype represent? Is there generally only one strain of a species present in the bee gut? How were strains chosen as representatives?</p><p>Section: The coexistence of four related <italic>Lactobacillus</italic> species in the honey bee gut depends on the host diet</p><p>5. I think it would help the reader to unpack the idea in your summary paragraph. This is the first place where niche partitioning is mentioned (partitioning is referred to in the abstract), and you don't define the term. I think the link between niche partitioning and your results is that pollen is a complex resource, and sugar water is not. From consumer-resource models, one would expect that there would be only one dominant competitor on one resource. If multiple resources are available, then one would expect that the community would be as diverse as the # of resources. Since pollen has &gt;4 resources, coexistence is possible if strains partition the resources they consume and do not compete directly.</p><p>6. I am <italic>not</italic> suggesting more experiments here, but have you considered seeing whether you could support the 4-member community on sugars found in pollen and detected as consumed by the metabolomics? Showing that this could work in a defined environment with these strains would be a nice (although not surprising) extension of the resource partitioning idea.</p><p>Section: in vitro co-culture experiments recapitulate the diet-dependent coexistence of the four <italic>Lactobacillus</italic> species</p><p>7. In culture, you observe higher yield for all four strains on glucose than on pollen or pollen extract, but you see the opposite in the bee gut. Have you followed up on why this might be? I ask because you are using yield as a proxy for 'niche space', and I think a fundamental assumption there is that resources that define the niches are limiting. If in culture a different resource is limiting (let's say resource B), then all of your strains might reach the same yield and stop growing due to resource B limitation before they have consumed all of the glucose or pollen. One way to determine whether glucose/ pollen limits yield would be to grow your strains on different concentrations of glucose/ pollen- if yield is dependent on the resource you are adding, you should see a linear relationship between the yield and the amount of glucose/pollen. I think that establishing that pollen or glucose is truly growth limiting in these experiments is critical if you want to make the statement that &quot;portioning of pollen-derived nutrients is sufficient for enabling coexistence&quot;.</p><p>8. Your experiments in bees use either sugar water or sugar water+pollen grains. But the experiments in this section use either pollen grains, pollen extract, or sugar. It would be a clearer comparison with the in vivo experiments if you showed coexsistence on pollen+sugar water. Without comparing the same conditions, I don't think that you can conclude from this section that &quot;In summary, these findings show that the dietary-dependent coexistence of the four <italic>Lactobacillus</italic> species observed in vivo can be recapitulated in vitro in a simple co- culture experiment, suggesting that the partitioning of pollen-derived nutrients is sufficient for enabling coexistence.&quot; I'd encourage the authors to re-phrase the summary and header for this section: I think that what is shown is that strains coexist on pollen but not on glucose, not that the diet-dependent coexistence has been recapitulated in vivo.</p><p>Section: The four <italic>Lactobacillus</italic> species upregulate divergent carbohydrate transport and metabolism functions during gut colonization in the presence of pollen</p><p>9. I find the down-regulation of amino-acid metabolism/transport genes in the SW+pollen condition to be interesting but counter-intuitive. Pollen is supplying dietary amino acids, whereas SW alone does not. Sometimes transcription becomes elevated when substrates are scarce, is there evidence in the literature that this could be the case?</p><p>10. Are the sugars transported/catabolized by the encoded COG G genes present in pollen?</p><p>11. I'm surprised that you didn't encounter problems with reads mapping to multiple reference genomes with HTSeq. The taxa share 85% gANI. I'd expect there to be some frequency of 100-mers sharing 1 SNP, which I understand from the results was the threshold for mapping reads to the genomes. I don't see any discussion of this in the text. Could you comment on what controls were done to explore the frequency of cross-mapping of reads?</p><p>12. Figure 4. My understanding of GH families is that they can be quite broad. For example, the GH16 family encompasses 15 different types of enzyme, not just the one cited in the figure. Could the authors provide more detailed information about why specific activities were attributed the GH families highlighted in the figure panels?</p><p>Section: Transcriptional responses to pollen are concordant in vivo and in vitro</p><p>13. Echoing my comments in the section about in vitro co-culturing, I'm wondering why the comparison was not glucose vs. glucose+pollen. In the host, when there is pollen available glucose is also available. Because of this, some of the differences between the in vitro pollen condition and the in vivo pollen+glucose condition might be transcripts that differentially expressed in response to glucose AND pollen, and not transcripts that are only expressed in the host. Because of this, I don't agree with the interpretation of the data that the transcriptional responses are concordant, and I think that the interpretation of differential expression to suggest that &quot;genes are specifically expressed in vivo&quot; is overly strong.</p><p>14. I think that these data can be used to make the overall point that the authors are presenting: the four strains do express different sugar-catabolism related genes when grown on pollen. Rather than comparing directly to the RNA-Seq from the host, I'd encourage the authors to focus instead on what their data show about the regulation of COG-G category genes in response to nutrient source. Specifically:</p><p>a. How does gene expression change between mono- and co-culture on the same carbon source?</p><p>b. If the strains differentially expressing genes when they are co-cultured, is a more diverse profile of COG-genes expressed, or do the strains tailor their expression?</p><p>c. I think there is only one direct comparison: co-culture communities on glucose. Are the COG genes differentially expressed the co-culture glucose community in vitro also the ones that are differentially expressed in the context of the in vivo community grown on glucose?</p><p>15. Supplementary Figure 3 indicates that some host samples profiled by RNASeq did not cluster by mds because of low read mapping. Please clarify if these samples were included in other analyses involving RNASeq data or if they were removed. If they were included, please comment on the rational for inclusion given low reads and lack of clustering.</p><p>Section: Metabolomics analysis reveals differences in flavonoid and sugar metabolism across the four <italic>Lactobacillus</italic> species</p><p>16. In studies of non-host associated microbial communities, an observation is that there is strain-level heterogeneity with respect to the profile of carbon sources consumed. From the metabolomics data, it looks as though some strains don't consume some carbon sources. Do you know whether all 4 strains can grow on the different carbon sources that you find by metabolomics in pollen, in particular the carbon sources that are most abundant in pollen?</p><p>Discussion:</p><p>17. I don't think that the comparison to hydra is fair- hydra microbiota assemble on the host epithelium, not a gut lumen.</p><p>18. You note that the primary site for colonization of <italic>Lactobacillus</italic> in the bee gut (the rectum) is known, and that other microbial taxa of the bee gut microbiota display different tissue tropism. I think that this is a really interesting point. Would we expect the dynamics of bee gut taxa with a closer host association to be different? Was the choice of strains motivated by the tissue tropism?</p><p>19. I'm surprised that you don't see evidence of cross-feeding on the complex resource. Do you think that this is due to the taxonomic similarity of the isolates (do you think crossfeeding is restricted to other phylotypes), or the small # used in this study, or that the community doesn't become limited for the resources in pollen? Can you differentiate among these possibilities with your data?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.68583.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1) The experimental design chosen for the in vitro cultures is not clear.

However, we need to keep in mind that whatever we would have fed to the bees, would have been pre-digested and partially absorbed by the host tissue in the midgut before it reaches the bacteria in the hindgut. For example, sucrose is cleaved by the bee into glucose and fructose and absorbed in the midgut. Consequently, the in vivo and in vitro conditions will never be the same even if we would have used identical treatments. Despite these inconsistencies between the in vivo and in vitro treatments, we agree with the reviewers that the experimental design is still valid to test the main hypothesis of our study, i.e. a complex, pollen-based diet facilitates coexistence, while the provisioning of simple sugars leads to the dominance of a single strain independent of the environment (culture tube versus host).</p><p>We have revised the discussion to acknowledge that the different sugar conditions may explain the differences in the relative abundance of community members between the in vitro and in vivo experiments. This can be found in the revised manuscript on lines 402-422.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) You do not explore much the mechanisms that can explain the lack of persistence observed under the simple diet. We acknowledge that a comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms involved in the simple diet are beyond the scope of the present paper, given that here you provide a clear proposal of the more interesting problem, that is the co-existence and persistence in the complex diet. However, we think that the paper could improve with an added analysis and/or discussion with the current data of possible mechanisms involved (see major comment 1 of Reviewer #1, point 4 of Reviewer #2, and point 2 of Reviewer #3).</p></disp-quote><p>We have addressed this point by adding a section in the discussion where we explain in more detail why we hypothesize that the lack of persistence of the four strains in the presence of the simple nutrients is due to competitive exclusion. The key point here is that each strain individually colonizes the bee gut, respectively grows in the culture tubes, in presence of the simple nutrients. However, when co-cultured only one strain persists in the simple nutrient condition, while in the presence of pollen all strains persist. The difference between these two conditions is the presence of pollen, i.e. a nutrient-rich substrate. The competitive exclusion principle states that two individuals can’t coexist if they compete for the same resource. The strain with the slightest growth advantage over the others will win, be it because it can utilize the available nutrient faster or actively inhibit the others in their growth. This is what our data suggests. We cannot see any other possible mechanism explaining this data.</p><p>The section in the discussion is found on line 423-435.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Please justify more clearly your choice of study organisms, and in the discussion, comment on how your findings can be extended to the related bumble bee gut microbiome (see point 5 of Reviewer #2, and point 1 of Reviewer #3).</p></disp-quote><p>We have addressed this point by restructuring the part of the introduction dedicated to <italic>Lactobacillus</italic> Firm5 on line 75-89. In brief, we chose this phylotype because (i) it is one of the most abundant phylotype of the honey bee gut microbiota, (ii) it is a very diverse phylotype that diverged into four different species which are different in their carbohydrate-utilization related gene content, (iii) the four species were shown to consistently coexist in vivo in conventional bees.</p><p>As for the bumble bee, or other social bee microbiota, we don’t know yet how many different lineages of <italic>Lactobacillus</italic> Firm5 coexist in other bees. Two different lineages of Firm5 have been found in bumble bees, but it is unclear if they coexist, neither is it known if these are the only two lineages associated with bumble bees. We feel that there is currently too little data to discuss how our results would relate to diversity found in other bee species. However, we added a sentence in the discussion which states that given the fact that the coexistence is based on pollen nutrients, it follows that dietary differences are likely to influence the diversity of <italic>Lactobacillus</italic> Firm5 in divergent host species.
