Here, we develop a neurocomputational account of how these social perceptions translate into social choice. Using a novel fMRI social perception task, we show that both merit and need perceptions recruited the brain’s social inference network. A behavioral computational model identified two non-exclusive mechanisms underlying variance in social perceptions: a consistent tendency to perceive others as meritorious/needy (bias) and a propensity to sample and integrate normative evidence distinguishing high from low merit/need in other people (sensitivity). Variance in people’s merit (but not need) bias and sensitivity independently predicted distinct aspects of altruism in a social choice task completed months later. An individual’s merit <italic>bias</italic> predicted <italic>context-independent</italic> variance in people’s overall other-regard during altruistic choice, biasing people toward prosocial actions. An individual’s merit <italic>sensitivity</italic> predicted <italic>context-sensitive</italic> discrimination in generosity toward high and low merit recipients by influencing other- and self-regard during altruistic decision-making. This context-sensitive perception–action link was associated with activation in the right temporoparietal junction. Together, these findings point toward stable, biologically based individual differences in perceptual processes related to abstract social concepts like merit, and suggest that these differences may have important behavioral implications for an individual’s tendency toward favoritism or discrimination in social settings.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="plain-language-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>The question of when and why humans are more likely to lend each other a hand has long been studied. In general, we are more likely to help those who appear more needy or deserving of help. This explains why there is often an outpouring of support after natural disasters and why people are more likely to assist children, who are perceived as being more ‘innocent.’</p><p>Unfortunately, people’s spontaneous judgments of need and merit can lead to adverse outcomes. For example, racial stereotyping influences our perceptions of who deserves support. Additionally, different people assess deservingness differently, leading to individual differences in whom we help.</p><p>Bas, Roberts et al. wanted to understand how people assess whether others need or deserve help and how this influences their decision to offer assistance (or not). To answer these questions, the researchers examined two competing hypotheses: some individuals may be more or less inclined to perceive others as needing and deserving help, regardless of the context. Alternatively, some people may be more sensitive to contextual cues signaling merit or need. These two processes could explain individual differences in how humans perceive need and deservingness, influencing decisions to help.</p><p>Bas, Roberts et al. developed a model of social perception that encompassed both of their hypotheses and designed a laboratory task that tested how social perceptions influence helping behavior. This approach measured two potential mechanisms for how social perception might influence choices: individuals could have a general bias that determines how inclined they are to perceive others as deserving or needy, or differences in sensitivity to integrating context-specific cues. Intriguingly, both mechanisms predicted their willingness to help strangers months later in a separate altruism task.</p><p>People who were biased towards perceiving others as deserving paid more attention to others' welfare when they had a chance to help and were more altruistic. People who were more sensitive to context cues around deservingness were more likely to discriminate between others, assisting those perceived as deserving help while withholding aid from supposedly non-deserving individuals. This aspect of the perception-action link was related to brain activation in the right temporoparietal junction, an area of the brain crucial to making judgments about others.</p><p>Bas, Roberts et al.'s findings point towards biological differences in how people perceive abstract social concepts like merit or deservingness. The way people perceive these concepts is stable and influences altruistic choice behavior. These results suggest that altruism may be increased by changing how people perceive others, leading to reduced favoritism or discrimination in social settings.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>altruism</kwd><kwd>social perception</kwd><kwd>drift-diffusion model</kwd><kwd>fMRI</kwd><kwd>mentalizing</kwd><kwd>social inferences</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000025</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Mental Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Conte Center P50 MH094258</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hutcherson</surname><given-names>Cendri A</given-names></name><name><surname>Tusche</surname><given-names>Anita</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000038</institution-id><institution>Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RGPIN-2019-04329</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tusche</surname><given-names>Anita</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000155</institution-id><institution>Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>435-2016-1274</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hutcherson</surname><given-names>Cendri A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Future prosocial acts can be forecasted from stable biological differences in how people perceive others' merit, pointing to novel strategies to reduce favoritism and discrimination in social situations.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Psychologists and economists have long sought to explain when and why people help.

Need and deservingness (merit) are two distinct principles of morality. The need principle involves distributing resources to those requiring them, regardless of whether they have earned them. In contrast, the ‘merit principle’ focuses on allocating resources based on individuals’ deservingness, irrespective of their actual need (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib161">Wilson, 2003</xref>).

We speculated that it might operate by changing the value that people ascribe to different social considerations during choice. More specifically, we build on a growing body of work suggesting that prosocial actions can be characterized as a value-based decision process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib150">Tusche and Bas, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Chen et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib140">Teoh et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Mayr and Freund, 2020</xref>). In this framework, the value of acting prosocial is represented as a weighted sum of several attributes, like the cost of helping for the decision-maker, the benefits for others, or the fairness of the outcome. These three attributes have been repeatedly shown to guide social behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Morishima et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Fehr and Schmidt, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Charness and Rabin, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib145">Tricomi et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib138">Tabibnia et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib119">Rhoads et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Carlson et al., 2020</xref>), with higher weights on prosocial attributes like benefits for others or fairness yielding more prosocial choices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib140">Teoh et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib125">Saulin et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Hutcherson et al., 2015a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Hu et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Hu et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib137">Sul et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Li et al., 2022</xref>). Within this computational framework, perceptions of others’ merit or need could affect social behaviors through a simple mechanism: by altering the weights given to outcomes for self, outcomes for others, or fairness during the decision process. For example, perceiving someone as highly deserving or needy could increase helping by increasing the weight given to the recipient’s benefits, decreasing the weight given to one’s own benefits, or both.</p><p>This computational framework leads to a set of testable predictions about how individual differences in social perceptual sensitivity and bias (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ1">Equation 1</xref>) might influence altruistic behavior: An individual’s general tendency to perceive merit or need (i.e., their <italic>bias</italic> parameter) should be correlated with a general tendency to ascribe higher weight to prosocial considerations (i.e., others’ benefits or fairness) across settings. In contrast, an individual’s sensitivity to cues signaling merit or need (i.e., their average <italic>sensitivity</italic> parameter <italic>S</italic>) should make them more discriminatory, increasing weights on prosocial considerations for those judged as deserving (or needy) but decreasing them for those judged as lacking these qualities. These weights should then manifest in the frequency with which an individual acts generously, either overall or as a function of the recipient’s merit and/or need.</p><p>To test these hypotheses and uncover their neural basis, we first asked participants to complete a novel social perception task while we collected their brain responses using fMRI (functional magnetic resonance imaging). The behavior observed in this task allowed us to computationally estimate two distinct—but not mutually exclusive—processes underlying individual differences in merit/need perception: an overall propensity to perceive others as deserving/in need (i.e., an individual’s <italic>bias</italic> parameter) and a tendency to sample and integrate cues signaling merit/need (i.e., an individual’s <italic>sensitivity</italic> parameter). Neurally, we investigated whether merit and need are perceived through distinct or common neural circuits and reflect individual differences in people’s perceptual bias and/or sensitivity. Examining need and merit concurrently in this task also helped clarify the computational and neural underpinnings of these related but distinct concepts, distinguishing between them more effectively. Second, we used a separate altruistic choice task (completed on average ~303 days later) to computationally estimate the weights people place on themselves, others, and fairness when deciding whether to provide aid, and we examined how those weights varied as a function of recipient merit and need. Third, we tested whether individual differences in merit/need bias or sensitivity and their neural underpinnings in the social perception task predict individual differences in prosocial action in the altruism task. Our results suggest that merit (but perhaps not need) perceptions result from stable individual differences in both bias and sensitivity and manifest in an individual’s prosocial behavior months later.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>This section is structured as follows. First, we report the results of our novel fMRI social perception task to describe how people perceive others’ merit and need. Behaviorally, we used parameter estimates from our computational model of social perception to characterize individuals’ perceptual biases and sensitivities driving variance in social perceptions across people. Neurally, we localized brain regions recruited during merit and need inferences and asked whether neural computations underlying merit and need perceptions are supported by distinct neural circuits or a general-purpose network for social inference processing. Second, we used data from a separate altruism task (collected on average 303 days later) to describe the effects of an interaction partner’s perceived merit and need on meaningful social behavior. Third, we explored if individuals’ perceptual biases and sensitivities (as captured in the social perception task) predicted variance in actual social behavior (observed in the altruism task). We examined this core question about the social perception–action link across time and contexts at both the behavioral and neural levels.</p><sec id="s2-1"><title>Social perception task: behavior and neural underpinnings of need and merit inferences</title><p>To assess individual differences in social perceptions, we used a modified version of the established fMRI why/how task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib133">Spunt and Adolphs, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib134">Spunt and Adolphs, 2015</xref>).

To address this question, we examined two distinct computational mechanisms: first, people may differ in their general tendency to perceive others as deserving or in need (bias hypothesis). Second, people may differ in their perceptual sensitivity to merit- or need-related evidence in their choice environment and/or their ability to use this information to guide their judgments (sensitivity hypothesis). Importantly, these mechanisms are not mutually exclusive but may vary in their relative impact on social behaviors across people and contexts. We tested the contribution of these two potential mechanisms using our behavioral computational model of social perception (see Methods).</p><p>We first verified that the model adequately accounted for the differences in participants’ choices and response times in all three task conditions (merit, need, and control blocks; for an illustration of the model fit, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>Next, we examined the estimated parameters of our hierarchical computational model at the individual participant level.

Next, we ran a series of whole-brain analyses to identify brain areas for which inference-evoked brain responses covary with individual differences in estimates of the computational model of social perception. Given the evidence above that the social cognitive brain network is activated to make these judgments, we hypothesized that stronger activation in one or more hubs in this network should correlate with greater perceptual sensitivity and/or bias in these social inferences. Consistent with this prediction, we found that brain responses during merit inferences [merit − control] systematically covaried with participants’ merit sensitivity scores in the right temporoparietal junction (rTPJ, peak at [MNI 56, –64, 22], <italic>t</italic> = 4.24, <italic>k</italic> = 228 voxels, p &lt; 0.001 at the voxel level, FWE corrected at the cluster level at p &lt; 0.05). In other words, participants with larger merit sensitivity scores (captured in the computational behavioral model) exhibited larger rTPJ responses when appraising someone’s merit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). This effect was specific for brain responses obtained during merit inferences; an analogous whole-brain analysis using neural activation obtained during need inferences [need − control] to predict merit sensitivity did not yield significant effects. We also did not observe any brain regions where inference-evoked brain responses were associated with variance in participants’ need sensitivity or bias scores for either merit or need at the whole-brain level (p &lt; 0.001 at the voxel level, FWE corrected at the cluster level at p &lt; 0.05). Thus, despite merit and need inferences both recruiting the general-purpose mentalizing network to an equivalent extent on average, we found some evidence of neuroanatomical specificity for merit inferences when considering estimates of the computational behavioral model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Notably, this functional link between the rTPJ and merit sensitivity was robust when we repeated the whole-brain analysis for the reduced sample of <italic>n</italic> = 25 participants with overlapping altruism task data (p &lt; 0.001 at the voxel level, FWE corrected at the cluster level at p &lt; 0.05; for details, see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>; for illustration, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Altruism task behavior</title><p>The results reported above relate to <italic>perceptions</italic> of need and merit; however, they say nothing about how such perceptions might influence decisions to help. In a separate altruism task, we examined how independently manipulating a social target’s merit and need alter prosocial behavior. The altruism task required participants to accept or reject monetary allocation that affected their payoffs and that of one of three partners (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). The merit of the three partners (high, unknown, and low) was manipulated based on information about partners’ behavior in a separate exchange game completed before the altruism task (see Appendix 1). Partners need varied on a trial-by-trial level (high and low) based on the likelihood of performing a painful cold pressor task (CPT) after the experiment. Participants were informed that partners could use the money earned during the altruism task (based on one randomly selected trial) to buy out of the painful post-task CPT. Importantly, the altruism task was unrelated to the social perception task and was completed on average 303 days later.

In other words, people who changed their generous behavior as a function of another’s merit were not necessarily the same as those who changed their behavior in response to another person’s need. Consequently, further analyses focused on the main effects of need and merit on altruistic choice. Overall, the experimental manipulations of another’s need and merit affected people’s generosity during altruistic choice.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4-2"><title>Computational behavioral model of altruistic choice: partners’ merit and need alter social attribute weights</title><p>Several mechanisms might drive the changes in altruistic choices we observed (see above): others’ merit or need might decrease self-interest, increase other-regard, increase fairness considerations, or some combination of these. To identify the relative contribution of the processes that drive generosity, we turned toward an established behavioral computational model of altruistic choice (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ4">Equation 4</xref>; see Methods). We first verified that our computational model of altruistic choice fit the data well by showing that choices and reaction times (RTs) were captured with high accuracy (for visualization of model fit, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>Next, we examined the relative importance of the social attributes (drift weights <italic>w</italic>), irrespective of the partner’s need or merit. On average (across all conditions), self-related outcomes strongly guided choices in the altruism task (indicated by the average overall positive weight on payoffs for self, <italic>w<sub>self</sub></italic> = 0.97 ± 0.75, mean ± std), more so than concern for others’ outcomes (overall <italic>w<sub>other</sub></italic> = 0.22 ± 0.49, p &lt; 0.001; FDR corrected) or fairness (overall <italic>w<sub>fairness</sub></italic> = 0.35 ± 0.36, p = 0.028; FDR corrected).

Variance in these <italic>overall</italic> attribute weights across people served as an indicator of more general, context-independent differences in (pro)social decision-making (explaining who will be more generous, on average, and why).</p><p>Finally, we tested if contextual cues about the partner’s merit or need altered the degree to which benefits for oneself (<italic>w<sub>self</sub></italic>), others (<italic>w<sub>other</sub></italic>), or fairness concerns (<italic>w<sub>fairness</sub></italic>) guided social choices in the altruism task (separate Wilcoxon signed rank tests for each attribute and experimental manipulation; FDR corrected for multiple comparisons; see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp5">Supplementary file 5</xref> for attribute-specific estimates; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B, C</xref> for illustration). Any changes in model estimates would indicate <italic>context-dependent</italic> effects (of varying levels of merit and need) of attributes’ input on altruistic behaviors. When interacting with a high (vs. low) merit partner, benefits for oneself (<italic>w<sub>self</sub></italic>) guided choices <italic>less</italic> (p &lt; 0.001, FDR corrected), whereas considerations of others’ benefits (<italic>w<sub>other</sub>, </italic>p &lt; 0.01, FDR corrected) and fairness concerns (overall <italic>w<sub>fairness</sub></italic>, p &lt; 0.001, FDR corrected) guided choices <italic>more</italic>.

Thus, if others faced great need, participants were more willing to ignore their fairness preferences. Together, these results suggest that merit- and need-evoked changes in generosity are driven by systematic changes in the social decision process—namely changes in attribute weights—as captured in our behavioral computational model of altruistic choice. Thus, we addressed another key question by showing that partners’ merit and need levels changed how specific choice-relevant considerations (self-regard, other-regard, and fairness) guided people’s decisions to act prosocially.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Individual differences in effects of others’ need and merit and altruistic decision-making</title><p>Notably, people differed substantially in their overall generosity and the degree to which generosity varied as a function of their partner’s need and merit (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>). Our model assumes this variation was driven by changes in social attribute weights <italic>w</italic> estimated in the behavioral computational model (see above). To quantify these individual differences and examine their relations, we calculated change scores of model-based estimates for each participant.

In other words, larger (smaller) changes in observed social behaviors can be explained by larger (smaller) changes in estimated attribute weights. Specifically, we confirmed that individuals’ merit-induced changes in generosity were reflected by individuals’ altered weights for self-interest (payoffs for self), other-regard (payoffs for partners) and fairness considerations on choices (p’s &lt; 0.018, FDR corrected). Need-related changes in generosity were reflected by altered consideration of benefits for self and others (p’s &lt; 0.001, FDR corrected; but not fairness, p = 0.895). In other words, individuals who were most sensitive to information about others’ merit and need (i.e., large differences in generosity toward a high vs. low merit/need partner) changed their decision process more strongly (captured in larger shifts in the weights on outcomes for self, other, and fairness considerations on choices as a function of others’ merit/need). These findings provide insights into the precise mechanism by which need and merit affect (pro)social behavior in altruistic choice settings, namely by altering the weighting of certain choice attributes in the decision-making process.

Second, we identified the mechanism of these context-dependent changes in social behaviors: merit and need altered the relative importance of self- and other-regard, and fairness preferences (captured in attribute weights <italic>w</italic> estimated in our computational model of altruistic choice). Third, we demonstrated that people differ in the degree to which they change their behaviors in response to social cues on others’ merit or need. This raises an important question: what factors determine the impact of others’ need or merit on behavior?</p><p>We propose that stable individual differences in social perceptions—as captured in our computational model of social perception and their neural underpinnings—can provide insights into this question. Behaviorally, the computational model decomposes individual differences in social perceptions into bias and sensitivity terms. These model estimates from the social perception task correspond to two mechanisms that drive variation in people’s social perceptions of others’ merit and need. We propose that these stable perceptual mechanisms can, in turn, impact social decision-making. Here, we bring together data from both tasks: the social perception task (which did not require meaningful social behavior toward others) and the altruism task (which included costly social actions). We had two specific hypotheses in mind when designing the study: we speculated that merit bias (or need bias) in the social perception task should be related to <italic>average</italic> weights on others’ outcomes in the altruism task. In contrast, estimates of an individual’s sensitivity to merit (or need) should predict the extent to which a person <italic>alters</italic> their weight on others’ outcomes as a function of their partner’s merit (or need). By combining data from both tasks, we explore a fundamental question: do people’s sensitivities and biases during social perceptions translate into subsequent social action? Notably, we see the results below as evidence of <italic>stable</italic> individual differences, since social action (i.e., generosity) was measured on average almost 10 months (~303 days) after the social perception task.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>Perceptual merit sensitivity predicts merit-related contextual changes in altruistic choice</title><p>Estimates from our computational behavioral model map onto specific hypotheses about the relationship between behaviors observed in both tasks. Perceptual sensitivity estimates reflect individuals’ tendency to sample and integrate evidence about merit (need) during the perceptual decision process. Higher sensitivity estimates will yield higher discriminability between others as a function of their merit (need). Assuming stable individual differences in sensitivity and the impact of categorizing individuals as meritorious or needy on altruistic decision-making, we hypothesized that individuals with higher perceptual merit (need) sensitivity in the social perception task would exhibit a greater change in social behavior depending on the partner’s merit (need) during the altruism task. To test this hypothesis, we correlated individuals’ merit sensitivity scores (social perception task) with merit-induced changes in social behavior (i.e., participant-specific changes in generosity toward [high − low merit] partners in the altruism task). We found that variance in merit sensitivity reflected merit-induced changes in generosity (Spearman’s <italic>r</italic> = 0.51, p = 0.010; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). In other words, individuals generally sensitive to merit information during social perceptions were also more susceptible to merit information during costly social behaviors.

In other words, individuals with higher merit sensitivity showed larger discrimination in the value placed on others’ wellbeing (and self-interest) when interacting with supposedly deserving and undeserving people. Next, we repeated this set of analyses for sensitivity scores estimated in the need condition of the social perception task. Here, variance in participants’ need sensitivity did not reflect need-induced changes in generosity (p = 0.745) or need-induced changes in altruistic choice attributes (all p’s &gt; 0.484).

Estimates of these two computations were uncorrelated, suggesting they represent distinct—but not mutually exclusive—processes driving individual differences in perceptions of peoples’ merit and need. We also demonstrated that these computations (for merit, if not need) might be stable and generalizable over time: individuals’ perceptual merit sensitivity predicted the degree to which they discriminated between others based on merit in a separate altruism task completed from 27 to 663 days later. Moreover, their perceptual merit bias predicted a general propensity to weigh others’ outcomes instead of their own during altruistic choices. Neurally, merit sensitivity (but not bias) was associated with increased activity of the TPJ during perceptual judgments, which in turn predicted merit-related discrimination in altruistic behavior.

Parochial altruism refers to the tendency to exhibit altruistic behavior toward in-group members and to withhold it from (or even display hostility toward) out-group members (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Bernhard et al., 2006</xref>). Parochial altruism occurs around the world in private and public settings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib122">Romano et al., 2021</xref>), in sports, politics, war, and religion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Hein et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Ginges et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Choi and Bowles, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Brewer et al., 2023</xref>), and has also been linked to activation patterns in the TPJ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Baumgartner et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Obeso et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Fujino et al., 2020</xref>). Although we did not use group- or membership-based cues to characterize partners in the altruism task (manipulating merit instead via partner <italic>behaviors</italic> in a separate task), the common locus in the TPJ might indicate shared mechanisms for both types of context-dependent social behaviors. Interestingly, our results suggest a considerable degree of stability of this idiosyncratic perceptual sensitivity across time and contexts, since the social perception and altruism tasks were completed on average ~10 months apart, up to almost 2 years for some participants. This finding is consistent with research showing a hereditary component of in-group favoritism and parochial altruism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Lewis and Bates, 2010</xref>).

Although the concept that judgments are a composite of subprocesses is not novel in itself (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Kenny and Albright, 1987</xref>), modeling allowed us to formally disentangle these different (neuro)computational mechanisms and demonstrate how they shape different aspects of meaningful social action months (or even years) later.

Given their importance for decision-making, we sought to determine whether perceptions of either need or merit fall within the category of social phenomena processed by dedicated neural circuits. Our neural findings largely suggest the answer is no. Both merit and need perception engaged the mentalizing network to a similar extent and were virtually indistinguishable neurally, with some minor differences. This held true even when applying multivariate decoding approaches, which have been suggested to be more sensitive than traditional univariate analysis techniques (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Kriegeskorte and Bandettini, 2007</xref>). We note, however, that perceptions of others’ merit/need in this task likely represent a composite of multiple different sub-components (e.g., related to specific social cues sampled and integrated to yield the final social judgment). Thus, our results do not preclude the existence of domain-specific neural circuitry at a lower level of social appraisals (e.g., gender or age categorization, facial and postural cues that a person is in pain, etc.).</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Limitations and future directions</title><p>Our results come with some important limitations. One of the biggest concerns is the puzzling absence of any observed neural or behavioral correlates of need sensitivity, in either the social perception or altruism tasks. We primarily relied on univariate analyses to support our conclusions here. Although a supplementary multivariate pattern analysis yielded little additional insight, exploring alternative methods such as the gradient approach or functional connectivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Janet et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Margulies et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib158">Vos de Wael et al., 2020</xref>) could prove more revealing. One other contributing factor to this null result could simply be the small sample size for our altruism task due to COVID-related delays and participant attrition. Other alternative explanations are also possible, however. While purely speculative, one possibility might lie in a limitation of the stimuli used for the social perception task. Need was generally signaled directly and concretely in each picture (i.e., someone with a knife to their throat, someone with a pained facial expression, etc.). In contrast, merit often had to be inferred indirectly from cues about the cognitive and motivational dispositions of the target (e.g., performance of unethical actions, clothing indicating group membership, other signs this person was a ‘good’ person, etc.). The ability to discriminate based on these abstract cues might thus have correlated with TPJ response and with the use of similarly abstract cues during the altruism task to judge merit of social partners. It is possible that if we had signaled need using similarly abstract cues in the social perception task, we might have observed greater associations with mentalizing network regions and/or with altruistic behavior months later. Future work will be needed to more systematically vary factors related to concrete versus abstract inference, in larger and more diverse samples, and with a greater range of socially relevant behaviors. Finally, another important open question concerns the origins of the identified perceptual biases and sensitivities. Future research should examine if differences in social perceptions stem from societal or religious values (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Amormino et al., 2022</xref>) conveyed during individuals’ upbringing, genetic factors, or a combination of both.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Participants</title><p>This research took place in the context of a large project that recruited participants from the broader Los Angeles metropolitan area to come to the lab on multiple days to complete different behavioral and neuroimaging tasks related to social cognition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Kliemann et al., 2022</xref>).

We also recruited 42 participants from the larger participant pool to complete the altruism task (13 females; mean age = 34 years, range = 19–49; full-scale IQ = 104.79 ± 7.97, range = 87–127). Of these 42 participants, we excluded one individual who fell asleep, five for excessive movement during fMRI data collection, three for invariant behavioral responses (identical left/right button press in &gt;90% of trials, indicating inattention to monetary offers in the altruism task), and five for manipulation check failures (e.g., failing memory checks regarding partner behavior in the altruism task, see below). This procedure yielded a sample of <italic>n</italic> = 28 for the altruism task, with an overlap of 25 individuals who successfully completed both sessions (social perception and altruism tasks). Thus, we report results regarding the social perception task for 44 participants (27 males; mean age = 34 years, range = 19–49; full-scale IQ = 105.84 ± 7.85, range = 90–127), the altruism task for 28 participants (19 males; mean age = 35 years, range = 25–49; full-scale IQ = 106.36 ± 7.94, range = 94–127), and cross-session results (comparing data across both tasks) for the sample of 25 individuals with valid data in both (17 males; mean age = 35 years, range = 25–49; full-scale IQ = 106.60 ± 8.26, range = 94–127). Participants in our overlap sample (valid data in both tasks) had an average separation between both tasks of 303 days (range: 27–663). This delay minimized the risk of sequential dependencies between tasks and increased confidence in the temporal stability of relationships between social perception and social action. Participants received $20 per hour for each experimental session and an additional amount based on one randomly selected trial in the altruism task to incentivize choices and ensure that participants’ responses reflected their actual preferences. All participants provided written informed consent according to a protocol approved by the Institutional Review Board of the California Institute of Technology (#12-0343).</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Normative sample</title><p>Estimating participants’ sensitivity to need and merit cues in the social perception task required quantifying the degree of need and merit displayed in each picture (e.g., stimuli, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). We assessed this quantity by obtaining normative ratings from an independent sample of participants recruited through Mechanical Turk (MTurk; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.mturk.com">http://www.mturk.com</ext-link>) and Qualtrics (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.qualtrics.com">http://www.qualtrics.com</ext-link>). The normative sample included 50 participants (17 females; mean age = 42 years, range = 25–67; 82% of White race; 100% native English speakers). This sample performed an online behavioral version of the social perception task (see below). Participants made binary judgments of whether the displayed target individual needed help, deserved help (merit), or used both hands (control) (i.e., the same judgment made by our main fMRI sample). For a given judgment (need/merit/control), the mean proportions of ‘yes’ responses across the sample for each image were used to operationalize perceptual evidence on merit, need, and control in the experimental stimuli used in the social perception task. We used these data from the separate sample to estimate the free sensitivity parameters in the behavioral computational model of social perception (see below). Data from our independent normative participant sample are available on the Open Science Framework (OSF; see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://osf.io/4u5vs/">https://osf.io/4u5vs/</ext-link>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Social perception task</title><p>To assess individual differences in social perceptions, we used a modified version of the established fMRI why/how task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib133">Spunt and Adolphs, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib134">Spunt and Adolphs, 2015</xref>). Participants viewed images of people in complex real-world scenes and made rapid yes/no judgments (button presses) while their brain responses were measured using fMRI. In separate blocks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), participants made judgments regarding others’ perceived merit (Does this person deserve help?), need (Does this person need help?), or factual judgments that did not require social inferences (Does this person use both hands?), which served as a control condition. Before each task block, a visual prompt informed participants of the upcoming condition of the task block. Moreover, a keyword was briefly presented between images of a block as a reminder (i.e., ‘need’, ‘deserve’, or ‘both hands’; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Each block consisted of 32 images, and participants completed two blocks per condition. Thus, participants viewed a total of 64 images, each presented once per condition (need, merit, and control). Some images displayed multiple people; a green arrow superimposed on the photograph indicated the target of the social perception. Images were displayed for 2 s with a 0.5 s inter-stimulus interval. The presentation order of images was fixed across participants to maximize efficiency. Crucially, this task did not require people to make altruistic choices or engage in meaningful social interaction. Instead, it focused solely on capturing individuals’ patterns of perceiving others’ perceived merit, need, and factual control inferences, which we modeled using an evidence accumulation framework (computational model of social perception, see below). The task was implemented in MATLAB (MathWorks) using the Psychophysics Toolbox extensions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Brainard, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Kleiner et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib112">Pelli, 1997</xref>).

All but one participant completed the social perception task first. On each trial, we presented participants with a proposed monetary allocation between themselves and one of three partners (e.g., $13 for themselves and $35 for their current partner; choice screen, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Participants decided whether to accept or reject the proposed allocation in favor of a constant default allocation of $20 for both (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Hutcherson et al., 2015a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib149">Tusche and Hutcherson, 2018</xref>).

Proposed monetary outcomes for the participant (You) and the partner (represented by one of three colored geometric shapes) ranged from $5 to $35 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). To minimize the effects of habituation and repetition, we randomly jittered proposal amounts by $0–$4.

We informed participants that each of the three partners would be given the option of using money received in the altruism task to buy out of the post-task CPT (based on a randomly selected trial at the end of the task that would be implemented according to the participants’ choice on that trial). With each dollar spent, the partner could subtract 10% from their probability of having to perform the painful CPT (e.g., spending $3 would reduce an 80% chance to 50%).

Thus, in trials with high percentages, the partners had a greater need for money to avoid the painful experience. For each partner, CPT likelihood was low in half of the trials (mean CPT probability of 20%) and high in the other half (mean CPT probability of 80%; random presentation order of high vs. low need trials). As with the monetary proposal amounts, we randomly jittered need-related percentages by 0–4% to minimize the effects of habituation and repetition.</p><p>To ensure the saliency of the experimental need manipulation, all participants completed the painful CPT task themselves before the altruism task outside the scanner. Participants were also told that all three partners had already completed one round of the CPT task before the altruism task and were presented with their ostensible pain ratings (7 on a 7-point scale; 1 = not at all; 7 = extremely). These ratings signaled to participants that all three partners found the ice water equally and extremely painful and were highly motivated to avoid another round of the CPT. After the altruism task, participants completed a variety of computerized sanity check questions and questionnaires outside of the scanner (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>).

For example, merit judgments should primarily reflect cues indicating merit (i.e., high sensitivity estimates of <italic>S<sub>merit|merit condition</sub></italic>) but might also reflect in part cues indicative of need (i.e., a low but non-zero <italic>S<sub>need|merit condition</sub></italic>). Thus, the model yields a total of nine sensitivity parameters estimated across the three conditions of the social perceptual task. The image-level evidence for <italic>Merit</italic>, <italic>Need</italic>, and <italic>Control</italic> (for the stimulus shown on that trial) was estimated using data from an independent participant sample (see Normative sample above). For each image, we used the mean-centered average proportion of ‘yes’ responses that the displayed target individual deserved help, needed help, or was using both hands (based on data from the independent normative sample). We focus on the ‘task-relevant’ estimated parameters <italic>S<sub>merit</sub></italic> in the merit condition, <italic>S<sub>need</sub></italic> in the need condition, and <italic>S<sub>control</sub></italic> in the control condition as indices of participants’ perceptual <italic>sensitivity</italic> to cues suggestive of others’ merit, need, or usage of both hands (supplemental manipulation checks confirmed larger perceptual sensitivity estimates in task-relevant compared to task-irrelevant task conditions, see Appendix 2). Higher parameter values suggest stronger discrimination of the normatively agreed-upon relevant cues (as captured by the independent normative sample). The DDM also includes three condition-wise free parameters that influence the overall drift, irrespective of the specific image (<italic>Bias<sub>need</sub></italic>, <italic>Bias<sub>merit</sub></italic>, and <italic>Bias<sub>control</sub></italic>; indicated as <italic>Bias<sub>condition</sub></italic> in <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ3">Equation 3</xref>). These parameters allow us to capture an individual’s general tendency to identify cues suggestive of others’ merit and need (or control), regardless of the actual social cues present in the image. We refer to these estimates as perceptual <italic>bias</italic>.</p><p>Once the momentary evidence <italic>E</italic> reaches the upper (yes) or lower (no) threshold, evidence accumulation terminates, and the corresponding choice is implemented. The difference between thresholds is estimated by a set of three parameters (<italic>a</italic><sub>Δ<italic>need</italic></sub>, <italic>a</italic><sub>Δ<italic>merit</italic></sub>, and <italic>a</italic><sub>Δ<italic>control</italic></sub>) that represent within-individual stability and difference across tasks. The DDM also includes three condition-wise non-decision time (<italic>ndt</italic>) parameters for capturing the time taken to initially encode stimuli and to implement the motor response, estimated similarly to incorporate within-individual stability and change across task conditions. Finally, the model included three condition-wise starting bias (<italic>z</italic>) parameters, which represent another potential mechanism by which biases at the onset of evidence accumulation can impact the decision process. Note that, although we estimated these starting biases to improve model fit, our focus in all primary analyses reported in this paper is on the evidence-related <italic>perceptual</italic> bias for merit and need (represented by <italic>Bias<sub>condition</sub></italic> in merit and need blocks, respectively), not these motor-related starting biases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib163">Witt et al., 2015</xref>).

Following previous implementations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Hutcherson et al., 2015a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib149">Tusche and Hutcherson, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Hutcherson and Tusche, 2022</xref>), we classified a choice as generous if the participant <italic>accepted</italic> a proposal that benefited the partner at the expense of oneself ($Self &lt; $Other) or <italic>rejected</italic> a proposal that profited themselves at the partner’s expense ($Self &gt; $Other). The overall and condition-specific fraction of generous choices measured participants’ generosity. Differences in generosity across conditions provided model-free estimates of the impact of social cues about others’ merit and need on social behaviors.

A more complicated model that allowed for need × merit interactions in driving weights did not improve model fit.

A detailed description of the model fitting procedure is provided in Appendix 3.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Correlating social perception and social action</title><p>Next, we tested for a relationship between social perception and social action. To this end, we correlated individual-specific bias and sensitivity parameters obtained from the social perception task with value-based attribute weight parameters in the altruism task. Because we found that some estimates of our computational model diverged from a normal distribution, we used non-parametric statistical tests to examine these relationships. Post hoc tests were corrected for multiple comparisons using the fdr_bh function implemented in MatlabR2022a. All results are reported for two-tailed statistical tests, unless reported otherwise. We removed outliers from all variables in our analyses based on values that exceeded 3 standard deviations from the mean.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>fMRI data</title><sec id="s4-9-1"><title>Acquisition</title><p>All neuroimaging data were acquired at the Caltech Brain Imaging Center using a Siemens Trio 3.0 Tesla scanner outfitted with a 32-channel phased-array head-coil. Functional image acquisition for the social perception task and altruism task occurred on different days in separate sessions (average delay of 303 days). For both fMRI tasks, we acquired gradient echo T2*-weighted echo-planar images (EPIs; 60 slices, voxel resolution 2.5 × 2.5 × 2.5 mm<sup>3</sup>, TR = 700 ms, TE = 30 ms, flip angle = 53°, FOV = 200 mm, interleaved acquisition order, multi-band acceleration factor = 6). We collected 903 volumes for the social perception task and 925 volumes for the altruism task. For all participants, we also acquired a high-resolution anatomical T1-weighted image using a MEMP-RAGE sequence (208 slices, 0.9 × 0.9 × 0.9 mm<sup>3</sup>, matrix size 256 × 256, TR = 2.55 s, TI = 1.15 s, TE = 1.6, 3.5, 5.3, 7.1 ms with RMS echo combination, RAGE flip angle = 8°). Distortion correction data for the fMRI EPI acquisitions employed a pair of phase-encoding polarity reversed T2w SE-EPI images with identical geometry and EPI echo train timing to the T2*w EPI images (TR 4.8 s, TE 50 ms, flip angle 90°). For information on preprocessing of functional and structural brain data, see Appendix 4.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9-2"><title>General linear model of brain responses in the social perception task</title><p>This analysis aimed to identify brain regions recruited during different judgments in the social perception task. For each participant, we estimated a general linear model (GLM) using a canonical hemodynamic response function and a 128-s high-pass cut-off filter to eliminate low-frequency drifts in the data. The GLM estimated three regressors of interest corresponding to condition-wise brain responses (implemented in different blocks) during merit inferences (deserves help?), need inferences (needs help?), and factual control inferences that did not require social inferences (used both hands?; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). The three condition-wise regressors were defined by the onset time of the first target image and the offset of the final image of each block (two blocks per condition). The GLM also included eight regressors of no interest: six motion regressors, the framewise displacement (estimated during preprocessing of neuroimaging data using fMRIPrep, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://fmriprep.org/">https://fmriprep.org/</ext-link>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Esteban et al., 2018a</xref>), and a session constant. The GLMs were implemented in MATLAB (R2018b) using the SPM12 toolbox (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm">http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm</ext-link>).</p><p>For each participant, we created several contrasts of interest: First, we identified brain regions activated during merit perception (contrast [merit – control]) and need perception (contrast [need – control]). Second, we estimated brain regions that are significantly more (or less) activated for need compared to merit perception (contrasts [merit – need]; [need – merit]). The respective contrast images were then used in four group-level analyses using simple <italic>t</italic>-tests as implemented in SPM12. Whole-brain maps were thresholded at p &lt; 0.001 (voxel level) and FWE corrected at a cluster level of p &lt; 0.05. Finally, we tested for brain regions that were reliably activated during both need and merit perceptions, by estimating a formal conjunction of both inference-specific brain maps ([need − control] ∩ [merit − control]) at the group level. Both brain maps used in this conjunction analysis were thresholded at the cluster-forming voxel level of p &lt; 0.001, FWE cluster-level corrected at p &lt; 0.05.</p><p>We also estimated a supplemental GLM for fMRI data from the altruism task. Due to COVID-19-related interruptions, only 25 participants from the sample that performed the social perception task also completed the fMRI altruism task. Given the limited sample size and noise level of fMRI data, we decided to focus solely on the behavior in the altruism task to address our research objectives.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Multivariate decoding of the inference condition in the social perception task</title><p>We also performed multivariate decoding analysis on the brain data collected in the social perception task. We first estimated another GLM for each participant (using SPM12). The GLM was identical to the one used for the univariate analysis with two exceptions: first, the model was estimated on non-smoothed brain data. Second, instead of collapsing both task blocks per condition into one regressor of interest, the GLM modeled each block of the social perception task separately, yielding six regressors of interest ([condition: merit, need, control] × [block: 1, 2]).</p><p>The multivariate pattern analysis aimed to identify localized activation patterns that reliably decoded the perception condition (merit, need, control) in the social perception task. To ensure an unbiased analysis of the neural activation patterns throughout the whole brain, a ‘searchlight’ approach was used (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Kriegeskorte et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Haynes et al., 2007</xref>). Given that this approach does not depend on a priori assumptions about informative brain regions or prior voxel selection, the problem of circular analysis (or ‘double dipping’) can be avoided (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Kriegeskorte et al., 2009</xref>). We implemented three separate decoding analyses: merit versus control, need versus control, merit versus need. All three analyses used a similar analysis approach, which we illustrate using the example of the decoding of need versus merit inferences below.</p><p>We used the same searchlight approach as in prior work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib148">Tusche et al., 2016</xref>). For each participant, a sphere with a radius of 4 voxels was created around every voxel <italic>v</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub> of the measured brain volume (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib147">Tusche et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Kahnt et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib162">Wisniewski et al., 2015</xref>). For each sphere, we investigated whether the local pattern of activation predicted the inference condition (e.g., need vs. merit). For every task block, parameter estimates from the GLM (see above) were extracted for each of the <italic>N</italic> voxels in the sphere around voxel <italic>v</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub> and transformed into an <italic>N</italic>-dimensional pattern vector. In total, for the binary decoding analysis, we created four pattern vectors for each sphere (e.g., for a searchlight analysis decoding of need vs. merit, we extracted two block-wise pattern vectors for need, and two for merit). The first two of the pattern vectors (one per condition) were used for the training (training dataset) of a linear support vector machine classifier with a fixed regularization parameter C = 1 (implemented using libSVM operated in MATLAB, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/libsvm/">https://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/libsvm/</ext-link>). This provided the basis for the subsequent classification of the remaining two pattern vectors (one per condition) that were not used for training. The procedure was then repeated by training on the last two pattern vectors and testing on the first two pattern vectors (yielding a twofold cross-validation). The amount of condition-related information of the spatial activation pattern of each spherical cluster was represented by the average decoding accuracy across both cross-validation steps and was assigned to the central voxel <italic>v</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub> of the cluster.</p><p>The described classification was performed for all spherical clusters created around every measured voxel, resulting in a three-dimensional map of average classification accuracies for each participant. These participant-specific accuracy maps were then spatially smoothed with an isotropic Gaussian kernel of 6 mm full-width half-maximum. Finally, a standard second-level statistical analysis was performed to identify brain regions that allowed classifying the perceptual condition (e.g., whether individuals performed need or merit judgments) across participants (<italic>n</italic> = 44). More specifically, individual accuracy maps were submitted to a one-sample <italic>t</italic>-test and contrasted against chance level (as implemented in SPM12). Since the classification was based on two alternatives (e.g., merit vs. need), chance level was 50%. Only regions passing a stringent statistical threshold (p &lt; 0.001 at the voxel level, p &lt; 0.05 FWE corrected at the cluster level) and showing significant decoding accuracies above chance were considered relevant for information encoding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Haynes et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib132">Soon et al., 2008</xref>).

manipulate partner’s merit in the altruism task</title><p>Before the altruism task, all participants completed a separate behavioral exchange game (sequential iterated Prisoner’s Dilemma, modified from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib129">Singer et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib130">Singer et al., 2006</xref>). Participants were first informed about the game’s overall structure, as follows: two anonymous players each start with 10 points. One player is randomly selected to act first and chooses how many points to send to the other player. Each sent point is tripled (e.g., if the player sends 10 points, the other player receives 30). The second player is then informed of the first player’s choice and chooses how many of their total points to send in return (again, anything sent is tripled). Total joint earnings are maximized if each player sends the maximum number of points to the other player. Importantly, the second player can decide not to send any points back at the expense of the first player. Participants were informed that they would be paired with a different person (ostensibly another participant) for each trial. After the instruction, all participants were ‘randomly’ assigned to act as the second player. Participants completed 10 trials where each first player sent one of the following amounts: 1, 3, 5, 5, 7, 7, 9, 9, 10, and 10. The ordering of these trials was randomized across participants.</p><p>We implemented the following approach to manipulate the perceived merit of three anonymous players (who would act as partners in the subsequent altruism task). After playing the game themselves, participants received feedback about the choices of two other players and had to guess the choice of a third player. Specifically, participants were informed that these three individuals had played the sequential prisoners’ dilemma at the same time as the participant but in different rooms. Participants were informed that player 1 behaved uncooperatively (‘Sent 0 out of 10, which tripled to become 0’; indicating low merit), and player 2 behaved cooperatively (‘Sent 10 out of 10, which tripled to become 30’; indicating high merit). As a control condition, no information about player 3 was provided (unknown merit); instead, participants were asked to guess that player’s choices. Participants were then informed that they would play the next task (altruism task) in the scanner with those three partners, represented by three colored geometric shapes.</p></sec></app><app id="appendix-2"><title>Appendix 2</title><sec sec-type="appendix" id="s9"><title>Sanity check confirming enhanced perceptual sensitivity scores in task-relevant blocks of the social perception task</title><p>In the social perception task, we estimated three sensitivity parameters (S<italic><sub>merit</sub></italic>, <italic>S<sub>need</sub></italic>, and S<italic><sub>control</sub></italic>) independently for all three conditions (i.e., 9 sensitivity parameters total; 3 estimates × 3 conditions), irrespective of whether the judgment was task-relevant or not in the block. This allowed for the possibility that evidence relevant to a specific perceptual ‘quantity’ might be sampled in contexts where it was not explicitly required and might influence judgments even when it was irrelevant. That said, we would expect larger perceptual sensitivity estimates in task-relevant settings (e.g., enhanced merit sensitivity in merit blocks of the social perception task). To confirm this assumption (which in essence serves as a manipulation check), we evaluated the effects of experimental conditions on the estimated sensitivity values for the hyper-mean parameters in our computational model of social perception. Specifically, we compared parameter posteriors and converted the probabilities to two-tailed tests.</p><p>Perceptual sensitivity estimates differed between the three conditions, as would be expected. In each of the blocks, the task-relevant sensitivity estimates (e.g., <italic>S<sub>need</sub></italic> in the need condition) were significantly greater than they were in either of the other conditions (e.g., <italic>S<sub>need</sub></italic> in the merit and factual control blocks; all p’s &lt; 0.0001). Furthermore, <italic>S<sub>control</sub></italic> did not differ between the need and merit conditions (p = 0.21), and <italic>S<sub>merit</sub></italic> did not differ between the need and control conditions (p = 0.46).

The bias <italic>w<sub>0</sub></italic> was significantly more negative in the need condition than in the merit condition (p = 0.002). The bias <italic>w<sub>0</sub></italic> in the control condition was not significantly different from the need (p = 0.06) or merit conditions (p = 0.10) using two-tailed statistical tests.</p></sec></app><app id="appendix-3"><title>Appendix 3</title><sec sec-type="appendix" id="s10"><title>Model fitting procedure</title><p>Above, we introduced the computational behavioral models of social perception and altruistic choice. Here, we provide further details on the model fitting procedure. For both the social perception task and the altruism task, we identified the best-fitting parameter values by estimating their posterior distributions with hierarchical Bayesian models using differential evolution Markov chain Monte Carlo (DE-MCMC) sampling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Holmes and Trueblood, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib146">Turner et al., 2013</xref>). Specifically, we used an analytic solution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Navarro and Fuss, 2009</xref>) to calculate the likelihood of the observed data (i.e., choices and reaction times [RTs]) given a combination of parameter values and used this likelihood to construct a Bayesian estimate of the posterior distribution of the likelihood of the parameter values given the data. To maximize the amount of data used for fitting our model, we included trials in which participants did not respond before response deadlines by estimating the probability that simulations would fail to generate a choice within this time frame. Before model fitting, we removed a few trials where participants made a response in less than 200 ms (0% and 0.02% of trials in the social perception task and altruism task, respectively).</p><p>At the participant level of our hierarchical model for the <italic>social perception task</italic>, we fit seven parameters [<italic>bias</italic>, <italic>S<sub>need</sub></italic>, <italic>S<sub>merit</sub></italic>, <italic>S<sub>control</sub></italic>, <italic>z</italic>, <italic>a</italic>, <italic>ndt</italic>] for each of the task conditions (need/merit/control judgments) simultaneously. Specifically, the drift sensitivity parameters were estimated separately for each of the three task conditions (merit, need, control) and, thus, their values were independent across conditions. However, because we expected a participant’s thresholds, starting biases, and non-decision times to be correlated across conditions, we used a method involving a ‘baseline and difference’ approach, in which one parameter specified the value obtained in the baseline/control (hands) condition, and two additional parameter governed the <italic>difference</italic> between the control value for that parameter and the specific task condition (i.e., merit − baseline, need − baseline). Thus, we obtained 21 parameter values per participant (7 free parameters × 3 conditions). At the population level of our model, we obtained estimates of the hyper means and hyper standard deviations for each of these parameters, resulting in 42 hyper parameters.</p><p>At the participant level of our hierarchical model for the <italic>altruism task</italic>, we fit three parameters [<italic>z</italic>, <italic>a</italic>, <italic>ndt</italic>] that were fixed across the need × merit conditions. In addition, we used a combination of four parameters [<italic>w</italic><sub>0</sub>, <italic>w<sub>self</sub></italic>, <italic>w<sub>other</sub></italic>, <italic>w<sub>fairness</sub></italic>] that were allowed to vary across conditions to describe the value-based evidence accumulation (drift) term in the model. For these parameters, we estimate only the independent main effects for need and merit, since another model that allowed for need × merit interactions did not improve model fit. Although the four weight parameters [<italic>w</italic><sub>0</sub>, <italic>w<sub>self</sub></italic>, <italic>w<sub>other</sub></italic>, <italic>w<sub>fairness</sub></italic>] were allowed to vary across the six combinations of need and merit, we also assumed that each of these parameters might be related within a single participant. Thus, we again took a ‘baseline and difference’ approach to capture how weight parameters differed across conditions. More specifically, our DDM model estimated four separate drift parameters for each attribute: (1) baseline sensitivity for the unknown partner; (2) an additive term related to difference in the need level (Δ<sub>Need</sub>, high = +1, low = –1); (3) an additive term indicating high merit partner trials, coded as 1/0; and (4) an additive term indicating low merit partner trials, coded as 1/0. For ease of comparison, when reporting the estimates for the main effect of need, we recode parameter estimates for high need as (baseline + Δ<sub>Need</sub>, see 1 and 2) and low need as (baseline − Δ<sub>Need</sub>, see 1 and 2). Thus, in total, we obtained 19 parameter values per participant. At the population level of our model we obtained estimates of the hyper means and hyper standard deviations for each of these parameters, resulting in 38 hyper parameters.</p><p>In total, we ran 3 × <italic>k</italic> chains in parallel for each model, where k is the number of participant-level parameters per participant (i.e., social perception task: 63 chains; altruism task: 57 chains) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Holmes and Trueblood, 2018</xref>). To preserve within-individual consistency for select parameter values (see above), we fit all conditions simultaneously. Additionally, we restricted possible parameter values as shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="app3table1">Appendix 3—table 1</xref>. Given these constraints, we employed a transformation in parameter sampling to ensure that the prior distributions of the hyper-mean model parameters were truly uniform (noninformative) across the specified range in each condition.</p><p>Specifically, for the social perception task, the DE-MCMC sampler sampled three MCMC model parameters each for <italic>ndt</italic>, <italic>a</italic>, and <italic>z</italic>—one for each condition (i.e., need, merit, and control). To preserve within-participant consistency across the three conditions while ensuring that an inverse probit transformation would result in a uniform distribution across values of [0,1], we computed the difference between one MCMC parameter and the sum of the other two (e.g., <italic>ndt<sub>need</sub></italic> – (<italic>ndt<sub>merit</sub> + ndt<sub>control</sub></italic>)) and then transformed this value via an inverse probit transformation. In this way, by specifying the priors of the MCMC hyper-mean model parameters as normal distributions with mean of 0 and variance of 1/3, <italic>N</italic>(0, 1/3), their combination and subsequent inverse probit transformation yielded a uniform distribution across values of [0, 1] for parameters in each condition. These transformed values were then scaled by their respective functions, <italic>f<sub>sc</sub></italic>(<italic>x</italic>), to the range of values as seen in <xref ref-type="table" rid="app3table1">Appendix 3—table 1</xref> to derive the model parameters. The priors of the MCMC hyper standard deviation parameters were specified as gamma distributions Γ[1, 1].</p><p>For the altruism task, the DE-MCMC sampler sampled MCMC model drift weight (<italic>w</italic>) parameters composed of stability (<italic>M</italic><sub><italic>params</italic></sub>) and effect of need and merit manipulations (change across conditions; <italic>δ</italic><sub><italic>params</italic></sub>). In the case of need-related effects, the sum of these MCMC model parameters <italic>M</italic><sub><italic>params</italic></sub> + <italic>δ</italic><sub><italic>params</italic></sub> × Condition (effects coded as high need = 1; low need = –1) is then transformed via an inverse probit transformation. The priors of the MCMC hyper-mean model parameters for both <italic>M</italic><sub><italic>params</italic></sub> and <italic>δ</italic><sub><italic>params</italic></sub> were specified as normal distributions with mean of 0 and variance of 0.5, <italic>N</italic>(0, 0.5), because inverse probit transformations of the sum of two normal distributions with mean 0 and variance 0.5 yields a uniform distribution across values of [0, 1] for parameters in both conditions. These transformed values were then scaled by their respective functions, <italic>f<sub>sc</sub></italic>(<italic>x</italic>), to the range of values as seen in <xref ref-type="table" rid="app3table1">Appendix 3—table 1</xref> to derive the diffusion model parameters. For the high and low merit conditions, the corresponding drift weight parameter was added following probit transformation. The priors of the MCMC hyper standard deviation parameters were specified as gamma distributions Γ[1, 1].</p><p>To construct the estimated posterior distributions of each parameter, we sampled 5000 iterations after an initial burn-in period (burn-in of 15,000 for the social perception task, 10,000 for the altruism task). We then thinned these 5000 samples by only keeping every fifth sample, leaving 1000 samples per chain. For each iteration, the DE-MCMC algorithm proposes a new set of parameter values for each chain based on the scaled difference between two other randomly selected chains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib146">Turner et al., 2013</xref>). The scaling for the difference between parameter values was <italic>γ</italic> = 2.38/√2<italic>d</italic>, where <italic>d</italic> is the number of parameters in the parameter space (e.g., for the social perception task, 42 at the population level and 21 at the participant level) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib146">Turner et al., 2013</xref>). At the hyper-level, parameter proposals were blocked such that one new parameter value was proposed at a time. At the participant level, parameter proposals were unblocked (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib146">Turner et al., 2013</xref>). The newly proposed parameter values are then evaluated by the Metropolis–Hastings algorithm for inclusion in the posterior distribution. Additionally, we implemented a probabilistic migration step, <italic>α</italic> = 0.01, at each MCMC step instead of the differential evolution to improve chain mixing and convergence toward the high probability density region of the posterior distribution of parameters. The migration step cycles the positions of a subset of chains (<italic>N</italic><sub><italic>migrate</italic></sub> uniformly sampled from the total number of chains) such that the positions of chains were compared against <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf16"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mspace width="thinmathspace"/><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mn>2</mml:mn><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mo>…</mml:mo><mml:mi>j</mml:mi><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula> and evaluated based on the Metropolis–Hastings algorithm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib146">Turner et al., 2013</xref>).

First, a reference volume and its skull-stripped version were generated by aligning and averaging 1 single-band references (SBRefs). A B0-nonuniformity map (or fieldmap) was estimated based on two (or more) echo-planar imaging (EPI) references with opposing phase-encoding directions, with 3dQwarp (AFNI 20160207) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Cox and Hyde, 1997</xref>). Based on the estimated susceptibility distortion, a corrected EPI reference was calculated for a more accurate co-registration with the anatomical reference. The BOLD reference was then co-registered to the T1w reference using bbregister (FreeSurfer) which implements boundary-based registration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Greve and Fischl, 2009</xref>). Co-registration was configured with six degrees of freedom. Head-motion parameters with respect to the BOLD reference (transformation matrices, and six corresponding rotation and translation parameters) are estimated before any spatiotemporal filtering using mcflirt (FSL 5.0.9 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Jenkinson et al., 2002</xref>). BOLD runs were slice-time corrected using 3dTshift from AFNI 20160207 (RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID:SCR_005927">SCR_005927</ext-link>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Cox and Hyde, 1997</xref>). First, a reference volume and its skull-stripped version were generated using a custom methodology of fMRIPrep. The BOLD time-series (including slice-timing correction when applied) were resampled onto their original, native space by applying a single, composite transform to correct for head-motion and susceptibility distortions. These resampled BOLD time-series will be referred to as preprocessed BOLD in original space, or just preprocessed BOLD. The BOLD time-series were resampled into several standard spaces, correspondingly generating the following spatially normalized, preprocessed BOLD runs: MNI152NLin6Asym, MNI152NLin2009cAsym. First, a reference volume and its skull-stripped version were generated using a custom methodology of fMRIPrep. Automatic removal of motion artifacts using independent component analysis (ICA-AROMA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib116">Pruim et al., 2015</xref>) was performed on the preprocessed BOLD on MNI space time-series after removal of non-steady state volumes and spatial smoothing with an isotropic, Gaussian kernel of 6 mm full-width half-maximum. Corresponding ‘non-aggresively’ denoised runs were produced after such smoothing. Additionally, the ‘aggressive’ noise regressors were collected and placed in the corresponding confounds file. Several confounding time-series were calculated based on the preprocessed BOLD: framewise displacement (FD), DVARS, and three region-wise global signals. FD was computed using two formulations following Power (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib115">Power et al., 2014</xref>) (absolute sum of relative motions) and Jenkinson (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Jenkinson et al., 2002</xref>) (relative root mean square displacement between affines). FD and DVARS are calculated for each functional run, both using their implementations in Nipype (following the definitions by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib115">Power et al., 2014</xref>). The three global signals are extracted within the CSF, the WM, and the whole-brain masks. Additionally, a set of physiological regressors were extracted to allow for component-based noise correction (CompCor, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Behzadi et al., 2007</xref>). Principal components are estimated after high-pass filtering the preprocessed BOLD time-series (using a discrete cosine filter with 128 s cut-off) for the two CompCor variants: temporal (tCompCor) and anatomical (aCompCor). tCompCor components are then calculated from the top 2% variable voxels within the brain mask. For aCompCor, three probabilistic masks (CSF, WM, and combined CSF + WM) are generated in anatomical space. The implementation differs from that of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Behzadi et al., 2007</xref> in that instead of eroding the masks by 2 pixels on BOLD space, the aCompCor masks are subtracted a mask of pixels that likely contain a volume fraction of GM. This mask is obtained by dilating a GM mask extracted from the FreeSurfer’s aseg segmentation, and it ensures components are not extracted from voxels containing a minimal fraction of GM. Finally, these masks are resampled into BOLD space and binarized by thresholding at 0.99 (as in the original implementation). Components are also calculated separately within the WM and CSF masks. For each CompCor decomposition, the k components with the largest singular values are retained, such that the retained components’ time-series are sufficient to explain 50 percent of variance across the nuisance mask (CSF, WM, combined, or temporal). The remaining components are dropped from consideration. The head-motion estimates calculated in the correction step were also placed within the corresponding confounds file. The confound time-series derived from head-motion estimates and global signals were expanded with the inclusion of temporal derivatives and quadratic terms for each (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib124">Satterthwaite et al., 2013</xref>). Frames that exceeded a threshold of 0.5 mm FD or 1.5 standardised DVARS were annotated as motion outliers. All resamplings can be performed with a single interpolation step by composing all the pertinent transformations (i.e., head-motion transform matrices, susceptibility distortion correction when available, and co-registrations to anatomical and output spaces). Gridded (volumetric) resamplings were performed using antsApplyTransforms (ANTs), configured with Lanczos interpolation to minimize the smoothing effects of other kernels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Lanczos, 1964</xref>). Non-gridded (surface) resamplings were performed using mri_vol2surf (FreeSurfer).</p></sec></app></app-group></back><sub-article article-type="editor-report" id="sa0"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.92539.3.sa0</article-id><title-group><article-title>eLife assessment</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Press</surname><given-names>Clare</given-names></name><role specific-use="editor">Reviewing Editor</role><aff><institution>University College London</institution><country>United Kingdom</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="evidence-strength"><kwd>Convincing</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="claim-importance"><kwd>Important</kwd></kwd-group></front-stub><body><p>These <bold>important</bold> findings stand out from other similar studies via some <bold>convincing</bold> demonstration of behavioural and neural relationships between two helping tasks – one focusing more on social perception, one more on its influence on social behaviour – that were performed more than 300 days apart.

It has received much attention from the psychological side, but comparatively less from neuroscience. The paper translates some ideas from a social Psychology domain to neuroscience using a neuroeconomically oriented computational approach. In particular, the paper is concerned with the idea that people help others based on perceptions of merit/deservingness, but also because they require/need help. To this end, the authors conduct two experiments with an overlapping participant pool:</p><p>(1) A social perception task in which people see images of people that have previously been rated on merit and need scales by other participants. In a blockwise fashion, people decide to whether the depicted person (a) deserves help, (b) needs help, and (c) whether the person uses both hands (== control condition)</p><p>(2) In an altruism task, people make costly helping decisions by deciding between giving a certain amount of money to themselves or another person. It is manipulated how much the other person needs and deserves the money.</p><p>The authors use sound and robust computational modelling approach for both tasks using evidence accumulation models. They analyse behavioural data for both tasks, showing that the behaviour is indeed influenced, as expected, by the deservingness and the need of the shown people. Neurally, the authors use a block-wise analysis approach to find differences in activity levels across conditions of the social perception task. The authors do find large activation clusters in areas related to theory of mind. Interestingly, they also find that activity in TPJ that relates to the deservingness condition correlates with people's deservingness ratings while they do the task, but also with computational parameters related to helping others in the second task, the one that was conducted many months later. Also some behavioural parameters correlate across the two tasks, suggesting that how deserving of help others are perceived reflects a relatively stable feature that translates into concrete helping decisions later-on.</p><p>The conclusions of the paper are overall well supported by the data.</p><p>(1) I found that the modelling was done very thoroughly for both tasks. Overall, I had the impression that the methods are very solid with many supplementary analyses. The computational modelling is done very well.</p><p>(2) A slight caveat, however, regarding this aspect, is that, in my view, the tasks are relatively simplistic, so that even the complex computational models do not as much as they can in the case of more complex paradigms. For example, the bias term in the model seems to correspond to the mean response rate in a very direct way (please correct me if I am wrong).</p><p>(3) Related to the simple tasks: The fMRI data is analysed in a simple block-fashion. This is in my view not appropriate to discern the more subtle neural substrates of merit/need-based decision making or person perception. Correspondingly, the neural activation patterns (merit &gt; control, need &gt; control) are relatively broad and unspecific. They do not seem to differ in the classic theory of mind regions, that are the focus of the analyses.</p><p>(4) However, the relationship between neural signal and behavioural merit sensitivity in TPJ is noteworthy.</p><p>(5) The latter is even more the case, as the neural signal and aspects of the behaviour are correlated across subjects with the second task that is conducted much later. Such a correlation is very impressive and suggests that the tasks are sensitive for important individual differences in helping perception/behaviour.</p><p>(6) That being said, the number of participants in the latter analyses are at the lower end of the number of participants that are these days used for across-participant correlations.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="referee-report" id="sa3"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.92539.3.sa3</article-id><title-group><article-title>Reviewer #3 (Public Review):</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><anonymous/><role specific-use="referee">Reviewer</role></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>Summary:</p><p>The paper aims at providing a neurocomputational account on how social perception translates in prosocial behaviors. Participants first completed a novel social perception task during fMRI scanning, in which were asked to judge the merit or need of people depicted in different situations. Second , a separate altruistic choice task was used to examine how the perception of merit and need influences the weights people place on themselves, others and fairness when deciding to provide help. Finally, a link between perception and action was drawn in those participants who completed both tasks.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>The paper is overall very well written and presented, leaving the reader at ease when describing complex methods and results. The approach used by the author is very compelling, as it combines computational modeling of behavior and neuroimaging data analyses. Despite not being able to comment on the computational model, I find the approach used (to disentangle sensitivity and biases, for merit and need) very well described and derived from previous theoretical work. Results are also clearly described and interpreted.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>In the social perception task, merit and need are evaluated by means of very different cues that rely on different cognitive processes (more abstract thinking for merit than need). Despite this limitation of the task, the authors were able to argue convincingly in the revised version about the solidity of their findings. Sample size is quite small for study 2, nevertheless the results provide convincing evidence.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="author-comment" id="sa4"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.92539.3.sa4</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Bas</surname><given-names>Lisa M</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/02y72wh86</institution-id><institution>Queen's University</institution></institution-wrap><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Kingston</named-content></addr-line><country>Canada</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Roberts</surname><given-names>Ian D</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/03dbr7087</institution-id><institution>University of Toronto Scarborough</institution></institution-wrap><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Toronto</named-content></addr-line><country>Canada</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Hutcherson</surname><given-names>Cendri A</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/03dbr7087</institution-id><institution>University of Toronto Scarborough</institution></institution-wrap><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Toronto</named-content></addr-line><country>Canada</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Tusche</surname><given-names>Anita</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/02y72wh86</institution-id><institution>Queen's University</institution></institution-wrap><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Kingston</named-content></addr-line><country>Canada</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Public Reviews:</bold></p><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>The authors conducted two tasks at 300 days of separation.

This is especially the case for the correlational questions. While the limitation is acknowledged at the end, it is not truly acknowledged in the way that the data are interpreted. I.e. much is concluded from absent relationships, where the likelihood of Type II error is high in this scenario. I suggest that throughout the manuscript, authors play down their conclusions about absence of effects.</p></disp-quote><p>Response: We agree with the reviewer that the limitation of small samples should be adequately reflected in the interpretation of the data. We have therefore added cautionary language to the interpretation of the correlational effects in several places of the revised manuscript. For example, we now state: “However, this absence of effects for need ought to be interpreted with caution, given the comparatively small sample size.” (pg. 33) and “As mentioned above, we cannot rule out the possibility that null findings may be due to the comparatively small sample size and should be interpreted cautiously (also see discussion)” (pg. 34-35).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) I found the results section quite a marathon, and due to its length I started to lose the thread concerning the overarching aims - which had been established so neatly in the introduction. I am unsure whether all of these analyses were necessary for addressing the key questions or whether some were more exploratory. E.g. it's unclear to me what one would have predicted upfront about the decoding analyses.</p></disp-quote><p>Response: We acknowledge and share the reviewer’s concern about the length of the results section and potential loss of clarity. Regarding the decoding analyses, we want to clarify that they were conducted as a sanity check to compare against the results of the univariate analysis. We didn’t have apriori hypotheses regarding these supplemental decoding analysis. We have clarified this issue in the revised version of the manuscript and moved the decoding analyses fully to the supplemental material to streamline the main text. The remaining results reported in the manuscript are indeed all based on apriori, key questions (unless specified otherwise, for example, supplemental analyses for other regions of interest for the sake of completeness). The only exception is the final set of results (Neural markers of merit sensitivity predict merit-related behavioral changes during altruistic choice) which represent posthoc tests to clarify the role of activation in the right temporoparietal junction (rTPJ) in merit-related changes in other-regard in altruistic decisions. While we acknowledge that this is a complex paper, after careful consideration we couldn’t identify any other parts of the results section to remove or report in the supplemental material.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) More specifically, the decoding analyses were intriguing to me. If I understand the authors, they are decoding need vs merit, and need+merit vs control, not the content of these inferences. Do they consider that there is a distributed representation of merit that does not relate to its content but is an abstracted version that applies to all merit judgements? I certainly would not have predicted this and think the analyses raise many questions.</p></disp-quote><p>Response: We thank the reviewer for sharing their thoughts on the decoding analyses and agree that this set of analyses are intriguing, yet raise additional questions, such as the neural computations required to assess content. However, we wish to clarify that the way we view our current results is very much analogous to results obtained from studies of perception in other fields. For example, in the face perception literature, it is often observed that the fusiform face area is uniformly more active, not only when a face (as opposed to an object) is on the screen, but when a compound stimulus consistent of features of a face and other features (e.g. of objects) is on the screen, but participants are instructed to attend to and identify solely the face. Moreover, multivariate activity in the FFA (but not univariate activity) is sufficient to decode the identity of the face. We view the results we report in the manuscript as more akin to the former types of analyses, where any region that is involved in the computation is uniformly more active when attention is directed to judgment-specific features. Unfortunately, the present data are not sufficient to properly answer the latter questions, about which areas enable decoding of specific intensity or identity of merit-related content. Follow-up experiments with a more optimized design are needed. Although interesting, we thus refrain from further discussing the decoding analyses in the manuscript to avoid distracting from the main findings based on the univariate comparison of brain responses observed while participants make merit or need inferences in the social perception task.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>When people help others is an important psychological and neuroscientific question.

The paper translates some ideas from a social Psychology domain to neuroscience using a neuroeconomically oriented computational approach. In particular, the paper is concerned with the idea that people help others based on perceptions of merit/deservingness, but also because they require/need help. To this end, the authors conduct two experiments with an overlapping participant pool:</p><p>(1) A social perception task in which people see images of people that have previously been rated on merit and need scales by other participants. In a blockwise fashion, people decide whether the depicted person (a) deserves help, (b) needs help, and (c) whether the person uses both hands (== control condition).</p><p>(2) In an altruism task, people make costly helping decisions by deciding between giving a certain amount of money to themselves or another person. How much the other person needs and deserves the money is manipulated.</p><p>The authors use a sound and robust computational modelling approach for both tasks using evidence accumulation models. They analyse behavioural data for both tasks, showing that the behaviour is indeed influenced, as expected, by the deservingness and the need of the shown people. Neurally, the authors use a block-wise analysis approach to find differences in activity levels across conditions of the social perception task (there is no fMRI data for the other task). The authors do find large activation clusters in areas related to the theory of mind. Interestingly, they also find that activity in TPJ that relates to the deservingness condition correlates with people's deservingness ratings while they do the task, but also with computational parameters related to helping others in the second task, the one that was conducted many months later. Also, some behavioural parameters correlate across the two tasks, suggesting that how deserving of help others are perceived reflects a relatively stable feature that translates into concrete helping decisions later-on.</p><p>The conclusions of the paper are overall well supported by the data.</p></disp-quote><p>Response: We thank the reviewer for the positive evaluation of our study and the comprehensive summary of our main findings. We would like to clarify, though, that we did originally collect fMRI data for the independent altruism task. Unfortunately, due to COVID-19-related interruptions, only 25 participants from the sample that performed the social perception task also completed the fMRI altruism task (see pg. 18). Given the limited sample size and noise level of fMRI data, we moved anything related to the neuroimaging data of the altruism task to the supplemental material (see Note S7) and decided to focus solely on the behavior of the altruism task to address our research objectives. We apologize for any confusion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(1) I found that the modelling was done very thoroughly for both tasks. Overall, I had the impression that the methods are very solid with many supplementary analyses. The computational modelling is done very well.</p></disp-quote><p>Response: We are pleased that the reviewer found the computational model sensible.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) A slight caveat, however, regarding this aspect, is that, in my view, the tasks are relatively simplistic, so even the complex computational models do not do as much as they can in the case of more complex paradigms. For example, the bias term in the model seems to correspond to the mean response rate in a very direct way (please correct me if I am wrong).</p></disp-quote><p>Response. We agree that the Bias term relates to mean responding (although it is not the sole possibility: thresholds and starting default biases can also produce changes in mean levels of responding that, without the computational model, are not possible to dissociate). However, we think that the primary value of this parameter comes not from the analysis of the social judgment task (where the reviewer is correct that the bias relates in a quite straightforward way to the mean response rate), but in the relationship of this parameter to the un-contextual generosity response in the altruism task. Here, we find that this general bias term relates not to overall generosity, but rather to the overall weight given to others’ outcomes, a finding that makes sense if the tendency to perceive others as deserving overall yields an increase in overall attention/valuation of their outcomes. Thus, a simple finding in one task relates to a more nuanced finding in another. However, we agree it is important to acknowledge the point raised by the reviewer, and now do so on pg. 20: “It is worth noting that the Bias parameters are strongly associated with (though not the sole determinant of) the mean response rate.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) Related to the simple tasks: The fMRI data is analysed in a simple block-fashion. This is in my view not appropriate to discern the more subtle neural substrates of merit/need-based decision-making or person perception. Correspondingly, the neural activation patterns (merit &gt; control, need &gt; control) are relatively broad and unspecific. They do not seem to differ in the classic theory of mind regions, which are the focus of the analyses.</p></disp-quote><p>Response: The social perception task is modified from a well-established social inference task (Spunt &amp; Adolphs, 2014; 2015) designed to reliably localize the mentalizing network in the brain. As such, we acknowledge that it is not optimally designed to discern the intrinsic complexities of social perception, or the specific appraisals or computations that yield more or less perception (of need or merit) in a given context. Instead, it was designed to highlight regions that are more generally recruited for performing these social perceptions/inferences.</p><p>We heartily agree with the reviewer that it would be interesting and informative to analyze this task in a trial-wise way, with parametric variation in evidence for each image predicting parametric variation in brain activity. Unfortunately, the timing of this task is not optimal for this kind of an analysis, since trials were presented in rapid and blocked fashion. We were also limited in the amount of time we could devote to this task, since it was collected in conjunction with a number of other tasks as part of a larger effort to detail the neural correlates of social inference (reported elsewhere). Thus, we were not able to introduce the kind of jittered spacing between trials that would have enabled such analysis, despite our own wish to do so. We hope that this work will thus be a motivator for future work designed more specifically to address this interesting question, and now include a statement to this effect on pgs. 2223: “Future research may reveal additional distinctions between merit and need appraisals in trial-wise (compared to our block-wise) fMRI designs.”</p><p>References:</p><p>Spunt, R.

Such a correlation is very impressive and suggests that the tasks are sensitive for important individual differences in helping perception/behaviour.</p></disp-quote><p>Response: Again, we share the reviewer’s impression that this finding is more noteworthy for appearing in tasks separated both by considerable conceptual/paradigmatic differences, and by such a long temporal distance. These findings make us particularly excited to follow up on these results in future research.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(6) That being said, the number of participants in the latter analyses are at the lower end of the number of participants that are these days used for across-participant correlations.</p></disp-quote><p>Response: We fully agree with this assessment. Unfortunately, COVID-related disruptions in data collection, as well as the expiration of grant funds due to the delay, severely limited our ability to complete assessments in a larger sample. Future research needs to replicate these results in a larger sample. We comment on this issue in the discussion on pg. 40. If the editor or reviewer has suggestions for other ways in which we could more fully acknowledge this, we would be happy to include them.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>The paper aims to provide a neurocomputational account of how social perception translates into prosocial behaviors. Participants first completed a novel social perception task during fMRI scanning, in which they were asked to judge the merit or need of people depicted in different situations. Secondly, a separate altruistic choice task was used to examine how the perception of merit and need influences the weights people place on themselves, others, and fairness when deciding to provide help. Finally, a link between perception and action was drawn in those participants who completed both tasks.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>The paper is overall very well written and presented, leaving the reader at ease when describing complex methods and results. The approach used by the author is very compelling, as it combines computational modeling of behavior and neuroimaging data analyses. Despite not being able to comment on the computational model, I find the approach used (to disentangle sensitivity and biases, for merit and need) very well described and derived from previous theoretical work. Results are also clearly described and interpreted.</p></disp-quote><p>Response: We thank the reviewer for their positive comments regarding presentation, approach, and content.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>My main concern relates to the selection of the social perception task, which to me is the weakest point. Such weakness has been also addressed by the same authors in the limitation section, and related to the fact that merit and need are evaluated by means of very different cues that rely on different cognitive processes (more abstract thinking for merit than need). I wonder whether and how such difference can bias the overall computational model and interpretation of the results (e.g. ideal you vary merit and need to leave all other aspects invariant).</p></disp-quote><p>Response: We agree with the reviewer on the importance of future research to more fully unpack the differences in this task, and develop better ways to manipulate need and merit in more comparable fashion. However, we point out that the issue of differences in abstractness of cues for need and merit does not actually seem to have a strong influence on the parameters retrieved by the computational model. Participants seem to be equally sensitive to BOTH merit and need information, despite that information deriving from different sources, as evidenced by the fact that the magnitude of the sensitivity parameters for need and merit in the social judgment task were nearly identical, and not statistically distinguishable. Nor were other parameters related to non-decision time or threshold statistically different (see Supplemental Table S2). If our results were driven purely by differences in the difficulty or abstractness of these judgments, we would have expected to see some evidence of this in the computational model, in the form of longer non-decision times, higher thresholds, or both. We do not. Likewise, the neural underpinnings evoked by both need and merit perceptions in this task (in the mentalizing brain network) were comparable. This is not to say that there aren’t real differences in the cues that might signal these quantities in our social perception task - just that there is little direct evidence for this difference in computational parameters or evoked brain responses, and thus it is unlikely that our results (which rely on an analysis of computational parameters) are driven solely by computational model biases, or the inability of the model to adequately assess participant sensitivity to need as opposed to merit.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>A second weakness is related to the sample size which is quite small for study 2. I wonder, given that study 2 fRMI data are not analyzed, whether is possible to recover some of the participants' behavioral results, at least the ones excluded because of bad MR image quality.</p></disp-quote><p>Response: We fully agree with the reviewer that increasing the sample size for the cross-task correlations would be desirable. Unfortunately, the current sample size already presents the maximum of ‘usable’ data; the approach suggested by the reviewer won’t affect the sample size. We used all participants whose behavioral data in the altruism task suggested they were performing the task in good faith and conscientiously.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Finally, on a theoretical note, I would elaborate more on the distinction of merit and need. These concepts tap into very specific aspects of morality, which I suspect have been widely explored. At the moment I am missing a more elaborate account of this.</p></disp-quote><p>Response: Need and merit are predominantly studied in separate lines of research (Molouki &amp; Bartels),</p><p>1. so there is relatively little theoretical research on the distinction between the two. Consequently, Siemoneit (2023) states that the relation between the concepts of need and merit in allocative distributions remains diffuse. To emphasize the distinct concepts of morality in the introduction we have now added to pg. 3: “Need and deservingness (merit) are two distinct principles of morality. The need principle involves distributing resources to those who require them, irrespective of whether they have earned them, while the &quot;merit principle&quot; focuses on allocating resources based on individuals' deservingness, regardless of their actual need (Wilson, 2003).”</p><p>One of the added values of our paper to the research literature is in adding to the clarification of computational and neural underpinnings of broad concepts like merit and need. To highlight the latter point, we have added the following statement on pg. 5 to the manuscript: “Examining need and merit concurrently in this task will also help clarify the computational and neural underpinnings of related, but distinct concepts, distinguishing between them more effectively.”</p><p>References:</p><p>Molouki, S., &amp; Bartels, D.

Admittedly, I'm sure they don't want to wait 300 days to have the complete dataset, but I would be in favour of collecting a sample in the hundreds on these behavioural tasks, completed at a much shorter separation (if any). I believe this would strengthen the authors' conclusions considerably if they could both replicate the effects they have and check these null effects in a sample where they could draw conclusions from them. Indeed, Bayesian stats to provide evidence for the null would also help here.</p></disp-quote><p>Response: We share the reviewer’s desire to see these results replicated (ideally in a sample of hundreds of participants). We have seriously considered the possibility of trying to replicate our results online, even before submitting the first version of the paper. However, it is difficult to fully replicate this paradigm online, given the elaborate story and context we engaged in to convince participants that they were playing with real others, as well as the usage of physical pain (Cold Pressor Task) for the need manipulation in the altruism task. Moreover, given comments by this reviewer that the results are already a little long, adding a new, behavioral replication would likely only add to the memory burden for the reader. We have thus opted not to include a replication study in the current work. However, we are actively working on a replication that can be completed online, using a modified experimental paradigm and different ways to manipulate need and merit. Because of the differences between that paradigm and the one described here, which would require considerable additional exposition, we have opted not to include the results of this work in the current paper. We hope to be able to publish this work as a separate, replication attempt in the future.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Given the difficulty of wading through the results section while keeping track of the key question being answered, I would suggest moving any analyses that are less central to the supplementary. And perhaps adding some more guiding sentences at the start and end of each section to remind the reader how each informs the core question.</p></disp-quote><p>Response: We deliberated for quite some time about what results could be removed, but in the end, felt that nearly all results that we already described need to be included in the paper, since each piece of the puzzle contributes to the central finding (relating parameters and behavior to neural and choice data across two separate tasks). However, we did move the decoding analysis results to the supplemental (see point below). We also take the reviewers point that the results can be made clearer. We thus have worked to include some guiding sentences at the start and end of sections to remind the readers how each analysis informs the core questions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>I think it needs unpacking more for the reader what they should conclude from the significant need+merit vs control decoding analyses, and what they would have expected in terms of cortical representation from the decoding analyses in general.</p></disp-quote><p>Response: We agree with the reviewer that given the decoding results position in the main manuscript it would need unpacking. After considering the reviewer's prior suggestion, we have reevaluated the placement of these supplemental results. Consequently, we have relocated it to the supplemental materials, as it was deemed less relevant to directly addressing the core research questions in the main manuscript. On pg. 23, the main manuscript now only states “We also employed supplemental multivariate decoding analyses (searchlight analysis 85-87), as commonly used in social perception and neuroscience research 7,58,82,88,89, corroborating our univariate findings (see Supplemental Note S6, Supplemental Table S10).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>(1) I would suggest moving information on how the computational models were fitted to the main text.</p></disp-quote><p>Response: The computational models are a key element of the paper and we deliberated about the more central exposure of the description of how the models were fitted in the main manuscript. However, we are concerned about the complexity and length of the article, which requires quite a lot from readers to keep in mind (as also commented on by reviewer 1). Those readers who are particularly interested in details of model fitting can still find an extensive discussion of the procedures we followed in the supplements. We thus have opted to retain the streamlined presentation in the main manuscript. However, if the editor feels that including the full and extensive description of model fitting in the main paper would significantly improve the flow and exposition of ideas, we are happy to do so.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) For the fMRI analyses: Could it be worth analysing the choices in the different conditions? They could be modelled as a binary regressor (yes/no) and this one might be different across conditions (merit/need/hands). Maybe this won't work because of the tight trial timeline, but it could be another avenue to discern differences across fMRI conditions.</p></disp-quote><p>Response: We thank the reviewer for this interesting suggestion! Unfortunately, the block design and rapid presentation of stimuli within each condition make it challenging to distinguish the different choices (within or across conditions). While we see the merit in the suggested analytical approach (in fact, we discussed it before the initial submission of the article), it would require some modifications of the task structure (e.g., longer inter-trial-intervals between individual stimuli) and an independent replication fMRI study. We were not able to have such a long inter-trial interval in the original design due to practical constraints on the inclusion of this paradigm in a larger effort to examine a wide variety of social judgment and inference tasks. We hope to investigate this kind of question in greater detail in future fMRI work.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) The merit effects seem to be more stable across time than the need conditions. Would it be worthwhile to test if the tasks entailed a similar amount of merit and need variation? Maybe one variable varied more than the other in the task design, and that is why one type of effect might be stronger than the other?</p></disp-quote><p>Response: We thank the reviewer for drawing attention to this important point. We used extensive pilot testing to select the stimuli for the social perception task, ensuring an overall similar amount of need and merit variation. For example, the social perception ratings of the independent, normative sample suggest that the social perception task entails a similar amount of need and merit variation (normative participant-specific percentage of yes responses for merit (mean ± standard deviation: 53.95 ± 13.87) and need (45.65 ± 11.07)). The results of a supplemental paired t-test (p = 0.122) indicate comparable SD for need and merit judgments. Moreover, regarding the actual fMRI participant sample, Figure S3 illustrates comparable levels of variations in need and merit perceptions (participant-specific percentage of yes responses for merit (56.70 ± 11.91) and need (48.69 ± 10.81) in the social perception task). Matching the results for the normative sample, the results of a paired t-test (p = 0.705) suggest no significant difference in variation between need and merit judgments. With respect to the altruism task, we manipulated the levels of merit and need externally (high vs. low).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>(1) It would be good to provide the demographics of each remaining sample.</p></disp-quote><p>Response: We appreciate the attention to detail and agree with the reviewer’s suggestion. We have now added the demographics for each remaining sample to the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) The time range from study 1 to study 2, is quite diverse. Did you use it as a regressor of no interest?</p></disp-quote><p>Response: We thank the reviewer for this interesting suggestion. We have examined this in detail in the context of our cross-task analyses (i.e., via regressions and partial correlations). Interestingly, variance in the temporal delay between both tasks does not account for any meaningful variation, and results don’t qualitatively change controlling for this factor.</p><p>For example, when we controlled for the delay between both separate tasks (partial correlation analysis), we confirmed that variance in merit sensitivity (social perception task) still reflected meritinduced changes in overall generosity (altruism task; p = 0.020). Moreover, we confirmed that variance in merit sensitivity reflected individuals’ other-regard (p = 0.035) and self-regard (p = 0.040), but not fairness considerations (p = 0.764) guiding altruistic choices. Regarding people’s general tendency to perceive others as deserving, we found that the link between merit bias (social perception task) and overall other-regard (p = 0.008) and fairness consideration (p = 0.014) (altruism task) holds when controlling for the time range (no significant relationship between merit bias and self-regard, p = 0.191, matching results of the main paper).</p><p>We refer to these supplemental analyses in the revised manuscript on ps. 33 and 35: “Results were qualitatively similar when statistically controlling for the delay between both tasks (partial correlations).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) Why in study 1 a dichotomous answer has been used? Would not have been better (also for modeling) a continuous variable (VAS)?</p></disp-quote><p>Response: We appreciate the reviewer's thoughtful feedback. In Study 1, opting for a dichotomous response format in the social perception task (Figure 1a) was a deliberate methodological choice. This decision, driven by the study's model requirements, aligns with the common use of a computational model employing two-alternative forced choices (&quot;yes&quot; and &quot;no&quot;) as decision boundaries. While drift– diffusion models for multiple-alternative forced-choice designs exist, our study's novel research questions were effectively addressed without their complexity. Finally, our model cannot accept continuous response variables as input unless they are transformed into categorical variables.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) In the fMRI analyses, when you assess changes in brain activity as a function of merit, I would control for need (and the other way round), to see whether such association is specific.</p></disp-quote><p>Response: Regarding the reviewer’s suggestion on controlling for need when assessing changes in brain activity as a function of merit, and vice versa, we would like to clarify the nature of our fMRI analyses in the social perception task. Our focus is on block-wise assessments (need vs. control, merit vs. control, need vs. merit blocks, following the fMRI task design from which our social perception task was modified from). We don’t assess changes in brain activity as a function of the level of perceived merit or need (i.e., “yes” vs. “no” trials within or across task blocks). Blocks are clearly defined by the task instruction given to participants prior to each block (i.e., need, merit, or control judgments). Thus, unfortunately, given the short inter-stimulus-intervals of each block, the task design is not optimal to implement the suggested approach.</p></body></sub-article></article>
