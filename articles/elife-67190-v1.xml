We show here that normal human or mouse dermal fibroblasts submitted to the out-of-field dose scattering at the margin of a PTV receiving a mimicked patient’s treatment do not die but enter in a long-lived senescent state resulting from the accumulation of unrepaired DNA single-strand breaks, in the almost absence of double-strand breaks.

generation of DNA damages lethal for cancer cells. Paradoxically, because DNA damages are mutagenic, ionizing radiations also have tumorigenic effects. A severe complication of radiation therapy is therefore the induction of second primary cancers (SPCs), also called radiotherapy-induced second cancers, second cancers after radiation therapy, or cancers in irradiated fields (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Berrington de Gonzalez et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Doyen et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Travis, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Trott, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Trott, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Tubiana, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Vautravers et al., 2010</xref>). SPCs are not a recurrence of the initial cancer but are neo-formed from normal cells affected by the radiations. Data on the increased risk of developing an SPC after radiation therapy is quite divergent in the available studies: it ranges from 0 in a cohort of 13,457 patients with rectal cancer having received radiation therapy after surgery compared to surgery alone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Martling et al., 2017</xref>) to 14 in a cohort of 1136 patients diagnosed with Hodgkin lymphoma at a median age of 11 years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Holmqvist et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Although the causal relationship between the initial radiation therapy and the induction of the SPC is impossible to definitely prove, SPCs are highly suspected to be radiation-induced. However, lifestyle, exogenous stressors, and genetic factors could also be contributing factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Doyen et al., 2010</xref>). Amazingly, in radiation therapy using external X-rays, SPCs develop not preferentially inside the planning target volume (PTV), that is, the volume having received 100% of the therapeutic dose, but preferentially close to the edge of the beams, or farther around, on several centimeters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Diallo et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Dörr and Herrmann, 2002</xref>). In a clinical linear accelerator, the region surrounding a beam (which will be called the margin in this article) receives photons leaking and scattering from the primary and secondary collimators, scattering from the flattening filter and scattering inside the patient from the PTV toward normal peritumoral tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chofor et al., 2012</xref>). Although the marginal dose (also called peripheral dose or out-of-field dose) emanating from the collimator and the flattening filter could be reduced by optimizing the accelerator’s technology, the scattering inside the patient is unavoidable. This internal scatter component was shown to be the major determinant of the dose deposited in the most proximal margin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chofor et al., 2012</xref>). The marginal radiation has three characteristics: (i) the deposited dose exponentially decreases with the distance, (ii) the deposited dose is approximately proportional to the PTV size, and (iii) the photon’s spectral energy fluence distribution is shifted to lower energies compared with those inside the PTV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chofor et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chofor et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kirkby et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kry et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Wiezorek et al., 2009</xref>). It was suggested that this photon quality change has the potential to increase the relative biological effectiveness (RBE) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chofor et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kirkby et al., 2007</xref>), but the underlying specific cellular damages, if any, are unknown.</p><p>X-rays induce, among others, DNA single-strand breaks (SSBs) and double-strand breaks (DSBs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Azzam et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Jonathan et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Panganiban et al., 2013</xref>). DSBs are defined as two breaks in the sugar-phosphate backbone on each DNA strand, at less than 10 bp. Their signalization and repair involve the activation of the DNA damage response (DDR) pathway with, downstream, the activation of the tumor suppressor TP53 that induces either a transitory cell cycle arrest favoring DNA repair or apoptosis. An SSB is a break in the sugar-phosphate backbone on only one DNA strand, often accompanied by a nucleotide loss and often displaying abnormal 5′ and 3′ ends (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Caldecott, 2008</xref>). The SSB repair (SSBR) pathway involves a first step of break detection initiated by the poly(ADP)ribose polymerase (PARP) 1, which, once activated by its linkage to the broken DNA, synthetizes long chains of poly(ADP)ribose (PAR). The accumulated PAR chains favor the recruitment of the X Ray Repair Cross-Complementing Group (XRCC) 1 scaffold protein. XRCC1 is then phosphorylated and recruits the repair enzymes themselves, including the polynucleotide kinase phosphatase (PNKP) and the polymerase β. These last steps are common with the base exchange pathway (BER) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Caldecott, 2014</xref>). It is known for a long time that the curative effect of ionizing radiations results from the formation of DSBs too many to be repaired, leading to cancer cell death by apoptosis or mitotic catastrophe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Jonathan et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Norbury and Hickson, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Panganiban et al., 2013</xref>). SSBs are less detrimental than DSBs, but 1 Gy deposited in the PTV generates 10–25 more SSBs than DSBs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dahm-Daphi et al., 2000</xref>). Presently, nothing is known about the respective quantities of SSBs and DSBs generated in the margin of the PTV and the consequences on the outcome of the affected normal cells.</p><p>Besides their spatial distribution related to the PTV, another amazing property of SPCs is their long latency period before emergence, ranging from 1 to 40 years after the treatment of the first cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Berrington de Gonzalez et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Dörr and Herrmann, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Doyen et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Sheppard and Libshitz, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Tubiana, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Vautravers et al., 2010</xref>). Moreover, the cumulative incidence of SPCs increases with time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Doyen et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Friedman et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Olsen et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Storm, 1988</xref>): for instance, the cumulative incidence of second sarcoma in a cohort of 16,705 patients treated by radiation therapy for nonmetastatic breast carcinoma was calculated at 0.7% at 5 years, at 0.27% at 10 years, and at 0.48% at 15 years after the initial treatment time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kirova et al., 2005</xref>). This suggests that the normal cells that were affected by the scattered photons remain dormant in the organism while maintaining a constant neoplastic transformation potential. However, the precise biological form of this dormant cell state is completely unknown. We assayed in this study whether it was senescence.</p><p>Indeed, although initially described as the state reached by normal human fibroblasts after a finite doubling number, senescence is now recognized as a more general reprogrammed state established to adapt to several stresses, such as telomere shortening, DNA damages, oxidative damages, or hyperactivation of some oncogenes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abbadie et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Ben-Porath and Weinberg, 2005</xref>). By producing DNA damages and oxidative stress, ionizing radiations are senescence inducers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cmielová et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Panganiban et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Seol et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Suzuki et al., 2003</xref>). The senescence program includes an increase in cell size, complex epigenetic changes, an increase in reticulum endoplasmic stress, an increase in autophagy, changes in the composition of the secretome, and above all a long-term cell cycle arrest in G1 associated with a resistance to apoptosis, making senescent cells nonproliferating long-lived cells in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abbadie et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Martien and Abbadie, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Pluquet et al., 2015</xref>). The senescent cell cycle arrest results from the persistence of unrepaired DNA damages. When these damages are of a type signalized through the DDR pathway, such as DSBs or shortened telomeres, the cell cycle arrest is very stable, almost irreversible, considered as tumor suppressor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Campisi and d’Adda di Fagagna, 2007</xref>). In contrast, when the unrepaired damages are SSBs, as we have shown in a seminal work on endogenous oxidative stress-induced senescence, about one senescent cell on 10,000 systematically and spontaneously re-enters in cell cycle to give rise to a progeny of cells we named post-senescent neoplastic emergent (PSNE) cells. These cells display mutations, markers of transformation, markers of epithelial-to-mesenchyme transition, and are able to form small hyperplasias or carcinomas in in vivo assays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Deruy et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gosselin et al., 2009a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Malaquin et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Martin et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Nassour et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>We investigated in this study whether SSB-induced senescence could be a step in the generation of SPCs after conformational 3D radiotherapy using X-rays. As SPC type, we focused on sarcomas that represent a large part of SPCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Diallo et al., 2009</xref>), and whose outcome is very poor with a survival rate at 5 years of 10–40% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Depla et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Vautravers et al., 2010</xref>). We report that normal fibroblasts located in the margin of a PTV receiving 2 Gy/day as patients enter after 2 weeks of treatment in premature senescence. This senescence induction is associated with an accumulation of SSBs in the almost absence of DSBs. We also report that about 10 days after the end of radiation fractions a few senescent cells re-enter cell cycle and generate a progeny of cells resuming proliferation and displaying mutations and increased invasive capacities. These findings lead us to propose for the first time a mechanism explaining how photons scattering inside the patient from the PTV toward the normal peritumoral tissues could induce a delayed development of sarcomas. They also pave the way for using senolytics to prevent second sarcoma development.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Characterization of the experimental setting for cell irradiations</title><p>To determine the type and quantity of DNA breaks generated in a stromal tissue localized at the margin of a PTV and analyze their effects on the stromal cell behavior, we applied a simulated standard radiotherapy protocol to in vitro cultured normal human dermal fibroblasts (NHDFs), which are primary cells, using a linear accelerator, the Varian Primus CLINAC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>), commonly used for treating patients by 3D conformal radiotherapy at the Anti-Cancer Center of Lille, France (Centre Oscar Lambret). The experimental setting was designed in the respect of the mode, energies, unitary dose, dose rate, total dose, and fractioning commonly applied to patients.</p><p>We first characterized the depth profile of dose deposition at 6 or 20 MV, the two energies used in photon mode with this accelerator. The results indicated that the maximum dose was deposited at 16–30 mm deep for 6 MV and at 25–45 mm deep for 20 MV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Therefore, cell plates (6-, 12-, or 96-well plates) were put on a 2- or 4-cm-thick poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) plate for irradiation from below at 6 or 20 MV respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref>).</p><p>The lateral positioning laser was used to position the isocenter at the bottom of the wells, on which the cells adhere (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref>). The light field was used to delimit a square PTV of 25 × 25 cm. Cell plates were positioned straddling the light field boundary indicating the isodose 50 in order to get at least one well column inside the PTV and several well columns spreading over the margin up to several centimeters from the limit of the beam (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B</xref>).</p><p>To check the accuracy of this experimental setting, cell plates were scanned and the deposited dose was calculated using the planning treatment system of the Centre Oscar Lambret. The dose profile diagram and the isodose curves indicated that, for the columns positioned inside the PTV, 100% of the dose was indeed deposited at the bottom of the wells, where the cells lay, and that the dose was almost homogeneous in the wells positioned inside the PTV. They also indicated that the dose exponentially dropped down in the wells positioned in the margin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2C and D</xref>).

As expected, both MDA-MB231 and NHDFs positioned inside the PTV underwent cell death after 3 weeks of irradiation.

For NHDFs positioned inside the PTV, the results show that p16 mRNA levels increased as soon as the second radiation fraction, but then dropped back during further radiation fractions. p21 appeared to take the reins with an upregulation from the second week of irradiation. For NHDFs positioned in the margin, p16 and p21 mRNA levels followed approximately the same induction pattern, mainly from the end of the first week of irradiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>).

When the comet assay electrophoresis is performed at pH 12.3, the double helix is denatured and the DNA fragments that migrate and form the comet tail come from both SSBs and DSBs. When the electrophoresis is performed at pH 8, the DNA fragments that migrate come only from DSBs. Thus, comparing the results at pH 8 and 12.3 enables to evaluate the relative quantity of DSBs and SSBs. Comet assay results at pH 12.3 revealed the presence of breaks in NHDFs positioned at the margin up to about 5 cm. Comet assay results at pH 8 confirmed the lack of DSB formation in NHDFs positioned at the margin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>). Therefore, the breaks recorded in the margin correspond almost only to SSBs, hence confirming the immunofluorescence results. As in immunofluorescence results, SSBs were as numerous in the proximal and distal margins. Comet assay results also confirmed the formation of both SSBs and DSBs in NHDFs positioned inside the PTV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>).</p><p>In order to target the tumor at best in its tridimensional volume, the planning treatment system combines the use of beams at 6 and 20 MV. To determine whether the energy of the incident photons could impact on the nature or quantity of breaks generated in NHDFs positioned inside the PTV or at its margin, we measured the quantity of XRCC1 and 53BP1 foci generated in NHDFs irradiated at 6 versus 20 MV. The results indicate that there was no statistically significant difference in the quantity of SSBs and DSBs generated inside the PTV or at the margin after one irradiation at 2 Gy at 6 or 20 MV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4</xref>).</p><p>Therefore, a unitary 2 Gy irradiation generates in nontumoral fibroblasts surrounding the PTV a specific SSB-without-DSB signature. As expected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hagen, 1994</xref>), the quantity of the generated DSBs followed approximately the dose gradient that exponentially decreases from the PTV to the most distal margin. In contrast and surprisingly, the quantity of generated SSBs was almost constant from the PTV to the most distal margin assayed here (about 5 cm).</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>The SSB generation in the margin necessitates some continuity in the material from the PTV</title><p>It was established that the major determinant of the dose deposited at the margin of a PTV results from the scattering of photons inside the patient (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chofor et al., 2012</xref>). To investigate whether the generation of SSBs in cells positioned in the margin was due to the propagation of photons inside the material, here the plastic of the culture plates, we aligned a second culture plate after the one straddling the limit of the PTV, and the two aligned plates were sealed or not by an ultrasound gel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s5">Figure 3—figure supplement 5A</xref>). We irradiated once at 2 Gy and analyzed DNA breaks by immunofluorescence anti-XRCC1 and -53BP1. Regarding SSBs, we recorded XRCC1 foci in NHDFs positioned inside the PTV and at the margin in only the first plate when the two plates were not sealed, but also in the second plate, when the plates were sealed, up to 18.7 cm. Regarding DSBs, we recorded 53BP1 foci only in NHDFs positioned inside the PTV and, to a much less extent, in the most proximal margin of the first plate, confirming the previous results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s5">Figure 3—figure supplement 5B</xref>).

However, in vivo in the dermis, fibroblasts are rather quiescent, except during tissue repair. We therefore wanted to determine whether the quantity of DNA breaks recorded after irradiation could be affected by the proliferating versus quiescent status of NHDFs. Cell cycle-slowed-down NHDFs (cultured in 0.1% FBS) and proliferating NHDFs (cultured in 2% FBS) were irradiated at 2 Gy daily for 5 days. The amount of DSBs plus SSBs was quantified by comet assays at pH 12.3.

For that, mice were positioned in close contact (sealed with an ultrasound gel) to a phantom that was irradiated using the Elekta Precise of the OncoVet veterinary clinic (Villeneuve d’Ascq, France). This linear accelerator is very similar to the Varian CLINAC of the Anti-Cancer Center of Lille we used for irradiating cells. The isocenter was positioned at the level of the mouse skin. A square PTV of 25 × 25 cm was delimited. The phantom was positioned inside the PTV, aligned along one of its limits, and the mouse was glued to it using some ultrasound gel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). The phantom was irradiated once at 2 Gy. Mice were sacrificed 1 hr later, their skin collected, fragmented at different distances from the contact with the phantom, and the skin fragments processed for detecting XRCC1 and 53BP1 foci. Mice irradiated whole body (isocenter at the level of the skin) were used as positive control. As expected, both SSBs and DSBs developed in dermal cells of total body-irradiated mice. In contrast, only SSBs, but not DSBs, were generated in dermal cells of the skin of mice positioned at the margin of the phantom, up to 2 cm from the contact with the phantom (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). By co-detecting vimentin with XRCC1, we showed that most of the XRCC1-positive dermal cells were fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>).

Regarding DSBs in NHDFs positioned inside the PTV, the results of comet assays at pH 8 show that there was no significant difference between cells irradiated once or five times. Regarding DSBs in NHDFs positioned at the margin, the results confirmed again their almost absence. Regarding SSBs, the comparison of the results at pH 8 and 12.3 indicated that in NHDFs positioned inside the PTV, SSBs were less numerous after five irradiations than after just one. In contrast, in NHDFs positioned at the margin, SSBs were more numerous after five irradiations than after just one (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>).

To assay this hypothesis, we submitted NHDFs to a unique irradiation at 2 Gy or to a series of five, and we performed the comet assays either just after the last irradiation or after a 72 hr delay, to evaluate whether the repair has happened or not. The results indicate that SSBs formed in cells positioned either in the PTV or the margin were fully repaired within 72 hr after a unique irradiation, whereas they were still detected 72 hr after the last irradiation of a series of five (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>), indicating that the SSB repair capacity decreased with successive radiation fractions. In contrast, the DSBs were always fully repaired within 72 hr, whatever the cells were submitted to one or five radiation fractions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>), indicating that the DSB repair capacity was not affected along a fractionated irradiation protocol. The same results were obtained by analyzing the breaks by immunofluorescence against XRCC1 and 53BP1: XRCC1 foci (SSBs) generated in the PTV were also partly resolved within 72 hr, but those generated in the margin were still significantly present after 72 hr; 53BP1 foci (DSBs) present in NHDFs positioned inside the PTV or at the proximal margin after four successive radiation fractions at 2 Gy were partly resolved within 72 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>). These results confirm that the SSBR capacity declines with the successive radiation fractions of a therapeutic protocol.</p><p>Since this decline could be due to an exhaustion of the pool of NAD+ (the substrate of PARP1) because of the high and continuous demand, we evaluated the evolution of the PARylation capacity of the cells along a fractionated protocol. NHDFs were irradiated at 2 Gy, once or during 2 weeks, and just after the last radiation fraction they were challenged by H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> to evaluate their remaining capacity in synthesizing PAR chains. Immunofluorescence against PAR chains shows that after one irradiation NHDFs do synthesize PAR chains in response to H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, whereas after 10 successive radiation fractions they have become unable to do so (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3</xref>).</p><p>Taken together, these results suggest that the successive irradiations of a standard fractioned radiotherapy protocol could lead to an exhaustion of the PARylation capacity, provoking the accumulation of unrepaired SSBs.</p></sec><sec id="s2-9"><title>A few radio-induced senescent cells generated in the margin give rise to transformed daughter cells</title><p>As unrepaired SSBs could be mutagenic, we wondered whether the marginal senescent cells could be a source of (pre)-neoplastic cells. To investigate this point, we irradiated NDHFs positioned inside the PTV or at its margin at 2 Gy/day during 2 weeks up to the induction of senescence. Since all cells located in the margin were probably not fully senescent at the end of this treatment, we sorted the most senescent NHDFs according to their SA-β-Gal activity, size, and granularity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). Sorted cells were plated again and monitored for post-senescence emergence. After 2–4 weeks post-sorting according to the experiment, we noticed the reappearance of small proliferating cells amongst senescent cells emanating from the margin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A and B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2A</xref>) referred to as post-senescent neoplastic emergent (PSNE). To determine whether these cells displayed (pre-)neoplastic properties, we first assayed whether they were mutated by performing an Hypoxanthine Phosphorybosyl Transferase (HPRT assay). As expected, exponentially growing cells did not survive a 6-thioguanine (6-TG) treatment, meaning their <italic>hprt</italic> gene, taken as a reporter of the genome condition, was not loss-of-function mutated. In contrast, PSNE cells, having emerged from senescent cells of the margin, resisted the 6-TG treatment, suggesting they were carrying mutations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2B</xref>). Then, we evaluated the invasive properties of the PSNE cells. We first searched for a potential matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) activity by in-gel zymography. Gelatinase activity was detected in PSNE cells emanating from NHDFs positioned in the margin compared to exponentially growing NHDFs taken as control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). Then, we assayed their migrating and invading capacities in Boyden chamber assays using respectively Matrigel-uncoated or -coated filters. PSNE cells, having emerged from senescence induced in the margin, did not show any increased migration compared to nonirradiated exponentially growing cells. However, their invasive capacities were multiplied about fourfold compared to control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>). Finally, we evaluated their tumorigenic potential by performing xenografts in immunocompromised mice (CB17-SCID). Twenty-two mice were grafted with 10<sup>6</sup> PSNE cells emanating from NHDFs positioned in the margin (proximal or distal). Up to now, 10 months after grafting, none of these mice developed tumors, whereas all mice grafted with HT1080 cells, a sarcoma cell line, developed a tumor within 2 weeks. Taken together, these results evidence that along irradiations of a fractionated protocol normal fibroblasts of the vicinity of a PTV enter premature senescence from which, after a while, few rare cells evade to give rise to a progeny of proliferative, mutated, invading, but not fully tumorigenic cells.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Some radio-induced senescent cells generated in the margin escape from senescence to generate a progeny of cells that reproliferate, have an increased invasion capacity, and display mutations.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Normal human dermal fibroblasts (NHDFs) (donor F6MC1, population doubling [PD] = 29.6 at the beginning of the experiment) positioned straddling the planning target volume (PTV) and the margin were irradiated or not during 2 weeks (10 * 2 Gy).

Therefore, we wondered if the sole SSB accumulation in the absence of DSBs or other DNA damages could be sufficient to induce senescence and post-senescence neoplastic escape. To address this question, we set a protocol to specifically and solely induce unrepaired SSBs, independently of an irradiation. For that, we daily treated NHDFs with a very mild 5 µM concentration of hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) to induce SSBs. To make them accumulate, we inhibited their repair by co-treating the cells with ABT-888, also called veliparib, a specific inhibitor of PARP1 and PARP2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Donawho et al., 2007</xref>). We checked that the combined treatment did induce a significant accumulation of XRCC1 foci, whereas the treatments with H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> alone or veliparib alone were very much less efficient. The accumulation of XRCC1 foci began from the 14th day of the combined treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>).

We also analyzed the phosphorylation of XRCC1 and the recruitment of PNKP at the damage foci to check the SSBR blockage by their absence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2</xref>). We then followed up the consequence of the accumulation of unrepaired SSBs on the cell behavior.

Several studies conclude that they could be due to the out-of-field dose affecting normal cells surrounding the treated volume (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chofor et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chofor et al., 2011</xref>). In this study, we investigated the effects of this out-of-field dose on normal fibroblasts in terms of DNA damage and cell outcome. We show that the out-of-field dose induces the formation of SSBs, but nearly no DSBs. Importantly, the SSBs accumulate during a mimicked standard therapeutic protocol because of a lack of repair due to a decrease in the PARylation capacity that establishes along the successive daily radiation fractions. The fibroblasts affected by this specific accumulation of unrepaired SSBs do not undergo cell death but enter in premature senescence. They remain stably arrested in this senescent state for a while, and then a few of them re-enter cell cycle to generate a progeny of daughter cells displaying hallmarks of cancerous transformation, but which have not become fully tumorigenic. This scenario was established by robust in vitro experiments using proliferating or quiescent primary human fibroblasts derived from different donors, as well as by in vivo experiments in mice. It is, to our knowledge, the first scenario that could explain at the same time the latency period of second sarcoma emergence, underpinned by the long life of senescent cells, and the preferential location of second sarcomas around the treated volume, underpinned by the specific accumulation in this area of nonlethal but mutagenic unrepaired DNA damages.</p><p>It is known that the marginal dose exponentially decreases with the distance from the limit of the beam (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chofor et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kry et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Wiezorek et al., 2009</xref>). In accordance, we found that the quantity of DSBs dramatically decreases from a few millimeters from the limit of the beam. In contrast and surprisingly, SSBs were almost as numerous at several centimeters from the limit of the beam as inside the PTV. Moreover, we demonstrated that their formation necessitates continuity in the material from the PTV. This indicates that SSBs are induced by photons propagating inside the material, confirming several studies showing that the internal scattering is the major source of the dose deposited in the most proximal margin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chofor et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lee et al., 2016</xref>). Moreover, it can be hypothesized that the preferential generation of SSBs on DSBs in the margin could be the consequence of the tightening of the scattered photon spectral energy fluence distribution around lower energies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chofor et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chofor et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kirkby et al., 2007</xref>). The experimental setup of this study was designed to only address the question of the potential role of photons scattering from the PTV, without mixing with the bystander effect relying on molecules secreted by the irradiated cancer and normal cells present inside the PTV. Of course, in the patient context, these two mechanisms could add, even synergize, or perhaps oppose the induction of DNA damages and the full transformation of the cells.</p><p>The results of this study also suggest that the ratio of DSBs/SSBs is very important in the cell outcome determination. Indeed, our data show that cells, whether they are cancerous or normal, developed both DSBs and SSBs when positioned inside the PTV, as already known (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Reisz et al., 2014</xref>), and consequently either underwent apoptosis in a few days, or more slowly entered a senescent-like state and then died. In contrast, normal cells positioned at the margin, which developed almost exclusively SSBs, or normal cells in which we induced almost exclusively SSBs by a co-treatment with a mild concentration of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> associated with a PARP inhibitor did not die at a significant level but entered senescence. Similarly, in normal human epithelial cells (keratinocytes and mammary epithelial cells), senescence occurs following an increase in endogenous oxidative stress, which also results in an accumulation of unrepaired SSBs, in the absence of DSBs or telomere shortening (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Nassour et al., 2016</xref>). Very importantly, in all these situations where senescence is induced by SSBs in the almost absence of DSBs, telomere shortening or any other DNA damage able to induce the DDR pathway, a few cells systematically re-enter in S-phase to generate a progeny of daughter cells displaying neoplastic or pre-neoplastic properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Deruy et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gosselin et al., 2009b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Martin et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Nassour et al., 2016</xref> and results herein). In contrast, NHDFs (the same as those used in the irradiation experiments of this study), having entered in replicative senescence because of shortened telomeres, never undergo apoptosis and remain very stably arrested in G1 without ever escaping (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">d’Adda di Fagagna et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Nassour et al., 2016</xref>). This state of replicative senescence fits very well with the dogma equating senescence with tumor suppression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Campisi, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Campisi, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kirkland and Tchkonia, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Shay and Roninson, 2004</xref>). In contrast, SSB-only-induced senescence, which harbors a cell cycle arrest that is not so stable for a few cells and source of cells harboring cancerous hallmarks, has to be considered as a tumor-promoting state.</p><p>Senescence establishment implies the accumulation of DNA breaks, some of which have to remain unrepaired to sustain a prolonged activation of the cell cycle arrest pathways. This is true for replicative senescence in which shortened telomeres, which are assimilated to unrepaired DSBs, constantly activate the DDR pathway and downstream the tumor suppressor TP53 and its target p21, a CKI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Rossiello et al., 2014</xref>). This is also true for SSB-only-induced senescence of human keratinocytes and mammary epithelial cells where unrepaired SSBs activate the upregulation of p16 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Nassour et al., 2016</xref>), a major in vivo and in vitro senescence-associated CKI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">He and Sharpless, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Rayess et al., 2012</xref>). We now demonstrate this mechanism in this study also for fibroblasts in which SSBs were induced by a mild H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> treatment associated with a PARP inhibitor. And most importantly, we now demonstrate this mechanism for cells submitted to out-of-field radiations in a radiotherapy-mimicking context. But why SSBs are not repaired in this radiotherapy context is not yet completely established. We established in this study that the SSB repair capacity declines with the daily irradiations of a fractioned protocol, in correlation with a decline in the PARylation capacity. However, the precise mechanism of the PARylation capacity decline is presently unknown and is under investigation.</p><p>One major characteristic of cancer cells is their multiple mutations affecting oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes. The (pre-)neoplastic cells that are formed by SSB-only-induced senescence evasion display mutations and transformed characteristics including morphological change and increased invasion capacity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Nassour et al., 2016</xref> and results herein). The accumulation of unrepaired SSBs is the inducer of senescence, but paradoxically it is also the fuel for post-senescence evasion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Nassour et al., 2016</xref>), probably because of the mutagenic potential of unrepaired DNA breaks. However, the precise mechanisms by which SSBs induce senescence and (pre)neoplastic evasion remain to be investigated.</p><p>The results of this study open at least two therapeutic avenues to decrease the risk of developing a second cancer after radiotherapy. One could be to decrease the accumulation of unrepaired SSBs in peri-PTV cells by supplementing the patient with NAD+ precursors. However, this also should decrease the accumulation of SSBs in cancer cells, consequently decreasing their rate of death and thereby compromising the cure. The other avenue could be to try to eliminate the senescent cells after the end of the radiotherapy. It is now widely established that senescence contributes to multiple age-related dysfunctions and diseases, and eliminating senescent cells in mice delays or decreases the incidence of these disorders, including cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baker et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Wissler Gerdes et al., 2020</xref>). This prompted several teams to develop drugs, called senolytics, specifically targeting senescent cells, to alleviate age-related disorders. There are presently two major senolytics whose efficacy was demonstrated in vitro and in mouse models, and which are subject to clinical trials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chang et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Pan et al., 2017</xref>): (i) the BH3 mimetics ABT-737 and ABT-263 (navitoclax) and (ii) the association of dasatinib + quercetin. Interestingly, navitoclax, dasatinib, and quercetin are or were used in anticancer treatments, presupposing that their use after radiation therapy to prevent from a second cancer emergence should not hamper the efficacy of the radiotherapy, even they could act additionally or synergistically with the treatment.</p><p>To conclude, in addition to have a clinical interest, studying post-radiotherapy second sarcoma is a model to study the very initial steps of tumorigenesis. Indeed, most often, these steps are inaccessible because of affecting too few cells, of unknown type, altered by an unknown stressing or damaging agent. In the context of post-radiotherapy second sarcomas, the affected cells and the inducer are known. The very first tumorigenic event we highlight in this study involves the formation of discreet DNA damages – SSBs – often assumed to be of no consequence because these are easily repaired and do not affect the genome stability. We show here that cells adapt to these damages and survive for a long time by adopting the senescent phenotype. They thereby become a reservoir of potentially tumorigenic mutations.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cell cultures</title><p>NHDFs were purchased from PromoCell.

Cells were permeabilized with a Triton X-100 solution at 0.2% in PBS followed by PBS washing. Unspecific sites were blocked by incubation at room temperature with a 5% non-fat milk solution in PBS. Then, epitopes were detected by incubation overnight at 4°C with antibodies against XRCC1 (ab47920 or ab1838, Abcam; sc-11429, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), 53BP1 (sc-22760, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), phosphoXRCC1 (A300-059A, Bethyl Laboratories), hOGG1 (B01P, Abnova), PNKP (Ab 170954, Abcam), or PAR chains (AM80, Calbiochem). After washing with PBS, cells were incubated with the secondary antibody (Life Technologies, A21206 and A-21202) followed by nuclear staining with 300 nM DAPI (Life Technologies, D1306). For the co-detection of the co-localization of 53BP1 and γH2AX, the antibodies against 53BP1 (NB100-304, Novus Biologicals) and γH2AX (NB100-78356, Novus Biologicals) were co-incubated overnight at 4°C.

The suspension was then immediately spread on a cometslide (4250-200-03, Trevigen). Agarose was allowed to cool down 20 min at 4°C. Then, cell membranes were permeabilized with a lysis solution (1.2 M NaCl, 100 mM EDTA, 10 mM Tris-HCl, 1% Triton X-100 [pH 10]) at 4°C, for 1 hr. Slides were then equilibrated in electrophoresis buffer (for pH 8: 89 mM Tris-base, 89 mM boric acid, and 2 mM EDTA; for pH 12.3: 300 mM NaOH, 1 mM EDTA) at 4°C. Then, an electrophoresis field of 40 V (15 mA) was applied during 30 min for pH 8 and of 60 V (90 mA) during 5 min for pH 12.3 at 4 °C. The electrophoretic migration was stopped by neutralizing the pH in a bath of cold water for 10 min. DNA was stained with SYBRGreen (X1000; Molecular Probes) according to the manufacturer’s recommendation. The slides were photographed under an AxioImagerZ1 Apotome (Zeiss) microscope. The images were analyzed using an ImageJ in-home macro in which the head (the nucleus) and the tail (the DNA that migrated) of the comet are delimited in order to get the fluorescence intensity of the head, the fluorescence intensity of the tail, and the length of the tail. The calculation of tail moments was done using the formula: (length of the comet tail × fluorescence intensity of the tail)/total fluorescence intensity (head+ tail).</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Mouse skin histology</title><p>One hour after irradiation, mice were sacrificed and skin samples were dissected.

The main conclusion although interesting is still correlative. The authors do not show whether SSBs are sufficient or required for the emergence of pro-tumorigenic cells from senescent cells.

In figure 2, senescence is characterized by using the classic SA-b-Gal marker and cell morphology parameters obtained by FACS. This paper aims to distinguish senescence with SSBs and DSB as two important types of senescent cells. A more detailed characterization is needed to fully understand these differences.

In figure 3A, the number of DSB observed in the PTV according to the p53BP1 biomarker is three times or more in comparison with cells in the margin. However, in figure 3B there is just a minor difference. This suggests that the sensitivity of the comet assay used is very low and cannot be used to conclude &quot;a lack&quot; of DSBs in cells in the margin. An independent biomarker of DSBs such as γH2AX is suggested to reinforce this important point.</p><p>3. Figure 3A should also include representative images of the foci quantified by the authors.

The authors propose that this is due to NAD depletion. However, low PARP levels (this was discarded in the discussion) or high PARG activity can equally explain these results. A direct measurement of NAD levels will be very informative.</p><p>7. The malignant properties of the fibroblasts that emerge from senescence are not fully characterized. The ability of these cell to form tumors in vivo would ideally be provided to conclude that these cells are responsible for secondary cancers after radiation.</p><p>8. The idea that SSB lead to a senescence arrest from which cells can escape is interesting and have wide ranging biological consequences. The authors end their paper showing that treating cells with reagents that induce only SSBs are sufficient to trigger this phenomenon. However, cells that are irradiated in the PTV also show high levels of SSB and they do not generate cells that escape from senescence. There are two competing models that explain the data. First, the author's model: &quot;SSB accumulation is sufficient to induce a senescence stage form which cells can escape&quot;. Alternatively, the senescence arrest associated to SSBs is not complete and the SSBs are just a measure of lower level of damage but not mechanistically involved in generating post-senescence cells. In fact, the emergence of post senescence cells is a very rare phenomenon and that is not consistent with the use of the word sufficient to explain the role of SSBs.</p><p>9. It would be relatively easy for the authors to show that senescent cells in the margin having mostly SSBs are sensitive to senolytics. Can these data be provided?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>One major issue from radiation therapy is the generation of secondary tumors that can arise a long time after treatment. This raises issues both to the academic point of view, to know cellular and molecular events involved, and for medical treatment. In this work, the authors designed a precise and elaborate protocol mimicking exposure of adjacent cells (margin ) to the central radiation beam, i.e. the planning target volume (PTV). The authors deeply characterized this novel irradiation protocol.</p><p>DNA double strand breaks (DSB) and single strand breaks (SSB) are the main DNA breaks generated by ionizing radiation (IR), but DSBs are generally considered as the most harmful lesion, leading to cell death. The authors made several observations, many of them being unexpected:</p><p>– Both DSB and SSB are produced in the PTV, while only (or mostly) SSB are generated in the margin. This leads to mainly cell death in the PTV, but mainly senescence in the margin.</p><p>– Senescence in the margin result from SSB accumulation due to SSB repair defect.</p><p>– Some cells escape from senescence, bearing mutations and markers of transformed cells.</p><p>This allows to establish a model with all steps elucidated.</p><p>Comments for the authors:</p><p>1. Page 8, line 133: &quot;normal human dermal fibroblasts&quot;: Please confirm that these are primary dermal fibroblasts.</p><p>2. Page 9, line 169-175, Figure 1C and Supp: sounds there are a little bit more caspase-independent death à 4x2Gy with F6MC1. Is it linked to the age of the donor or to individual variability? Also there is late apoptosis at 6x2Gy, no? Could the authors comment?</p><p>3. Page 9 line 187 (Figure 2A). Seems there is no decrease in the margin.</p><p>4. Page 11 Line 224-227: did the authors tried to analyze the impact of NAC, on DSB production? For some authors the DSB indirectly arise from bases oxidation (resulting from water radiolysis) and incision of the oxidized bases on the complementary DNA strands. According to this hypothesis, reducing ROS by treating cells with NAC might reduce the frequency of DSBs. Same comment lines 248-252.</p><p>5. Page 12 line 268. According to the cell cycle analysis, many cells are not so much quiescent, the effects are moderate and many cells are still replicating their genome. Did the authors try without any serum (primary cells can support this) or at confluency? And also at low O2 concentration (for example, 3%) that better mimics the in vivo conditions.</p><p>6. Page 13 line 305: &quot;SSBs were less numerous after five irradiations than after just one&quot;. Could the authors comment (one sentence might be sufficient).</p><p>7. Page 13 line 310: please define SSBR in the text (I suppose it is SSB repair).</p><p>8. Page 13 Line 310-319: can we envision the de novo production of SSB production, that might alter the final quantification?</p><p>9. The discussion is a little bit too long. For instance the paragraph on the senolytics (line 461-480) could be shortened. It is not necessary to deeply detail all the potential strategies; this is interesting, but a little bit out the scope of the paper.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.67190.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>This is an original contribution based on previous work from the Abbadie group describing the emergence of tumorigenic cells from senescent cells.

In contrast, SSBs are more easily quantifiable than DSBs by comet assay because the comet tails are longer. Therefore, the two techniques are complementary. In figure 3A, the differences in DSB numbers between the PTV and the margin are indeed at least 3-fold. In figure 3B, they are of the same range, between 2.1 and 2.5 (see the exact values in <xref ref-type="table" rid="sa2table1">Author response table 1</xref>), but this is not very easy to see on the graph because of the scale we have to put to include all the extreme values.</p><table-wrap id="sa2table1" position="float"><label>Author response table 1.</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom"/><th align="left" valign="bottom">Non-irradiated</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">PTV</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Margin (-5 to +20mm)</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Margin (+22 to +47mm)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Mean</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">2.34</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">7.49</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">2.96</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">3.45</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Fold change between PTV and margin</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">2.53</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">2.17</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><p>However, we have done immunofluorescence against γH2AX as requested.

A direct measurement of NAD levels will be very informative.</p></disp-quote><p>We have made the same hypotheses as the reviewer, and these points are currently under investigation, but none of our results are presently convincing. Our latest results suggest that the expression of PARP1 could decline a bit in contrast to what we wrote in the initial version of the paper. So, we have changed the text, to just say that the mechanisms are presently unknown and under investigation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7. The malignant properties of the fibroblasts that emerge from senescence are not fully characterized. The ability of these cell to form tumors in vivo would ideally be provided to conclude that these cells are responsible for secondary cancers after radiation.</p></disp-quote><p>We have done this experiment, but at the time we submitted our article, we though that the delay of observation was too short to conclude. Now, we are 10 months after grafting, so we give the results as they are (see p15).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8. The idea that SSB lead to a senescence arrest from which cells can escape is interesting and have wide ranging biological consequences. The authors end their paper showing that treating cells with reagents that induce only SSBs are sufficient to trigger this phenomenon. However, cells that are irradiated in the PTV also show high levels of SSB and they do not generate cells that escape from senescence. There are two competing models that explain the data. First, the author's model: &quot;SSB accumulation is sufficient to induce a senescence stage form which cells can escape&quot;. Alternatively, the senescence arrest associated to SSBs is not complete and the SSBs are just a measure of lower level of damage but not mechanistically involved in generating post-senescence cells. In fact, the emergence of post senescence cells is a very rare phenomenon and that is not consistent with the use of the word sufficient to explain the role of SSBs.</p></disp-quote><p>This comment of the reviewer made me realize that I was not enough clear. What is important for senescence escape is the accumulation of unrepaired SSBs in the absence of DSBs, shortened telomeres or other DNA damages able to activate the DDR pathway. I now better explain that in the discussion. Moreover, I used in the new version of the article, wherever possible, the expressions “SSB-without-DSB signature” or “SSB only-induced senescence” instead of “SSB-induced senescence”.</p><p>For us, the fact that only a few cells escape the senescent arrest do not preclude the use of the word “sufficient”. We used the word “sufficient” in its mathematical acceptation meaning that if SSBs (without DSBs) are present, senescence and post-senescence emergence will occur. The fact that only a few cells escape senescence could be explained by the mutations induced by the SSB that could only stochastically affect genes involved in cell cycle regulation or other key functions involved in transformation. However, we agree that we have not yet investigated how SSB mechanistically induce senescence and escape. I added a sentence for saying that in the revised version.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9. It would be relatively easy for the authors to show that senescent cells in the margin having mostly SSBs are sensitive to senolytics. Can these data be provided?</p></disp-quote><p>We have done these experiments and showed that Navitoclax was indeed able to kill senescent fibroblasts arising in the PTV or in the margin. Navitoclax was also able to kill MDA-MB 231 cells having resisted to 2 weeks of irradiations. These results are therefore highly promising for a future use in clinics. Presently, we are performing experiments in mice. We think it will be more pertinent to publish these results with those in vivo to come.</p><p>We also tried the association Dasatinib+Quercetin. These drugs were indeed toxic for senescent fibroblasts, but killed at the same level the proliferating ones.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:Comments for the authors:</p><p>1.

Page 11 Line 224-227: did the authors tried to analyze the impact of NAC, on DSB production? For some authors the DSB indirectly arise from bases oxidation (resulting from water radiolysis) and incision of the oxidized bases on the complementary DNA strands. According to this hypothesis, reducing ROS by treating cells with NAC might reduce the frequency of DSBs. Same comment lines 248-252.</p></disp-quote><p>We have done experiments with NAC because we believed that ROS produced by water radiolysis would be at the origin of SSBs (rather than DSBs which are generally assumed to result from a direct ionization of DNA). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref> shows the growth curves of MDA-MB231 and NHDFs irradiated during two weeks in the presence or not of NAC. The results indicate that NAC does not rescue the growth of both cell types, whether they were irradiated or not, localized in the PTV or in the margin, rather NAC slightly slowed down the growth of NHDFs. This indicates that in this experimental setting, the impact of radio-induced oxidative stress is non-significant. We do not wish to publish these results, because they are preliminary and the role of ROS needs to be in-depth investigated (ROS concentration measures, other antioxidants).</p><fig id="sa2fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-67190-sa2-fig1-v1.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5.
