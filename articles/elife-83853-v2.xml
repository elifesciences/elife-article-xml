These pathways utilize an array of molecular mechanisms in the epigenetic modulation of gene expression and exert their influence on nearly every step in the lifecycle of a transcript, from transcription to translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Meister, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Wu et al., 2020</xref>). At the cellular level, small RNA (sRNA) pathways are key contributors to regulating genome and transcriptome homeostasis, both under normal conditions and stress responses. At the organismal level, sRNA pathways are key regulators of gene expression programs that direct development and differentiation, and mis-regulation of sRNA pathways or components can lead to conditions such as cancer and infertility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Wu et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>The central effectors of sRNA pathways are the highly conserved Argonaute (AGO) family of proteins. AGOs are the core components of ribonucleoprotein complexes called RISCs (RNA induced silencing complexes) and are guided in a sequence-specific manner by sRNAs (18â30 nucleotides long) to complementary target transcripts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Dueck and Meister, 2014</xref>). AGOs have a bilobed structure consisting of four major domains: PAZ, MID, PIWI, and a low-complexity N-terminal domain. The PAZ and MID domains possess pockets to coordinate 3â² and 5â² end sRNA binding, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Sheu-Gruttadauria and MacRae, 2017</xref>). The PIWI domain resembles RNaseH and has the capacity to direct endonucleolytic cleavage of the target RNA if the active site harbors a tetrad of catalytic amino acids (DEDD/H, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Nakanishi et al., 2012</xref>). Relatively few AGOs possess this catalytic tetrad, and many AGOs recruit additional proteins to elicit other gene regulatory outcomes, such as mRNA de-capping, de-adenylation, or chromatin modulation.</p><p>In <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>, at least four types of endogenous sRNAsâmiRNAs, piRNAs, 22G-RNAs, and 26G-RNAsâand as many as 27 AGO-like genes have the potential to contribute to complex networks of gene regulation in different tissues throughout development. miRNAs and piRNAs are genomically encoded and transcribed by RNA polymerase II, while the 22G-RNAs and 26G-RNAs are generated by the activity of different RNA-dependent RNA polymerases (RdRPs). miRNAs are known to associate and function with the conserved AGOs ALG-1, ALG-2, and ALG-5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Hutvagner et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Brown et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">CorrÃªa et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Vasquez-Rifo et al., 2013</xref>). The Piwi-interacting RNAs (piRNAs, also called 21U-RNAs in <italic>C. elegans</italic>) bind to the PIWI AGO PRG-1 and are thought to maintain germline genome integrity by silencing foreign or deleterious nucleic acids such as transgenes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Lee et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Shirayama et al., 2012</xref>). Although piRNA pathways in other animals play a more prominent role in regulating transposable elements than in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, the functions of the piRNA pathway are broadly and consistently required in animal germlines to ensure fertility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Ozata et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Two additional types of endogenous sRNAs present in <italic>C. elegans</italic> are the 26G-RNAs and 22G-RNAs (named for their predominant length and 5â² nucleotide). Because these sRNAs are generated by RdRPs, they are thought to exploit perfect complementarity to their targets. The 26G-RNAs are synthesized by the RdRP RRF-3, which generates dsRNA that is processed into 26G-RNAs by the endonuclease DICER and the phosphatase PIR-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Chaves et al., 2021</xref>). 26G-RNAs are classified into two groups: those of spermatogenic origin (class I, associated with ALG-3 and ALG-4, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Han et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Conine et al., 2010</xref>) and those of oogenic and embryonic origin (class II, associated with ERGO-1, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Vasale et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Han et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>The 22G-RNAs are generated by the RdRPs RRF-1 and EGO-1, independent of DICER. Currently, 22G-RNAs are divided into two main groups, those that are bound by CSR-1 and target germline expressed protein-coding transcripts to protect them from silencing, along with fine-tuning gene expression in the embryo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Claycomb et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cecere et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Seth et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Wedeles et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Singh et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Gerson-Gurwitz et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Nguyen and Phillips, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Charlesworth et al., 2021</xref>), versus those that are bound by other WAGO class AGOs (such as WAGO-1 and HRDE-1) that silence protein-coding genes, pseudogenes, transposable elements, and cryptic loci (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Gu et al., 2009</xref>). 22G-RNAs are generally thought to act as secondary, amplified sRNAs that are synthesized after a transcript is targeted by a primary sRNA/AGO complex, with the main exception being the majority of CSR-1 associated 22G-RNAs. Primary sRNAs take several forms: piRNAs (PRG-1), 26G-RNAs (ALG-3, ALG-4, and ERGO-1), and exogenous-siRNAs produced by DICER during exogenous RNAi (exoRNAi) (RDE-1).</p><p><italic>C. elegans</italic> AGOs have generally been studied on a case-by-case basis, with <italic>agos</italic> being uncovered via genetic screens, or selected for study based on phenotype (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Tabara et al., 1999</xref>). Such approaches are limited because not all phenotypes to which <italic>agos</italic> may contribute have been tested, and redundancy among the <italic>agos</italic> could confound their recovery in genetic screens. To date, only one study has taken a systematic approach to understanding AGO functional relationships, examining the requirement for each <italic>ago</italic> in exogenous RNAi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Yigit et al., 2006</xref>). A lack of antibodies against individual AGOs and difficulties with transgenic approaches have also hampered the development of a cohesive set of reagents to study AGO function. Indeed, several <italic>C. elegans</italic> AGOs have yet to be studied, and others remain only partially characterized.</p><p>In this study, we have undertaken a systematic analysis of the <italic>C. elegans</italic> AGOs. We employed CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing to introduce GFP::3xFLAG epitope tags in the endogenous loci of each <italic>ago</italic> using these strains to examine spatiotemporal expression profiles throughout development, combined with sequencing sRNAs from AGO complexes and <italic>ago</italic> mutants to define the core of <italic>C. elegans</italic> sRNA pathways. We systematically assessed fertility of <italic>ago</italic> mutants and employed phenotypic assays directed by our expression and sRNA sequencing data, enabling us to uncover new roles for specific AGOs in maintaining germline integrity and in regulating immune responses to bacterial and viral pathogens. Collectively, our findings provide a foundation for understanding the full scope of sRNA pathway activity in <italic>C. elegans</italic>. With these AGO tools and knowledge of sRNA binding partners and targets, our findings provide a deeper understanding of sRNA functions throughout development and under varied environmental conditions in <italic>C. elegans</italic>.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Systematic analysis of <italic>C. elegans</italic> Argonautes</title><p>Previous studies identified 27 <italic>ago</italic> genes in <italic>C. elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Yigit et al., 2006</xref>); however, some have been reclassified as pseudogenes (e.g., <italic>prg-2</italic>). To define an updated set of <italic>ago</italic> genes to study, we searched the genome (WormBase version WS262) for genes that contain PAZ and PIWI domains, have a predicted protein size of ~100 kDa, and bear homology to known AGOs. Twenty-one genes met these criteria, and we ultimately characterized 19 of these AGOs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and B</xref>). Construction of a phylogenetic tree for these 19 AGOs in relation to <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> AGO1 and <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> PIWI places seven AGOs in the AGO clade: ALG-1, ALG-2, ALG-3, ALG-4, ALG-5, ERGO-1, and RDE-1; a single AGO in the PIWI clade: PRG-1; and 13 AGOs in the WAGO clade: CSR-1, C04F12.1 (renamed VSRA-1 for Versatile Small RNAs Argonaute-1, see below), WAGO-1, PPW-2/WAGO-3, WAGO-4, SAGO-2/WAGO-6, PPW-1/WAGO-7, SAGO-1/WAGO-8, HRDE-1/WAGO-9, WAGO-10, and NRDE-3/WAGO-12 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). It is important to note that CSR-1 exists as two isoforms, a long isoform (CSR-1a) and a short isoform (CSR-1b), that differ by 163 amino acids at their N terminus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Nguyen and Phillips, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Charlesworth et al., 2021</xref>).

Loss of RDE-1 also led to a substantial depletion of miRNAs overall, while loss of ALG-2 or ALG-5 did not result in major changes, which could reflect redundancy or differences in function for these AGOs. Loss of several WAGOs also led to a decrease in global miRNA levels, and we speculate that this is due to indirect effects on protein-coding gene regulation, rather than a direct influence on the miRNA pathway.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3-2"><title>miRNA and ERGO-1 26G-RNA pathways intersect</title><p>To understand the association of ALG-3, ALG-4, and ERGO-1 with both 26G-RNAs and miRNAs, we tested whether the GFP::3xFLAG tag interfered with proper sRNA loading, using existing ERGO-1 IP-sRNA sequencing data performed with an ERGO-1-specific antibody (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Vasale et al., 2010</xref>). In this study, the authors detected a subset of ERGO-1-associated miRNAs, but dismissed this as a nonspecific interaction. We reanalyzed these data using our custom computational pipeline and identified 26 miRNAs that were enriched twoold over input and significantly overlapped with our IP data set, suggesting that miRNA association with ERGO-1 is not a result of the GFP::3xFLAG tag, but that miRNA enrichment may be a property of ERGO-1 IPs.</p><p>We examined our AGO expression and localization data, and observed that ERGO-1 expression closely overlaps with ALG-1 and ALG-2, indicating that these AGOs could physically interact in vivo (Figures 6A and F and 7A, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7âfigure supplements 1</xref>â<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s8">8</xref>).

These data suggest that the ERGO-1/ALG-1 or -2 interactions are due to AGO associations on shared target transcripts. Further supporting this model, we sequenced sRNAs associated with ERGO-1 IPs after RNase treatment and observed that miRNAs were substantially reduced, while 26G-RNAs remained enriched, compared to non-RNase treated ERGO-1 IPs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G and H</xref>). Collectively, these data suggest that the miRNA enrichment present in the ERGO-1 IPs may be indirect due to an interaction between ERGO-1 and ALG-1 or ALG-2 on target transcripts. They also imply that co-regulation of target transcripts by 26G-RNAs and miRNAs could occur. Finally, these observations highlight an important consideration for interpreting IP/sRNA sequencing data: the association of multiple AGOs on common transcripts could result in skewed sRNA enrichment patterns, thus additional experiments such as those described above and examination of <italic>ago</italic> mutant sRNA sequencing data are warranted.</p><p>To explore the functional and developmental consequences of physical interaction between ERGO-1 and ALG-1, we created <italic>alg-1; ergo-1</italic> double mutants.

Patterns of sRNA distribution were generally more similar within AGO clusters than between clusters; however, there were some differences.

The majority of lincRNAs (48) are targeted by the WAGO cluster, followed by the ERGO-1 cluster (35). Many of the targets overlapped between the WAGO and ERGO-1 clusters (26), with the majority of this overlap (25/26) originating from PPW-1 targets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5âfigure supplement 2D</xref>). Seventeen lincRNA targets were specific to the WAGO cluster, three were specific to the ALG-3/4 cluster, and three were specific to the ERGO-1 cluster (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5âfigure supplement 2D</xref>). Our results point to lincRNAs as another important, yet poorly studied category of sRNA targets with the potential for tissue-specific regulation.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5-4"><title>Hierarchy and interconnected regulation of multiple sRNA pathways</title><p>To begin to understand why <italic>C. elegans</italic> encodes so many AGOs, we must first understand how the different sRNA pathways interact with each other. Loss of one component may affect the sRNA landscape in the organism, potentially allowing us to infer the hierarchical relationship between sRNA/AGO pathways. Our analysis indicated that some AGOs may have distinct roles and participate in different pathways depending on the tissue in which they are expressed. To address how loss of one component may affect the system, we sequenced sRNAs from all <italic>ago</italic> mutants in triplicate. We examined how the sRNAs antisense to protein-coding, pseudogene, repetitive and transposable element, and lincRNA targets of each AGO are affected in each <italic>ago</italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5âfigure supplement 3</xref>).</p><p>It is possible that AGOs may regulate other AGOs, especially as among the targets of AGO/sRNAs were other <italic>agos</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5âfigure supplement 2E</xref>), indicating there may be regulatory networks in place in which sRNA pathways can regulate others, and/or participate in regulatory feedback loops. The WAGOs CSR-1 and WAGO-4 form a hub that targets most of the constitutively expressed germline AGOs (see below; note that this is mostly attributable to CSR-1b based on the developmental time assayed), while the spermatogenesis-specific AGOs, ALG-3, ALG-4, and WAGO-10 form a self-regulatory hub (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5âfigure supplement 2E</xref>). Below we outline several observations from this analysis and put these results in the context of our current knowledge of hierarchy in sRNA targeting.</p><p>Loss of the miRNA-binding AGOs ALG-1, ALG-2, and ALG-5 did not have large effects on the endo-siRNA pathways (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5âfigure supplement 3</xref>); therefore, we begin our analysis by focusing on established primary AGOs: PRG-1, ERGO-1, and ALG-3/4. Given that CSR-1 seems able to play both primary and secondary AGO roles, we include it in this group. Loss of the piRNA-binding primary AGO PRG-1, which results in the loss of most piRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>), led to downregulation of secondary sRNAs associated with the WAGO cluster AGOs sRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Montgomery et al., 2021</xref>). This result is consistent with the model that piRNA targeting induces the production of 22G-RNAs that are then loaded into WAGO-1 and HRDE-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Lee et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Cornes et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Das et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bagijn et al., 2012</xref>). Our complete analysis reveals that PPW-1 and PPW-2 also work within the context of PRG-1 targeting. With similar logic, loss of the 26G-RNA-binding primary AGO ERGO-1 resulted in the loss of ERGO-1 cluster sRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5âfigure supplement 3</xref>). Consistent with our observation that NRDE-3 sRNAs are depleted, it was previously shown that the translocation of NRDE-3 to the nucleus requires sRNA binding, and loss of ERGO-1 results in NRDE-3 remaining cytoplasmic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Guang et al., 2008</xref>). Our complete analysis reveals that SAGO-1- and SAGO-2-associated 22G-RNAs are depleted upon loss of ERGO-1, indicating that SAGO-1 and SAGO-2 also work within the context of ERGO-1 targeting.</p><p>We observed that the sRNAs of some 22G-RNA-associated AGOs are differentially affected by loss of primary AGOs. For example, PPW-1-bound sRNAs that target protein-coding genes, pseudogenes, and transposons are depleted in <italic>prg-1</italic> mutants but not <italic>ergo-1</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5âfigure supplement 3</xref>). Conversely, PPW-1-bound sRNAs that target lincRNAs are depleted in <italic>ergo-1</italic> mutants but not <italic>prg-1</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5âfigure supplement 3</xref>). When taken together with the clustering analysis of targets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A and DâF</xref>), it appears that PPW-1 acts downstream of both the PRG-1 piRNA pathway and the ERGO-1 26G-RNA pathway. This PPW-1 duality may be dependent on the tissue (germline and soma) in which it is expressed. Thus, it is likely that in the germline PPW-1 acts downstream of PRG-1 piRNAs, and in the soma it acts downstream of ERGO-1 26G-RNAs. A similar observation is made for C04F12.1/VSRA-1-bound sRNAs. C04F12.1/VSRA-1 acts downstream of ERGO-1 26G-RNAs to target pseudogenes, transposons, and lincRNAs, and acts in conjunction with CSR-1 22G-RNAs to target protein-coding genes in the germline (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A and DâF</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5âfigure supplement 3</xref>). Because of this dual association with the CSR-1 cluster and the ERGO-1 cluster, we named C04F12.1 VSRA-1, for <underline>V</underline>ersatile <underline>S</underline>mall <underline>R</underline>NAs <underline>A</underline>GO.</p><p>Loss of the 26G-RNA-binding AGOs ALG-3 and ALG-4 individually did not affect sRNA populations, likely due to their partial redundancy with each other (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Conine et al., 2010</xref>). Interpreting the loss of CSR-1 is more complicated, given that it targets nearly one quarter of the protein-coding genome, is encoded as two isoforms with distinct expression profiles and functions, and is required for both gene licensing as well as silencing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Charlesworth et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Nguyen and Phillips, 2021</xref>). Loss of both isoforms of CSR-1 in a null mutant resulted in depletion of CSR-1 cluster sRNAs targeting protein-coding genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5âfigure supplement 3</xref>); however, the sRNA levels of other AGOs, including WAGO-1, HRDE-1, PPW-1, SAGO-2, and SAGO-1, were also decreased. This may be due to secondary effects arising from loss of CSR-1, which appears to be capable of regulating many other AGOs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5âfigure supplement 2E</xref>).</p><p>Loss of single 22G-RNA-associated AGOs had different effects depending on the AGO (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5âfigure supplement 3</xref>). Like loss of both CSR-1 isoforms, loss of WAGO-4 also resulted in depletion of CSR-1 cluster sRNAs. Loss of the WAGO cluster WAGOs had varying effects. Loss of WAGO-1 or HRDE-1 resulted in the depletion of PPW-2-associated sRNAs, while loss of HRDE-1 alone also resulted in depletion of WAGO-1- and HRDE-1-associated sRNAs. This indicates that HRDE-1 is required for the stability of most of the WAGO cluster associated sRNAs, likely reflecting the requirement of HRDE-1 in producing tertiary sRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Sapetschnig et al., 2015</xref>). Loss of SAGO-1 resulted in downregulation of ERGO-1 cluster-associated sRNAs primarily targeting pseudogenes and lincRNAs. This suggests SAGO-1 is the main AGO targeting these elements downstream of ERGO-1/26G-RNAs. Loss of PPW-2 did not result in downregulation of WAGO cluster small RNAs, but rather CSR-1 cluster sRNAs, highlighting the potential for interplay between pathways.</p><p>In summary, we have defined which classes of genetic elements are targeted by each AGO and the genetic requirements for each <italic>ago</italic> in accumulating sRNAs targeting these elements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>). These results define the relationships between different AGO pathways and highlight the complexity of target regulation. The clear targeting of different genetic elements by different clusters of AGOs implies that features intrinsic to the target transcript likely encode determinants for AGO/sRNA pathway specificity. Furthermore, the spatiotemporal expression profile of targets, sRNA biogenesis components, and AGOs are also likely to be major contributors to the patterns we have observed.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>AGOs have distinct spatiotemporal localization patterns during development</title><p>To link our molecular observations with the AGO expression profiles and gain insight into where each AGO exerts its function, we visualized GFP fluorescence using confocal microscopy at each stage of worm development, revealing that AGOs are expressed in a variety of tissues throughout the life cycle. We identified 16/19 AGOs expressed in the germline, consistent with known roles for AGOs in the germline (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A and F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6âfigure supplement 1A</xref>). Eight of these show germline-restricted expression and the other eight are also expressed in somatic tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7âfigure supplements 1</xref>â<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s8">8</xref>). In total, 11/19 AGOs are expressed in the soma, with 3 AGOs being somatically restricted (SAGO-1, SAGO-2, ALG-1) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7âfigure supplements 1</xref>â<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s8">8</xref>). We observed AGOs expressed in various somatic tissues, including but not limited to the vulva, hypodermis, muscle, seam cells, intestine, neurons, somatic gonad, and spermatheca (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A and F</xref> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7âfigure supplements 1</xref>â<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s8">8</xref>). AGO expression levels vary, and low expression levels or expression under specific (e.g., stress induced) conditions may have precluded detection of some AGOs in some tissues. Specifically, RDE-1 was hardly detectable as a translational fusion. However, the first step in our CRISPR protocol generates a transcriptional reporter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Dickinson et al., 2015</xref>), by which we observed strong GFP expression under the control of the <italic>rde-1</italic> promoter.

Nine AGOs are constitutively expressed throughout the germline from the emergence of the P1 cell through spermatogenesis in the L4 stage to oogenesis in adults: RDE-1, ALG-5, PRG-1, CSR-1b, WAGO-1, PPW-2, WAGO-4, PPW-1, and HRDE-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7âfigure supplements 1</xref>â<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s8">8</xref>). Of these, two AGOs are more highly expressed at the mitotic zone of the adult oogenic germline: ALG-5 and PPW-2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). The other seven germline-expressed AGOs exhibit gamete-specific expression patterns. ALG-3, ALG-4, WAGO-10, and the CSR-1a isoform are expressed only during spermatogenesis, at the L4 stage in hermaphrodites and constitutively in the male germline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Charlesworth et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Nguyen and Phillips, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s7">Figure 7âfigure supplement 7</xref>). Only PPW-2 and CSR-1b are detectable in spermatids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Charlesworth et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Schreier et al., 2022</xref>). ALG-2, ERGO-1, and NRDE-3 are specifically expressed in oocytes starting at the young adult hermaphrodite stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A and F</xref>). C04F12.1/VSRA-1 is also restricted to the oogenic germline in adult worms and shows expression in the primordial germ cells of L1 larvae (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7âfigure supplement 2</xref>). Published mRNA expression data from dissected hermaphrodite and male germlines shows largely the same mRNA expression patterns as the tagged AGO proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6âfigure supplement 1B</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Tzur et al., 2018</xref>). All germline-expressed AGOs, except those that are expressed only during oogenesis, are also expressed in the male germline and display the similar patterns of expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s7">Figure 7âfigure supplement 7</xref>).</p><p>The germline AGOs encompass different subcellular localization profiles. Half (8/16) of the germline AGOs are enriched in perinuclear phase-separated germ granules: ALG-3, ALG-4, ALG-5, PRG-1, CSR-1a, b, WAGO-1, PPW-2, and WAGO-4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A and F</xref>). PPW-1 is also weakly detected in germ granules, mostly restricted to the pachytene region of the adult germline (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). There are four types of germ granules in <italic>C. elegans</italic> that are thought to play different roles in sRNA pathways: P granules, Z granules, Mutator Foci, and SIMR Foci (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Sundby et al., 2021</xref>). PRG-1, CSR-1, and WAGO-1 were previously reported to co-localize with P granules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Wang and Reinke, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Batista et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Claycomb et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Gu et al., 2009</xref>), and WAGO-4 was identified as a Z granule component (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Wan et al., 2018</xref>). To determine which types of germ granules the germline-constitutive WAGOs, CSR-1b, and PRG-1 are associated with, we determined the overlap in pixels between fluorescently-tagged AGOs and components of P granules (PGL-1) or Z granules (ZNFX-1) using confocal microscopy in adult worms. The CSR-1 cluster AGOs CSR-1 and WAGO-4 overlapped roughly equally with both P and Z granule pixels, whereas the WAGO cluster AGOs PPW-2 and WAGO-1 were strongly biased toward overlap with P granules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). PRG-1 was intermediate to both of these phenotypes. Thus, AGOs with similar target preferences display similar germ granule localization patterns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>).</p><p>Two AGOs are predominantly nuclear: HRDE-1 and NRDE-3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A and F</xref>). While HRDE-1 is known to be a nuclear germline AGO required for RNAi inheritance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Buckley et al., 2012</xref>), NRDE-3 was previously shown to be a somatic nuclear AGO, required for somatic RNAi inheritance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Guang et al., 2008</xref>). That we observed NRDE-3 localizing to oocyte nuclei may explain how it is capable of propagating certain RNAi responses into the next generation.</p><p>Due to the split in AGOs between germline-constitutive and sex-specific expression, we asked whether targets were also sex-biased. A previous report defined the spermatogenic, oogenic, and germline-constitutive transcriptomes of <italic>C. elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Ortiz et al., 2014</xref>). Therefore, we compared the protein-coding target transcripts for 22G- and 26G-RNA binding AGOs to this dataset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). The 22G-RNA targets of the WAGO cluster AGOs PPW-2, HRDE-1, and WAGO-1 were depleted of germline constitutively expressed transcripts. Instead, PPW-2 and HRDE-1 targets were enriched for spermatogenic transcripts, and WAGO-1, HRDE-1, and PPW-1, targets were enriched for oogenic transcripts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). This suggests that the WAGO cluster can be further subdivided and is responsible for sex-specific gene regulation during the young adult stage when oogenesis occurs: PPW-2 regulates spermatogenic genes, and WAGO-1 and PPW-1 regulate oogenic genes. Both branches of this WAGO cluster appear to act upstream of or in parallel with the nuclear HRDE-1. The 22G-RNA targets of the CSR-1 cluster AGOs CSR-1, C04F12.1/VSRA-1, and WAGO-4 were depleted of spermatogenic transcripts and were enriched for both oogenic and germline-constitutive transcripts in the young adult stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). We previously reported that CSR-1b and WAGO-4 associate with oogenic and germline constitutive transcripts during the L4 stage, and in contrast CSR-1a enriches for spermatogenic transcripts that overlap with the ALG-3/4 cluster (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Charlesworth et al., 2021</xref>). During the L4 stage, targets of the ALG-3/4 cluster AGOs WAGO-10, ALG-3 and -4 were all enriched for spermatogenic transcripts and ALG-3 and -4 also showed enrichment for germline constitutive transcripts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). Similarly, during the young adult stage, the ALG-3/4 cluster AGO RDE-1 targets were also enriched for spermatogenic transcripts. Thus, germline AGOs have differential roles in regulating sex-specific germline transcripts in a spatiotemporal manner.</p><p>Given their germline expression, we next asked whether each germline AGO is required for fertility. Previous work examined a role for each <italic>C. elegans ago</italic> in fertility and found that only <italic>csr-1</italic> is essential at the normal laboratory-culturing temperature of 20Â°C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Yigit et al., 2006</xref>), although several other AGOs, including ALG-1, ALG-2, and PRG-1, have been shown to be required for optimal fertility at this temperature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Batista et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Bukhari et al., 2012</xref>). However, in recent years it has become apparent that stressful conditions, such as elevated temperature, can have a substantial impact on the fertility of mutants. This temperature-dependent fertility defect can manifest in the first generation after a temperature shift or take several generations to reach its full impact. Several germ granule component mutants and <italic>ago</italic> mutants, including <italic>hrde-1</italic>, <italic>prg-1</italic>, <italic>wago-4</italic>, and <italic>ppw-2,</italic> have been shown to exhibit a Mortal germline (Mrt) phenotype, in which fertility decreases over several generations at elevated temperature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Buckley et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Simon et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Schreier et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Wan et al., 2018</xref>). We therefore performed brood size assays at 20Â°C and 25Â°C for recently outcrossed hermaphrodites of each single <italic>ago</italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). At 20Â°C, seven <italic>ago</italic> mutants showed compromised fertility: <italic>alg-1</italic>, <italic>alg-2</italic>, <italic>alg-5</italic>, <italic>ergo-1</italic>, <italic>prg-1</italic>, <italic>rde-1,</italic> and <italic>wago-1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). When shifted to 25Â°C, the same mutants displayed a low brood size, which was even more pronounced in some cases (e.g., <italic>alg-1</italic> was sterile). We also observed fertility defects not present at 20Â°C for four <italic>ago</italic> mutants: <italic>alg-4</italic>, <italic>ppw-2</italic>, <italic>wago-4</italic>, and <italic>hrde-1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). <italic>csr-1</italic> mutants were sterile at both temperatures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). These results indicate that more than half (10/19) of the <italic>C. elegans</italic> AGOs contribute individually to optimal fertility.</p><p>To further assess the role of temperature stress on the fertility of <italic>ago</italic> mutants, we conducted an Mrt assay, following worms for 30 generations at 25Â°C.

We also observed substantially reduced fertility that took longer to manifest in <italic>alg-3</italic> and <italic>alg-4</italic> single mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>). These <italic>agos</italic> have been shown to act partially redundantly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Conine et al., 2010</xref>) and loss of both results in sterility at 25Â°C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Collectively, these findings implicate 11/19 AGOs and every type of sRNA pathway in maintaining fertility over generations.</p><p>Understanding of the Mrt phenotype is currently incomplete. Factors involved in telomere and chromatin maintenance as well as germ granule components result in an Mrt phenotype when mutated, and it has been suggested that this phenotype occurs when epigenetic stress accumulates over generations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Cecere, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Sundby et al., 2021</xref>). The <italic>hrde-1</italic> Mrt phenotype at 25Â°C was shown to be reversible upon transferring the animals back to 20Â°C, suggesting it may not be genotoxic in origin (e.g., transposon mobilization) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Spracklin et al., 2017</xref>). Similarly, the Mrt phenotype of <italic>prg-1</italic> mutants is reversible when the animals are subjected to starvation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Simon et al., 2014</xref>). We therefore explored whether <italic>ago</italic> mutant Mrt phenotypes display the same characteristics as each other and other Mrt mutants. We focused on the WAGOs that have the most severe Mrt phenotype: <italic>wago-1</italic>, <italic>ppw-2</italic>, <italic>wago-4</italic> and <italic>hrde-1</italic>.</p><p>To test whether genotoxic stress is responsible for the Mrt phenotype, we maintained animals at 25Â°C for three generations, then transferred them back to 20Â°C and measured brood size at each generation. For all four mutants, we observed the same pattern; a reversal of the Mrt phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6âfigure supplement 2A</xref>), suggesting that genotoxic stress is not responsible for the Mrt phenotype for any of these w<italic>agos</italic>.</p><p>Given that the Mrt phenotype results in a gradual decrease in brood size, we hypothesized that the germline might suffer from general proliferation defects. To test this, we examined the germlines of the Mrt <italic>wagos,</italic> focusing on the mitotic zone. Counting germ cells at the mitotic zone at 20Â°C and 25Â°C revealed Mrt <italic>wagos</italic> produced fewer germ cells than wild-type controls, suggesting a proliferation defect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6âfigure supplement 2B</xref>). The Mrt <italic>wagos</italic> also showed a reduced number of oocytes in adult animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6âfigure supplement 2C</xref>). We also tested whether the Mrt <italic>wagos</italic> displayed increased levels of apoptosis, which could lead to decreased numbers of germ cells, using acridine orange staining. Only <italic>hrde-1</italic> mutants displayed a slight elevation in apoptosis levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6âfigure supplement 2C</xref>). These results are consistent with a previous observation that <italic>hrde-1</italic> mutants have variable defects in both oogenesis and spermatogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Buckley et al., 2012</xref>) and suggest that the defects observed in the Mrt <italic>wagos</italic> generally arise early in germ cell proliferation. In our analysis of the sRNA complements and targets of these WAGOs, we showed that WAGO-1, PPW-2, and HRDE-1 cluster together to target repetitive elements and other silenced germline genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D and E</xref>), while WAGO-4 mainly targets germline expressed genes that are co-targeted by CSR-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A and C</xref>). Whether a common mechanism or different mechanisms underlie the Mrt phenotype in these <italic>ago</italic> mutants from different clusters remains to be resolved.</p></sec><sec id="s2-8"><title>AGO somatic expression and tissue-specific gene regulation</title><p>We found broad expression patterns for many AGOs in the soma, suggesting they may have gene regulatory roles in tissues where sRNA pathways have not been deeply explored (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7âfigure supplements 1</xref>â<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s8">8</xref>). The intestine is a key interface between the worm and its environment.

The intestine is the somatic tissue that expresses the most AGOs: ALG-1, ALG-2, ERGO-1, RDE-1, CSR-1a (the long isoform of CSR-1), PPW-1, SAGO-2, SAGO-1, and NRDE-3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A and B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s8">Figure 7âfigure supplement 8</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Guang et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Vasquez-Rifo et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Charlesworth et al., 2021</xref>). Most AGOs were broadly cytoplasmic; NRDE-3 was nuclear; and three AGOs, SAGO-1, SAGO-2, and PPW-1, showed an accumulation along the apical membrane of the intestinal cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). SAGO-2 is not detectable in other tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7âfigure supplements 1</xref>â<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s8">8</xref>).</p><p>Given the role of the intestine, and the abundance of AGOs representing three of the four sRNA pathways (miRNA, 22G- and 26G-RNAs), we wondered how these pathways might function there. The entire ERGO-1 cluster is represented in the intestine, along with the long isoform of CSR-1, CSR-1a (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). Our previous work demonstrated that CSR-1a silences genes involved in immune and pathogen defense responses in the intestine. Loss of <italic>csr-1a</italic> led to an upregulation of these genes and enhanced worm survival on the bacterial intestinal pathogen <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> (PA14) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Charlesworth et al., 2021</xref>). Similarly, the GO terms associated with the ERGO-1 cluster are enriched for immune and defense responses, particularly in the intestine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp7">Supplementary file 7</xref>). GO terms associated with the targets of individual AGOs were primarily derived from the targets of SAGO-2 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp7">Supplementary file 7</xref>), which is closely related to PPW-1 and SAGO-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Additionally, PPW-1 targets were enriched for the innate immune signaling pathway, MAP kinase (MAPK) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp7">Supplementary file 7</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Kim et al., 2002</xref>). Given their localization and GO analysis, we hypothesized that SAGO-1, SAGO-2, and PPW-1 may play a role in immune responses to pathogenic bacteria. In agreement, survival assays of <italic>sago-2</italic>, <italic>ppw-1,</italic> and <italic>sago-1</italic> mutants on PA14 revealed that both <italic>sago-2</italic> and <italic>ppw-1</italic> are partially resistant to killing by PA14 infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>).</p><p>Previous research has shown that PPW-1, SAGO-1, and SAGO-2 act as secondary AGOs, downstream of RDE-1 in exo-RNAi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Yigit et al., 2006</xref>), with SAGO-1 and SAGO-2 being required for efficient exo-RNAi in the soma, and PPW-1 for efficient exo-RNAi in the germline. Overexpression of any of these three AGOs in the muscle cells of a compound <italic>ago</italic> mutant rescues the RNAi deficiency of the mutant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Yigit et al., 2006</xref>). RDE-1 and other components of the exo-RNAi machinery are also involved in antiviral responses against the Orsay virus. RDE-1 targets the viral RNA and recruits the RdRP RRF-1 to generate secondary 22G-RNAs that combat the virus. Consistent with this, loss of <italic>rde-1</italic> or the RdRP machinery leads to increased viral proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">FÃ©lix et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>Given our understanding of the roles of the secondary AGOs in exo-RNAi, we hypothesized that viral secondary 22G-RNAs could be loaded into these AGOs, and that their mutation could render the worms more sensitive to Orsay virus. To test this, we analyzed the response of <italic>sago-2</italic>, <italic>ppw-1,</italic> and <italic>sago-1</italic> mutants to infection by Orsay virus using <italic>rde-1</italic> and <italic>pals-22</italic> as controls for sensitivity and resistance, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Reddy et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>). Only <italic>sago-2</italic> showed a higher infection level, which phenocopied that of <italic>rde-1</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>). Thus, SAGO-2 may have dual roles in mediating immunity in the intestine. First, SAGO-2 targets immune response genes, and loss of <italic>sago-2</italic> enhances the ability of the worms to survive on PA14. Conversely, loss of <italic>sago-2</italic> decreases viral RNA targeting, likely by RNAi mechanisms in which SAGO-2 is loaded with secondary 22G-RNAs that were generated after targeting of viral RNA by the primary AGO RDE-1.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Here, we have analyzed the 19 AGO proteins in <italic>C. elegans</italic> using CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing and next-generation sequencing. Analysis of the expression patterns and sRNA complements of each AGO identifies sRNA regulatory networks employed in tissues throughout the animal and reveals specific and shared features of each AGO, advancing understanding of the functions and mechanisms of these pathways in the context of a whole animal.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title><italic>C. elegans</italic> small RNA pathways</title><p>Our analysis provides a framework for categorizing the AGOs and their sRNAs. Consistent with current models, the AGOs can be divided into four groups based on the type of sRNA they interact with: (1) the miRNA binding classical AGOs, ALG-1, ALG-2, ALG-5, and RDE-1; (2) the piRNA binding PIWI, PRG-1; (3) the 26G-RNA binding classical AGOs, ERGO-1, ALG-3, and ALG-4; and (4) the 22G-RNA binding WAGOs, CSR-1, VSRA-1, WAGO-1, PPW-2, WAGO-4, PPW-1, SAGO-2, SAGO-1, HRDE-1, and NRDE-3. Our analysis of the 22G- and 26G-RNA binding AGOs revealed they can be further classified into four major clusters based on their targets: (1) the CSR-1 cluster: CSR-1, WAGO-4, and C04F12.1/VSRA-1, which target germline expressed protein-coding genes; (2) the WAGO cluster: WAGO-1, PPW-2, and HRDE-1 that target silenced germline genes, pseudogenes, and repetitive/transposable elements; (3) the ERGO-1 cluster: ERGO-1, PPW-1, SAGO-1, SAGO-2, and NRDE-3 that target many somatic genes, pseudogenes, and lincRNAs; and (4) the ALG-3/4 cluster: ALG-3, ALG-4, and WAGO-10 that are restricted to the spermatogenic germline and predominantly target spermatogenesis genes.</p><p>Among these groups, several AGOs bind to one type of sRNA (e.g., ALG-1, -2, -5, and PRG-1), while others have broader specificity or act as scavengers (e.g., RDE-1). We observed a physical association between the 26G-RNA binding AGOs and miRNAs, which may reflect coordinated regulation of transcripts by both miRNAs and 26G-RNAs. The 22G-RNA binding AGOs represent a more varied group, in which some AGOs cluster differently depending on the portion of the genome they target (e.g., VSRA-1 clusters with CSR-1 to target protein-coding genes, and with ERGO-1 to target lincRNAs). However, how sRNAs and targets are âselectedâ by different AGOs remains poorly understood.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>AGO/small RNA specificity</title><p>Individual AGO target specificity involves many factors, including the intrinsic structural and biochemical properties of the AGO; the sRNA biogenesis mechanisms and biochemical features; the features and co-factors of target transcripts; and the expression and localization patterns of AGOs, sRNA machinery, and targets. For instance, it has been shown that the preference for a specific 5â² nucleotide is determined in large part by interactions between the sRNA, the 5â² binding pocket within the MID domain and another region of the AGO termed the specificity loop (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Ma et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Frank et al., 2010</xref>). In <italic>C. elegans</italic>, the biogenesis mechanisms of sRNAs contribute to specificity through differences in 5â² nucleotide chemistry, in which miRNAs, piRNAs, and 26G-RNAs possess a monophosphate (DICER-dependent), whereas the 22G-RNAs possess a triphosphate (DICER-independent). This difference is reflected in the AGO phylogeny; the AGOs more closely related to AGOs in other species retained the ability to bind 5â² monophosphorylated nucleotides and possess highly conserved residues within the 5â² binding pocket (e.g., Y529, K533, Q545, K570, C546 in hAGO2) while the WAGOs preferentially bind triphosphorylated nucleotides and possess a more divergent set of residues in these positions. These results, coupled with structure-function-based analyses in vivo, will enable us to understand the mechanisms of AGO loading and sRNA preference more comprehensively despite a lack of in vitro sRNA loading assays.</p><p>We observed that most of the transcriptome, including nearly all protein-coding genes, has 22G- and 26G-RNAs directed against it. This suggests that sRNA production (1) happens broadly across tissues and (2) that most of the transcriptome has the potential to become a substrate for RdRP activity. However, we did not observe sRNA enrichment in AGOs for all of the transcripts with detectable sRNAs. This could be for a number of reasons. First, our experimental design and analysis pipeline is biased for more abundant and more enriched sRNAs to produce a high-confidence set of targets for each AGO. If we reduced the thresholds of 5 RPM, twofold enrichment, and requirement for enrichment in both replicates, we might detect additional sRNAs (and thus targets) enriched in association with AGOs that occur at very low abundance or are expressed in a small number of cells. Second, features of the transcript are likely to influence the extent to which it can serve as a template for sRNA synthesis, including sequence motifs, intron/exon, content, 3â² UTR and poly-A length, secondary structure, expression level, association with other RBPs, and subcellular routing and/or localization. Third, targeting by an AGO is generally thought to initiate an sRNA amplification loop. Thus, targets for which sRNAs are successfully loaded into AGOs and that reach a critical threshold of AGO regulation may be the âwinnersâ that we have detected in our sRNA sequencing. In-depth computational analyses of the features of high-confidence target transcripts will reveal specific features of âsuccessfulâ targets. Measuring transcript levels and localization in specific cell types, using single cell-seq and smFISH, will inform our understanding of what target levels and which subcellular locations (e.g., germ granules) are associated with high levels of sRNAs. Finally, examination of RdRP mechanisms in specific cell types and in vitro is necessary to fully understand AGO/sRNA specificity.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Temporal and spatial specificity of small RNA regulation</title><p>Our analysis maps the expression patterns of every AGO throughout development. While some AGOs are broadly expressed in a variety of tissues, others are restricted to specific tissues, cell types, and developmental stages. For example, ERGO-1, ALG-2, and NRDE-3 are expressed in similar patterns within a variety of tissues that include neurons, the somatic gonad, intestine, and oocytes. PRG-1, which has mainly been studied for its role in germline gene regulation, is also present within muscle during larval stages. It remains to be determined whether AGOs have the same functions and targets in each cell type in which they are expressed, and whether the targets change during development.</p><p>Our analysis mainly focused on the L4 to YA transition stage in <italic>C. elegans</italic> because all AGOs, aside from the spermatogenesis specific AGOs, are expressed at this time. Also, sRNA populations change in abundance during development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ambros et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Ruby et al., 2006</xref>), which could reflect changes in expression or association with AGOs. Using the tools developed here, it is possible to probe different life stages of <italic>C. elegans</italic> to observe the temporal dynamics of AGO/sRNA complexes and gain a better understanding of the regulation of targets throughout development, either in a whole animal or a tissue/cell-type-specific manner.</p><p>Several studies have analyzed cell-type-specific functions of AGO/sRNA pathways. However, most genomic studies on <italic>C. elegans</italic> AGOs and sRNAs used whole worms to obtain sufficient material for IP/sRNA sequencing and mainly considered two tissue types (soma and germline) using mutants and subtractive approaches. While using whole worms enables a broad overview of AGO/sRNA targets, it may miss low-abundance sRNAs that could participate in cell-type-specific functions. We are now able to identify AGO complexes and pools of sRNAs in specific cells or tissues with low amounts of starting material, and can use tissue-specific promoters and 3â² UTRs to drive AGO expression in specific cells and tissues. Furthermore, functional assays, such as reporter assays, are growing increasingly more precise, and coupling these with auxin-degron-mediated AGO depletion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Zhang et al., 2015</xref>) will allow for enhanced control over AGO activity in specific tissues. Our analysis of expression patterns provides an atlas of AGO expression. This and the phenotypes we have uncovered point to specific tissues of interest, and will help prioritize specific cells and tissues for subsequent analyses.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Stress reveals phenotypes</title><p><italic>C. elegans</italic> laboratory culture conditions are chosen to minimize stress and promote growth.

Previous studies did not observe phenotypes for most single <italic>ago</italic> mutants under normal laboratory culture conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Yigit et al., 2006</xref>). However, one major function of sRNA pathways is to regulate gene expression to ensure robustness against stressful conditions, with a growing body of literature demonstrating that sRNA pools are altered in response to changes in the environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Rechavi et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Rechavi et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Kaletsky et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Moore et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Houri-Zeevi et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Ewe et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Schott et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Ni et al., 2016</xref>). For example, in sRNA pathway and germ granule mutants, elevated temperature strongly affects <italic>C. elegans</italic> fertility, leading to an Mrt phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ahmed and Hodgkin, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Sundby et al., 2021</xref>). While several <italic>agos</italic> had been associated with the Mrt phenotype previously, our systematic analysis revealed additional AGOs whose loss also contributed to reduced fertility under temperature stress and implicated all types of worm sRNA pathways in this process. Therefore, the molecular mechanisms underlying this phenotype may be different for each <italic>ago</italic> mutant. Further in-depth characterization of germline development and gene expression in the <italic>ago</italic> mutants will be necessary to better understand this phenomenon. However, the potential for indirect effects due to mis-regulation of large groups of genes remains a challenge to disentangle.</p><p>Pathogens are another set of stressors that worms are frequently exposed to in the wild, but rarely encounter in the lab. Our sequencing analysis of SAGO-2- and PPW-1-bound sRNAs revealed that these AGOs regulate immunity and pathogen response genes, which led us to test their roles in response to various pathogens. Our studies revealed a dichotomy for two closely related paralogs. These two AGOs share greater than 98% sequence identity at the nucleotide level and the same expression pattern in the intestine, yet PPW-1 is also expressed constitutively in the germline. Loss of either <italic>sago-2</italic> or <italic>ppw-1</italic> led to enhanced survival when confronted with the bacterial pathogen PA14, yet loss of <italic>sago-2</italic> alone resulted in increased Orsay virus infection. We suspect this is because SAGO-2 and PPW-1 regulate immune-responsive genes, and their loss is likely to cause mis-regulation of these genes. This may indirectly provide the worms with an enhanced ability to ward off infection by PA14. On the other hand, SAGO-2 is likely to be directly involved in the antiviral response, downstream of RDE-1, while PPW-1 is either redundantly required or dispensable for this response. These two AGOs display different phenotypes, yet vary at only 12 amino acids, and challenging us to understand the molecular mechanisms by which these AGOs act.</p><p>While we do not know all the conditions under which AGO/sRNA pathways are required, the wormâs natural environment may provide important clues and experimental contexts for further analyzing the roles of the AGOs. This, in combination with the AGO expression profiles and sRNA sequencing data described here will help define environmental stressors and the functions of sRNA pathways in adapting to them.</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Noncoding RNA targets of sRNA pathways</title><p>Transposable elements are tightly regulated in the germline. In many animals, transposable elements are silenced by the piRNA pathway. However, in worms the piRNA pathway directly regulates only a handful of DNA (cut and paste) transposable elements. Instead, the WAGO cluster, including HRDE-1, WAGO-1, PPW-1, and PPW-2, is responsible for nearly all transposable element regulation in the worm. These AGOs likely function constitutively in the germline, while a handful of transposable elements are regulated during spermatogenesis by ALG-3/4.</p><p>While sRNA regulation of protein-coding genes and transposable elements is well-studied, we show that lincRNAs and pseudogenes are also prominent targets. Both pseudogenes and lincRNAs appear to be regulated by various AGO clusters, implying tissue-specific regulation. For instance, the WAGO cluster targets germline lincRNAs, the ALG-3/4 cluster targets spermatogenesis lincRNAs, and the ERGO-1 cluster targets somatic lincRNAs, when integrating sRNA enrichment and AGO expression data. Both lincRNAs and pseudogenes have the capacity to regulate gene expression themselves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Pink et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Statello et al., 2021</xref>), and warrant further study as sRNA targets.</p></sec><sec id="s3-6"><title>AGO isoforms and differential functions</title><p>Recent studies on two CSR-1 isoforms demonstrated that different isoforms encoded from a single <italic>ago</italic> gene can have different expression patterns, sRNA binding partners, and functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Charlesworth et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Nguyen and Phillips, 2021</xref>). SAGO-2, PPW-1, ALG-1, ALG-2, and ERGO-1 also exhibit the potential to encode more than one protein, with one or more exons that vary between isoforms. For all but SAGO-2, the differential exons are encoded at the 5â² end of the gene, leading to N-terminal differences in encoded proteins.

The WormBase version WS276 PRJNA13758 ce11 canonical geneset annotations were used (excluding miRNAs, repeats, and transposons). <italic>C. elegans</italic> miRNA annotations were obtained from miRBase (release 22.1). For repeats and transposons RepeatMasker+Dfam (ce10, October 2010, RepeatMasker open-4.0.6, Dfam 2.0) annotations were used. The UCSC Lift Genome Annotations tool was used to convert ce10 coordinates to ce11 coordinates. Briefly, the counting script used the findOverlaps function from the GenomicAlignments package (version 1.22.1) to assign reads to features. Multiple aligning reads or reads that align to more than one feature were dealt with by counting reads in a sequential manner to the different gene biotypes in the following order (AS stands for antisense): miRNA, piRNA, rRNA, snoRNA, snRNA, tRNA, ncRNA, lincRNA, repeats AS, protein coding AS, pseudogene AS, lincRNA AS, antisense RNA, rRNA AS, snoRNA AS, snRNA AS, tRNA AS, ncRNA AS, miRNA AS, piRNA AS, protein coding, pseudogene, antisense RNA AS, repeats. For reads that align to more than one feature in the same biotype group, the read count was split between the features based on the fraction of uniquely aligned reads to each of those features (unique weighing). Subsequent analysis was performed using custom R scripts (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/ClaycombLab/Seroussi_2022">https://github.com/ClaycombLab/Seroussi_2022</ext-link>, copy archived at <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Seroussi, 2023</xref>).</p><p>To determine small RNAs enriched in Argonaute IPs, reads were first normalized to library size (reads per million [RPM]). We used two approaches for this. In the first approach, we normalized the reads to the entire library size. In the second approach, we normalized the reads to library size minus sense reads of: rRNA, snoRNA, snRNA, tRNA, ncRNA, lincRNA, protein coding, and pseudogene. These likely represent RNA degradation products so removing them may eliminate noise. The first approach was used in the initial analysis of small RNAs associated with Argonaute IPs for complete transparency and unbiased assignment of small RNA types and targets. Indeed, the vast majority of reads in all libraries were antisense rather than sense. Thus, subsequent enrichment analysis and comparisons between Argonaute IPs and identification of likely targets used the second approach. To determine whether small RNAs against a particular target were enriched in an Argonaute IP, the following calculation was made: enrichment = IP RPM + 0.01/Input RPM + 0.01. The 0.01 represents a pseudocount to eliminate the possibility of dividing by zero. A target was considered enriched if in every replicate it was at least twofold enriched and had at least 5 RPM in the IP replicates. To further refine the analysis, where indicated in the text, only 22G or 26G-RNAs were used to calculate enrichment.

Manderâs co-localization coefficients are calculated using JaCoP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bolte and CordeliÃ¨res, 2006</xref>).</p></sec></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf2"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Data curation, Software, Formal analysis, Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing â original draft, Writing â review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Software, Formal analysis, Validation, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Software, Formal analysis, Validation, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Formal analysis, Validation, Investigation, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Formal analysis, Validation, Investigation, Methodology, Writing â review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Formal analysis, Validation, Investigation, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Formal analysis, Validation, Investigation, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con8"><p>Formal analysis, Validation, Investigation, Methodology, Writing â review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con9"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Visualization, Project administration, Writing â review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con10"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Data curation, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing â original draft, Project administration, Writing â review and editing</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s6"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="supp1"><label>Supplementary file 1.</label><caption><title>A table summarizing previously published data on <italic>C. elegans</italic> AGOs.</title></caption><media xlink:href="elife-83853-supp1-v2.xlsx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="xlsx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="supp2"><label>Supplementary file 2.</label><caption><title>A table summarizing small RNA library information.</title></caption><media xlink:href="elife-83853-supp2-v2.xlsx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="xlsx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="supp3"><label>Supplementary file 3.</label><caption><title>Tables summarizing the enrichment of reads, biotypes, and AGO targets in all libraries.</title></caption><media xlink:href="elife-83853-supp3-v2.xlsb" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="vnd.ms-excel.sheet.binary.macroEnabled.12"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="supp4"><label>Supplementary file 4.</label><caption><title>A table summarizing sRNAs depleted in <italic>ago</italic> mutants.</title></caption><media xlink:href="elife-83853-supp4-v2.xlsx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="xlsx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="supp5"><label>Supplementary file 5.</label><caption><title>A table summarizing the mirDeep2 analysis results in predicting novel high confidence miRNAs.</title></caption><media xlink:href="elife-83853-supp5-v2.xlsx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="xlsx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="supp6"><label>Supplementary file 6.</label><caption><title>A table summarizing the 466 unannotated 21U sRNA sequences enriched in PRG-1 IPs and depleted in <italic>prg-1</italic> mutants.</title></caption><media xlink:href="elife-83853-supp6-v2.xlsx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="xlsx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="supp7"><label>Supplementary file 7.</label><caption><title>Gene Ontology analysis results of AGO targets.</title></caption><media xlink:href="elife-83853-supp7-v2.xlsx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="xlsx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="supp8"><label>Supplementary file 8.</label><caption><title>Strains and primers used in this study.</title></caption><media xlink:href="elife-83853-supp8-v2.xlsx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="xlsx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="mdar"><label>MDAR checklist</label><media xlink:href="elife-83853-mdarchecklist1-v2.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="s7"><title>Data availability</title><p>All high-throughput sequencing data are available through GEO, accession number GSE208702.

We have made this point explicitly within this section, on p. 14:</p><p>miRNA and ERGO-1 26G-RNA pathways intersect</p><p>Collectively, these data suggest that the miRNA enrichment present in the ERGO-1 IPs may be indirect, due to an interaction between ERGO-1 and ALG-1 or ALG-2 on target transcripts. They also imply that co-regulation of target transcripts by 26G-RNAs and miRNAs could occur. Finally, these observations highlight an important consideration for interpreting IP/sRNA sequencing data: the association of multiple AGOs on common transcripts could result in skewed sRNA enrichment patterns, thus additional experiments such as those described above and examination of <italic>ago</italic> mutant sRNA sequencing data are warranted.</p><p>While we have tried to minimize non-specific association of AGOs with sRNAs by testing several buffer/IP conditions and performing additional controls (e.g. as for ERGO-1), the issues of AGO-AGO interactions on common transcripts or within complexes, and the possibility of AGOs associating with abundant sRNA species that they do not normally bind during the IP are important considerations for these experiments. We can readily observe this âcross-contaminationâ issue with ERGO-1 because the sRNAs are two different types: miRNAs and 26G-RNAs. It might not be so easy to pick up on these issues with the WAGOs that bind to 22G-RNAs; for example WAGO-1, HRDE-1, and PPW-2/WAGO-3. However, there are several lines of data that make me less concerned about this issue: 1. The targets are not entirely overlapping for these 3 WAGOs (HRDE-1, WAGO-1, and PPW-2/WAGO-3); and 2. The metagene profiles are different for PPW-2 and HRDE-1 vs. WAGO-1, suggesting that they are not binding to the same exact sequences of sRNAs along the transcript (which you might expect to see if the enrichment was from WAGO-1 and PPW- 2 targeting the same transcripts at the same time, for instance). So, we donât think this is a huge concern for the WAGOs and weâre not sure why it happens for ERGO-1/ALG-Â½.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>I am a bit surprised that N terminal tagging of WAGO-3 resulted in a functional protein.

I recommend the authors discuss this issue somewhere in their paper.</p></disp-quote><p>We were also surprised that PPW-2/WAGO-3 was functional, given the tag placement and the findings of Gudipati regarding N-terminal processing by DPF-3. The tag is not inserted at the extreme N-terminus of PPW-2/WAGO-3, but is instead found at amino acid 7. This may provide for some level of proteolysis of PPW-2/WAGO-3 that renders it functional. Our results with N-terminally tagged PPW- 2/WAGO-3 are comparable to those of Schreier et al (Nat Cell Biol 2021), who inserted a similar tag at the N-terminus:</p><p>âwe endogenously tagged WAGO-3 with GFP::3ÃFLAG at its N terminus. We note that this may affect the function of WAGO-3, as its N terminus is processed34. However, disruption of N-terminal WAGO-3 processing does not result in phenotypes in WAGO-1-wild-type animals34, as is the case in our experiments.â</p><p>We also overlapped our PPW-2/WAGO-3 IP/small RNA enrichment data with that of Schreier et al. and Gudipati et al. (Gudipati tagged PPW-2/WAGO-3 internally, after aa 46) and found good correlation with both data sets, suggesting that the N terminal tagging of PPW-2/WAGO-3 does not interfere with small RNA association in an otherwise wild-type background.</p><p>To increase transparency in our results, we have added the following sentence in the first results section to address the potential caveats of N-terminal tagging of PPW-2/WAGO-3 and WAGO-1:</p><p>We note that although PPW-2 (also known as WAGO-3) and WAGO-1 were recently shown to be N-terminally processed by the protease DPF-1, both GFP::3xFLAG::PPW-2 and 3xFLAG::WAGO-1 strains behaved as wild-type, consistent with previous reports (Gudipati et al., 2021; Schreier et al., 2022).</p></body></sub-article></article>
