Familial cold autoinflammatory syndrome, the mildest form of CAPS, is characterized by cold-induced inflammation induced by the overproduction of IL-1β. However, the molecular mechanism of how mutated NLRP3 causes inflammasome activation in CAPS remains unclear. Here, we found that CAPS-associated NLRP3 mutants form cryo-sensitive aggregates that function as a scaffold for inflammasome activation. Cold exposure promoted inflammasome assembly and subsequent IL-1β release triggered by mutated NLRP3. While K<sup>+</sup> efflux was dispensable, Ca<sup>2+</sup> was necessary for mutated NLRP3-mediated inflammasome assembly. Notably, Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx was induced during mutated NLRP3-mediated inflammasome assembly. Furthermore, caspase-1 inhibition prevented Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx and inflammasome assembly induced by the mutated NLRP3, suggesting a feed-forward Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx loop triggered by mutated NLRP3. Thus, the mutated NLRP3 forms cryo-sensitive aggregates to promote inflammasome assembly distinct from canonical NLRP3 inflammasome activation.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>cytokines</kwd><kwd>inflammation</kwd><kwd>interleukin</kwd><kwd>inflammasome</kwd><kwd>regulated cell death</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>18K08112</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Takahashi</surname><given-names>Masafumi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>21K08114</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Takahashi</surname><given-names>Masafumi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>16H01395</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Takahashi</surname><given-names>Masafumi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003837</institution-id><institution>Ichiro Kanehara Foundation for the Promotion of Medical Sciences and Medical Care</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Karasawa</surname><given-names>Tadayoshi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100009619</institution-id><institution>Japan Agency for Medical Research and Development</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Takahashi</surname><given-names>Masafumi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001700</institution-id><institution>Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Takahashi</surname><given-names>Masafumi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Mutated NLRP3 forms cryo-sensitive aggregates that induce inflammasome assembly distinct from the canonical NLRP3 inflammasome.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The cryopyrin-associated periodic syndromes (CAPS) are a spectrum of rare diseases consisting of three clinically defined autosomal dominant disorders: familial cold autoinflammatory syndrome (FCAS), Muckle-Wells syndrome (MWS), and chronic infantile neurological, cutaneous, and articular syndrome (CINCA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kuemmerle-Deschner et al., 2017</xref>). These three syndromes can be classified according to severity. FCAS is the mildest form of CAPS and is characterized by cold-induced fever, arthralgia, urticaria, and conjunctivitis. MWS is accompanied by systemic amyloidosis and progressive hearing loss. CINCA is the most severe phenotype and is characterized by CNS inflammation, bone deformities, and chronic conjunctivitis. Genetic causes of these disorders are gain-of-function mutations in the NLRP3 gene, encoding cryopyrin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hoffman et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brydges et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kuemmerle-Deschner, 2015</xref>). The mutated NLRP3 protein causes overproduction of IL-1β, resulting in systemic inflammatory characteristics, such as recurrent fever, rash, conjunctivitis, and arthralgia.</p><p>NLRP3 forms a multi-protein molecular complex called ‘NLRP3 inflammasome’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Schroder and Tschopp, 2010</xref>). NLRP3 inflammasome is composed of NLRP3, apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a caspase recruitment domain (ASC) which acts as an adaptor protein, and the cysteine proteinase caspase-1, and functions as a scaffold for caspase-1 activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Schroder and Tschopp, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Karasawa and Takahashi, 2017</xref>). The assembly of inflammasome complex promotes oligomerization and auto-processing of caspase-1. The active caspase-1 processes precursors of inflammatory cytokines IL-1β and IL-18 and converts them to their mature forms. Another critical role of caspase-1 is the processing of gasdermin D (GSDMD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Liu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Broz et al., 2020</xref>). The processed amino-terminal domain of GSDMD binds to the plasma membrane and forms pores. Therefore, caspase-1-mediated GSDMD pore induces the release of cytosolic content and subsequent necrotic cell death called pyroptosis.</p><p>Although NLRP3 was initially identified as a causative gene of CAPS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hoffman et al., 2001</xref>), the function of NLRP3 had been unclear because CAPS is a rare disease. In 2006, however, Tschopp and his colleagues found that monosodium urate crystals activate NLRP3 inflammasome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Martinon et al., 2006</xref>). Since this finding, many studies have clarified the pivotal role of NLRP3 inflammasome in inflammatory responses in both host defense and sterile inflammatory diseases. Other investigators and we have demonstrated the pathophysiological role of NLRP3 inflammasome in cardiovascular and renal diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Duewell et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Usui et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Usui et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Komada et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Komada et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Despite many findings regarding molecular mechanisms and the pathophysiological role of the NLRP3 inflammasome, the disease mechanisms of CAPS are not fully understood. In particular, although FCAS is characterized by cold exposure-induced recurrent fever and inflammation, the mechanisms by which exposure to cold regulates NLRP3 inflammasome in FCAS remain unclear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Rosengren et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brydges et al., 2013</xref>). In the present study, we have found that CAPS-associated NLRP3 mutants form cryo-sensitive aggregates, which function as scaffolds for NLRP3 inflammasome assembly. The aggregation of the mutated NLRP3 is sensitive to Ca<sup>2+</sup>. Therefore, mutated NLRP3 triggers inflammasome assembly driven by Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx-mediated feed-forward regulation.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>CAPS-associated NLRP3 mutants form cryo-sensitive foci</title><p>To investigate the pathophysiological role of CAPS-associated NLRP3 mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cordero et al., 2018</xref>), we generated cell lines expressing fusion proteins of NLRP3 mutants and a green monomeric protein, mNeonGreen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A and B</xref>). We found that FCAS-associated NLRP3-L353P and -Y563N, as well as CINCA-associated NLRP3-D303N and -Y570C formed foci without any stimulation, while wild type (WT)-NLRP3 is expressed diffusely (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). On the other hand, ASC-GFP forms a single speck per cell. To analyze the localization of NLRP3 during NLRP3 inflammasome activation without being affected by ASC, we generated <italic>ASC KO</italic> THP-1 cells (<italic>ASC KO/EF-1-NLRP3-mNeonGreen-</italic>THP-1). NLRP3-D303N formed foci in <italic>ASC KO</italic> THP-1 cells, whereas WT-NLRP3 did not form foci upon stimulation by the NLRP3 activator nigericin, indicating that the foci are distinct from canonical inflammasome assembly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B and C</xref>). To assess whether the foci formation is cryo-sensitive, the transduced cells were exposed to cold temperature (32°C) for 24 hr. A considerable number of foci were detected in CINCA-associated D303N and Y570C mutant-expressing cells under normal temperature (37°C). Although the number of foci was increased in all of the mutant-expressing cells under cold exposure, the sensitivity to cold exposure was prominent in FCAS-associated mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D–I</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D-G</xref>). The number of foci formed was weakly associated with expression levels of NLRP3 as indicated by fluorescence of mNeonGreen. In contrast, speck formation by ASC-GFP was not affected by cold exposure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1J</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1H</xref>). These results suggest that CAPS-associated NLRP3 mutants form cryo-sensitive foci consistent with disease severity and characteristics.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Cryopyrin-associated periodic syndrome-associated NLRP3 mutants form cryo-sensitive foci.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) <italic>EF1-NLRP3-WT-, NLRP3-L353P-,</italic> or <italic>NLRP3-D303N-mNeonGreen-</italic>HeLa cells or <italic>EF1-ASC-GFP-</italic>HeLa cells were analyzed by confocal microscopy.

To test this hypothesis, we performed fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) analysis. After induction of foci formation by cold exposure, some of the NLRP3-L353P- and D303N-mNeonGreen-foci were bleached. The fluorescence in the bleached area was not recovered, indicating that the foci are aggregates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A and B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A and B</xref>). The wholly bleached area of NLRP3-L353P-mNeonGreen-foci was also not recovered (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2C and D</xref>).

These foci are aggregates that function as a scaffold for inflammasome activation. Consistent with this finding, inflammasome assembly and subsequent IL-1β release induced by CAPS-associated NLRP3 mutants are cryo-sensitive. The aggregation of CAPS-associated NLRP3 mutants is regulated by intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels. Furthermore, caspase-1 inhibition prevents Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx and inflammasome assembly induced by CAPS-associated NLRP3 mutants. These findings provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms of inflammasome activation in CAPS.</p><p>The formation of cryo-sensitive aggregates by CAPS-associated NLRP3 mutants is a significant finding of this study. Oligomerization or polymerization is a common feature of domains contained in inflammasome components. Both caspase recruitment domain (CARD) in ASC and caspase-1 and PYD in ASC and NLRP3 form filamentous assemblies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Masumoto et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lu et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Karasawa et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Stutz et al., 2017</xref>). In addition, full-length ASC, which has both PYD and CARD, forms a large aggregate called speck. Therefore, aggregation of CAPS-associated NLRP3 mutants seems to be mediated by their PYD-PYD interaction. However, the mechanisms by which CAPS-associated NLRP3 mutants, which typically occur in other domains including NACHT domain and LRR, promote aggregation and affect their cryo-sensitivity have remained unclear. During the preparation of this manuscript, the structure of full-length NLRP3 and complex of NLRP3 oligomer have been determined. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Andreeva et al., 2021</xref> have suggested that full-length murine NLRP3 forms oligomer called double-ring cage via interaction with LRR. Further analyses are required to clarify the role of double-ring cage formation in aggregation of CAPS-associated NLRP3 mutants.</p><p>With regard to cryo-sensitivity, recent studies have suggested that the formation of aggregates and LLPS is modulated by conditions including temperature and pH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alberti et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Riback et al., 2020</xref>). These factors shift the threshold of aggregation and LLPS under a constant protein concentration. In the present study, the frequency of foci formation by mutated NLRP3 was weakly associated with its expression levels. Furthermore, increased expression of mutated NLRP3 dose dependently promoted inflammasome assembly. The temperature and its expression levels seems to be an essential determinant of the aggregation of mutated NLRP3. Although all of the analyzed NLRP3 mutants exhibited cryo-sensitivity, the sensitivity of FCAS-associated L353P and Y563N mutants was more prominent than that of CINCA-associated D303N and Y570C mutants. Meanwhile, CINCA-associated mutants formed a large number of aggregates compared to FCAS-associated mutants at 37°C. Therefore, we assume that different cryo-sensitivity plays a causative role in the disease severity and sensitivity to cold exposure of CAPS. Further analyses are required to clarify the association between disease severity and capacity to form aggregates. Cold exposure also affected inflammasome activation induced by extrinsic stimulation. Unlike NLRP3 mutant-mediated inflammasome activation, nigericin- or nanosilica-induced NLRP3 inflammasome activation was blunted by cold exposure. Since NLRP3 inflammasome assembly requires ATPase activity, the temperature may influence extrinsic stimulation-induced inflammasome assembly via its enzymatic activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Duncan et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>Increasing evidence suggests that K<sup>+</sup> efflux is a main upstream event of NLRP3 inflammasome activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Munoz-Planillo et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">He et al., 2016a</xref>). Although the precise mechanism underlying K<sup>+</sup> efflux-mediated NLRP3 inflammasome assembly is still unclear, NEK7 has been shown to interact with NLRP3 directly and promote inflammasome assembly as a downstream of K<sup>+</sup> efflux (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">He et al., 2016b</xref>). Unexpectedly, we demonstrated that inflammasome activation induced by NLRP3-L353P is not prevented by supplementation with extracellular K<sup>+</sup> or a deficiency of NEK7, indicating that K<sup>+</sup> efflux is dispensable for inflammasome activation induced by FCAS-associated NLRP3 mutant. Instead, our data clearly showed that both NLRP3 aggregation and inflammasome assembly induced by NLRP3-L353P are dependent on the presence of Ca<sup>2+</sup>. Several studies indicate that Ca<sup>2+</sup> is another upstream signal of NLRP3 inflammasome activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lee et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Murakami et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Rossol et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Horng, 2014</xref>). Further studies are necessary to elucidate whether the previously identified mechanism of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-mediated WT-NLRP3 inflammasome activation shares the mechanism with inflammasome activation induced by CAPS-associated NLRP3 mutants. However, the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-sensitive NLRP3 aggregation appears to be distinct from canonical inflammasome assembly because the stimulation with nigericin failed to form NLRP3 aggregates.</p><p>Of note, we showed that the elevation of intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> induced by NLRP3-L353P was dependent on caspase-1 activity. Recent studies have suggested that gasdermin pore formation induced by caspase activation regulates the influx of Ca<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">de Vasconcelos et al., 2019</xref>). Broz and his colleagues have suggested that the Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx induced by GSDMD pore formation initiates membrane repair by ESCRT complex, which negatively regulates pyroptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Rühl et al., 2018</xref>). Another possible pore channel downstream of caspases is pannexin 1. Previous studies have suggested that caspase-11 and caspase-7 cleave and activate pannexin 1 during pyroptosis and apoptosis, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chekeni et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Yang et al., 2015</xref>). The Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx induced by NLRP3-L353P was probably mediated by pannexin 1 because two pannexin 1 inhibitors, probenecid and trovafloxacin, attenuated Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx and inflammasome assembly induced by NLRP3-L353P. In the present study, pharmacological inhibition of caspase-1 and pannexin 1 prevents the elevation of intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> and ASC oligomerization and speck formation. Therefore, we consider that CAPS-associated NLRP3 mutant forms cryo-sensitive inflammasome assemblies, which trigger caspase-1-mediated feed-forward loop of Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx, leading to incremental inflammasome assembly. Ca<sup>2+</sup> seems to promote this incremental inflammasome assembly rather than the initial assembly because the aggregation of NLRP3 mutants was blunted but still induced in the absence of Ca<sup>2+</sup>. In comparison with NLRP3-L353P, NLRP3-D303N was less sensitive to Ca<sup>2+</sup> because Ca<sup>2+</sup> depletion partially inhibited IL-1β release induced by NLRP3-D303N. Furthermore, the pannexin 1 inhibition failed to prevent IL-1β release induced by NLRP3-D303N. It is likely that CINCA-associated mutants exhibit constitutive active properties, and feed-forward regulation mediated by Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx promotes inflammasome assembly only in FCAS-associated NLRP3 mutants. Taken together, the inhibition of caspase-1-pannexin 1 axis could be a potential target to inhibit inflammasome assembly induced by FCAS-associated NLRP3 mutants.</p><p>In the present study, we investigated the mechanisms of cryo-sensitive inflammasome assembly in CAPS-associated NLRP3 mutants. However, this study has a few limitations. First, to analyze the function of mutated NLRP3, we used mutated NLRP3 expressing under an inducible promoter or in <italic>ASC KO</italic> cells because the expression of mutated NLRP3 induces pyroptotic cell death. To clarify the dynamics of endogenously expressed NLRP3, a study using a knock-in model would be required. Second, the aggregation of NLRP3 was analyzed by fusion protein with mNeonGreen. A biochemical analysis of aggregation using mutated NLRP3 without any tags or fluorescent proteins is also required in the future.</p><p>In conclusion, we found that CAPS-associated NLRP3 mutants form cryo-sensitive aggregates, which can function as the scaffold for NLRP3 inflammasome activation. The aggregation of mutated NLRP3 is not dependent on K<sup>+</sup> efflux but rather is regulated by intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels. We expect that our findings would be valuable for the development of novel therapies for CAPS.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Plasmids</title><p>PCR-generated cDNAs encoding human NLRP3 were subcloned into pENTR4 vector.

We showed that ca<sup>2+</sup> promotes both the initial aggregation and subsequent inflammasome assembly. Although the presence of ca<sup>2+</sup> enhanced the aggregation of mutated NLRP3, the aggregation still occurred in the absence of ca<sup>2+</sup> (Figure 5C­–E, Figure 5­—figure supplement 2A–C). The initial aggregation of mutated NLRP3 triggered ca<sup>2+</sup> influx because inflammasome assembly visualized by ASC-BFP occurred prior to ca<sup>2+</sup> influx (Figure 6G–I). Furthermore, ca<sup>2+</sup> influx was mediated by caspase-1 because pharmacological inhibition of caspase-1 prevented ca<sup>2+</sup> influx and ASC speck formation induced by mutated NLRP3 (Figure 7A–E). In the revised manuscript, the involvement of caspase-1 was further validated by genetically mutated cells (Figure 7G and H). With regard to the mechanism of ca<sup>2+</sup> influx, we found that inhibition of pannexin 1 attenuated ca<sup>2+</sup> influx and the formation of inflammasome assembly (Figure 8A–H). We have added the data and discussed these issues in the revised manuscript (page 8, paragraph 1, page 9, paragraph 1 and 2, and page 12, paragraph 2).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. Additional triggers of NLRP3 should be tested for the reasons described by Reviewer 2.</p></disp-quote><p>According to the suggestions, we investigated additional regulatory mechanisms of inflammasome activation induced by mutated NLRP3. Recent studies have suggested that dispersion of TGN plays a critical role in both K<sup>+</sup> efflux-dependent and independent inflammasome activation (Nature, 2018;564:71). Since the polybasic linker in NLRP3 is required for its TGN localization, we introduced mutation in the polybasic linker of mutated NLRP3. However, the NLRP3 polybasic linker mutants formed cryo-sensitive foci, indicating that TGN localization is dispensable for inflammasome activation induced by mutated NLRP3 (Figure 4C–E and Figure 4—figure supplement 1F). Instead, according to the reviewer’s suggestion, we assessed the effect of pannexin 1 inhibitor and found that pannexin 1 was involved in ca<sup>2+</sup> influx and subsequent inflammasome assembly induced by FCAS-associated NLRP3 mutant (Figure 8A–H and Figure 8—figure supplement 1A–D). We have added the data and mentioned these issues in the revised manuscript (page 7, paragraph 1, and page 9, paragraph 2).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. Whether the cryo-sensitive aggregation a common characteristic of other autoinflammation-associated NLRP3 mutants should be examined.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate this important comment. In addition to L353P and D303N mutants, we developed FCAS-associated Y563N and CINCA-associated Y570C mutants. Whereas previously developed L353P and D303N mutants are located in NBD, these two mutations are located in NLRC4HD domain of NLRP3 (Figure 1—figure supplement 1A). Expectedly, both two mutants form cryo-sensitive aggregates (Figure 1I and Figure 1—figure supplement 1B–E). We have added the data and mentioned these issues in the revised manuscript (page 4, paragraph 3, and page 5, paragraph 1).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4.

We further analyzed FCAS-associated L353P and Y563N mutants and CINCA-associated D303N and Y570C mutants. Although all of the analyzed mutated NLRP3 exhibited cryo-sensitivity, the sensitivity of FCAS mutants was more prominent than that of CINCA mutants (Figure 1F and I, Figure 1—figure supplement 1D–G). Moreover, the foci number of CINCA-associated mutants was higher than that of FCAS-associated mutants at 37ºC. Thus, it is likely that CINCA-associated NLRP3 mutants exhibit cryo-sensitivity, but their ability to form aggregates is potent enough to induce inflammasome activation at 37ºC. We have added the data and discussed these issues in the revised manuscript (page 5, paragraph 1, and page 11, paragraph 1).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>It is not clear if Ca is required for both the constitutive aggregation of NLRP3 CAPS mutants and the subsequent inflammasome assembly.

Ca<sup>2+</sup> promotes both the initial aggregation and subsequent inflammasome assembly. However, aggregation of mutated NLRP3 occurred in the absence of ca<sup>2+</sup>. NLRP3 L353P mutant and D303N mutant formed cold-exposure-induced foci in ca<sup>2+</sup>-depleted condition (Figure 5­—figure supplement 2A–C). As the reviewer suggested, the initial aggregation of mutated NLRP3 triggered ca<sup>2+</sup> influx because inflammasome assembly visualized by ASC-BFP occurred prior to ca<sup>2+</sup> influx (Figure 6G–I).

We agree that ca<sup>2+</sup> influx functions as an amplifier of inflammasome assembly induced by mutated NLRP3. As the reviewer suggested, cold exposure promoted aggregation of mutated NLRP3 even in the absence of ca<sup>2+</sup> (Figure 5­—figure supplement 2A–C). However, the supplementation of ca<sup>2+</sup> promoted aggregation of mutated NLRP3 (Figure 5E). Previous studies have suggested that cationic ions regulate protein aggregates such as α-synuclein (Sci Rep. 2018;8:1895, doi: 10.1038/s41598-018-20320-5.). Therefore, we speculate that the influx of ca<sup>2+</sup> is a direct regulator of mutated NLRP3 aggregation. We have added the data and mentioned these issues in the revised manuscript (page 8, paragraph 1).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Is this cryo-sensitive aggregation a common characteristic of other autoinflammation-associated NLRP3 mutants?</p></disp-quote><p>(Please also see the response to the Editor #3):</p><p>We appreciate this invaluable comment. According to the comment, we developed the cells expressing other CAPS-associated NLRP3 mutants: FCAS-associated Y563N and CINCA-associated Y570C. Expectedly, both two mutants form cryo-sensitive aggregate (Figure 1I, Figure1—figure supplement 1B–G). Moreover, sensitivity to cold exposure is more prominent in FCAS-associated Y563N than CINCA-associated Y570C. We have added the data and mentioned these issues in the revised manuscript (page 5, paragraph 1).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Biochemical demonstration of aggregation of NLRP3 CAPS mutants would strengthen the immunofluorescence data in Figure 1 (L353P and D303N).</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this valuable suggestion. To assess the aggregation of mutated NLRP3 without being affected by fluorescent tag, we developed the <italic>ASC-KO /TRE-NLRP3-L353P</italic>- and <italic>ASC-KO /TRE-NLRP3-D303N</italic>-THP-1 cells and showed that the mutated NLRP3 were detected in the detergent-insoluble fraction in the absence of ASC. This biochemical experiment supports that mutated NLRP3 forms aggregates (Figure 3—figure supplement 1C). We have added the data and mentioned these issues in the revised manuscript (page 6, paragraph 1).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 3 and its supplement should include direct comparisons of WT NLRP3 and NLRP3 mutants.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your important comment. We agree that direct comparisons between mutants are helpful to validate the potency of each mutant. In our experiment, however, transduction of lentiviral vector encoding mutated NLRP3 induced massive cell death in the presence of ASC probably due to carrying over of mutated NLRP3 protein produced in 293T cells during lentiviral production. Therefore, we established each cell line from survived cells with limiting dilution. IL-1β release and ASC speck formation were evaluated in each clone. Instead, we directly compared the effect of WT and L353P on ASC recruitment to the aggregates (Figure 3A–C). We would like to validate the potency to produce IL-1β in each mutant in future work.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>NEK7 deletion should be verified by western blotting.</p></disp-quote><p>According to this suggestion, we confirmed the deficiency of NEK7 by western blotting (Figure 4—figure supplement 1C).

Presumably this is important as the aggregate size (and number) are likely to be functions of temperature?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this important comment. We quantified the area and number of foci formed by NLRP3 mutants. Although the total area of foci was increased by cold exposure, the mean area of foci was not increased by cold exposure (Figure 1—figure supplement 1F and G). In contrast, the number of foci was increased by cold exposure (Figure 1H and I). These results suggest that the temperature affects the number of foci rather than their size. We have added the data and mentioned these issues in the revised manuscript (page 5, paragraph 1).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Again as suggested above, consider additional triggers for NLRP3 activation in case temperature affects nigericin and silica in independent ways. Perhaps a more direct trigger, things that disturb the TGN, what about K<sup>+</sup> efflux independent activation with transfected imiquimod?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this helpful comment. A previous report has suggested that imiquimod induces TGN-dispersion and inflammasome activation in a K<sup>+</sup> efflux-independent manner. In our experiment with THP-1 cells, however, the treatment with imiquimod failed to induce IL-1β release (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref>). Therefore, we were not able to evaluate the effect of cold exposure on imiquimod-induced response. Instead, we investigated the involvement of TGN because the dispersion of TGN plays a critical role in both K<sup>+</sup>-efflux-dependent and independent inflammasome activation. Although we introduced mutation into polybasic linker, which interacts with phosphorylated phosphatidylinositide on TGN membrane, the NLRP3 polybasic linker mutant forms cryo-sensitive aggregation (Figure 4C–E). On the other hand, we found that pannexin 1 is involved in ca<sup>2+</sup> influx and subsequent inflammasome assembly induced by NLRP3 L353P mutant (Figure 8A–H).

As described in the response to the comment #2, we developed the mutants lacking three lysine residues (K129, K131, and K132) in the polybasic linker of NLRP3 by introducing alanine. Notably, the polybasic region mutant still formed foci (Figure 4C). Although foci formation by D303N mutant was decreased by polybasic linker mutation, cold exposure-enhanced foci formation was detected even in the polybasic linker mutant (Figure 4D and E).

In the previous manuscript, we analyzed FCAS-associated L353P mutant and CINCA-associated D303N mutant. In some experiments, we mainly analyzed L353P mutant to clarify the mechanisms of its cryo-sensitivity. In the revised manuscript, we performed additional experiments using D303N mutant and confirmed that D303N mutant-mediated inflammasome assembly is independent of NEK7 and dispensable for TGN (Figure 4—figure supplement 1E, and Figure 4D). Meanwhile, although the expression of D303N mutant also caused ca<sup>2+</sup> influx (Figure 6—figure supplement 1A and B), the inhibition of pannexin 1 failed to inhibit IL-1β release induced by D303N mutant (Figure 8—figure supplement 1G). D303N mutant was less sensitive to ca<sup>2+</sup> because ca<sup>2+</sup>-depletion partially inhibited IL-1β release induced by D303N (Figure 5—figure supplement 1F and Figure 5—figure supplement 2B). Moreover, a remarkable difference between FCAS and CINCA-associated mutants was observed in the formation of aggregates at 37ºC. Whereas foci formation in FCAS-mutants was markedly induced at 32ºC, a large number of foci were detected even at 37ºC in CINCA-associated mutants (Figure 1I). These results suggest that D303N mutant displays constitutive active properties. We have added the data and discussed these issues in the revised manuscript (page 11, paragraph 1, and page 12, paragraph 2).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Specific comments</p><p>Figure 1A – I don't understand the difference between foci and speck, especially since they are both shown to be aggregates later in figure 2.

Previous studies have suggested that ASC forms a large speck aggregate (J Biol Chem. 1999;274, 33835. doi: 10.1074/jbc.274.48.33835.). ASC generally forms a single speck per cell, and the size of the speck is 1–2 µm in a diameter (Cell death Differ. 2007. 2007;14:1590, doi: 10.1038/sj.cdd.4402194.). In contrast, NLRP3 mutants form small multiple foci in the cells. To validate the number of mutated NLRP3 foci per cell, we analyzed the data of high content analysis and confirmed that mutated NLRP3 forms one to multiple foci in the cells (Figure 1—figure supplement 1D).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 1D-E.

We further analyzed FCAS-associated Y563N mutant and CINCA-associated Y570C mutant in the revised manuscript. Although the analyzed mutated NLRP3 exhibited cryo-sensitivity, the sensitivity of FCAS mutants was more prominent than that of CINCA (Figure 1E–I and Figure 1—figure supplement 1E and F). Moreover, foci number of CINCA-associated mutants was higher than that of FCAS-associated mutants at 37ºC. Thus, we postulate that CINCA-associated NLRP3 mutants exhibit cryo-sensitivity, but their ability to form aggregates is potent enough to induce inflammasome activation at 37ºC. We have added the data and discussed these issues in the revised manuscript (page 11, paragraph 1).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>One of the most exciting findings of this figure is that the data is consistent with the severity of the disease associated with the specific mutation. These assays could provide quantitative methods to quantify mutation pathogenicity.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your positive comment. Because we evaluated only four mutants in this study, it is difficult to determine the severity of CAPS associated with specific mutations by the number of mutated NLRP3 foci. Therefore, we would like to investigate the association between foci number and disease severity in future work.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Other than the LLPS inhibitor, I don't understand what is different about supplemental Figure 2.</p></disp-quote><p>I’m sorry for our insufficient explanation. In figure-supplement 2, we analyzed partially bleached D303N aggregates and wholly bleached L353P aggregates, separately (Figure 2—figure supplement 2A and C), whereas partially bleached L353P aggregate were analyzed in figure 2A and B. In addition, as a positive control of FRAP, we have added the data on FRAP analysis of unfused mNeonGreen protein (Figure 2—figure supplement 2E and F). We have added the data and mentioned these issues in the revised manuscript (page 5, paragraph 2).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 3 and supplemental Figure 3</p><p>The use of the TET ON system is novel, and clearly shows increased NLRP3 expression and dimerization as well as ASC solublilty changes when induced and with temperature but I don't understand why it proves that the tag isn't responsible for the aggregate formation.</p></disp-quote><p>We do apologize for our insufficient explanation. We developed and used the cells expressing full length NLRP3 without any tags or fluorescent proteins under the TRE promoter in these experiments. The induction of mutated NLRP3 promoted ASC oligomerization and ASC speck formation (Figure 3D, E, and G). Furthermore, to investigate the aggregation of mutated NLRP3 without being affected by fluorescent tag, we developed the <italic>ASC-KO /TRE-NLRP3-L353P</italic>- and <italic>ASC-KO /TRE-NLRP3-D303N</italic>-THP-1 cells. The mutated NLRP3 proteins were detected in the detergent-insoluble fraction in the absence of ASC, supporting that mutated NLRP3 forms aggregates (Figure 3—figure supplement 1D). We have added the data and mentioned these issues in the revised manuscript (page 6, paragraph 1).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>I found the reduction of cold induced IL-1B release with extrinsic stimulation of WT cells to be interesting. This should be emphasized as more evidence of mutation specific effects.</p></disp-quote><p>According to the suggestion, we have emphasized and discussed this issue in the revised manuscript (page 11, paragraph 1).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>This figure might actually help the authors in that the cold induction of IL-1B expression and release in the CINCA transfected cells is much more modest than in the FCAS transfected cells. Its possible that CINCA patient do have cold induction but don't notice it since their baseline inflammation is so high and there is so little change with cold.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your comment. As the reviewer mentioned, we postulate that CINCA-associated NLRP3 mutants exhibit cryo-sensitivity, but this feature is masked by its potent ability to form aggregates. Indeed, other CINCA-associated D303N and Y570C mutants exhibited a potent ability to form aggregates even at 37ºC (Figure 1I). We have discussed this issue in the revised manuscript (page 11, paragraph 1).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Do foci number correlate well with IL-1B release?</p></disp-quote><p>We are sorry for our confusing data. Because the number of foci was analyzed in the cells lacking ASC, these cells are defective in mutated NLRP3-mediated IL-1β release. We consider that further refined experimental designs are needed to evaluate the capability of IL-1β release in each NLRP3 mutant.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It might be useful to see if the CINCA mutation has some K and NEK7 dependence.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your suggestion. We have moved the NEK7 data to main figure (Figure 4A and B). In addition, we have investigated the NEK7-dependency in the CINCA mutant and found that D303N mutant also induced IL-1β release in the absence of NEK7 (Figure 4—figure supplement 1D and E). We have added these data and mentioned these results in the revised manuscript (page 7, paragraph 1).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Are results the same for CINCA mutations.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your helpful comment. According to the suggestion, we investigated ca<sup>2+</sup> influx induced by CAPS-associated D303N mutant. Similar to the FCAS mutant, induction of the D303N mutant induced ca<sup>2+</sup> influx (Figure 6—figure supplement 1A and B).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6D Interesting that casp 1 inhibition affects ASC solubility.</p></disp-quote><p>Sorry for the lack of explanation. We investigated the effect of pharmacological inhibition of caspase-1 on ca<sup>2+</sup> influx induced by NLRP3-L353P mutant using fluo-8. The number of fluo-8-positive cells was decreased under the caspase-1 inhibition. In the revised manuscript, we further validated the involvement of caspase-1 using <italic>CASP1</italic>-deficient cells (Figure 7G).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>MCC950 data could be moved from Supplemental to main.</p></disp-quote><p>According to the suggestion, we have moved the data on MCC950 to main figure. (Figure 8I and J).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Are results the same for CINCA mutations.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your helpful comment. According to the suggestion, we have added data on CINCA-associated D303N mutant (Figure 7—figure supplement 1C). The pharmacological inhibition of caspase-1 prevented IL-1β release induced by D303N mutant. However, while pannexin 1 inhibition prevented IL-1β release induced by L353P mutant, the pannexin 1 inhibition failed to prevent IL-1β release induced by D303N mutant (Figure 8A–H and Figure 8—figure supplement 1G). These results suggest that CINCA-associated mutant exhibits constitutive active properties. Thus, feed-forward regulation mediated by ca<sup>2+</sup> influx promotes inflammasome assembly only in FCAS-associated NLRP3 mutant. We have discussed this issue in the revised manuscript (page 12, paragraph 2).</p></body></sub-article></article>
