During meiosis, the tumor suppressor BRCA1/BRC-1 and structural maintenance of chromosomes 5/6 (SMC-5/6) complex genetically interact to promote high fidelity DNA double strand break (DSB) repair, but the specific DSB repair outcomes these proteins regulate remain unknown. Using genetic and cytological methods to monitor resolution of DSBs with different repair partners in <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>, we demonstrate that both BRC-1 and SMC-5 repress intersister crossover recombination events. Sequencing analysis of conversion tracts from homolog-independent DSB repair events further indicates that BRC-1 regulates intersister/intrachromatid noncrossover conversion tract length. Moreover, we find that BRC-1 specifically inhibits error prone repair of DSBs induced at mid-pachytene. Finally, we reveal functional interactions of BRC-1 and SMC-5/6 in regulating repair pathway engagement: BRC-1 is required for localization of recombinase proteins to DSBs in <italic>smc-5</italic> mutants and enhances DSB repair defects in <italic>smc-5</italic> mutants by repressing theta-mediated end joining (TMEJ). These results are consistent with a model in which some functions of BRC-1 act upstream of SMC-5/6 to promote recombination and inhibit error-prone DSB repair, while SMC-5/6 acts downstream of BRC-1 to regulate the formation or resolution of recombination intermediates. Taken together, our study illuminates the coordinated interplay of BRC-1 and SMC-5/6 to regulate DSB repair outcomes in the germline.</p></abstract><kwd-group

sexually reproducing organisms generate haploid gametes. In a diploid organism, each meiotic cell begins prophase I with four copies of the genome – two homologous chromosomes (homologs) and identical copies of each homolog called sister chromatids. As mutations incurred in the gamete genome will be passed on to the resultant progeny, it is crucial that genome integrity be maintained during meiosis. Despite this risk, a highly conserved feature of the meiotic program is induction of DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) by the topoisomerase-like protein Spo11 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Keeney et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bergerat et al., 1997</xref>). A limited subset of DSBs must engage the homologous chromosome as a recombination partner and be repaired as a crossover event to forge a physical connection between homologs that facilitates accurate chromosome segregation at the meiosis I division. DSBs are incurred in excess of the number of eventual crossovers and other pathways must therefore be utilized to repair residual DSBs. How meiotic cells regulate repair pathway engagement to both accurately and efficiently resolve DSBs is a critical question in the field of genome integrity.</p><p>In many organisms, the majority of meiotic DSBs are repaired through interhomolog noncrossover recombination mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Hunter, 2015</xref>). Multiple models are proposed for how meiotic noncrossover repair occurs. Evidence in <italic>Drosophila</italic> suggests that both interhomolog noncrossovers and crossovers may be generated by differential processing of similar joint molecule intermediates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Crown et al., 2014</xref>). Work in budding yeast, mammals, and <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> indicates that the majority of interhomolog noncrossovers are generated via synthesis-dependent strand annealing (SDSA) with the homolog (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Hunter, 2015</xref>). In SDSA, one or both resected end(s) of the DSB invades a repair template, new sequence is synthesized, the strand dissociates from its repair template, and finally utilizes the synthesized sequence to anneal to the other resected end of the DSB.</p><p>Meiotic DSBs may also be repaired by recombination with the sister chromatid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Goldfarb and Lichten, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Toraason et al., 2021c</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Almanzar et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Schwacha and Kleckner, 1997</xref>). In budding yeast, DSB repair by intersister recombination is disfavored so as to promote recombination with the homologous chromosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Goldfarb and Lichten, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Schwacha and Kleckner, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Humphryes and Hochwagen, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kim et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Schwacha and Kleckner, 1994</xref>). In metazoan meiosis, however, the engagement of intersister repair has proven challenging to detect and quantify. While recombination between polymorphic homologs may be readily studied via sequence conversions in final repair products, the identical sequences of sister chromatids preclude the detection of intersister recombination by sequencing-based approaches. Recently, two methods have been developed in the nematode <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> to enable direct detection of homolog-independent meiotic recombination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Toraason et al., 2021c</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Almanzar et al., 2021</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Toraason et al., 2021c</xref> constructed an intersister/intrachromatid repair (ICR) assay that exploits nonallelic recombination at a known locus in the genome to identify homolog-independent repair events in resultant progeny (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1-figure supplement 1 A</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Almanzar et al., 2021</xref> designed an EdU labeling assay to cytologically identify sister chromatid exchanges (SCEs) in compacted chromosomes at diakinesis. Together, these studies demonstrated that: (1) homolog-independent meiotic recombination occurs in <italic>C. elegans</italic>; (2) the sister chromatid and/or same DNA molecule is the exclusive recombination repair template in late prophase I; and, (3) intersister crossovers are rare and represent a minority of homolog-independent recombination products (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Toraason et al., 2021c</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Almanzar et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>While meiotic cells primarily utilize homologous recombination to resolve DSBs, error prone repair pathways are also available in meiosis to repair DSBs at the risk of introducing de novo mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gartner and Engebrecht, 2022</xref>). These error prone mechanisms are repressed in wild type contexts to promote recombination repair but are activated in mutants that disrupt recombination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Macaisne et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Yin and Smolikove, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kamp et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Lemmens et al., 2013</xref>). Non-homologous end joining (NHEJ), which facilitates the ligation of blunt DNA ends by the DNA ligase IV homolog LIG-4, is active in the <italic>C. elegans</italic> germline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Macaisne et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Yin and Smolikove, 2013</xref>). Recent studies have revealed that microhomology-mediated end-joining facilitated by the DNA polymerase θ homolog POLQ-1 (theta-mediated end-joining, TMEJ) is the primary pathway by which small mutations are incurred in <italic>C. elegans</italic> germ cells and somatic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kamp et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">van Schendel et al., 2015</xref>). Since neither NHEJ nor TMEJ are required for successful meiosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kamp et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Lemmens et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Volkova et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Colaiácovo et al., 2003</xref>), recombination is likely sufficient for meiotic DSB repair and gamete viability under normal conditions.</p><p>The structural maintenance of chromosomes 5/6 complex and tumor suppressor BRCA1 (SMC-5/6 and BRC-1 respectively in <italic>C. elegans</italic>) are highly conserved and regulate meiotic DSB repair in <italic>C. elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kamp et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bickel et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hong et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Li et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Janisiw et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Odiba et al., 2024</xref>). The SMC-5/6 complex is vital for preservation of meiotic genome integrity, as <italic>C. elegans</italic> mutants for <italic>smc-5</italic> exhibit a transgenerational sterility phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bickel et al., 2010</xref>). Although null mutations of <italic>smc-5, smc-6,</italic> and <italic>brc-1</italic> revealed that they are not required for development nor reproduction in <italic>C. elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bickel et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Li et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Janisiw et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adamo et al., 2008</xref>)<italic>,</italic> both SMC-5/6 and BRC-1 are required for efficient DSB repair, as <italic>smc-5</italic> and <italic>brc-1</italic> null mutants both display meiotic chromosome fragmentation at diakinesis indicative of unrepaired DSBs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bickel et al., 2010</xref>). In <italic>C. elegans,</italic> BRC-1 has also been shown to repress error prone DSB repair via NHEJ and TMEJ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kamp et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Li et al., 2020</xref>), and acts in parallel with the tumor suppressor 53BP1/HSR-9 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hariri et al., 2023</xref>). Further, SMC-5/6 and BRC-1 may promote genome integrity in part by facilitating efficient recombination, as <italic>smc-5</italic> and <italic>brc-1</italic> mutants exhibit persistent DSBs marked by the recombinase RAD-51 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kamp et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bickel et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adamo et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Boulton et al., 2004</xref>), suggesting that early recombination steps are disrupted in these mutants. BRC-1 further prevents recombination between heterologous templates to promote accurate recombination repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">León-Ortiz et al., 2018</xref>). Despite these apparent DNA repair defects, interhomolog crossover formation is largely unaffected by <italic>smc-5</italic> and <italic>brc-1</italic> mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bickel et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Li et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Janisiw et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adamo et al., 2008</xref>). Taken together, these data have contributed to the model that that SMC-5/6 and BRC-1 are required for intersister repair in <italic>C. elegans</italic>.</p><p>SMC-5/6 and BRC-1 genetically interact to regulate germline DSB repair. The incidence of unrepaired DSBs observed in both <italic>smc-5</italic> and <italic>brc-1</italic> single mutants are not additive in the double <italic>smc-5;brc-1</italic> mutant context, which suggests that SMC-5/6 and BRC-1 may share some DSB repair functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bickel et al., 2010</xref>). Other experiments, however, indicate opposing functions for SMC-5/6 and BRC-1, as both the mitotic DNA replication defects in <italic>smc-5</italic> mutants and the synthetic lethality of <italic>smc-5;him-6</italic> (BLM helicase) double mutants are suppressed by <italic>brc-1</italic> mutation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hong et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Wolters et al., 2014</xref>). Crucially, the specific steps of recombination regulated by SMC-5/6 and BRC-1 that intersect to influence DNA repair outcomes remain unknown.</p><p>To determine the DSB repair functions of SMC-5 and BRC-1 that regulate DNA repair outcomes during <italic>C. elegans</italic> meiosis, we employed a multipronged approach utilizing genetic assays, cytology, sequence analysis of recombinant loci, and functional DSB repair assays in <italic>smc-5</italic> and <italic>brc-1</italic> mutants. We find that SMC-5 and BRC-1 function to repress meiotic intersister crossover recombination, and that BRC-1 specifically regulates homolog-independent noncrossover intermediate processing. Through these experiments, we also find that BRC-1 prevents mutagenic DSB repair at the mid-pachytene stage of meiotic prophase I. By assessing germ cell capacity to resolve exogenous DSBs, we demonstrate that meiotic nuclei become more dependent on BRC-1 for DSB repair in late stages of meiotic prophase I.

Since the <italic>C. elegans</italic> germline is organized in a spatial-temporal gradient in which nuclei move progressively through the stages of meiotic prophase I along the distal-proximal axis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Rosu et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Jaramillo-Lambert et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cahoon and Libuda, 2021</xref>), oocytes at all stages of meiotic prophase I can be affected simultaneously by a specific treatment, such as heat shock or irradiation. As the rate of meiotic progression in the <italic>C. elegans</italic> germline is known (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Rosu et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Jaramillo-Lambert et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cahoon and Libuda, 2021</xref>), we can score resultant progeny at specific timepoints post heat shock to distinguish oocytes that incurred a Mos1-excision induced DSB at the stages of prophase I when the homologous chromosome is available as a repair partner (the ‘interhomolog window’, leptotene-mid pachytene, 22–58 hr post heat shock) from the stages when the homolog is not readily engaged for DSB repair (the ‘non-interhomolog window’, late pachytene-diplotene, 10–22 hr post heat shock) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Rosu et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>We performed the ICR assay in a <italic>brc-1(xoe4</italic>) mutant, which removes the entire <italic>brc-1</italic> coding sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Li et al., 2018</xref>). If BRC-1 is required for efficient intersister repair, then we expected the overall frequency of ICR assay GFP+ recombinant progeny to be reduced. Contrary to this hypothesis, we found that GFP+ progeny were elevated at all interhomolog window timepoints and were not reduced within the non-interhomolog window (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref>). Since the ICR assay restricts DSB recombination repair to homolog-independent repair and should therefore represent the ‘ceiling’ for recombination frequencies, this increase in GFP+ recombinant progeny was unexpected. Given that BRC-1 represses heterologous recombination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">León-Ortiz et al., 2018</xref>) and that polymorphisms, such as those contained in the GFP repair template in the ICR assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Toraason et al., 2021c</xref>), reduce the likelihood of recombination between templates, we hypothesized that this increase in GFP+ recombinants may represent relaxed bias for the allelic repair template in the ICR assay. However, <italic>msh-2</italic> mutants, which are defective in heteroduplex recognition and rejection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chakraborty and Alani, 2016</xref>), did not display increased ICR assay recombinants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2C</xref>), suggesting that altered repair template bias does not underpin this effect. Increased recombinants could also be derived from elevated rates of Mos1 excision; however, we did not observe an overall increase in recombinant progeny in a parallel Mos1-based assay in <italic>brc-1</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplements 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">3A</xref>), which suggests that Mos1 does not excise more frequently in <italic>brc-1</italic> mutants. As we cannot be certain of the source of increased recombinants in the <italic>brc-1</italic> ICR assay, we refrain from making any inference that requires comparing the absolute levels of homolog-independent recombination events in our <italic>brc-1</italic> ICR assay data. Regardless of the absolute number of ICR assay GFP+ recombinant progeny, we identified both crossover and noncrossover recombinants in the interhomolog window (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref>), demonstrating that BRC-1 alone is not essential for intersister/intrachromatid crossover or noncrossover repair. Notably, the overall proportion of crossover progeny among recombinants identified was increased at all timepoints scored for the <italic>brc-1(xoe4</italic>) null mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), which is similar to the increase in the proportion of ICR assay crossover events we also found in the classical <italic>brc-1(tm1145);brd-1(dw1</italic>) mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B</xref>).

Similar to <italic>brc-1</italic> mutants, we found that the frequency of GFP+ progeny in the ICR assay was elevated at all timepoints scored in <italic>smc-5(ok2421</italic>) null mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>) and was not reduced relative to wild type in null <italic>smc-6(ok3294</italic>) mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref>). The incidence of recombinants in <italic>smc-5</italic> null mutants was not dramatically elevated overall in the IH assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>), suggesting that Mos1 excision is not increased in <italic>smc-5</italic> null mutants. Since we cannot be certain of the cause of this increase in recombinants in the <italic>smc-5</italic> ICR assay, we refrain from making conclusions regarding the absolute frequency of intersister repair events that occur within this mutant context. Regardless of the absolute number of ICR assay GFP+ recombinant progeny, we did identify both crossover and noncrossover recombinants at all timepoints scored in our <italic>smc-5</italic> ICR assays, demonstrating that SMC-5/6 alone is not required for noncrossover nor crossover homolog-independent repair (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>).</p><p>To determine if SMC-5 regulates intersister/intrachromatid recombination outcomes, we examined occurrence of <italic>smc-5</italic> ICR assay crossover recombinants as a proportion of all recombinants identified. While the proportion of crossovers was not significantly different than wild-type within the individual 12 hr timepoints we scored (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>), the frequency of crossover recombinants in <italic>smc-5</italic> mutants was significantly elevated within the interhomolog window overall (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, Fisher’s Exact Test p=0.037). Thus, our data suggests that a function of SMC-5 is to prevent homolog-independent crossovers arising from DSBs induced in early stages of meiotic prophase I. To cytologically affirm that intersister crossovers occur in <italic>smc-5</italic> mutants, we assessed the frequency of SCEs in <italic>smc-5(ok2421</italic>) mutants by examining EdU labeled chromatids at diakinesis. Since mutants of <italic>smc-5</italic> are known to have defects in chromosome compaction and produce misshapen bivalents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bickel et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hong et al., 2016</xref>), the majority of chromatid pairs in the <italic>smc-5</italic> null mutant were uninterpretable in the EdU labeling assay (See Methods). Despite these challenges, we identified SCEs in 35.7% of scored chromatid pairs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C–D</xref>, 5/14 chromatid pairs scored, 95% Binomial CI 16.3–61.2%, Fisher’s Exact Test p=0.004) as compared to only 4.1% of wild type chromatid pairs (2/49 chromatid pairs scored, 95% Binomial CI 1.1–13.7%) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Almanzar et al., 2021</xref>). While we do not consider these results as an absolute metric for the rate of SCEs in <italic>smc-5</italic> mutants due to limited sample size from chromosome morphology issues, our ICR assay and EdU labeling experiments nevertheless demonstrate that intersister repair still occurs in the absence of the fully assembled SMC-5/6 complex and indicate a role for SMC-5 in regulating intersister crossing over during <italic>C. elegans</italic> meiosis.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>SMC-5 represses intersister crossovers.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Bar plot displaying the percent of crossover recombinant progeny identified in wild type and <italic>smc-5</italic> ICR assays out of all recombinant progeny scored within individual 12 hr timepoint periods.

When we performed the ICR assay in <italic>smc-5::AID*::3xFLAG;brc-1</italic> mutants following SMC-5 germline depletion, we identified GFP+ noncrossover and crossover ICR assay recombinant progeny in <italic>smc-5::AID*;brc-1</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>), reinforcing that neither of these repair outcomes require SMC-5 or BRC-1. Further, the proportion of ICR assay crossover recombinants in <italic>smc-5::AID*;brc-1</italic> mutants was elevated relative to wild type at both the 22–34 hr and 46–58 hr timepoints within the interhomolog window but was indistinguishable from <italic>brc-1</italic> single mutants at all timepoints assayed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>).

Under wild type conditions, BRC-1 promotes efficient resection of the damaged chromatid (blue) and facilitates strand invasion and extension with the sister chromatid (purple). BRC-1 also inhibits TMEJ either through direct antagonism of this pathway or indirectly by promoting efficient recombination. Following strand extension, the majority of D-loop intermediates are dissolved and repaired through SDSA, which is efficient due to BRC-1 promoted resection of the second end of the DSB. A minority of D-loops will proceed to form joint molecules, which may potentially be preferentially resolved as noncrossovers via the action of SMC-5/6 or as crossovers in an SMC-5/6 independent manner. In addition, SMC-5/6 inhibits the formation of toxic joint molecule intermediates, such as multi-chromatid joint molecules. In a <italic>brc-1</italic> mutant, DSBs are not resected to wild type levels and strand invasion is inefficient. Reduced resection limits the efficiency of second end capture in SDSA, reducing noncrossovers through this pathway. Further, limited strand extension reduces the extent of gene conversion in noncrossovers generated by successful SDSA or joint molecule dissolution. Failure in SDSA leads to increased DSB reinvasion of repair templates, contributing to the tandem duplications observed in mutants for BRCA1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chandramouly et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kamp et al., 2020</xref>). In addition, either due to absence of direct inhibition by BRC-1 or inefficiencies in recombination, end joining (particularly TMEJ) becomes activated to resolve DSBs. However, reduced resection does not inhibit joint molecule formation, leading to more of these intermediates which are preferentially resolved as crossovers. Finally, in an <italic>smc-5</italic> mutant, early steps in DSB repair proceed normally. However, absence of SMC-5/6 results in unconstrained joint molecule formation, including toxic intermediates. Failure in SMC-5/6 action to promote noncrossover repair further increases the proportion of joint molecules which are resolved as crossovers.</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-80687-fig4-figsupp6-v2.tif"/></fig></fig-group></sec><sec id="s2-9"><title>BRC-1 promotes recombinase loading to DSBs in <italic>smc-5</italic> mutants</title><p>To determine the interactions of SMC-5 and BRC-1 in regulating early steps of meiotic DSB repair, we examined the localization of the recombinase RAD-51, which marks DSBs undergoing early steps of recombination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Colaiácovo et al., 2003</xref>), in <italic>smc-5</italic>, <italic>brc-1</italic>, and <italic>smc-5;brc-1</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>).

BRC-1 is known to repress both TMEJ and NHEJ in multiple organisms, including <italic>C. elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kamp et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Li et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Huen et al., 2010</xref>), and ablation of NHEJ or TMEJ is sufficient to partially rescue RAD-51 foci loading to DSBs in <italic>brc-1</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Trivedi et al., 2022</xref>). To test whether TMEJ and/or NHEJ contribute to the ionizing radiation resilience observed in <italic>smc-5;brc-1</italic> double mutants, we created <italic>smc-5;brc-1;polq-1</italic> and <italic>smc-5;brc-1;lig-4</italic> triple mutants that are defective in TMEJ and NHEJ respectively. <italic>lig-4</italic> mutation did not fully suppress the synthetic radiation resilience of <italic>smc-5;brc-1</italic> mutants, suggesting that NHEJ is not a primary mechanism of DNA repair in meiotic nuclei when both SMC-5/6 and BRC-1 are lost. However, we observed a striking effect in <italic>smc-5;brc-1;polq-1</italic> mutants; even at the moderate dose of 2500 Rads, loss of POLQ-1 caused dramatic sensitization of <italic>smc-5;brc-1</italic> mutants to ionizing radiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3A</xref>).

To test the contributions of sperm effects to our radiation sensitivity analysis, we determined the viability of oocytes from irradiated hermaphrodites mated to unirradiated wild type males (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3B</xref>). DSBs induced in sperm are primarily repaired by TMEJ in the fertilized zygote and have minimal impact on F1 viability when POLQ-1 is present (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Wang et al., 2023</xref>), so we focused our analysis on <italic>polq-1</italic>, <italic>smc-5;brc-1,</italic> and <italic>smc-5;brc-1;polq-1</italic> null mutants.

A similar restoration of viability was observed in the interhomolog window of <italic>smc-5;brc-1;polq-1</italic> mutants, indicating that the effect of <italic>polq-1</italic> on oocytes irradiated in early stages of prophase I was primarily due to sperm-specific effects. However, the increased radiation sensitivity of <italic>smc-5;brc-1;polq-1</italic> within the non-interhomolog window was not rescued by mating (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3A–B</xref>).

As <italic>brc-1</italic> mutation confers synthetic resilience to radiation in <italic>smc-5</italic> mutants, we provide evidence that some functions of BRC-1 contribute to the meiotic DSB repair defects associated with loss of <italic>smc-5</italic>. Further, we find that TMEJ is vital to radiation resilience in late meiotic prophase I in <italic>smc-5;brc-1</italic> mutants, suggesting that this pathway compensates for the DNA repair deficiencies incurred when SMC-5/6 and BRC-1 are both lost (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3D</xref>).

Our study utilizes genetic and cytological technologies not available at the time of this initial work to specifically examine homolog-independent repair in the absence of <italic>brc-1</italic> and <italic>smc-5</italic>. While we find that neither BRC-1 nor SMC-5/6 are necessary for intersister repair in <italic>C. elegans</italic> meiosis per se, we instead identified functions for both BRC-1 and SMC-5 in regulating intersister repair outcomes, thereby supporting the original conclusions of Adamo et al. and Bickel et al. that BRC-1 and SMC-5/6 function in homolog-independent repair.

BRC-1 physically interacts with the synaptonemal complex, localizes to recombination nodules, promotes efficient interhomolog crossover formation, and regulates the meiotic crossover landscape under conditions of meiotic dysfunction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Li et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Janisiw et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Li et al., 2020</xref>).

What functions of BRC-1 may underpin these phenotypes? BRCA1 is thought to regulate many early steps in recombination including DSB resection, strand invasion, and D-loop formation in other model systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kamp et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Zhao et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chen et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Cruz-García et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chandramouly et al., 2013</xref>). We propose that many of these functions are conserved in <italic>C. elegans</italic> BRC-1.</p><p>While research in budding yeast, mammalian systems, and <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> suggests that SDSA is the primary pathway for the formation of noncrossovers in meiosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Hunter, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ahuja et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Marsolier-Kergoat et al., 2018</xref>) and that processing of joint molecular intermediates can generate noncrossovers during <italic>Drosophila</italic> meiosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Crown et al., 2014</xref>), the mechanisms by which <italic>C. elegans</italic> noncrossover recombination occurs is unknown. Our finding that <italic>brc-1</italic> mutation affects the extent of ICR assay noncrossover gene conversion, but not crossover gene conversion, suggests that homolog-independent noncrossovers arise from a distinct intermediate or undergo differential processing from crossovers in <italic>C. elegans</italic>. This result is consistent with a model in which either SDSA or joint molecule dissolution is a primary mechanism of intersister noncrossover recombination in the <italic>C. elegans</italic> germline (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s6">Figure 4—figure supplement 6</xref>).</p><p>The size of an SDSA or dissolution noncrossover conversion tract is primarily determined by the length of DNA strand extension (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Marsolier-Kergoat et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Guo et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Keelagher et al., 2011</xref>). Human BRCA1 promotes strand invasion and D-loop formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Zhao et al., 2017</xref>), which may influence the efficiency of strand extension. Our conversion tract data therefore raises the possibility that <italic>C. elegans</italic> BRC-1 influences the formation and/or stability of strand invasion intermediates, thereby promoting the formation of long ICR assay noncrossover gene conversion events (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s6">Figure 4—figure supplement 6</xref>). Our data also demonstrate that <italic>brc-1</italic> mutants exhibit elevated intersister crossovers. If BRC-1 only functions to promote strand invasion and D-loop formation, then we would expect <italic>brc-1</italic> mutation to reduce intersister crossovers and not increase their occurrence. Previous studies have also suggested that BRCA1/BRC-1 regulates DSB resection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chen et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Cruz-García et al., 2014</xref>), and we propose that this function better accounts for our observed increase in intersister crossovers in the <italic>brc-1</italic> null mutant. Specifically, BRCA1-promoted long range DSB resection may be important for the efficiency of SDSA by ensuring sufficient single stranded DNA is exposed on the second end of the DSB to facilitate strand annealing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kamp et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chandramouly et al., 2013</xref>). While sufficient resection may be critical in resolving SDSA noncrossovers, long range resection is not required for the efficient formation of joint molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Zakharyevich et al., 2010</xref>). Thus, reduced length of DNA resection due to a <italic>brc-1</italic> mutation may impede SDSA and therefore increase the probability that DSBs will form joint molecule intermediates, thereby promoting intersister crossover outcomes.</p><p>Reduced resection in conjunction with inefficient strand invasion and synthesis during recombination may further explain the ectopic engagement of TMEJ observed in <italic>brc-1</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kamp et al., 2020</xref>). Short range resection provides sufficient substrate for TMEJ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Ramsden et al., 2022</xref>), which in combination with inefficient homology search may provide more opportunity for TMEJ engagement. Polymerase θ helicase activity is also sufficient to remove recombinases from single-stranded DNA to promote end-joining repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Schaub et al., 2022</xref>). BRC-1 may promote recombination and prevent TMEJ by stabilizing RAD-51 on resected DNA or antagonizing this activity of polymerase θ. Notably, the timepoint at which we identified mutants in the <italic>brc-1</italic> ICR and IH assays correlate to the stage of meiotic prophase I at which BRC-1 is also required in late meiotic prophase I for the loading and/or maintenance of RAD-51 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Li et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Janisiw et al., 2018</xref>). Overall, our data is consistent with a model in which BRC-1 promotes multiple DSB repair steps, including resection and the formation of early strand invasion intermediates, to facilitate intersister noncrossover repair (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s6">Figure 4—figure supplement 6</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Functions of SMC-5/6 in <italic>C. elegans</italic> meiotic DSB repair</title><p><italic>C. elegans</italic> deficient in SMC-5/6 exhibit severe meiotic genome instability and become sterile over successive generations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Volkova et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bickel et al., 2010</xref>). Despite these stark phenotypes, our ICR and IH assays identified only relatively subtle phenotypes in <italic>smc-5</italic> mutants. It should be noted, however, that the ICR and IH assays only detect DSB repair outcomes that encode a functional protein product. Thus, many of the severe DSB repair mutations associated with SMC-5/6 deficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Volkova et al., 2020</xref>) may disrupt the coding sequence in the ICR or IH assays and therefore escape detection.</p><p>In budding yeast, Smc5/6 prevents the accumulation of toxic interchromosomal attachments and recombination intermediates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bonner et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Chen et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Peng et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Xaver et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Lilienthal et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Copsey et al., 2013</xref>). Prior evidence in <italic>C. elegans</italic> suggests that some of these functions are likely conserved, as double mutants for <italic>smc-5</italic> and the BLM helicase homolog <italic>him-6</italic> are sterile and display chromatin bridges indicative of persistent interchromosomal attachments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hong et al., 2016</xref>). This synthetic phenotype suggests that these two complexes act in parallel to prevent the accumulation of joint molecules. A previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Almanzar et al., 2021</xref>) and the data we present here reveal that both SMC-5 and HIM-6 repress intersister crossovers. The synthetic sterility associated with loss of both SMC-5 and HIM-6 then may be a product of parallel functions for these proteins in limiting and/or resolving joint molecules. Although BLM is known to play multiple roles in regulating recombination, a core function of this helicase is in antagonism of joint molecule formation and promotion of noncrossover recombination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Schvarzstein et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">McVey et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Weinert and Rio, 2007</xref>). SMC-5/6 in <italic>C. elegans</italic> meiosis may therefore act as a second line of defense to ensure the elimination of inappropriate joint molecule intermediates that have formed more stable configurations. We also did not observe a large increase in ICR assay crossover products in <italic>smc-6</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>).

Specific subunits of SMC-5/6 also exhibit enzymatic function, such as the E3 SUMO ligase Nse2/Mms21 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Andrews et al., 2005</xref>), suggesting that SMC-5/6 may act to post-translationally modify target proteins to regulate DNA repair.

Further, the repair events that we identified frequently displayed microhomologies flanking the deletion site – a characteristic signature of TMEJ.

We raise the hypothesis that <italic>C. elegans</italic> meiotic POLQ-1 may be activated in late stages of meiotic prophase I by PLK-2 analogously to mitotic human Polθ activation by PLK1. These regulatory events may confer a switch in cellular ‘priorities’ from ensuring formation of interhomolog recombination intermediates to promoting repair of all residual DSBs even through error prone mechanisms. By repairing all residual DSBs (even in the wake of sequence errors), germ cells avoid catastrophic chromosome fragmentation during the meiotic divisions.</p><p>During the mid to late pachytene transition, an important function of BRC-1 (and to a lesser extent SMC-5/6) may be to prevent TMEJ either by antagonizing this pathway or facilitating efficient recombination. Our irradiation experiments revealed that both <italic>brc-1</italic> and <italic>smc-5</italic> mutant oocytes exhibit greater sensitivity to exogenous DNA damage in late stages of prophase I, suggesting that cellular requirements for efficacious DSB repair change during the transition to late pachytene. Moreover, during the mid-late pachytene stage, several changes regarding BRC-1 occur: (1) BRC-1 protein localization changes; and, (2) BRC-1 is required to load (and/or stabilize) RAD-51 filaments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Li et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Janisiw et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2C</xref>). We found that <italic>brc-1</italic> mutants incur mutations with characteristic TMEJ signatures specifically at the mid/late pachytene stage, suggesting that the changes in BRC-1 localization and function at this stage may coincide with changes in the availability and/or regulation of error prone repair mechanisms. Our irradiation experiments demonstrated that <italic>smc-5;brc-1</italic> double mutant oocytes in late meiotic prophase I are dependent upon TMEJ DNA polymerase θ homolog <italic>polq-1</italic> for viability. If BRC-1 functions that repress TMEJ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kamp et al., 2020</xref>) are specific to late prophase, then this result suggests that many DSBs in <italic>smc-5;brc-1</italic> mutants induced in early prophase may not be repaired until mid/late pachytene, when TMEJ is active. Spatiotemporal transcriptomic analysis has shown that <italic>polq-1</italic> is expressed throughout meiotic prophase I (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Tzur et al., 2018</xref>). As we only identified error-prone resolution of DSBs induced at mid pachytene, our findings raise the possibility that BRC-1 independent mechanisms may repress TMEJ in early/mid pachytene. Our results in <italic>brc-1</italic> mutants therefore lay the groundwork for future research delineating the temporal regulation of error-prone meiotic DSB repair. Taken together, our study reveals that the engagement of error-prone and recombination DSB repair pathways are differentially regulated during the course of <italic>C. elegans</italic> meiotic prophase I.</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Interaction between BRC-1 and SMC-5/6 in meiotic DNA repair</title><p>Our observation of multiple genetic interactions in <italic>brc-1</italic> and <italic>smc-5</italic> double mutants, but no coincident change in either SMC-5/6 or BRC-1 localization in their respective null mutants, suggests that the phenotypes of <italic>smc-5</italic>, <italic>brc-1</italic>, and <italic>smc-5;brc-1</italic> mutants are likely not derived from direct physical interactions between these complexes nor action on shared substrates. Instead, we propose that BRC-1 and SMC-5/6 exert sequential roles in regulation of DSB repair. A similar model was proposed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hong et al., 2016</xref> which postulated that early recombination defects in <italic>brc-1</italic> mutants may alleviate the toxic recombination intermediates formed in <italic>smc-5;him-6</italic> double mutants.</p><p>How might DNA repair defects in <italic>brc-1</italic> mutants ameliorate genomic instability associated with <italic>smc-5</italic> mutation? Our observation that <italic>brc-1</italic> mutation suppresses the increased RAD-51 foci in <italic>smc-5</italic> mutants suggests that BRC-1 acts to promote recombination repair of DSBs even in contexts where recombination is defective (such as in <italic>smc-5</italic> null mutants). Ablation of NHEJ and TMEJ proteins in <italic>brc-1</italic> mutants rescues RAD-51 foci formation, indicating that BRC-1 acts to promote recombinase loading at the exclusion of error-prone DSB repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Trivedi et al., 2022</xref>). Thus, it is likely that many DSBs in <italic>smc-5;brc-1</italic> mutants are repaired by recombination-independent pathways and circumvent <italic>smc-5</italic> mutant defects.</p><p><italic>brc-1</italic> mutant defects in DSB resection and strand invasion may also contribute to suppressing <italic>smc-5</italic> mutant phenotypes. In budding yeast, the additional ssDNA generated by long range resectioning of a DSB is used for homology search (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Chung et al., 2010</xref>). Inefficient resection in <italic>brc-1</italic> mutants may reduce the extent of homology that could anneal to heterologous templates and contribute to toxic joint molecules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s6">Figure 4—figure supplement 6</xref>). Compromised strand invasion and D-loop formation in <italic>brc-1</italic> mutants could also limit the capacity for DSBs to form multi-chromatid engagements. Conversely, resection defects of <italic>brc-1</italic> mutants may increase the risk for toxic recombination intermediates in <italic>smc-5</italic> mutants by limiting the efficiency of SDSA and therefore biasing DSBs to form joint molecules. Future studies assessing the specific recombination intermediates formed in <italic>brc-1</italic> and <italic>smc-5</italic> mutants is needed to distinguish between these possibilities.</p><p>In summary, our data suggest that BRC-1 acts upstream of SMC-5/6 to promote recombination by facilitating early DSB processing and strand invasion. SMC-5/6, then, likely functions downstream of BRC-1 to stabilize or regulate joint molecules, consistent with its functions in preventing the accumulation of toxic interchromosomal attachments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hong et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Jagut et al., 2016</xref>). Our work reveals interplay between these highly conserved DNA repair complexes in regulating DNA repair pathway engagement and outlines targets for future research to determine the molecular basis of these interactions.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title><italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> strains and maintenance</title><p><italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> strains were maintained at 15°C or 20°C on nematode growth medium (NGM) plates seeded with OP50 bacteria.

We also include an acceptance summary that explains what the editors found interesting or important about the work.</p></boxed-text><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;BRCA1/BRC-1 and SMC-5/6 regulate DNA repair pathway engagement during <italic>C. elegans</italic> meiosis&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, including Bernard de Massy as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Jessica Tyler as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in the review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Anton Gartner (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this synthetic review with &quot;Essential revisions&quot; and &quot;Other revisions&quot; to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Understanding the assays is important for the readers. Even though the information is available in previous publications, a supplementary figure describing the assays (ICR and IH) and recombination products and their detection is suggested.</p><p>2) As noted by the authors, the inter-sister CO increase was not expected and seems to contradict the previous publications by Adamo et al. and Bickel et al. Have the authors thought about testing intersister recombination with another allele of their mutants to exclude effects due to unknown mutations? This issue needs to be addressed and discussed.</p><p>3) L303-304: The interpretation of the increased GFP progeny is a major issue and cannot be redirected to a few sentences in the methods section as this is the major topic of this study. The methods section outlines several alternatives, whereas the main text seems to prioritize some. This seems arbitrary and should be clarified with experimental data (for instance testing the SNP hypothesis).</p><p>4) The authors cannot conclude that both assays (L 323 support a function for SMC-5 in repressing intersister crossover in <italic>C. elegans</italic> meiosis: Data from Edu is supported by only 6 bivalents coming from 2 oocytes. In addition, could the authors demonstrate that those exchanges are taking place during meiosis? (as performed for him-6, this may require to analyze a smc-5 spo-11 mutant).</p><p>5) L361: the potential delay should be shown. Assigning the two time-windows as inter homolog and non interhomolog is at the basis of the experimental approach and whether it is altered in the mutants or not must be known and taken into account for interpretations.</p><p>6) Analysis of ICR and IH in brc-1 smc-5 double mutant. The authors could use balancers for both loci to maintain the strain, and minimize accumulation of genomic instability (from the strain list, a balancer was used for smc-5 but not for brc-1). Alternatively, the Smc-5 degron allele could be used.</p><p>7) Irradiation experiments: Please provide cytological data of DSB repair detection (ie RPA or Rad-51) in the different mutant contexts and information about the number of DSBs induced at the different doses of IR (14 DSB per homolog pair for 5000 rads as from Almanzar et al?). Also provide information about the γ sensitivity of germ cells of wt, single and double mutants.</p><p>The readout of the irradiation experiments is brood viability. One major problem with the interpretation is that sperm is also irradiated and can contribute to the phenotype. To avoid this issue, the authors should irradiate hermaphrodites and mate with non-irradiated males. This could be tested at least for one genotype (ie brc-1 smc-5) to evaluate the potential impact of sperm irradiation.</p><p>8) The main figure (figure 4) should present brood viability, and the fit to the model as supplementary figure, as qualitatively the effects can be visualized by examining the brood viability: i) greater sensitivity of smc-5 compared to brc-1 (the claim for a greater sensitivity in the non-interhomolog window is not convincing as the differences of the γ parameter are quite small, may be excepted for the brc-1 mutant at 5000 rads; in addition, no statistical test is validating the differences),ii) dispensability of BRC-1 at early prophase in low IR, iii) suppression of smc-5 sensitivity by brc-1 in the interhomolog window, iv) sensitization by polq-1.</p><p>9) Discussion:</p><p>The discussion is mostly reiterating the data from the results and should be more focused on the conclusions that can be drawn, novel points or questions to be addressed, and relating to current knowledge on Brc-1 and Smc-5 in other species.</p><p>The question of chromosome fragmentation in Smc-5 and discussion about the data from this manuscript (L 674…) is unclear. How could the mutations detected in smc-5 (Volkova et al.) explain the efficient recovery of HR events by the ICR and IH assays? As indicated above (point 2), the authors should discuss the previous study concluding that Brc-1 is required for intersister recombination (Adamo et al., 2008).</p><p>After citing this work in the introduction, the authors ignore this opposite conclusion from the discussion. May be the chromatid fragments in brc-1 msh-4 are products of TMEJ ? Similarly, Bickel et al. 2010, proposed that Smc-5 is required for homolog-independent (presumably intersister) events. The authors must solve this apparent contradiction.</p><p>The question of potential differences between Spo11 and Mos1 induced breaks should be discussed and thus with alternative interpretations.</p><p>10) The model presented in Figure 5, with the molecular intermediates is only indirectly supported by the data which does not allow determining which steps of the reaction are affected besides for the resection phenotype from the gene conversion tract analysis. The model would be better suited to be presented as a supplementary figure.</p><p>11) Box plots: Plot data points instead of box plots: Figure 1A, 1c, supfig2b, 2d, Figure 2B, 2d, Figure 3C, d</p><p>Other revisions:</p><p>12) Abstract: L21: SMC-5 was not shown to limit error prone repair.</p><p>13) The authors should introduce more widely the current knowledge about Brca1 and Smc5/6 with information from other species. Their results should also be integrated into a larger context.</p><p>14) It is unclear whether each mutant was analyzed in parallel with a wild-type control. In principle to control for experimental variations (temperature…) this should be done. As presented in figures, one has the impression that wild-type and mutants were done in parallel. Please explain clearly the experimental procedures in the methods, and provide relevant information in the legends.</p><p>15) In several figures (ie Figure 1C and others), sample sizes and duplicates are not clearly indicated: how many animals, how many oocytes. It would be easier to have N values on the figures. It is mentioned in the methods that ICR assays were repeated 4 times with at least 20 parents each (what about the IH assays ?), but the source data shows only the total pool of progeny tested. What is the inter-parent and inter-replicate variation?</p><p>16) For counting bivalents, some with visually interpretable bivalents were counted. Likely some bivalents either DAPI or Edu staining was difficult to interpret. How to exclude a selection bias in this analysis?</p><p>17) Fig1D: some numbers do not match the table: 1/41 instead of 1/43…, same for 1E.</p><p>And the mutant non-unc is 17.2% in the figure but 13.2% in the text.</p><p>18) Figure 3 A and C: The number of noncrossover conversion tracts in the non-IH window for smc-5 and brc-1 seems to be too low (with one long event in brc-1) to be statistically valid, even though a p value was calculated by the Fisher's exact test. The authors should dampen their conclusion that Brc-1 only affects tract length in the IH window or alternatively increase sample size.</p><p>19)</p><p>L 39: SPo11 references: Keeney et al. 1997; Bergerat et al. 1997.</p><p>L 44: The use of &quot;resolve&quot; for DSB is odd (also L 55, 74).</p><p>L 51: &quot;In SDSA, one resected end&quot; might be better than &quot;the resected end&quot;.</p><p>L 74: Utilize homologous recombination.</p><p>L 104-5: vague; not additive could mean synergistic or unchanged.</p><p>L 121 (and L514-515).

The experiments are generally well done, and the results will be of interest to investigators studying DNA repair and meiotic recombination in <italic>C. elegans</italic>. However, it is unclear whether the results are unique to <italic>C. elegans</italic>, and the authors do not give sufficient context to convincingly frame their conclusions as novel or identifying conserved meiotic mechanisms.</p><p>At least in the merged PDF of the manuscript, lines 176 and 177 seem out of place, and reading from line 147 (before Figure 1) to line 176 (after Figure 1) does not make sense. I think lines 176-77 should be deleted, but do they belong somewhere else? Also, the first reference to Figure 1A comes later in the text than I would have expected, so I'm not sure if other text was missing that should have been there.</p><p>The ICR and IH assays are so important to this paper that there should be a supplemental figure showing how they work and give different outcomes for CO vs NCO, and where the polymorphisms are. Even though they have been published elsewhere, it would be helpful not to have to find those papers to be able to follow the experiments done here.</p><p>Line 461: How do the doses of IR used affect the number of DSBs or RAD-51 foci? Are these doses expected to increase breaks 2-fold? 10-fold? The experiments are difficult to interpret without knowing how DSB number (or some DSB proxy) changes.</p><p>As the authors acknowledge, there is substantial variation in viability between the broods of different irradiated (and even unirradiated) hermaphrodites with the same genotype. The cause of this variability is not known. However, it is possible that sperm defects contribute to the variability. Irradiation of young adult hermaphrodites will induce mutations both in the germline nuclei undergoing meiosis and in the several hundred mature sperm made earlier in development. Thus, the &quot;reverse timecourse&quot; following irradiation is capturing both the effects of mutations made at different stages of nuclei undergoing oogenic meiosis and sperm that had already completed meiosis when irradiated. Larval lethality could result from either, and may be revealing how an embryo copes with inheriting damaged DNA from the sperm. It is also formally possible that sperm differences account for the variability observed in unirradiated worms. It is already difficult to compare the data using Mos1 induced breaks to the irradiation data because the assays are completely different. However, the Mos data also presumably is only measuring recombination during oocyte production (i.e. not in sperm), while larval lethality following irradiation is likely measuring damage in sperm as well as during oogenesis. I would recommend mating irradiated hermaphrodites with unirradiated males to simplify the analysis by looking only at consequences of damage that will ultimately affect the oocyte.</p><p>The irradiation/larval lethality assay was used instead of the ICR/IH assays because &quot;genetically balanced smc-5;brc-1 double mutants can still acquire mutations and become progressively sterile over the course of a few generations&quot; (line 456). From the strain list, it looks like only smc-5 was balanced, but brc-1 was maintained in a homozygous condition. Given the availability of numerous small inversion balancers made by the Mitani lab, it should be possible to balance both loci. This may prevent the accumulation of defects and allow the ICR/IH assays to be done in double mutants. Alternatively, perhaps the degron-tagged smc-5 allele could be used to deplete SMC-5 acutely. If so, this would greatly strengthen the paper.</p><p>For me, the way the irradiation data are presented calls into question their robustness, or at least suggests that the conclusions are only as good as the mathematical model. I think many of the key results are visible in Supplemental Figure 4A, at least at some doses. As a biology person and not a statistics person, I would find it substantially more convincing to discuss the empirical data first, then bring in the model data to support the empirical data. At the very least, I need better justification for the design of the statistical model and its reliability.</p><p>Identical data are presented as wild-type controls in several figures (Figures1A and 4A, 1B and 4C, Supplemental Figure 1A and B, and elsewhere). This gives the false impression that each mutant was analyzed in parallel with a wild-type control. However, it is unclear from the text, figure legends, and methods whether any of the experiments were done with parallel controls. In fact, the wild-type dataset was performed once and combined with previous data (line 950). Ideally, wild-type and mutants would be analyzed at the same time, on the same batch of plates, same batch of worm food, and in the same incubator, since meiosis is temperature sensitive, and heat shock genes can be induced by a variety of stressors, including wet plates. If this was not done, the authors should clearly state it in the methods and ideally also in the figure legends, since it is an important point. I also think it would be less confusing, and would potentially make the paper easier to read, if some figures were combined, for example 1A and 4A could be one figure (with a legend stating that multiple replicates were done, but not always in parallel for different genotypes); 1B and 4C could easily be combined.</p><p>Figures 1B and 4C: the N values are given for number of bivalents analyzed. The number for WT seems reasonable, but the numbers for mutants seem small even though this is a somewhat difficult experiment. How many bivalents were analyzed in each oocyte, and how were they chosen? How many oocytes were analyzed? How many animals?</p><p>Figure 3A and C: it is hard to interpret the data showing a statistically significant effect of brc-1 depletion on resection tract length because so many fewer NCO tracts were analyzed in brc-1 than in wt or smc-5 and only one long tract was identified. I guess this would only mean that the magnitude of the effect is being underestimated, not the opposite.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.80687.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Understanding the assays is important for the readers.

The ICR results in <italic>brc- 1(tm1145);brd-1(dw1)</italic> mutants revealed a clear increase in homolog-independent crossovers, corroborating our <italic>brc-1(xoe4)</italic> results (Figure 1 —figure supplement 2B).

Thus, our additional experiments affirm that neither SMC-5 nor SMC-6 is required for homolog-independent repair. While both <italic>smc-5(ok2421)</italic> and <italic>smc-6(ok3294)</italic> null mutants prevent SMC-5/6 complex assembly (Bickel <italic>et al.</italic>), it is possible that the residual proteins of the SMC-5/6 complex in either single mutant (<italic>e.g.</italic> SMC-5 protein in the <italic>smc-6(ok3294)</italic> null mutant) may still exert subtle functions sufficient to influence DNA repair outcomes that are independent of an assembled SMC-5/6 complex. We have therefore amended the text of our manuscript to specify that our results are specific to the function of SMC-5, rather than SMC-5/6.</p><p>Our multipronged assessment of DNA repair phenotypes provides further confidence that a strong modifier allele is not affecting our analysis of <italic>smc-5</italic> and <italic>brc-1</italic> mutants relative to previous work.

Our experiments affirm the long-standing hypothesis that BRC-1 and SMC-5 regulate intersister DNA repair; however, our data indicate that they are not necessarily required for intersister repair (which is what was originally hypothesized), but instead our results support a growing body of evidence that BRC-1 and SMC-5/6 regulate diverse meiotic DNA repair outcomes. Our study therefore provides vital context to the meiosis and DNA repair fields. To emphasize and clarify these points (especially the fact our data complements prior published data), we have summarized these notions in a new section of our discussion (lines 545-589).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) L303-304: The interpretation of the increased GFP progeny is a major issue and cannot be redirected to a few sentences in the methods section as this is the major topic of this study. The methods section outlines several alternatives, whereas the main text seems to prioritize some. This seems arbitrary and should be clarified with experimental data (for instance testing the SNP hypothesis).</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that the increased frequency of ICR assay recombination events in both <italic>smc-5</italic> and <italic>brc-1</italic> mutants is of potential biological importance, and we therefore performed experiments to test our hypotheses that the rate of increased recombinants in <italic>brc-1</italic> and <italic>smc-5</italic> mutants may be underpinned by relaxed heteroduplex rejection and/or increased Mos1 excision. It is important to note, however, that none of the conclusions made from the ICR assay in our manuscript are informed by the absolute frequency of ICR assay recombinants; we only draw conclusions from the ratios of homolog-independent noncrossovers and crossovers. We further make no claims as to the absolute frequency of intersister events that occur in <italic>brc-1</italic> and <italic>smc-5</italic> mutants.</p><p>We now include new experimental data where we tested whether altered heteroduplex recognition or rejection may influence the frequency of detectable ICR assay recombinants by specifically performing the ICR assay in a <italic>msh-2</italic> mutant, which is required for mismatch repair (Figure 1 —figure supplement 2, Chakraborty and Alani 2016). We found that the overall frequency of recombinants was not significantly altered in this context, disfavoring the mismatch-rejection model.</p><p>We next attempted to directly measure the frequency of Mos1 excision following heat shock by quantifying the number of RAD-51 foci produced following heat shock with the ICR assay in <italic>spo-11</italic>, <italic>smc-5::AID::3xFLAG;spo-11</italic>, and <italic>brc-1;spo-11</italic> mutants. However, we found that our <italic>smc-5::AID::3xFLAG;spo-11</italic> ICR assay strains were sick and mated very poorly, preventing us from obtaining sufficient animals to perform the experiment. Further, the <italic>brc-1(xoe4);spo-11</italic> ICR assay strains were genetically unstable and segregated phenotypes consistent with balancer breakdown. We hypothesize that this problem is due <italic>brc-1</italic> intolerance for large heterozygous genomic rearrangements, such as the nT1 translocation balancer required to properly balance <italic>spo-11</italic> and the ICR assay.</p><p>We attempted to balance <italic>brc-1</italic> with the multiply inverted balancer chromosome qC1 (Edgley <italic>et al.

Cell</italic> 2018), <italic>brc-1</italic> mutation may be broadly incompatible with this balancer class. Unfortunately, the smaller inversion balancer that covers the <italic>unc-5</italic> locus on chromosome IV (Dejima <italic>et al. Cell Rep.</italic> 2018) contains a transgene disrupting the <italic>unc-5</italic> locus, rendering it unusable for our purposes. We therefore were unable to test the absolute rate of Mos1 excision in the ICR assay in <italic>smc-5</italic> and <italic>brc-1</italic> mutants. As we noted in the text of our manuscript (Lines 191- 194,271-273), the maximum incidence of recombinants in the <italic>smc-5</italic> and <italic>brc-1</italic> IH assays were not elevated relative to wild type, suggesting that increased Mos1 excision is not increased in these mutants. Future work beyond the scope of this manuscript will be required to determine the underlying cause of the elevated rates of GFP+ ICR assay progeny in <italic>smc-5</italic> and <italic>brc-1</italic> mutants.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The authors cannot conclude that both assays (L 323 support a function for SMC-5 in repressing intersister crossover in <italic>C. elegans</italic> meiosis: Data from Edu is supported by only 6 bivalents coming from 2 oocytes.

We also appreciate that assessing for SCEs in an <italic>smc-5;spo-11</italic> mutant could be informative. However, due to the dissertation completion timeline of our collaborators, this analysis is beyond the scope of this manuscript. To interpret this data more conservatively, we have amended our text to emphasize that our <italic>smc-5</italic> SCE counts should be interpreted as evidence that meiotic and/or mitotic intersister crossovers do occur in the absence of SMC-5 but may not reflect the absolute levels of SCEs (Lines 262-266).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) L361: the potential delay should be shown.

The authors could use balancers for both loci to maintain the strain, and minimize accumulation of genomic instability (from the strain list, a balancer was used for smc-5 but not for brc-1). Alternatively, the Smc-5 degron allele could be used.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewers that the <italic>brc-1 smc-5</italic> double mutant is of interest. Unfortunately, the balancer options available for the <italic>brc-1</italic> locus of Chromosome III are limited to translocation balancers, and in our hands translocation balancers (both nT1 and qC1) are highly genetically unstable in a <italic>brc-1</italic> mutant background, limiting their application for these purposes. We therefore introgressed a germline-specific TIR1 transgene into the <italic>smc-5::AID::3xFLAG</italic> background, enabling germline-specific SMC-5 depletion in the presence of auxin (Figure 4 —figure supplement 2A,B). We then generated the <italic>smc-5::AID::3xFLAG;brc-1(xoe4)</italic> double mutant ICR assay strains and performed the assay following SMC-5 depletion (Figure 4A). We found that the ICR assay in <italic>brc-1</italic> mutants following SMC-5 depletion appear very similar to <italic>brc-1</italic> single mutants, suggesting that BRC-1 acts upstream of or in the same pathway with SMC-5 to regulate homolog-independent repair outcomes (Lines 344-364).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) Irradiation experiments: Please provide cytological data of DSB repair detection (ie RPA or Rad-51) in the different mutant contexts and information about the number of DSBs induced at the different doses of IR (14 DSB per homolog pair for 5000 rads as from Almanzar et al?). Also provide information about the γ sensitivity of germ cells of wt, single and double mutants.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the value of the reviewers’ suggestion to additionally assess DSB repair cytologically to complement our functional analysis. We examined RAD-51 foci in wild- type, <italic>smc-5</italic>, <italic>brc-1</italic>, and <italic>smc-5;brc-1</italic> germlines (Figure 4B). The results of this analysis are discussed in the manuscript at Lines 365-383. As we used γ radiation from a cesium source rather than X-rays to induce DSBs in this study, we reference the DSB induction estimates calculated in Yokoo <italic>et al. Cell</italic> 2012 that also used γ radiation to induce DSBs. From Yokoo <italic>et al.</italic>, a dose of 5000 Rads is expected to induce approximately 9.8 DSBs/chromatid pair, while a dose of 5000 Rads would inflict 19.6 DSBs/chromatid pair. We have included this information in the text for the readers’ reference (Lines 390-392).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The readout of the irradiation experiments is brood viability. One major problem with the interpretation is that sperm is also irradiated and can contribute to the phenotype. To avoid this issue, the authors should irradiate hermaphrodites and mate with non-irradiated males. This could be tested at least for one genotype (ie brc-1 smc-5) to evaluate the potential impact of sperm irradiation.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate this point made by the reviewers, particularly considering recent evidence that sperm-specific irradiation can cause intergenerational lethality in <italic>C. elegans</italic> (Wang <italic>et al. Nature</italic> 2023). Wang <italic>et al.</italic> demonstrate that even at doses of radiation much higher than those used in this study, the sperm-specific impact on brood viability is minimal in the F1 generation following P0 irradiation. The notable exception to this observation is in <italic>polq-1</italic> mutants, as DSBs in mature sperm DNA are repaired by maternally contributed POLQ-1 in the fertilized zygote. To assess the potential confounding effect of sperm to our brood viability experiments, we irradiated <italic>smc-5;brc-1</italic>, <italic>polq-1</italic>, and <italic>smc-5;brc-1;polq- 1</italic> mutant hermaphrodites and then mated these animals to unirradiated males (Figure 4 —figure supplement 3A,B, see Methods lines 781-783). In accordance with Wang <italic>et al.</italic>, introduction of <italic>polq-1</italic> mutation did increase the sensitivity of brood viability to radiation due to sperm-specific effects. However, mating did not rescue brood viability in the non- interhomolog window of <italic>smc-5;brc-1;polq-1</italic> mutants, supporting our conclusion that TMEJ is engaged in late stages of meiotic prophase I to resolve DSBs in <italic>smc-5;brc-1</italic> mutants. We have added description of these results to our Results section (Lines 447- 460).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) The main figure (figure 4) should present brood viability, and the fit to the model as supplementary figure, as qualitatively the effects can be visualized by examining the brood viability: i) greater sensitivity of smc-5 compared to brc-1 (the claim for a greater sensitivity in the non-interhomolog window is not convincing as the differences of the γ parameter are quite small, may be excepted for the brc-1 mutant at 5000 rads; in addition, no statistical test is validating the differences),ii) dispensability of BRC-1 at early prophase in low IR, iii) suppression of smc-5 sensitivity by brc-1 in the interhomolog window, iv) sensitization by polq-1.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewers’ feedback on the presentation of our irradiation data and subsequent analysis.

In reference to Adamo <italic>et al.</italic> and Bickel <italic>et al.</italic>, we have added additional context to our discussion (Lines 516- 527, see also our response to Major Revision point #2). We do not feel that our results contradict the Adamo and Bickel results and instead provide additional context to their data by applying technologies not available at the time of these original studies to directly test the specific role of SMC-5/6 and BRC-1 in homolog-independent DSB repair. Our parallel application of the EdU labeling assay (which monitors primarily SPO-11- induced DSB repair) and ICR assay (which monitors Mos1 excision-induced DSB repair) addresses the concern that our detection of intersister events may be unique to exogenous DSB repair. We have emphasized this point both in the Results (Lines 164- 165) and Discussion (Lines 524-527).</p><p>We thank the reviewers for their feedback on the structure of our Discussion.

Also, the first reference to Figure 1A comes later in the text than I would have expected, so I'm not sure if other text was missing that should have been there.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for catching this formatting error.

The cause of this variability is not known. However, it is possible that sperm defects contribute to the variability. Irradiation of young adult hermaphrodites will induce mutations both in the germline nuclei undergoing meiosis and in the several hundred mature sperm made earlier in development. Thus, the &quot;reverse timecourse&quot; following irradiation is capturing both the effects of mutations made at different stages of nuclei undergoing oogenic meiosis and sperm that had already completed meiosis when irradiated. Larval lethality could result from either, and may be revealing how an embryo copes with inheriting damaged DNA from the sperm. It is also formally possible that sperm differences account for the variability observed in unirradiated worms. It is already difficult to compare the data using Mos1 induced breaks to the irradiation data because the assays are completely different. However, the Mos data also presumably is only measuring recombination during oocyte production (i.e. not in sperm), while larval lethality following irradiation is likely measuring damage in sperm as well as during oogenesis. I would recommend mating irradiated hermaphrodites with unirradiated males to simplify the analysis by looking only at consequences of damage that will ultimately affect the oocyte.</p></disp-quote><p>Please see our response to Essential Revisions #7.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The irradiation/larval lethality assay was used instead of the ICR/IH assays because &quot;genetically balanced smc-5;brc-1 double mutants can still acquire mutations and become progressively sterile over the course of a few generations&quot; (line 456). From the strain list, it looks like only smc-5 was balanced, but brc-1 was maintained in a homozygous condition. Given the availability of numerous small inversion balancers made by the Mitani lab, it should be possible to balance both loci. This may prevent the accumulation of defects and allow the ICR/IH assays to be done in double mutants. Alternatively, perhaps the degron-tagged smc-5 allele could be used to deplete SMC-5 acutely. If so, this would greatly strengthen the paper.</p></disp-quote><p>Please see our response to Essential Revisions #6.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>For me, the way the irradiation data are presented calls into question their robustness, or at least suggests that the conclusions are only as good as the mathematical model. I think many of the key results are visible in Supplemental Figure 4A, at least at some doses. As a biology person and not a statistics person, I would find it substantially more convincing to discuss the empirical data first, then bring in the model data to support the empirical data. At the very least, I need better justification for the design of the statistical model and its reliability.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate this valuable feedback from the reviewer and wish to emphasize that it was not our intent to obscure our results. We agree with and appreciate the feedback that many of the phenotypes we noted are quite clear even from the raw data without any analysis, and have presented the experimental data in Figure 4C and moved our statistical analysis to Figure 4 —figure supplement 3.</p><p>The Βeta-Binomial model is commonly employed in statistical analysis of discrete observations, as it accounts for multiple levels of variation that may exist within a given dataset. Binomial distributions describe the incidence of discrete outcomes (<italic>e.g.</italic> whether the egg laid by a nematode will hatch or not) that occur with a probability of p. In a Βeta-Binomial model, p is not a fixed value and is instead described by a Βeta distribution.</p><p>This framework is useful for our analysis, as some DNA repair mutants exhibit high inter-hermaphrodite variation in baseline brood viability (in particular loss-of-function mutants deficient for multiple repair pathways, such as <italic>brc-1;polq-1</italic> mutants, as observed both in our study and by Trivedi <italic>et al. NAR</italic> 2022). In this context, the variance between hermaphrodites can be accounted for by the Βeta distribution in the model, while the proportion of dead progeny that are observed in a given brood is accounted for by the Binomial level of the model. We have taken a Bayesian approach to fitting this model to our data and have estimated values for the parameters of this model that reasonably recapitulate the data we observe and facilitate our inference in the effect of irradiation on brood viability.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Identical data are presented as wild-type controls in several figures (Figures1A and 4A, 1B and 4C, Supplemental Figure 1A and B, and elsewhere). This gives the false impression that each mutant was analyzed in parallel with a wild-type control. However, it is unclear from the text, figure legends, and methods whether any of the experiments were done with parallel controls. In fact, the wild-type dataset was performed once and combined with previous data (line 950). Ideally, wild-type and mutants would be analyzed at the same time, on the same batch of plates, same batch of worm food, and in the same incubator, since meiosis is temperature sensitive, and heat shock genes can be induced by a variety of stressors, including wet plates. If this was not done, the authors should clearly state it in the methods and ideally also in the figure legends, since it is an important point. I also think it would be less confusing, and would potentially make the paper easier to read, if some figures were combined, for example 1A and 4A could be one figure (with a legend stating that multiple replicates were done, but not always in parallel for different genotypes); 1B and 4C could easily be combined.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this feedback.
