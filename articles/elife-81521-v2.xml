We have shown previously that different orientations of the transmembrane (TM) helices within a receptor dimer can lead to different signaling outputs. Here we addressed the structural basis of activation for receptor mutations S505N and W515K that induce myeloproliferative neoplasms. We show using <italic>in vivo</italic> bone marrow reconstitution experiments that ligand-independent activation of TpoR by TM asparagine (Asn) substitutions is proportional to the proximity of the Asn mutation to the intracellular membrane surface. Solid-state NMR experiments on TM peptides indicate a progressive loss of helical structure in the juxtamembrane (JM) R/KWQFP motif with proximity of Asn substitutions to the cytosolic boundary. Mutational studies in the TpoR cytosolic JM region show that loss of the helical structure in the JM motif by itself can induce activation, but only when localized to a maximum of six amino acids downstream of W515, the helicity of the remaining region until Box 1 being required for receptor function. The constitutive activation of TpoR mutants S505N and W515K can be inhibited by rotation of TM helices within the TpoR dimer, which also restores helicity around W515. Together, these data allow us to develop a general model for activation of TpoR and explain the critical role of the JM W515 residue in the regulation of the activity of the receptor.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>c-mpl ligand</kwd><kwd>thrombopoietin receptor</kwd><kwd>cytokine receptor</kwd><kwd>transmembrane domain</kwd><kwd>helix dimerization</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002661</institution-id><institution>Fonds National de la Recherche Scientifique</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Télévie PhD fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Balligand</surname><given-names>Thomas</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002661</institution-id><institution>Fonds National de la Recherche Scientifique</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Papadopoulos</surname><given-names>Nicolas</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Les avions de Sebastien</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Levy</surname><given-names>Gabriel</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100009729</institution-id><institution>Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Constantinescu</surname><given-names>Stefan N</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100005026</institution-id><institution>Stichting Tegen Kanker</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Constantinescu</surname><given-names>Stefan N</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100005041</institution-id><institution>Catholic University of Louvain</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Salus Sanguinis</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Constantinescu</surname><given-names>Stefan N</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Les avions de Sébastien</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Constantinescu</surname><given-names>Stefan N</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund8"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Action de recherche concertée</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>16/21-073</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Constantinescu</surname><given-names>Stefan N</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund9"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100022434</institution-id><institution>Walloon Excellence in Lifesciences and Biotechnology</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>F 44/8/5 - MCF/UIG - 10955</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Constantinescu</surname><given-names>Stefan N</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund10"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000888</institution-id><institution>W.

Their activation induces long-lasting genetic effects by activation of transcription factors via their pre-bound cytosolic Janus kinases. The thrombopoietin (Tpo) receptor (c-Mpl or TpoR) and its ligand Tpo are the main regulators of megakaryocyte differentiation and platelet production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kaushansky et al., 1994</xref>). Besides these regulatory roles, TpoR functions in early hematopoiesis by promoting self-renewal, expansion, and maintenance of the hematopoietic stem cell pool (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Qian et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Solar et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Yoshihara et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fox et al., 2002</xref>).</p><p>TpoR is a type 1 member of the cytokine receptor superfamily that also includes the erythropoietin receptor (EpoR), growth hormone receptor (GHR), granulocyte-colony stimulating factor receptor (G-CSFR), and prolactin receptor (PrlR). These receptors consist of two identical chains and function as homodimers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Watowich et al., 1996</xref>). They almost exclusively employ the Janus kinase JAK2, which is prebound to the cytosolic domain of the receptor. JAK2 contains both an activating kinase domain (JH1) and a pseudokinase domain (JH2). The JH2 domain exerts inhibitory effects on the JH1 kinase domain and is required for cytokine-induced activation of the kinase domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bandaranayake et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Ungureanu et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Saharinen et al., 2000</xref>). Upon activation, Y1007 and Y1008 in the kinase activation loop are trans-phosphorylated, which switches on the kinase activity and allows phosphorylation of other sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Feng et al., 1997</xref>).</p><p>A fraction of EpoR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Constantinescu et al., 2001b</xref>), GHR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Yang et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brooks et al., 2014</xref>), gp130 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Tenhumberg et al., 2006</xref>), and PrlR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Qazi et al., 2006</xref>) is believed to exist as ligand-independent preformed dimers. Ligand binding induces a conformational change in the receptor that is coupled to a change in the orientation and possibly structure of the cytosolic juxtamembrane (JM) domain and which is transmitted to the intracellular JAK2 proteins. The mechanism of this coupling is at the heart of how these receptors transduce cellular signals. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brooks et al., 2014</xref> have proposed a mechanism of GHR activation involving a transition of the dimeric transmembrane (TM) domain from a parallel orientation of the two TM helices to a left-handed coiled coil geometry that results in the separation of the inhibitory JH2 domain of one JAK2 from the JH1 kinase domain of the other. These studies emphasize the importance of the rotational orientation and tilt angles of TM helices in transmitting signals across cell membranes. The relative orientation and tilt of TM helices are often modulated by extracellular signals in polytopic membrane proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hall et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Ren et al., 2016</xref>) and in a fashion similar to the cytokine receptors, the rotational orientation of the single pass receptor tyrosine kinases controls receptor signaling by altering the structure and membrane interactions of the juxtamembrane sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bell et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">McLaughlin et al., 2005</xref>).</p><p>The human TpoR (hTpoR) differs from the other type 1 cytokine receptors in several respects. First, the TM domains of hTpoR do not readily dimerize in an inactive receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Defour et al., 2013</xref>). Rather, ligand binding induces dimerization of the receptor in an active conformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Wilmes et al., 2020</xref>). We have engineered receptor dimers of TpoR using either the dimerization domain of Put3 in the murine TpoR (mTpoR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Staerk et al., 2011</xref>) or by specific asparagine (Asn) substitutions within the TM domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Leroy et al., 2016</xref>). Results from the engineered Put3 coiled coil dimers suggest there is one inactive orientation of the TM helices and several orientations that lead to different signaling outputs. The observation of active and inactive orientations of the hTpoR TM helices has also been reported with the use of cysteine cross-linking and alanine-scanning mutagenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Matthews et al., 2011</xref>). More recently, we have explored the use of Asn-scanning mutagenesis to modulate the orientation of the TM helices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Leroy et al., 2016</xref>). Asn induces hydrogen bonding between the Asn residues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Choma et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Zhou et al., 2000</xref>) and dimerization of cytokine type I receptors TMD, as TpoR, EpoR or G-CSFR, leading to signaling in the absence of ligand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Ding et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Maxson et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Becker et al., 2008</xref>). The striking observation was that when Asn residues are introduced by substitution at different positions, the TM helices in the murine receptor form dimers in various azimuthal orientations, whereas only a single substitution in the human receptor (S505N) results in appreciable activity. The S505N mutation is found in familial forms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Ding et al., 2004</xref>) and in rare sporadic cases of essential thrombocythemia (ET) and primary myelofibrosis (PMF) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Beer et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Ma et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>A second major difference between TpoR and other type 1 cytokine receptors is the presence of a five-residue (K/RWQFP respectively in m/hTpoR) insertion at the cytosolic JM boundary. The most prevalent hTpoR mutations in myeloproliferative neoplasms are within this motif at W515 within this motif (W515L/K/A/R) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Beer et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Pardanani et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Pecquet et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Pikman et al., 2006</xref>). We have shown that W515 and the surrounding residues are required to prevent self-activation of hTpoR as W515 prevents productive dimerization of the upstream TM helices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Defour et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Staerk et al., 2006</xref>). Strikingly, 17 out of the 20 possible amino acids activate hTpoR when introduced at W515, including W515Y/F (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Defour et al., 2016</xref>), indicating a very specific physiological effect of the tryptophan (Trp) indole side chain in maintaining the inactive state of hTpoR.</p><p>In this article, we take advantage of the Asn and Trp mutations as tools to address the mechanism of TpoR activation.

To address this mechanism, we took advantage of TM peptides containing the regulatory JM K/RWQFP motif that is unique to the TpoR. Structurally, the TpoR TM domain can fold into a membrane spanning α-helix independent of the rest of the receptor domains and the effects of mutations within the TM-JM peptide sequence parallel the effects observed upon mutation of the full receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Defour et al., 2013</xref>). For example, the TM-JM peptide sequence corresponding to hTpoR is largely monomeric but is driven into an active dimer conformation with the S505N and W515K mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Defour et al., 2013</xref>). In this section, we use solid-state NMR measurements of mTpoR TM peptides to address the structure of the peptide at the boundary between the hydrophobic TM domain and the KWQFP sequence with the aim of understanding how dimerization induced by the TM S498N and G502N mutations is coupled to structural changes in the JM sequence. We have previously shown that the TM-JM peptides reconstituted into model membrane bilayers composed of DMPC:DMPG are able to replicate the dimerization behavior of the full TpoR wild type and mutant receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Defour et al., 2013</xref>). The negatively charged DMPG provides a net negative charge to the membrane surface that mimics inner bilayer surface of native plasma membranes (see ‘Materials and methods’). The proximity of these mutations to the K/RWQFP motif suggests that they may impact the structure near W508 in mTpoR or W515 in hTpoR, where many mutations trigger activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Defour et al., 2016</xref>). We then address the secondary structure of the dimeric hTpoR TM-JM peptide containing the activating W515K mutation.</p><p>To gain insight into the secondary structure of TpoR TM-JM peptides, we combined solid-state NMR and FTIR. We performed solid-state NMR spectroscopy using peptides containing <sup>13</sup>C-labeled amino acids at specific positions. Assignments were aided by FTIR measurements of the amide I vibration, which reveal that the TM-JM peptides are predominantly α-helical when reconstituted into membrane bilayers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Defour et al., 2013</xref>) without contributions from β-strand or β-sheet secondary structure. It is more challenging to distinguish random coil from α-helix by FTIR due to overlap of the vibrational bands. However, on the basis of the <sup>13</sup>C NMR chemical shift of backbone carbonyl groups, we have previously shown that the α-helix of the TM domain extends into the JM region until at least F510, which is adjacent to P511 of the KWQFP motif (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Staerk et al., 2006</xref>). The <sup>13</sup>C=O NMR chemical shift is sensitive to secondary structure and occurs at ~175 ppm or higher when the <sup>13</sup>C-labeled amino acid is within an α-helix due to direct hydrogen bonding to the i-4 NH group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Saitô et al., 1998</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> presents <sup>13</sup>C NMR spectra of murine and human TpoR TM-JM peptides containing 1-<sup>13</sup>C L505 or 1-<sup>13</sup>C L512, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>).

In the case of the Asn mutants and in the wild-type receptor with bound Tpo, dimerization of hTpoR (or rotation of the TM helices in mTpoR dimer) places W515 in the center of the helix–helix interface.

Structurally, we have undertaken solution-NMR studies in sodium dodecylsulfate (SDS) of the wild-type hTpoR TM-JM peptide and its W515K mutant. Relaxation measurements of the backbone <sup>15</sup>N resonances show that W515K mutation leads to association of the TM helices (as observed in membrane bilayers), and that it induces upfield chemical shift changes in the RWQF sequence consistent with helix unraveling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). Similar results were obtained for the S505N mutant of TpoR (481–520) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brett, 2012</xref>).

The solution NMR studies provide an independent probe of the structure of the region surrounding W515 upon helix dimerization.

Indeed, hTpoR with a helical break at position 519/520 (RWQFP<bold>GP</bold>) constitutively activates the receptor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4e</xref>).

Thus, as predicted by the NMR data on mutant TpoRs carrying upstream oncogenic mutations, loss of α-helicity in the region around and immediately past W515 (i.e. until residue 521, hTpoR nomenclature) can induce TpoR autoactivation. The loss of helical structure must, however, be localized as loss of α-helicity in the region starting six residues downstream of W515 profoundly impairs the function of hTpoR.</p><p>Next, we asked whether activation induced by these Gly-Pro mutants shares the same requirements as the canonical S505N and W515K hTpoR mutations.

The L505 <sup>13</sup>C=O chemical shift was at 176.4 ppm in the A499N construct characteristic of helical secondary structure, but decreased to 174 ppm with the +2 Ala insertion, indicative of localized loss of helical structure, in agreement with activation.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>The W508K mutant can be inactivated by rotation into a single inactive conformation</title><p>We have previously described how mutations of W508 (W515 in hTpoR) can activate the receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Pecquet et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Staerk et al., 2006</xref>). W508 is expected to be located at the membrane boundary and its mutation may be related to the observation that the Asn mutations closer to the membrane boundary have higher activity. To uncouple the effects of rotational orientation and proximity to the membrane surface, we assessed the effect of +2 Ala insertions in the context of the W508K mutation. Strikingly, the +2 Ala insertion exerted strong inhibition on W508K (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5f</xref>), which perfectly fits the orientations determined by cc-TpoR fusions, as the +2 Ala insertion will rotate the W508/515 mutants to the inactive interface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5c</xref>). The +2 Ala insertion inhibited the W508K mTpoR mutants to a higher extent than the S498N and G502N mutants, according to the interface induced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5c</xref>). Importantly, the +2 Ala insertion inhibited hTpoR W515K as well (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5g</xref>). Last but not least, we measured the <sup>13</sup>C=O chemical shift of L512 in the W515K construct of hTpoR sequence with the +2 Ala insertion and detected a downfield chemical shift to 175.6 ppm, indicating that the +2 Ala insertion led to acquisition of helical structure like in the non-mutated TpoR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3g</xref>). In line with the results in mTpoR, the insertion of +2 Ala led to a small but significant decrease in signaling by the constitutively active S505N mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5g</xref>). Thus, rotation of the JM domain by insertion of +2 Ala activates the inactive TpoR A499N, while it decreases signaling by mTpoR S498N and hTpoR S505N, and inhibits the W508/W515 mutants.</p></sec><sec id="s2-8"><title>TpoR transmembrane domain dimerization induces membrane binding of the C-terminal switch region</title><p>TpoR, like other cytokine receptors, binds the JAK2 FERM domain via the region between Box 1 and Box 2 in the cytosolic domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Huang et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Royer et al., 2005</xref>).

Were this model to be valid for TpoR, we would predict that in the inactive state of TpoR WT, this switch residue W529 would be accessible in solution, but upon activation in hTpoR S505N or W515K mutants, this W529 residue would make contact to the membrane or the FERM domain of the other JAK2 molecule, which is very close to the cytosolic leaflet of the plasma membrane. A recent study showed that indeed FERM domain residues interact with the membrane inner leaflet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Wilmes et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>The studies undertaken above show that both the S505N and W515K mutations lead to dimerization in active orientations, although the dimer structures are likely not identical.

We next addressed how receptor unraveling is correlated with JAK2 activation and with the JH1 domains getting into close proximity. The question is whether the increased activity observed with Asn substitutions closer to the membrane surface is correlated with close apposition of the JAK2 JH1 domains.

The latter induces a significant increase in JAK2 JH1 dimerization. We next tested JAK2 JH1 dimerization with the mTpoR W508K or mTpoR A499N mutants in the presence or absence of the +2 Ala insertion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6f</xref>). A499N is an inactive dimer as shown previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Leroy et al., 2016</xref>). It is rendered active by the +2 Ala insertion as already discussed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5e</xref>. In contrast, the W508K mutation in mTpoR leads to higher dimerization of JAK2 JH1 domains, which is reversed by the +2 Ala insertion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6f</xref>). Furthermore, dimerization of JAK2 was not dependent on the kinase activity of JAK2 but on the actual physical proximity of the JH1 domains, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref> using the kinase dead K882D version of JAK2. That the mTpoR W508K mutant induces higher dimerization of the JAK2 JH1 domains compared to that induced by wild-type mTpoR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6f</xref>) was expected, knowing that the murine W508K mutant corresponds to the W515K mutant of hTpoR, which induces ligand-independent receptor dimerization and constitutive STAT5 activation by the luciferase reporter assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5g</xref>). Following this observation, we also show that the inactive W508K+2 Ala mutant induces a lower dimerization of JAK2 JH1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6f</xref>).</p><p>In conclusion, the dimerization signals of JAK2 kinase domains fit well with the functional data in STAT5 transcriptional assays. Of note, in these assays, the rotation induced by the +2 Ala insertion activates the A499N mutant and inactivates the W508K mutant, indicating that such rotations directly impact the next downstream signaling event, which is represented by dimerization and activation of JAK2.</p></sec><sec id="s2-10"><title>A consensus mechanism of activation by TM and JM mutations involves local loosening of restrictions at the intracellular boundary</title><p>The combination of the Ala insertion data and NMR data presented here suggests that the change in rotation and close dimerization of TM helices translate into a local loss of helical structure at the intracellular TM boundary. We propose that this provides greater flexibility in allowing the switch residues of TpoR, especially W529, to contact the JAK2 on the other receptor chain in the dimer and eventually to reorient the bound JAK2 molecules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>).

Activation of GHR was associated by transition from parallel TM domains to a crossed structure of TM domains with increased tilt. The structural basis for such a mechanism is not known. For TpoR, we and others have observed that activation decreases the tilt of TM helices, with active mutants exhibiting more parallel orientations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Leroy et al., 2016</xref>). Thus, the GHR and TpoR adopt opposing TM tilt characteristics. Here we show that several mutations leading to activation of TpoR induce partial loss of the α-helix around the JM K/RWQFP motif, and this is proportional to the proximity to the cytosolic border of the TM Asn substitutions. Thus, for TpoR, the mechanism to achieve separation near the start of the cytosolic domain is a loss of the α-helix, unlike for GHR which adopts a crossed TM dimer structure in an active state. In agreement with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ferrao et al., 2018</xref>, both mechanisms would result in sufficient flexibility to allow binding of receptor switch residues to the F3 domain of the other JAK2 in an active complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>).</p><p>To explore the role of TM rotations, we introduced extra Ala residues before the KWQFP motif in the JM region of the mTpoR. For these mutants, we assessed dimerization of JAK2 fragments and the secondary structure around W508. We show that rotation induced by +2 Ala insertions can inhibit constitutive activity of the Asn and W508K mutants. Using peptides corresponding to the TM-JM regions of TpoR, we show here that oncogenic mutants S498N and G502N in mouse, and W515K in human (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Leroy et al., 2016</xref>), exhibit local loss of α-helicity around the K/RWQFP motif (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Interestingly, the +2 Ala insertion also exhibits a partial loss of secondary structure around the K/RWQFP motif compared to the wild type sequence, possibly explaining the weakly activating phenotype of +2 Ala insertion on TpoR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5d</xref>). Reversal of activation of hTpoR W515K by the +2 Ala insertion correlates well with restoration of α-helical structure in this double mutant around W515 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>).</p><p>Noteworthy, the A499N mutant, which adopts an inactive dimeric configuration, can be activated by the rotation imposed by the +2 Ala insertion, supporting the notion that activation by TM and JM mutations requires dimerization and rotation.</p><p>Our data show that proximity and orientation of the TM domains are both required for activation of the TpoR. Single amino acid substitutions in the TM domains with Asn induce an increasingly important loss of α-helicity in the JM helix as these substitutions edge closer to the cytosolic domain of the receptor. The unraveling of the JM helices coincides with activation, but only if the register of the helices where the Asn substitutions are introduced matches the steric rotational constraints for proper assembly of the JH1 kinase domains of the JAK2 molecules that are bound downstream of the receptor chain. Thus, activation is controlled by liberation of JAK2 constraints by partial unraveling of JM helices, leading to a precise reconfiguration of JAK2 domains and allowing phosphorylation of the activation loop Y1007 by the opposite JAK2.</p><p>As JAK proteins are composed of four different domains, one can assume that the different domains of JAK2 can fulfill different functions regarding the receptor/JAK2-complex activation. It is not known whether only the FERM domain or also either the pseudokinase, the kinase, or the SH2 domain of JAK2 might be linked to receptor unraveling. Hydrophobic sequences of the ‘switch’ motif at the outset of Box 1 in TpoR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Constantinescu et al., 2001a</xref>) would be good candidates for interaction with the kinase or pseudokinase domain in an inactive receptor/JAK complex and possibly interaction with the FERM domain in the active configuration. Recently, using X-ray crystallography on segments of JAK2 and cytosolic domains of cytokine receptors, it was shown that the W residues of the switch motifs in the erythropoietin and leptin receptors may interact with the FERM domain of the JAK2 appended to the other receptor monomer, thus presumably favoring activation via formation of a cross-structure where one receptor binds two JAKs, one via a constitutive F2 binding and the other via the activation-induced binding of switch residues to F3, where F2 and F3 refer to subdomains of the FERM domain, respectively, an acyl CoA-binding protein-like domain (F2) and a Pleckstrin Homology (PH)-like fold (F3) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ferrao et al., 2018</xref>). In this model, the switch residues have an important contribution to bridging the receptor-JAK2 into active dimers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ferrao et al., 2018</xref>), in agreement with the original model we proposed for switch residues, which act in a distinct way from the residues that recruit JAK2 to the receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Huang et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Constantinescu et al., 2001a</xref>). While Box 1 was defined as proline-rich sequences (PXXPXP) that may include the hydrophobic switch residues, recent structural work argue that while the PXXPXP motif binds F2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Wallweber et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Zhang et al., 2016</xref>), the upstream switch residues bind F3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ferrao et al., 2018</xref>), thus targeting distinct regions of JAK2 and suggesting that they fulfill different functions as distinct motifs.</p><p>Loss of the α-helix between the TpoR TM domain and Box 1 would allow this cross configuration with the switch residue W529 interacting in the membrane with the F3 FERM domain of the JAK2 in trans. Results of our INEPT NMR experiment agree with a loss of rigidity upon activation. Localized loss of α-helicity in the cytosolic JM domain and significant conformational change around switch residue W529 are likely to trigger the liberation of the kinase domains of JAK2 from physical sequestration by the pseudokinase and FERM domains. More experiments are needed to determine whether this process is asymmetric with respect to which receptor and which JAK2 initiate activation, depending on which receptor subunit unravels first. Also, more investigation is required before concluding that such unraveling may occur for receptors such as EpoR or TpoR in complexes with the myeloproliferative neoplasm-prevalent JAK2 V617F mutant, for which a dimeric model structure was recently obtained (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Glassman et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p>There are precedents for secondary structure changes of cytosolic JM regions in membrane receptors. A mutated Neu (HER2) receptor tyrosine kinase in breast cancer was shown to exhibit a change from random coil to helix when compared to WT HER2, leading to activation of the intrinsic kinase domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Matsushita et al., 2013</xref>). Random coil structure in the JM region was found to bind the lipid headgroups of the inner leaflet of the membrane and hold the receptor in an inactive conformation. Also, the bacterial DesK TM receptor contains in its cytosolic region a catalytic domain that functions as a phosphatase or a kinase according to the temperature. Kinase function was associated with helical structure and phosphatase function with random coil structure induced by interaction with the lipids at the inner leaflet of the membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Inda et al., 2014</xref>). The sequence of DesK is charged and contains both positive and negative charges, the former are required for binding to the negative charges of lipids. Mutation of positive charges to Ala results in constitutive helical structure and kinase activity at low temperature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Inda et al., 2014</xref>). In contrast, our results show that the cytosolic JM domain of a cytokine receptor switches from helical in the inactive state into random coil and membrane lipid bound in the active state. This switch is associated to interaction with lipids and is likely to liberate JAK2 proteins from a relative position that is inactive into an active position. Our model is compatible to the model of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brooks et al., 2014</xref> where flexibility of the cytosolic domain leads to JAK2 activation, while we show that this is localized, and we delineate the borders of this region that loses helicity. Our results are also compatible with the model proposed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Wilmes et al., 2020</xref> where monomeric TpoR needs to be dimerized for activation. This model fits with our recent results showing that JAK2 V617F can induce close apposition of the cytosolic domains of cytokine receptors, such as EpoR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Leroy et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>While our previous data and this study suggest that the small molecule agonist eltrombopag used in the clinics to activate TpoR also dimerizes the TM domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Leroy et al., 2016</xref>) and leads to unraveling of the cytosolic JM region, an important question is whether this local loss of α-helicity around the JM RWQFP motif is also required for the physiological activation by cytokine. Tpo is predicted to impose a massive re-orientation of the extracellular domains, and it is possible that a dimeric configuration leading to JAK2 activation can be adopted without close contacts between TM domains. Of note, Tpo is able to weakly activate the mTpoR A499N inactive pre-formed dimer. This observation suggests that extracellular domain re-configuration can overwhelm the stabilizing interactions between TM domains.</p><p>Since the +2 Ala insertion rotating the JM helix by +206° inhibits pathogenic W515K mutants, our data open the way for the possibility that extracellular proteins such as antibodies, nanobodies, or diabodies could re-configure the pathological receptor dimerization and inhibit pathological activation by Asn or W515X mutations in myeloproliferative neoplasms. Recently, diabodies targeting the extracellular domain of EpoR were identified that maintain the receptor monomers at distances compatible with weak activation of WT JAK2 but induce inactivation of JAK2 V617F-bound EpoR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Moraga et al., 2015</xref>). A similar functional effect was recently described for diabodies targeting the extracellular domain of TpoR; however, no structural data exist for the precise dimeric interface(s) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cui et al., 2021</xref>). These data suggest nevertheless that reconfiguring the extracellular domain of cytokine receptor mutants might have therapeutic significance.</p><p>Finally, our data build on the rich literature regarding the role of tryptophan at the membrane–water interface. Tryptophan has two unique properties that form the basis of its structural and functional roles in proteins. First, the side chain has both strong hydrophobic and hydrophilic character as a result of the aromatic rings and NH functional group of its indole side chain. In membrane proteins, the side chain is localized to the head-group region of the bilayer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Yau et al., 1998</xref>). This unique character of the side chain is elegantly exhibited in studies by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Braun and von Heijne, 1999</xref>, who found that Trp, but not Phe, pulls model TM helices toward the lipid–water interface. The strong partial negative charge resulting from the aromatic ring current on the face of the indole side chain is often found associated with basic amino acids. These cation-π interactions are an essential for partitioning of positively charged residues into the membrane bilayer in antimicrobial peptides. The interaction of R414 and W515 in the RWQFP motif allows this region to adopt helical secondary structure at the end of the TpoR TM helix. The second unique property of the tryptophan side chain is its large size, which is not easily tolerated in the well-packed interior of proteins. When found in the interior of membrane proteins, tryptophan is stabilized by a number of specific interactions that reflect its dual hydrophobic–hydrophilic character. For example, a highly conserved tryptophan plays a unique role in G protein-coupled receptors for controlling helix unraveling that is associated with receptor activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Pope et al., 2020</xref>). In the TpoR, activation results in the rotation of Trp515 into the helical interface of the TM dimer, where it is not tolerated due to steric interactions. Together these studies provide insights into why Trp is unique within the RWQFP motif and why mutations to other amino acids lead to constitutive receptor activity.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s3-1"><title>Plasmid constructs</title><p>The murine and human TpoR wild types (WT), the Asn substitution, and Ala insertion mutant constructs were subcloned into pMX-IRES-GFP as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Staerk et al., 2006</xref>).

These cells were spin infected with 300 µL concentrated VSV-G pseudo-typed retroviral supernatant expressing mTpoR WT or mutants, obtained as previously described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Pecquet et al., 2010</xref>. 10<sup>6</sup> infected cells were then injected intravenously in lethally irradiated female mice aged between 6 and 8 weeks old. After bleeding, red blood cell (RBC), platelets, white blood cells (WBC), and neutrophils were measured using an MS9 blood cell counter at day 40 post-transplantation. GFP was checked at multiple time points to evaluate chimerism. For histological and morphological analysis, mice were sacrificed after bleeding at day 40 post-transplantation. Slides were analyzed with CaseViewer 2.4 (3DHISTECH Ltd.). This work was approved by the Ethics Committee for Animal Experimentation of the Université catholique de Louvain under the reference 2019/UCL/MD/026 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-7"><title>Solid-state NMR spectroscopy</title><p>For solid-state NMR studies on TpoR peptides reconstituted into model membrane bilayers, 44 residue peptides corresponding to the TM domain and JM regions of TpoR were synthesized using solid-phase methods. The sequence for human TpoR was RRRETAWISLVTALHLVLGLSAVLGLLLLRWQFPAHYRRLRHALWPS-NH<sub>2</sub>, while the sequence for the murine TpoR was RRRETAWITLVTALLLVLSLSALLGLLLLKWQFPAHYRRLRHALWPS-NH<sub>2</sub>. Both peptides contained C-terminal carboxy amide protecting groups. The peptides included three non-native Arg at the N-terminus for peptide solubility and to terminate both ends of peptide with positive charges (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>). The crude peptide (5–15 mg) was purified by reverse-phase HPLC on a C4 column using gradient elution and reconstituted by detergent dialysis using DMPC and DMPG (10:3) and an ~1:60 peptide to lipid ratio. Lipids were obtained from Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, AL) as lyophilized powders and used without further purification. The DMPC, DMPG lipids with 14-carbon chains roughly match the hydrophobic thickness of typical cell membranes, while DMPG introduces a net negative charge. This lipid mixture has previously been used to demonstrate that the TM-JM peptides mimic the dimerization behavior of the full-length receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Defour et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Tang et al., 2019</xref>), in which the wild-type human TpoR receptor is monomeric while the W515K and S505N receptors are dimeric. Magic angle spinning NMR experiments were performed at a <sup>13</sup>C frequency of 125 MHz on a Bruker AVANCE spectrometer. The MAS spinning rate was set to 9–11 KHz (±5 Hz). The ramped amplitude cross-polarization contact time was 2 ms. Two-pulse phase-modulated decoupling was used during the evolution and acquisition periods with a radiofrequency field strength of 80 kHz. The sample temperature was maintained at 198 K (±2 K).</p><p>The INEPT pulse sequence was used to address membrane binding in the JM region of the TM-JM peptides of hTpoR as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Matsushita et al., 2013</xref>). INEPT spectra were obtained at 37°C using hTpoR reconstituted into DMPC:PG bilayers. hTpoR peptides were U-<sup>13</sup>C labeled at W529 at the C-terminus of the switch region.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s4"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf2"><p>is co-founder of MyeloPro Diagnostics and Research GmbH, Vienna, Austria</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Validation, Investigation, Methodology, Writing – original draft</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Validation, Investigation, Methodology, Writing – original draft</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Conceptualization, Validation, Investigation, Writing – original draft</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Conceptualization, Validation, Investigation, Writing – original draft</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Data curation, Validation, Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Data curation, Software, Formal analysis, Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con8"><p>Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con9"><p>Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con10"><p>Conceptualization, Validation, Investigation, Writing – original draft</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con11"><p>Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con12"><p>Supervision, Validation, Investigation, Methodology, Writing – original draft</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con13"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Validation, Methodology, Writing – original draft</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>This work was approved by the Ethics Committee for Animal Experimentation of the Université catholique de Louvain under the reference 2019/UCL/MD/026 .

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Jonathan Cooper as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>All reviewers are enthusiastic about the choice of problem and feel that the data presented, including the biological data, and the writing is of high quality. However, there is a strong feeling that additional data must be provided concerning the role and impact of W515 to further establish helix unwinding and its role in receptor activation. It is likely that new experiments will be necessary.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) There is one major shortcoming in this manuscript, which concerns W515. It is known that mutation of W515 to any of 17 of the canonical amino acids, including Phe, is sufficient to trigger homodimerization and receptor activation. The authors present some evidence that the phenomenon behind this is that mutation of W515 to almost any other residues disrupts the helical secondary structure of the critical juxtamembrane segment, which promotes dimerization and receptor activation. What is puzzling is why a Trp at site 515 promotes helix formation, but nearly all other amino acids at this site disrupt helix formation. This strongly suggests the side chain of W515 must be interacting with another domain of the protein in the inactive state, in a manner that is responsible for how Trp stabilizes the juxtamembrane helix which is a central feature that helps define that state. This dangling missing piece of their mechanistic model should be resolved. Perhaps REDOR measurements could be performed to accomplish this goal.</p><p>2) While the solid state data is of very high quality, establishing clear differences between wild-type and mutants, there remains some concern about the unwinding of the helix with mutations, established on the basis of a single CO probe at a specific site.

Your revised article has been evaluated by Jonathan Cooper (Senior Editor) and a Reviewing Editor.</p><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed, as outlined below:</p><p>The reviewers indicate that the SDS micelle data is problematic, likely resulting from the fact that SDS is not a good membrane mimic. Prior to publication this important point should be addressed.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The revised version of the manuscript has been significantly improved to address all previous concerns, including the provision of new data. I have no further recommendations to the authors. Nice paper!</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>While the authors addressed most of my critiques, the new solution NMR data included in the manuscript supporting the helical unwinding model are problematic. The authors choose a substandard membrane-mimicking system. SDS micelles are notorious for perturbing the structures of both soluble and membrane-bound proteins. Also, it is unclear if the chemical shift changes in micelles support the sparse chemical shift changes measured in lipid membranes. In Figure 3 suppl. 1, the W515K mutation seems to induce helicity for residues 501-509, while the remaining residues show slight unwinding. Again, these inconsistencies might be caused by the SDS micelles.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>I have significant concerns about the new solution NMR data intended on addressing the reviewers' concern about the mechanism of activation.</p><p>1. The carbonyl chemical shift data in lipids and micelles (new data since original submission) on the same samples are in apparent contradiction. In figure 3 (panels e and f), WT – W515K would give a positive carbonyl chemical shift by ~2 ppm. However, in figure 3 supplement 1, the same difference gives a negative carbonyl chemical shift of ~0.5 ppm for the same residue (L512). Further, the trend from the solution NMR data indicates that the W515K mutant induces helicity (weakly) within the region around W515.</p><p>2. The solution NMR data are performed in SDS micelles, which is essentially an invalidated membrane mimic for studying membrane protein structures. Taken together with point #1, it is a significant cause for concern this environment is reporting on something biologically significant.</p><p>3. The authors included the Materials and methods with the figure legends. Within this is a materials and method section that includes &quot;structural restraints and structure calculation&quot; of the TM dimer; however, they do not show data or structures or discuss this in the text.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.81521.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) There is one major shortcoming in this manuscript, which concerns W515.

More broadly, our studies over the past decade have sought to address the importance of the entire RWQFP insert in the TM domain. Our working model for this sequence has been that cation-π interactions are central to the role of the Trp and the accompanying amino acids.</p><p>Arginine and tryptophan both are over-represented at the cytoplasmic TM-JM boundaries of membrane proteins. Arginine is positively charged and part of the “positive-inside” rule for membrane protein insertion. Arginine and lysine define the cytoplasmic ends of TM helices and prefer to be accessible to the water-exposed membrane surface. In contrast, tryptophan residues prefer hydrophobic head-group or membrane interior locations. A revealing aspect of the RWQFP motif is that the arginine and tryptophan are located at the membrane to cytosolic border. As a result, in order to accommodate arginine in a more water-inaccessible membrane environment, it interacts with the surface of the tryptophan indole ring. Partitioning of the RWQF sequence in a more water-inaccessible environment also drives the formation of helical secondary structure as an unpaired backbone C=O…NH in a hydrophobic environment is estimated to cost 3-6 kcal/mol of energy.</p><p>We have taken two approaches in respond to this essential criticism of the reviewers: one structural and one computational. Additional NMR data (structural approach) has been included in the supporting information (see response to point 2 below). Computational approaches provide a second way to address whether a cation–π interaction between Trp515 and the positively charged Arg514 is responsible for stabilizing the C-terminal TM helix. We have included a new supporting figure using Α-Fold 2.0 that probes the structural changes upon mutation of Trp515. In the wild-type receptor, Arg514 is predicted to form a cation–π interaction with Trp515. In the W515K mutant, the helical secondary structure in the RKQFP sequence is disrupted and Arg514 forms a new cation–π interaction with Trp529. Similar changes occur in other Trp515 mutants (e.g. W515A) highlighting the ability of Α-Fold to predict such interactions and the consequences of mutation. Overall, 15 out of 19 W515X mutants are predicted to be unfolded. Experimentally, 17 out of 19 mutations lead to activation. Importantly, W515C and W515P are the only two amino acid substitutions that do <italic>not</italic> cause constitutive activity experimentally (Defour, Chachoua, Pecquet, and Constantinescu, 2016). Computationally, these two sites do <italic>not</italic> predict helix unraveling. In short, the overall predictions of Α-Fold agree with the unique nature of tryptophan at position 515.</p><p>In addition, we have expanded the arguments supporting the potential role of cation–π interactions by adding a new section entitled “Unfolding of the RWQF α-helical motif is a common mechanism of receptor activation”.</p><p>These modifications are now in the revised manuscript starting with line 213:</p><p>“Our working model for the mechanism of activation in the wild-type or mutant receptors is that the RWQF motif is stabilized in the inactive state as an α-helix as a result of a cation-π interaction between R514 and W515. This interaction allows the RWQF sequence to partition into the more hydrophobic head-group region of the bilayer. Both Arg and Trp are over-represented at the cytoplasmic ends of TM helices (von Heijne, 1992), but whereas Arg prefers a water-accessible environment, Trp prefers to be buried in a more hydrophobic environment (Yau, Wimley, Gawrisch, and White, 1998). Since Arg and Trp are located at the border between membrane and cytosolic domains and Arg precedes Trp in the sequence, partitioning into the membrane head-group region results in a favorable interaction of the positive charge associated with the guanidinium group of the R514 side chain with the partial negative charge associated with the aromatic surface of the W515 side chain. Partitioning of the RWQF sequence into the more water-inaccessible environment drives the formation of helical secondary structure as an unpaired backbone C=O…NH in a hydrophobic environment is estimated to cost 6 kcal/mol of energy (Engelman, Steitz, and Goldman, 1986).</p><p>In this model, activation of the receptor results in or is caused by disruption of the R514-W515 cation-π interaction. In the W515 mutants, R514 is no longer stabilized in a membrane environment and the helix containing the RWQFP sequence unravels to allow the positively charged side chain to reach outside of the membrane. In the case of the Asn mutants and in the wild-type receptor with bound Tpo, dimerization of hTpoR (or rotation of the TM helices in mTpoR dimer), places W515 in the center of the helix-helix interface. The data suggest that a steric clash of the W515 side chains results in unraveling of the cytoplasmic end of the TM helix.</p><p>Computational and additional NMR data are provided in the supplementary figures to support the model of helix unraveling suggested by the solid-state NMR studies. Computationally, we used AlphaFold 2.0 (Jumper et al., 2021) calculations of hTpoR TM-JM peptides to predict the influence of all possible mutations at position 515 on the TM-JM helix structure. Remarkably, α-helix unraveling was predicted for 15 out of 20 possible amino acids at 515 (supplement 2 to Figure 3). Importantly, two of the mutations that are not predicted to cause helix unraveling are W515C and W515P. Experimentally, these two amino acid substitutions are the only ones that do not induce constitutive activity among all possible amino acid substitutions at W515 (Defour et al., 2016). Introducing a Trp at the preceding position 514 instead of R/K in W515K/R mutants reverses helix unfolding in AlphaFold simulations (supplement 3 to Figure 3). This result agrees with our previous data that the WRQFP mutant is inactive and is essentially monomeric (J. P. Defour et al., 2013).</p><p>Structurally, we have undertaken solution-NMR studies of the wild-type hTpoR TM-JM peptide and its W515K mutant. Relaxation measurements of the backbone <sup>15</sup>N resonances show that W515K mutation leads to association of the TM helices, and that it induces upfield chemical shift changes in the RWQF sequence consistent with helix unraveling (supplement 1 to Figure 3).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) While the solid state data is of very high quality, establishing clear differences between wild-type and mutants, there remains some concern about the unwinding of the helix with mutations, established on the basis of a single CO probe at a specific site. Additional experimental (NMR) confirmation of this effect, perhaps using additional nuclei or additional residues as probes, or preferably both, should be presented.</p></disp-quote><p>Solid-state NMR spectroscopy has the advantage of allowing measurements of the TM-JM domains of the membrane receptors in membrane environments. The membrane bilayer can have a direct influence on protein structure and correspondingly on the mechanism of receptor activation. Two aspects of the TM-JM structures that are important in such systems are dimerization and interactions of JM residues with the lipid head-groups. We have shown in previous studies on the TpoR that peptides corresponding to the TM-JM region can reproduce the dimerization behavior observed with full receptors and receptor mutants (J.-P. Defour et al., 2013). In the TpoR, the TM-JM peptides provide clear links between dimerization and changes in the RWQFP region and switch region. That is, the “dimerization switch” appears to be contained in the residues in this limited region.</p><p>To address the reviewer concern that the NMR data reporting on a single <sup>13</sup>C probe is too limited, we have included a comparison of wild-type and W515K TpoR constructs using solution NMR spectroscopy in Supplement 2 to Figure 3<italic>.</italic> The solution NMR studies on the wild-type TM-JM peptides and the W515K mutant show that mutation leads to dimerization (as reflection in a change in NMR correlation times), and also leads to a change in the chemical shifts in the RWQFP region consistent with the solid-state NMR data. The solution NMR studies have the advantage of probing the entire TM-JM structure, and provide complementary support to helix unraveling induced by dimerization in an active orientation of the TM-JM peptides. Our overall strategy has been to extend the solution NMR studies to larger TpoR constructs (i.e. constructs that include the cytoplasmic domains of the receptor), but these studies are beyond the scope of this manuscript.</p><p>The text has been changed at Line 213 as indicated above.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>– Perhaps this work could be supported through additional predictions with alphafold or the like.

We have previously determined through FTIR measurements that the TM-JM peptides adopt α-helical structure without β-sheet or β-strand contributions. The helical structure is more difficult to deconvolute from random coil with this type of analysis. However, the <sup>13</sup>C=O chemical shift is diagnostic of the helix-coil transition due to the large change in hydrogen-bonding. McDermott and co-workers showed a nice correlation between the sigma22 component of the chemical shift for <sup>13</sup>C=O groups and hydrogen bonding strength derived from small molecule crystal structures and FTIR measurements (Gu, Zambrano, and McDermott, 1994). For this manuscript, we sought to present a single (simple) marker in a large number of mutants and to determine if there was a correlation with activity of the full-length receptor. In parallel studies we have been using solution NMR to obtain assignments and constraints on these peptides in detergent. We have included a comparison of the WT and W515K TM-JM peptides that arrives at the same conclusions as for the solid-state NMR studies. We have also reworded this section referenced above as follows.</p><p>Revised text added at page 8 line 183:</p><p>“To gain insight into the secondary structure of TpoR TM-JM peptides we combined solid state NMR and FTIR. We performed solid-state NMR spectroscopy using peptides containing <sup>13</sup>C-labeled amino acids at specific positions. Assignments were aided by FTIR measurements of the amide I vibration which reveal that the TM-JM peptides are predominantly a-helical when reconstituted into membrane bilayers (J. P. Defour et al., 2013) without contributions from b-strand or b-sheet secondary structure. It is more challenging to distinguish random coil from α-helix by FTIR due to overlap of the vibrational bands. However, on the basis of the <sup>13</sup>C NMR chemical shift of backbone carbonyl groups, we have previously shown that the α-helix of the TM domain extends into the JM region until at least F510, which is adjacent to P511 of the KWQFP motif (reference Staerk et al. 2006, Blood 107, 1864). The <sup>13</sup>C=O NMR chemical shift is sensitive to secondary structure and occurs at ~175 ppm or higher when the <sup>13</sup>C-labeled amino acid is within an α-helix due to direct hydrogen bonding to the i-4 NH group (Saitô, Tuzi, and Naito, 1998).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Line 188: &quot;equivalent to L508 in mTpoR&quot;; should be L505?</p></disp-quote><p>Indeed, we thank the reviewer for this correction.

Prior to publication this important point should be addressed.</p></disp-quote><p>There were two major concerns from the reviewers 2 and 3 concerning the solution NMR data that are now addressed and incorporated into the revised manuscript. The first was the inconsistency between the solution and solid-state NMR data. This came from our error in labeling panel &quot;d&quot; of Suppl Figure 1 of Figure 3, data in panel &quot;d&quot; are representing chemical shifts of W515K versus wild type (WT) TpoR, while in the legend and on the panel the label was incorrectly TpoR WT versus W515K. We apologize for this error. The second was that SDS is a detergent and a sub-standard membrane mimic. We have shown that SDS allowed us to reproduce the ability of W515K to induce dimerization of WT TpoR (which is a monomer). The behaviors of WT TpoR as monomer and TpoR W515K as dimer were established by us in previous papers both in membrane environment (Leroy, Defour et al. 2016) as well as in detergent micelles (dodecylphosphocholine, DPC) (Defour, Itaya et al. 2013). SDS allowed us to observe the same dimerization as in membrane environment, and allowed us to obtain higher resolution spectra than in DPC micelles. We then show that in dimerizing conditions W515K induces unraveling of the TpoR sequence encompassing residues 514-517. We thank the reviewer for the concern because this made us realize that we did not emphasize enough an important point: W515 or S505N mutations induce unraveling because they induce dimerization of the transmembrane domains. This has been shown by us in two previous publications using analytical ultracentrifugation, infrared spectroscopy, solid-state NMR and the environment was DMPC:DMPG, a more physiological environment than SDS. We stress this point now at page 10.</p><p>We added at Results page 8 the following sentence line 174:</p><p>&quot;We have previously shown that the TM-JM peptides reconstituted into model membrane bilayers composed of DMPC:DMPG are able to replicate the dimerization behavior of the full TpoR wild-type and mutant receptors (21). The negatively charged DMPG provides a net negative charge to the membrane surface that mimics inner bilayer surface of native plasma membranes (see Methods).&quot;</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>While the authors addressed most of my critiques, the new solution NMR data included in the manuscript supporting the helical unwinding model are problematic. The authors choose a substandard membrane-mimicking system. SDS micelles are notorious for perturbing the structures of both soluble and membrane-bound proteins. Also, it is unclear if the chemical shift changes in micelles support the sparse chemical shift changes measured in lipid membranes. In Figure 3 suppl. 1, the W515K mutation seems to induce helicity for residues 501-509, while the remaining residues show slight unwinding. Again, these inconsistencies might be caused by the SDS micelles.</p></disp-quote><p>The plotted data in panel &quot;d&quot; of Supplemental Figure 1 of Figure 3 are the differences of W515K compared to the WT chemical shifts. The data are consistent between solution NMR and solid-state NMR in that both exhibit upfield chemical shifts in the W515K mutant compared to the WT sequence. The label of the panel and the figure legend have been revised as follows to clarify this point. We are sorry for the error/wording in our earlier version that led to the apparent discrepancy, which is not real.</p><p>Specifically, we have added the following sentences to the Figure Legend.</p><p>“The ability of the W515K peptide to dimerize in SDS micelles compared to the wild-type sequence mimics the observation of dimerization in membrane bilayers (21, 24).” (page 35, line 1000)</p><p>“The negative chemical shift differences indicate a lower frequency for the W515K mutant compared to wild-type. The upfield chemical shifts in the W515K mutant from Leu511 to the C-terminus are consistent with the carbonyl chemical shifts observed in the solid-state NMR resonances at Leu512 and are interpreted as unraveling of the C-terminus upon dimerization. The chemical shift difference at position 512 of -0.5 ppm in the solution NMR measurements is smaller than the difference in the solid-state NMR measurements of approximately -3 ppm.” (page 36, line 1003)</p><p>We also added at page 10, lane 239</p><p>“Structurally, we have undertaken solution-NMR studies in sodium dodecylsulfate (SDS) of the wild-type hTpoR TM-JM peptide and its W515K mutant.

Similar results were obtained for the S505N mutant of TpoR (481-520) (45).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>I have significant concerns about the new solution NMR data intended on addressing the reviewers' concern about the mechanism of activation.</p><p>1. The carbonyl chemical shift data in lipids and micelles (new data since original submission) on the same samples are in apparent contradiction. In figure 3 (panels e and f), WT – W515K would give a positive carbonyl chemical shift by ~2 ppm. However, in figure 3 supplement 1, the same difference gives a negative carbonyl chemical shift of ~0.5 ppm for the same residue (L512). Further, the trend from the solution NMR data indicates that the W515K mutant induces helicity (weakly) within the region around W515.</p><p>2. The solution NMR data are performed in SDS micelles, which is essentially an invalidated membrane mimic for studying membrane protein structures. Taken together with point #1, it is a significant cause for concern this environment is reporting on something biologically significant.</p></disp-quote><p>We expand below our arguments for the use of SDS in the solution NMR experiments as support for the solid-state NMR measurements. We recognize that detergent micelles do not have the same physical properties as membrane bilayers. Our structural studies on TpoR over the past decade have been almost exclusively in cell membranes or in model membrane bilayers, so we fully understand the concern. Despite their differences, both detergents and membrane bilayers induce helical structure in the hydrophobic transmembrane portion of single membrane-spanning sequences. The reason is that both detergents and membranes exclude water from the backbone amide groups of the sequence. In the absence of water, helix formation is favored via intra-helical hydrogen-bonding of these groups. Nevertheless, a key criterion for us as to whether detergents are able to “mimic” membrane bilayers is whether they are able to reproduce the ability of the transmembrane helices to associate in a biologically relevant manner, that is for example in the case of TpoR to reproduce the dimerization induced by W515K in TpoR TM domains that we reported with DMPC:DMPG and was validated by cell biological assays in our previous papers for the full length TpoR.</p><p>An important observation in this regard is that the human wild-type TpoR sequence is monomeric in cell membranes and dimerizes upon ligand binding (Leroy, Defour et al. 2016). Importantly, the receptor dimerizes due to the activating mutations at Ser505 and Trp515 (Leroy, Defour et al. 2016). As a result, there are basically two reasons for selecting SDS as the detergent for our solution NMR studies. The first is that SDS environment reproduces the dimerization behavior of the W515K mutant compared to the wild-type peptide/protein, which exists as a monomer. We had previously shown that both the W515K and S505N transmembrane sequences induced dimerization in membrane bilayers (DMPC:DMPG) and in detergent micelles (dodecylphosphocholine, DPC) (Defour, Itaya et al. 2013). That is, the wild-type TpoR sequence was observed to be monomeric under both detergent and membrane bilayer conditions, while TpoR sequences with activating mutations were dimeric under both conditions.</p><p>The second reason for selecting SDS is that SDS yields slightly higher-resolution spectra of both the monomeric wild-type peptide and the W515K peptide than DPC. For our studies on the TpoR peptides, we screened several different detergents (including isotropic bicelles formed from short and long chain lipids) and found that (perhaps surprisingly) SDS provided the highest resolution spectra exhibiting the expected dimerization of the W515K mutant.</p><p>Our original studies on the dimerization of transmembrane helices traces back to the work on the TM domain of glycophorin A, which was known to dimerize via its TM sequence. These studies were undertaken in both detergent micelles (MacKenzie, Prestegard et al. 1997) and in membrane bilayers (Smith, Song et al. 2001). The measurements yielded similar but not identical dimer interfaces. The major differences related to two characteristics of detergent micelles: they do not have defined planar surfaces (as in bilayers) and they are more permeable to water than bilayers. The result in the case of glycophorin A was that the crossing-angle of the helices was slightly larger and one of the residues within the interface (Thr87) formed different hydrogen bonding contacts (Smith, Eilers et al. 2002). In membranes, the Thr87 side chain formed intermolecular hydrogen bonds (not found in the detergent dimer structure) (Smith, Eilers et al. 2002). This subtle difference was attributed to the larger crossing angle and association of water with Thr87 in micelles. That is, the differences between detergents and membrane bilayers were not large enough to markedly influence the dimerization between TM helices.</p><p>We had not undertaken the solution NMR studies on TpoR in response to the previous review, we had performed these experiments before this manuscript was submitted. Rather these results are part of a series of wider studies investigating the structure and interactions of TpoR. We argued that if the structures of the TM dimer in solution and membranes were the same (or roughly the same), we could use the SDS system to investigate the structures of the folded intracellular domains. For the current studies, we selected a single <sup>13</sup>C probe that could be used in a series of peptides that included the human wild-type sequence, the murine wild-type sequence, several asparagine mutants in both human and mouse, several Trp515 mutants, and alanine insertion mutants. For additional NMR support for unraveling, the comparison of only the wild-type human and W515K mutant (in a completely independent set of measurements) extends the probes to additional <sup>13</sup>C backbone C=O groups encompassing the 514-517 human TpoR insertion sequence (RWQFP or RKQFP). The reasoning (in part) was that this (along with results from the Α-Fold calculations) would be more straightforward for the reader to understand.</p><p>We have revised the text to clarify the points above.</p><p>Page 10, line 239. <italic>Structurally, we have undertaken solution-NMR studies in sodium dodecylsulfate (SDS) of the wild-type hTpoR TM-JM peptide and its W515K mutant. Relaxation measurements of the backbone <sup>15</sup>N resonances show that W515K mutation leads to association of the TM helices (as observed in membrane bilayers), and that it induces upfield chemical shift changes in the RWQF sequence consistent with helix unraveling (supplement 1 to Figure 3). Similar results were obtained for the S505N mutant of TpoR (481-520) (45). We had previously shown that both the W515K and S505N transmembrane sequences induced dimerization in membrane bilayers (DMPC:DMPG) as well as in detergent micelles (dodecylphosphocholine, DPC) (Defour, Itaya et al. 2013). The solution NMR studies provide an independent probe of the structure of the region surrounding W515 upon helix dimerization. These studies show that the transmembrane domain of TpoR is helical in both the wild-type and mutant peptides and that dimerization induced by the W515K mutation results in unraveling of the helix in the RWQF insert region of the peptide.</italic></p><p>Finally reviewer 3 indicated that we included the methods for how the assignments were made in the solution NMR experiments with the figure legends.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3.
