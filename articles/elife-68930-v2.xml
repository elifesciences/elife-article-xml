Here, we found that PRMT5 was expressed at high level in ovarian granulosa cells of growing follicles. Inactivation of <italic>Prmt5</italic> in granulosa cells resulted in aberrant follicle development and female infertility. In <italic>Prmt5-</italic>knockout mice, follicle development was arrested with disorganized granulosa cells in which WT1 expression was dramatically reduced and the expression of steroidogenesis-related genes was significantly increased. The premature differentiated granulosa cells were detached from oocytes and follicle structure was disrupted. Mechanism studies revealed that <italic>Wt1</italic> expression was regulated by PRMT5 at the protein level. PRMT5 facilitated IRES-dependent translation of <italic>Wt1</italic> mRNA by methylating HnRNPA1. Moreover, the upregulation of steroidogenic genes in <italic>Prmt5</italic>-deficient granulosa cells was repressed by <italic>Wt1</italic> overexpression. These results demonstrate that PRMT5 participates in granulosa cell lineage maintenance by inducing <italic>Wt1</italic> expression. Our study uncovers a new role of post-translational arginine methylation in granulosa cell differentiation and follicle development.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Infertility in women can be caused by many factors, such as defects in the ovaries. An important part of the ovaries for fertility are internal structures called follicles, which house early forms of egg cells. A follicle grows and develops until the egg is finally released from the ovary into the fallopian tube, where the egg can then be fertilised. In the follicle, an egg is surrounded by other types of cells, such as granulosa cells. The egg and neighbouring cells must maintain healthy contacts with each other, otherwise the follicle can stop growing and developing, potentially causing infertility.</p><p>The development of a follicle depends on an array of proteins. For example, the transcription factor WT1 controls protein levels by activating other genes and their proteins and is produced in high numbers by granulosa cells at the beginning of follicle development. Although WT1 levels dip towards the later stages of follicle development, insufficient levels can lead to defects. So far, it has been unclear how levels of WT1in granulose cells are regulated.</p><p>Chen, Dong et al. studied mouse follicles to reveal more about the role of WT1 in follicle development. The researchers measured protein levels in mouse granulosa cells as the follicles developed, and discovered elevated levels of PRMT5, a protein needed for egg cells to form and survive in the follicles. Blocking granulosa cells from producing PRMT5 led to abnormal follicles and infertility in mice. Moreover, mice that had been engineered to lack PRMT5 developed abnormal follicles, where the egg and surrounding granulosa cells were not attached to each other, and the granulosa cells had low levels of WT1. Further experiments revealed that PRMT5 controlled WT1 levels by adding small molecules called methyl groups to another regulatory protein called HnRNPA1.</p><p>The addition of methyl groups to genes or their proteins is an important modification that takes place in many processes within a cell. Chen, Dong et al. reveal that this activity also plays a key role in maintaining healthy follicle development in mice, and that PRMT5 is necessary for controlling WT1. Identifying all of the intricate mechanism involved in regulating follicle development is important for finding ways to combat infertility.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>PRMT5</kwd><kwd>ovary</kwd><kwd>granulosa cells</kwd><kwd>Wt1</kwd><kwd>IRES</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Ovary</kwd><kwd>Granulosa cells</kwd><kwd>PRMT5</kwd><kwd><italic>Wt1</italic></kwd><kwd>IRES</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002855</institution-id><institution>Ministry of Science and Technology of the People's Republic of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2018YFC1004200</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chen</surname><given-names>Min</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002855</institution-id><institution>Ministry of Science and Technology of the People's Republic of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2018YFA0107700</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gao</surname><given-names>Fei</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002367</institution-id><institution>Chinese Academy of Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>XDB19000000</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gao</surname><given-names>Fei</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100014219</institution-id><institution>National Science Fund for Distinguished Young Scholars</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>81525011</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gao</surname><given-names>Fei</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>31970785</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gao</surname><given-names>Fei</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>31601193</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gao</surname><given-names>Fei</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>31671496</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gao</surname><given-names>Fei</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>PRMT5 participates in ovarian granulosa cell lineage maintenance by regulating <italic>Wt1</italic> IRES-dependent translation.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Follicles are the basic functional units in the ovaries. Each follicle consists of an oocyte, the surrounding granulosa cells, and theca cells in the mesenchyme. The interaction between oocytes and somatic cells is crucial for follicle development. Follicle maturation experiences primordial, primary, secondary, and antral follicular stages. Primordial follicles are formed shortly after birth via breakdown of oocyte syncytia. Each primordial follicle is composed of an oocyte surrounded by a single layer of flattened pregranulosa cells that remains in a dormant phase until being recruited into the primary stage under the influence of two main signaling pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Monniaux, 2016</xref>). Once activated, flattened granulosa cells become cuboidal, and follicles continue to grow through proliferation of granulosa cells and enlargement of oocytes. Development of high-quality oocytes is important for female reproductive health and fertility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Jagarlamudi and Rajkovic, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Liu et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Monniaux, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Richards and Pangas, 2010</xref>). Although gonadotropin, follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), and luteinizing hormone (LH) are important for the growth of antral follicles, the early stages of follicle development are driven by a local oocyte-granulosa cell dialog. Abnormalities in this process may lead to follicle growth arrest or atresia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Oktem and Urman, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Richards and Pangas, 2010</xref>).</p><p>Granulosa cells are derived from progenitors of the coelomic epithelium that direct sexual differentiation at the embryonic stage and support oocyte development postnatally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Liu et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Smith et al., 2014</xref>). Theca-interstitial cell differentiation occurs postnatally along with the formation of secondary follicles. The steroid hormone produced by theca-interstitial cells plays important roles in follicle development and maintenance of secondary sexual characteristics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Liu et al., 2010</xref>). The Wilms’ tumor (WT) suppressor gene <italic>Wt1</italic> is a nuclear transcription factor indispensable for normal development of several tissues. In gonads, <italic>Wt1</italic> is mainly expressed in ovarian granulosa cells and testicular Sertoli cells. During follicle development, <italic>Wt1</italic> is expressed at high levels in granulosa cells of primordial, primary, and secondary follicles, but its expression is decreased in antral follicles, suggesting that it might be a repressor of ovarian differentiation genes in the granulosa cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hsu et al., 1995</xref>). Our previous studies demonstrated that <italic>Wt1</italic> is required for the lineage specification and maintenance of Sertoli and granulosa cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cen et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chen et al., 2017</xref>). However, the underlying mechanism that regulates the expression of <italic>Wt1</italic> in granulosa cells is unknown.</p><p>Protein arginine methyltransferase 5 (PRMT5) is a member of the PRMT family that catalyzes the transfer of methyl groups from S-adenosylmethionine to a variety of substrates and is involved in many cellular processes, such as cell growth, differentiation, and development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Di Lorenzo and Bedford, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Karkhanis et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Stopa et al., 2015</xref>). PRMT5 is the predominant type II methyltransferase that catalyzes the formation of most symmetric dimethylarginines (SDMAs) in the cells and regulates gene expression at the transcriptional and posttranscriptional levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Karkhanis et al., 2011</xref>). PRMT5 forms a complex with its substrate-binding partner, the WD-repeat protein MEP50 (or WDR77), which greatly enhances the methyltransferase activity of PRMT5 by increasing its affinity for protein substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Stopa et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>In gonad development, inactivation of <italic>Prmt5</italic> specifically in primordial germ cells (PGCs) causes massive loss of PGCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kim et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Li et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Wang et al., 2015</xref>). PRMT5 promotes PGC survival by regulating RNA splicing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Li et al., 2015</xref>) and suppressing transposable elements at the time of global DNA demethylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kim et al., 2014</xref>). In this study, we found that PRMT5 is expressed at high level in ovarian granulosa cells of growing follicles and the expression level changes with follicle development, suggesting that PRMT5 in granulosa cells plays a role in follicle development. To test the function of PRMT5 in granulosa cells, we specifically inactivated <italic>Prmt5</italic> in granulosa cells using <italic>Sf1<sup>+/cre</sup></italic>. The <italic>Sf1<sup>+/cre</sup></italic> mouse expresses <italic>Cre</italic> recombinase in the adrenogonadal primordium at 10 dpc, the precursors for cortical cells in the adrenals and somatic cells in the gonads (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bingham et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Huang and Yao, 2010</xref>). We found that <italic>Prmt5<sup>flox/flox</sup>;Sf1<sup>+/cre</sup></italic> female mice were infertile and that follicles were arrested at the secondary stage. The expression of WT1 was dramatically reduced, and the granulosa cells in secondary follicles began to express steroidogenic genes. Further studies revealed that PRMT5 regulates follicle development by facilitating <italic>Wt1</italic> translation.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Deletion of <italic>Prmt5</italic> in granulosa cells caused aberrant ovary development and female infertility</title><p>The expression of PRMT5 in ovarian granulosa cells was examined by immunofluorescence.

In this study, we found that protein arginine methylation plays important roles in granulosa cell development. The development of ovarian follicles is a dynamic process. The granulosa cells in antral follicles express gonadotropin receptors. Before ovulation, granulosa cells begin to express steroidogenic enzymes that are necessary for progesterone and estradiol synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Irving-Rodgers et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Smith et al., 2014</xref>). In this study, we found that <italic>Prmt5</italic>-deficient granulosa cells began to express steroidogenic genes in secondary follicles and the upregulation of the steroidogenic genes in <italic>Prmt5</italic>-deficient granulosa cells was reversed by <italic>Wt1</italic> overexpression, indicating that PRMT5 is required for preventing the premature differentiation of granulosa cells via regulation of WT1 expression. Coordinated interaction between granulosa cells and oocytes is required for successful follicle development and production of fertilizable oocytes. The premature luteinized granulosa cells will lose their structural and nutritional support for oocytes, which will lead to follicle growth arrest or atresia at early stages of folliculogenesis.</p><p>Nuclear receptor <italic>Sf1</italic> plays a critical role in the regulation of steroid hormone biosynthesis by inducing the expression of steroidogenic enzymes in steroidogenic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ikeda et al., 1993</xref>). Our previous study demonstrated that WT1 represses <italic>Sf1</italic> expression by directly binding to the <italic>Sf1</italic> promoter region and that inactivation of <italic>Wt1</italic> causes upregulation of <italic>Sf1,</italic> which in turn activates the steroidogenic program (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chen et al., 2017</xref>). In the present study, the mRNA and protein levels of <italic>Sf1</italic> were significantly upregulated after WT1 loss. Therefore, we speculate that the upregulation of steroidogenic genes in <italic>Prmt5</italic>-deficient granulosa cells is most likely due to the increased expression of <italic>Sf1</italic> gene.</p><p>As an important nuclear transcription factor, the function of WT1 in granulosa cell development has been investigated. However, the molecular mechanism that regulates the expression of <italic>Wt1</italic> gene is unknown. In this study, we found that the expression of WT1 at the protein level was dramatically reduced in <italic>Prmt5</italic>-deficient granulosa cells, whereas the mRNA level was not changed, indicating that PRMT5 regulates <italic>Wt1</italic> expression at the post-transcriptional level. In our mouse model, <italic>Prmt5</italic> was inactivated in granulosa cells at the early embryonic stage. However, defects in follicle development were not observed until 2 weeks after birth. This outcome probably occurred because <italic>Prmt5</italic> is not expressed in granulosa cells before the development of primary follicles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). During the early stage, <italic>Wt1</italic> expression is also maintained in pregranulosa cells. Therefore, we speculate that there must be other factor(s) involved in regulating <italic>Wt1</italic> expression before primary follicle stage.</p><p>More than 100 mRNAs in mammals contain IRES elements in their 5′UTRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Jaud et al., 2019</xref>), which are involved in various physiological processes, such as differentiation, cell cycle progression, apoptosis, and stress responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Godet et al., 2019</xref>). The 5′UTR sequence of <italic>Wt1</italic> mRNA is highly conserved, with more than 85% homology among the sequences of 29 mammalian species.

These results suggest that arginine methylation has different effects on the ITAF activity of HnRNPA1 according to different IRESs and cell contexts.

Therefore, the inhibition of HnRNPA1 ITAF activity by PRMT5 does not occur through changes in the binding of HnRNPA1 to <italic>Wt1</italic> mRNA. Arginine–glycine–glycine (RGG)-motif region is also reported to be involved in mediating the interactions between homo- and heterotypic proteins. It is possible that arginine methylation of HnRNPA1 changes the interactions of HnRNPA1 and its protein partners, which affects the ITAF activity of HnRNPA1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Wall and Lewis, 2017</xref>).

In Prmt5-knockout mice, follicle development was arrested with disorganized granulosa cells, leading to female infertility. They found that the premature differentiated granulosa cells were detached from oocytes caused by reduced expression of WT1 and the increased expression of steroidogenesis-related genes. Mechanism studies revealed that PRMT5 facilitated IRES-dependent translation of Wt1 mRNA by methylating HnRNPA1. They also performed rescue experiments and showed that to overexpress WT1 in Prmt5-deficient granulosa cells could rescue the aberrant differentiation.</p><p>WT1 is a well-known protein in follicle development and this work is a major advance in understanding the role of post-translational arginine methylation in regulating WT1 expression in granulosa cell differentiation and follicle development. They used an array of overall high-quality experiments using mouse granulosa cells including co-immunoprecipitation, RNA immunoprecipitation to illustrate that Wt1 IRES-dependent translation was promoted by PRMT5. Below there is a list of comments that I think the authors should address before considering publication.</p><p>1. Line 132: I find the description of the follicle composition in the different ages and mutant mice are very confusing, lacking crucial quantification of the follicles. I think authors should provide:</p><p>(1). Detailed definition that they used for different kinds of follicles (primordial, primary, secondary, antral, preantral, …) with representative pictures;</p><p>(2). Provide a quantification of follicles at different stage presented in control and mutant animals at different times (2 weeks, 3 weeks, …) in Figure 1.</p><p>2. Line 149: Please provide more details about the fertility test. I wonder when the follicles were all lost in mutant mice. Figure S4 showed that the apoptosis and proliferation of granulosa cells was not changed in Prmt5flox/flox; Sf1-Cre mice at P14 and P18.</p><p>3. Please specify clearly which band is WT1 and <italic>FOXL2</italic> in Figure 5A.</p><p>4. Please provide a little bit more background about the Sf1 Cre mice and point out when and where the Cre recombinase expressed.</p><p>5. Please provide more information about how quantification of protein levels on WBs is done.</p><p>6. For Figure 6D-F, the authors use IgG as negative control, and I think the Prmt5flox/flox; Sf1-Cre granulosa cells are a better control for the co-immunoprecipitation. In Figure 6F, the western blot results of HnRNPA1 and SYM10 are from the same membrane? I wonder what the expression of HnRNPA1 and SYM10 are in Prmt5-deficient granulosa cells.</p><p>7. It is crucial to analyze the methylation status of HnRNPA1 in P14 and P18 Prmt5-deficient granulosa cells.</p><p>8. Line 585, A &quot;secong&quot; enzyme?</p><p>9. Line 537, the authors mentioned that &quot;the inhibition of HnRNPA1 ITAF activity by PRMT5 does not occur through changes in the binding of HnRNPA1 to Wt1 mRNA&quot;, please add some discussions about the possible regulation mechanism between the HnRNPA1 and WT1.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>In their manuscript entitled &quot;PRMT5 regulates ovarian follicle development by facilitating Wt1Translation&quot; Chen and colleagues test the hypothesis that granulosa cell-specific expression of PRMT5 is required for ovarian follicle development in the mouse. To answer this question, the authors successfully used a Sf1-CRE driver to selectively disrupt a floxxed allele of PRMT5 in granulosa cells. The manuscript is roughly divided into two main sections. The first section addresses ovarian follicle development defects associated with the granulosa cell-specific ablation of PRMT5 and the second section defines the molecular details associated with the gene expression changes.</p><p>It appears that the authors have completed and presented a series of important experiments that are novel and of potential high impact. The manuscript is well written and clear and the data are of excellent quality. The study is unique in that it includes highly complicated set of integrated in vivo and in vitro studies to identify molecular mechanisms underlying the regulation of ovarian follicle development. The major findings and conclusions are largely supported by the data that is presented in the manuscript and these conclusions are highly impactful to the field of regulation of gene expression underlying mammalian reproduction and development.</p><p>One important concern is that although many clear data are presented, the quantitative and reproducible nature of this data remains questionable. In many cases it is unclear in how many biological or experimental replicates the data is presented from and if sufficient replicates were used to make these important conclusions. This is true for the in vivo mouse data where clear examples of the effects are shown without the necessary quantification or sufficient replicate numbers to make the strong conclusions stated. This is especially true for assessing ovarian follicle numbers between individuals that do vary even within genotypes. In similar fashion, the manuscript hypothesizes the existence of a novel IRES in the 5'UTR of WT1 presents strong evidence for it but never attempts to identify this IRES. The absence of some minor controls and obvious tests of their hypothesis is also a bit concerning. For example, while the rescue experiments with the cDNA for WT1 are really exciting, but this construct missing the 5'UTR of WT1 should be insensitive to the PRMT5 inhibitor but this is not tested. The absence of these controls or additional experimental manipulations detracts from the potential high impact of these findings.</p><p>While the granulosa cell targeting of PRMT5 looks successful in Figure S2, Figure 1 is highly descriptive in nature and not sufficiently quantitative. Numbers of each follicle type from multiple biological replicates and fertility status of multiple replicates of each genotype must be completed over a significant period of time. Mating data concluding infertility is nowhere to be found in the manuscript. Reduction of WT1 in the PRMT5 KO at P18 is interesting, but how many replicates of each genotype were assessed and can the staining be analyzed in a more quantitative nature in Figure 2. Figure 4 seems redundant given the fact that follicle structures are disorganized in vivo unless a specific cellular process is examined. For example, does steroid biosynthesis increase in the cKO cultures vs. controls? There are a few key additions possibly already completed or that need to be completed that would enhance the strength of the stated developmental conclusions.</p><p>Similar details of the molecular analyses are missing as well that would increase the strength of these conclusions. Is the inhibitor specific for PRMT5 or are other arginine methyltransferases inhibited that could affect the stated conclusions in the manuscript. In figure 6C, the CCND1 IRES is also predicted to be affected by this inhibitor but this is not tested or shown. What is the source of the input differences in figure 6D and E? In 6D there is relatively equivalent levels of all three proteins and in E HNRNPA1 is highly reduced and does this affect the outcome of the IP? How many times was the experiment shown in 6F completed and what is the potential variability observed between replicates? In figure 7A, is there a significant difference in WT1 expression levels or is there a relative increase? Presenting and/or quantifying multiple replicates of each manipulation might help distinguish between these two possibilities. In figure 8, is the adenovirus expression of WT1 cDNA without 5'UTR insensitive to the PRMT5 inhibitor?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.68930.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>Epigenetic regulation of ovarian granulosa cells is not well studied.

Is it SF1 mediated as well?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you very much for the comments. During follicle development, WT1 is abundantly expressed in the granulosa cells of primordial, primary and secondary follicles, and dramatically reduced in antral follicles. By contrast, SF1 expression can not be detected in the granulosa cells of primordial, primary and secondary follicles, and it is upregulated in antral follicles. Our previous studies have found that inactivation of <italic>Wt1</italic> during embryonic stage resulted in up-regulation of steroidogenic enzymes in pre-granulosa cells and Sertoli cells. We also demonstrated that WT1 can directly bind to the <italic>Sf1</italic> promoter region to repress <italic>Sf1</italic> expression (Development, 2017, doi: 10.1242/dev.144105). Given the fact that <italic>Sf1</italic> plays a critical role in the development of steroidogenic cells and induction of steroidogenic gene expression, and significantly increased expression of <italic>Sf1</italic> in <italic>Prmt5</italic>-deficient granulosa cells in the present study, we speculate that WT1 represses steroidogenic enzyme genes expression in granulosa cells probably also by inhibiting <italic>Sf1</italic> expression. But this needs further investigation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– The most important enzyme for granulosa cell function is Cyp19a1 or aromatase. There is no data provided for this gene expression.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you very much for the suggestion. Actually, we have tried different commercial antibodies. Unfortunately, all of them did not work.

In Prmt5-knockout mice, follicle development was arrested with disorganized granulosa cells, leading to female infertility. They found that the premature differentiated granulosa cells were detached from oocytes caused by reduced expression of WT1 and the increased expression of steroidogenesis-related genes. Mechanism studies revealed that PRMT5 facilitated IRES-dependent translation of Wt1 mRNA by methylating HnRNPA1. They also performed rescue experiments and showed that to overexpress WT1 in Prmt5-deficient granulosa cells could rescue the aberrant differentiation.</p><p>WT1 is a well-known protein in follicle development and this work is a major advance in understanding the role of post-translational arginine methylation in regulating WT1 expression in granulosa cell differentiation and follicle development. They used an array of overall high-quality experiments using mouse granulosa cells including co-immunoprecipitation, RNA immunoprecipitation to illustrate that Wt1 IRES-dependent translation was promoted by PRMT5. Below there is a list of comments that I think the authors should address before considering publication.</p><p>1. Line 132: I find the description of the follicle composition in the different ages and mutant mice are very confusing, lacking crucial quantification of the follicles. I think authors should provide:</p><p>(1). Detailed definition that they used for different kinds of follicles (primordial, primary, secondary, antral, preantral, …) with representative pictures;</p></disp-quote><p>We are sorry for the confusing description. The representative pictures for the follicles at different stages were provided in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref>. The oocytes in ovaries were labeled with MVH antibody. B, C, and D are the magnified views of the box regions in panel A. Primordial follicles were defined as an oocyte surrounded by a layer of squamous (flattened) granulosa cells as shown in panel B and D (arrowheads). Primary follicles possessed an oocyte surrounded by a single layer of cuboidal granulosa cells as shown in panel B (arrows). Secondary follicles were surrounded by more than one layer of cuboidal granulosa cells, with no visible antrum as shown in panel D (arrows). Antral follicles contain multiple layers of granulosa cells and visible antral spaces as shown in panel C (arrows). The description of “preantral follicle” is confusing and it has been removed in the revised manuscript.</p><fig id="sa2fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-68930-sa2-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2).

Apoptosis is probably the fate of the premature luteinized granulosa cells in the arrested follicles at later stage. At 4 weeks of age, although the number of secondary follicles is not decreased, most of them are abnormal with less layers of flattened granulosa cells. The number of secondary follicles evidently decreased at 5 weeks.

To answer this question, the authors successfully used a Sf1-CRE driver to selectively disrupt a floxxed allele of PRMT5 in granulosa cells. The manuscript is roughly divided into two main sections. The first section addresses ovarian follicle development defects associated with the granulosa cell-specific ablation of PRMT5 and the second section defines the molecular details associated with the gene expression changes.</p><p>It appears that the authors have completed and presented a series of important experiments that are novel and of potential high impact. The manuscript is well written and clear and the data are of excellent quality. The study is unique in that it includes highly complicated set of integrated in vivo and in vitro studies to identify molecular mechanisms underlying the regulation of ovarian follicle development. The major findings and conclusions are largely supported by the data that is presented in the manuscript and these conclusions are highly impactful to the field of regulation of gene expression underlying mammalian reproduction and development.</p><p>One important concern is that although many clear data are presented, the quantitative and reproducible nature of this data remains questionable. In many cases it is unclear in how many biological or experimental replicates the data is presented from and if sufficient replicates were used to make these important conclusions. This is true for the in vivo mouse data where clear examples of the effects are shown without the necessary quantification or sufficient replicate numbers to make the strong conclusions stated. This is especially true for assessing ovarian follicle numbers between individuals that do vary even within genotypes. In similar fashion, the manuscript hypothesizes the existence of a novel IRES in the 5'UTR of WT1 presents strong evidence for it but never attempts to identify this IRES. The absence of some minor controls and obvious tests of their hypothesis is also a bit concerning. For example, while the rescue experiments with the cDNA for WT1 are really exciting, but this construct missing the 5'UTR of WT1 should be insensitive to the PRMT5 inhibitor but this is not tested. The absence of these controls or additional experimental manipulations detracts from the potential high impact of these findings.</p><p>While the granulosa cell targeting of PRMT5 looks successful in Figure S2, Figure 1 is highly descriptive in nature and not sufficiently quantitative. Numbers of each follicle type from multiple biological replicates and fertility status of multiple replicates of each genotype must be completed over a significant period of time.

Every time, ovaries of more than ten female mice were used for granulosa cell isolation and then co-immunoprecipitation experiments. The similar results were obtained for different replicates. The difference between former Figure 6D and 6E is probably because the exposure time for MEP50 and PRMT5 in Figure 6E was a little longer when scanning the NC membranes than Figure 6D. But wherever in 6D or 6E, nearly no proteins could be immunoprecipitated with IgG. From the results, we can see among the same amount of immunoprecipitated proteins, the amount of MEP50 and PRMT5 immunoprecipitated with MEP50 antibody is more than that immunoprecipitated with HnRNPA1 antibody. HnRNPA1 antibody is also effective because it can immunoprecipitate large amount of itself. One possible reason is that HnRNPA1 is abundantly expressed in granulosa cells, whereas only a small proportion of HnRNPA1 interacts with PRMT5 and MEF50 proteins at the moment. Therefore, HNRNPA1 antibody can pulldown more <italic>HNRNPA1</italic> protein than PRMT5 protein.</p><p>The experiments shown in Figure 6F were also repeated for three times and the results were very similar among the replicates.
