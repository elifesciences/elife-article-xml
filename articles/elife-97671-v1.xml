While numerous hallmarks of age-related microglia have been elucidated, the progression from homeostasis to dysfunction during the aging process remains unresolved. To bridge this gap in knowledge, we undertook complementary cellular and molecular analyses of microglia in the mouse hippocampus across the adult lifespan and in the experimental aging model of heterochronic parabiosis. Single-cell RNA-Seq and pseudotime analysis revealed age-related transcriptional heterogeneity in hippocampal microglia and identified intermediate states of microglial aging that also emerge following heterochronic parabiosis. We tested the functionality of intermediate stress response states via TGFβ1 and translational states using pharmacological approaches in vitro to reveal their modulation of the progression to an activated state. Furthermore, we utilized single-cell RNA-Seq in conjunction with in vivo adult microglia-specific <italic>Tgfb1</italic> conditional genetic knockout mouse models to demonstrate that microglia advancement through intermediate aging states drives transcriptional inflammatory activation and hippocampal-dependent cognitive decline.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>aging</kwd><kwd>microglia</kwd><kwd>inflammation</kwd><kwd>cognition</kwd><kwd>hippocampus</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000049</institution-id><institution>National Institute on Aging</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AG055292</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Shea</surname><given-names>Jeremy M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000049</institution-id><institution>National Institute on Aging</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AG055797</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Villeda</surname><given-names>Saul A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000049</institution-id><institution>National Institute on Aging</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AG077816</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Villeda</surname><given-names>Saul A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000893</institution-id><institution>Simons Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Villeda</surname><given-names>Saul A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>During aging, microglia progress through intermediate cellular states, including stress response and translation upregulation states, that modulate subsequent activation and impact cognitive decline.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Microglia are one of few immune cells with long-term residence in the brain parenchyma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Waisman et al., 2015</xref>). Microglia support neural development by synaptic pruning and neurogenic function in the developing brain, followed by homeostatic maintenance in the adult brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Salter and Beggs, 2014</xref>). Alternatively, in the aged brain microglia exhibit unbalanced phenotypes, aggravating perceived insults rather than responding productively to environmental signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Mosher and Wyss-Coray, 2014</xref>). While microglia have been identified as the principal mediators of multiple age-related neurodegenerative pathologies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bachiller et al., 2018</xref>), the mechanisms leading to microglia dysfunction during aging remain obscure.</p><p>Numerous studies have indicated that aged microglia are inflamed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Sierra et al., 2007</xref>), have reduced phagocytic capacity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Marschallinger et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Pluvinage et al., 2019</xref>), and have decreased motility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Damani et al., 2011</xref>). Microglia exhibit several hallmarks of aging that potentially contribute to their age-related dysfunction, such as shortened telomeres (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Flanary et al., 2007</xref>), altered intercellular communication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Udeochu et al., 2016</xref>), molecular alterations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Grabert et al., 2016</xref>), and a loss of proteostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Burns et al., 2020</xref>). Furthermore, many recent studies have started to reveal the molecular changes that define microglial aging. Single-cell RNA-Seq (scRNA-Seq) analyses indicate that microglia isolated from the entire brain lose homeostasis and activate inflammatory transcriptional profiles with age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hammond et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Li et al., 2023</xref>). Data-rich studies have also revealed partial overlaps between aging microglia and those from disease models, including Alzheimer’s disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Silvin et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Keren-Shaul et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Sala Frigerio et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lee et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Masuda et al., 2019</xref>). Interestingly, the microglial response to aging shows regional variation as white matter-rich regions induce an interferon signature in aged microglia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kaya et al., 2022</xref>). Studies using aged plasma administration and heterochronic blood exchange demonstrate that microglia aging is in part driven by the aged systemic environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Yousef et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Rebo et al., 2016</xref>). However, the genesis of age-related microglial phenotypes has not been extensively investigated. So, we set out to characterize the progression of age-related hippocampal microglial changes, aiming to uncover intermediate states that could be intrinsic to the aging process. To do so, we undertook complementary cellular and molecular analyses of microglia across the adult lifespan and in heterochronic parabiosis – an experimental model of aging in which the circulatory systems of young adult and aged animals are joined (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Villeda et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>In this study, we report that microglia in the adult mouse hippocampus, a brain region responsible for learning and memory and susceptible to age-related cognitive decline, advance through intermediate states that drive inflammatory activation during aging. We utilize scRNA-Seq across the adult lifespan to identify intermediate transcriptional states of microglial aging that emerge following exposure to an aged systemic environment. We observe heterogeneous spatiotemporal dynamics of microglia activation across the adult lifespan with pseudotime and immunohistochemical analysis. Functionally, we tested the role of these intermediate states using in vitro microglia approaches and in vivo temporally controlled adult microglia-specific <italic>Tgfb1</italic> conditional genetic knockout mouse models to demonstrate that intermediates represent modulators of the progression of microglia from homeostasis to activation, with functional implications for hippocampal-dependent cognitive decline.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table

Maximum intensity projections of Z-stacked images were constructed. Images were converted to 8-bit images and the <italic>Tgfb1</italic> was thresholded. For each section, the intensity of 5–7 individual <italic>Tgfb1</italic> puncta was averaged to get the average puncta intensity of that section. The intensity of all <italic>Tgfb1</italic> signal in clearly identifiable individual IBA1 cells was measured for 20–25 cells in the molecular layer of the hippocampus.

To also assess amygdala-dependent cued fear conditioning, the mild foot shock was paired with a light and tone cue (conditioned stimulus [CS]) during the training phase. Conditioned fear was displayed as freezing behavior. Specific training parameters are as follows: tone duration is 30 seconds; level is 70 dB, 2 kHz; shock duration is 2 seconds; intensity is 0.6 mA. This intensity is not painful and can easily be tolerated but will generate an unpleasant feeling. More specifically, on day 1 each mouse was placed in a fear-conditioning chamber and allowed to explore for 2 minutes before delivery of a 30-second tone (70 dB) and light ending with a 2-second foot shock (0.6 mA). 2 minutes later, a second CS-US pair was delivered. On day 2, each mouse was first placed in the fear-conditioning chamber containing the same exact context, but with no CS or foot shock. Freezing was analyzed for 2 minutes and represented as the percentage of time that the mouse froze over the 2 minutes. 1 hour later, the mice were placed in a new context containing a different odor, floor texture, chamber walls, and shape. Animals were allowed to explore for 2 minutes before being re-exposed to the CS. Freezing was analyzed for 30 seconds following the CS and represented as the percentage of time that the mouse froze over those 30 seconds. Determination of freezing behavior was performed using FreezeScan video tracking system and software (Cleversys, Inc). Single outliers were removed using the extreme studentized deviate method (Grubbs’ test) with an alpha of 0.05.</p></sec><sec id="s2-13"><title>Novel object recognition</title><p>The novel object recognition task was adapted from a previously described protocol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Leger et al., 2013</xref>). Specifically, during the habituation phase (day 1), mice could freely explore an empty open-field arena for 10 minutes (motor activity and anxiety [time in center] were measured during this phase). During the training phase (day 2), two identical objects were placed in the habituated arena, and mice could explore the objects for 5 minutes. For the testing phase (day 3), one object was replaced with a novel object, and mice could explore the objects for 5 minutes. Time spent exploring each object was quantified using the Smart Video Tracking Software (Panlab; Harvard Apparatus). Two different sets of objects are used. To control for any inherent object preference, half of the mice are exposed to object A as their novel object and half to object B. To control for any potential object-independent location preference, the location of the novel object relative to the trained object is also varied. The objects were chosen based on their ability to capture the animal’s interest, independent of genetic background or age. To determine percent time with novel object, we calculate (Time with novel object)/(Time with Trained Object + Time with Novel Object) * 100. In this preference index, 100% indicates full preference for the novel object, and 0% indicates full preference for the trained object. A mouse with a value of 50% would have spent equal time exploring both objects. Mice that did not explore both objects for 5 seconds during the training phase or testing phase were excluded from analysis. Single outliers were removed using the extreme studentized deviate method (Grubbs’ test) with an alpha of 0.05.</p></sec><sec id="s2-14"><title>Y maze</title><p>The Y maze task was conducted using an established forced alternation protocol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Belarbi et al., 2011</xref>).

The maze was cleaned between each mouse to remove odor cues, and the trained arm was alternated between mice. The mouse was then removed to its home cage. After 30 minutes, the block was removed, and the mouse was returned to the start arm and allowed to explore all three arms for 5 minutes. Time spent in each arm was quantified using the Smart Video Tracking Software (Panlab; Harvard Apparatus). The percent time in the novel arm was defined as time in the novel arm divided by time spent in the novel and trained arms during the task.</p></sec><sec id="s2-15"><title>Datasets</title><p>All RNA-Seq and scRNA-Seq data have been deposited in the Gene Expression Omnibus and are publicly available as of the date of publication.

Microglia have region-specific transcriptional states, so we decided to focus our analyses on the hippocampus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Grabert et al., 2016</xref>), a region with well-reported functional differences during aging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fan et al., 2017</xref>). Correspondingly, we investigated age-related transcriptional heterogeneity by performing scRNA-Seq on hippocampal CD11b-positive cells isolated from mice across numerous life stages at mature (6 months), middle-age (12 months), aged (18 months), and old age (24 months) using a commonly employed pooling strategy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lee et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Millet et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Harrington et al., 2023</xref>) (n=1 pool of five biological replicates for each age) to reveal the dynamics of microglia aging. 82% of cells isolated with CD11b were identified as microglia using canonical markers with a small subset being proliferative (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A-C</xref>). Dimensionality reduction revealed that non-proliferative microglia were grouped into interconnected clusters that contained homeostatic, transition, and activated states, along with a semi-distinct cluster with interferon activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D–G</xref>). Overlaying microglia ages onto the clusters revealed progression from a homeostatic state in younger microglia to an activated state in old microglia, suggesting that gradual transcriptional changes occur during microglial aging (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B and C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1H</xref>). Furthermore, the heterogeneity of microglial transcriptional programs increased with age (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1I</xref>). Expression of <italic>Cx3cr1</italic> and <italic>Itgam</italic> exemplified the homeostatic state, while <italic>B2m</italic>, <italic>Apoe</italic>, <italic>Cd48</italic>, and <italic>Lyz2</italic> depict the activated state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Interestingly, several immediate early genes (<italic>Jun</italic>, <italic>Klf2</italic>, <italic>Fos</italic>), as well as the purinergic receptor gene <italic>P2ry12</italic>, exhibited transient increases in expression at middle-age (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Alternatively, the interferon cluster represents a small proportion of the overall microglia population with little age-related changes in the number of these cells, but augmented expression of interferon genes during aging (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A, C, and D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1G</xref>). Thus, gene expression changes exhibited unique patterns during aging, with certain genes showing age-related decreases (e.g., <italic>Tgfbr1</italic>) or increases (e.g., <italic>Apoe</italic>), while a subset of genes (e.g., <italic>Tgfb1</italic>) have peaks of expression at middle age (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D, E, and G</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). Several complement genes implicated in age-related synaptic loss (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Udeochu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Shi et al., 2015</xref>) (e.g., <italic>C1q</italic> and <italic>C3</italic>) demonstrated progressive age-related transcriptional increases, and the increased complement activity in microglia was confirmed by immunohistochemistry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E and F</xref>).</p><p>The effects of aging on microglia could be progressive or sudden, so we investigated if we could find evidence of early aging of hippocampal microglia. We observe relatively few differentially genes between 6- and 12-month (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G and H</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). The number of differentially expressed genes gradually increased through the 24-month time point (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G–J</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>), suggesting that hippocampal microglia progressively accumulate aged-related expression changes. Furthermore, when investigating the outcome for genes with significant changes for each age, we find that genes that are differentially expressed at 12 months lose their expression change, while genes that change at later ages show progressive expression differences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>). GO analysis of the microglia from 6- and 12-month-old mice revealed that activation and translational programs are modestly enriched in genes with increased expression during early aging (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref>). The latter stages of aging display more prominent enrichment of immune activation and translation processes in genes with increased expression, while revealing that genes that regulate transcriptional processes exhibit decreased expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1J and K</xref>). Thus, microglia progressively age with subsets of cells at each age group being forerunners toward inflammatory activation or refractory to aging by remaining homeostatic. This analysis further suggests that microglia could pass through transitory states during aging.</p><p>As scRNA-Seq analysis revealed transcriptional heterogeneity during hippocampal microglial aging, we next assessed microglial phenotypic diversity across hippocampal subregions that could mirror the differential impact of aging across these hippocampal subregions at a functional level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kozareva et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Seki and Arai, 1995</xref>). We subdivided the adult hippocampus into functional units and quantified accumulation of puncta of the lysosomal marker CD68 in microglia to identify activation in the dentate gyrus (DG), molecular layer (ML), granule cell layer (GC), hilus, CA3, and CA1 at 3, 6, 12, 18, and 24 months of age (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A–C</xref>). We find striking spatial differences in microglial activation patterns during aging, with the GC, hilus, CA3, and outer CA1 regions showing robust microglia activation that increases beginning at middle age, while the ML and inner CA1 exhibit no age-related activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2D–F</xref>). Additionally, we characterized the levels of the pro-inflammatory transcription factor NFKB p65 in microglia during aging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Taniguchi and Karin, 2018</xref>). Microglia-specific expression of NFKB p65 demonstrates region- and age-specific accumulation that mirrors, in part, age-related microglial CD68 increase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2G–I</xref>). These results indicate temporally defined and spatially heterogeneous microglia activation within the aging hippocampus that complements the identification of heterogeneous transcriptional activation of microglia during aging.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Trajectory analysis indicates that aging microglia pass through intermediate states</title><p>To determine the transcriptional progression of microglia aging toward an activated state, we performed pseudotime analysis of the scRNA-Seq data using Monocle and observed several trajectories (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). We find that the pseudotime trajectories progressed along the biological ages of the mice, indicating the suitability of this analysis for modeling aging progression in microglia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). We focus our analysis on one trajectory with two semi-distinct subbranches that terminated in transcriptional inflammatory activation since the alternate branch had minimal transcriptional differences between the beginning and end of the trajectory (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B and C</xref>). To gain insight into the transcriptional states of microglial aging along this inflammatory trajectory, we used spatial autocorrelation analysis and identified five expression modules of coregulated genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B and C</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). We named these modules according to the most enriched GO pathways and known roles of prominent genes for microglia. This trajectory proceeds from high expression of homeostatic genes and mitochondrial processes (module 1) to transient expression of stress response genes and <italic>Tgfb1</italic> (module 2), of which TGFβ signaling is critical for microglia development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Butovsky et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bedolla et al., 2024</xref>). A concerted increase in the expression of ribosomal genes (module 3) precedes one subbranch of inflammatory activation (module 4), while the other myeloid activation subbranch (module 5), characterized by <italic>B2m</italic> and <italic>C1qc</italic> expression, proceeds independently of increased ribosomal gene expression. GO analysis of genes specifically upregulated at 12 months showed an enrichment of stress response pathways (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A and B</xref>), corroborating the findings of the pseudotime analysis that intermediate stages of microglial aging pass through stress response pathways. We complemented Monocle pseudotime analysis using another distinct trajectory analysis (Scorpius) that uncovered similar progression through stress–response and translational intermediate states, followed by inflammatory activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C and D</xref>). We further corroborate the transient nature of the intermediate stress response module (module 2), observing KLF2 expression that peaks at 18 months of age by immunohistochemistry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>) and <italic>Tgfb1</italic> expression that has a transient peak at 12 months of age by RNAscope (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>).

TGFB1 treatment modified the transcriptional states of LPS-treated microglia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1J</xref>) and caused decreased expression of genes in GO terms related to inflammatory immune processes after LPS stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>).

First, mitochondrial dysfunction triggers a stress response, and products of this stress response (e.g., TGFB1) attempt to return microglia to homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chovatiya and Medzhitov, 2014</xref>). Here, chronic activation of the stress response leads to subsequent increased translational capacity that promotes inflammatory activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Xu et al., 2020</xref>). Alternatively, another branch of microglial activation advances independently of increased translational capacity, evidenced by translational inhibition having little effect on its activation following LPS stimulation. Thus, we find that increases in translational capacity predicate age-related inflammatory phenotypes, identifying potential targets to counter microglial aging. Analysis of scRNA-Seq data further identifies intermediate states of microglial aging in young adult heterochronic parabionts, suggesting a pivotal role for the aged systemic environment in driving advancement toward age-related inflammatory activation.</p><p>While we find evidence of the beginnings of inflammatory activation in the hippocampus by middle age (12 months), consistent with the timing recently reported in the whole brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Li et al., 2023</xref>), it should be noted that scRNA-Seq analysis of the whole brain did not observe intermediate stages in microglial aging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Li et al., 2023</xref>). These disparate observations could likely be the result of analyzing multiple regions with highly differentiated transcriptional programs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Grabert et al., 2016</xref>) that could obfuscate regional aging trajectories. This further underscores the need for both temporal and regional specificity in aging studies, given the level of cellular heterogeneity observed across ages and brain regions. Indeed, in the hippocampus, it is likely that the local microenvironment plays a significant role in the genesis of microglial aging, as regional distinctions in cellular function and composition – even in apposed subregions – elicit different outcomes in microglia with age and following exposure to an aged systemic environment. With age, multiple hippocampal subregions accumulate activated microglia beginning at 12 months of age, signifying that age-related alterations in microglia are initially present at middle age. Studying microglia, or other cell types, at these early stages of aging in a region-specific manner could represent useful models to investigate the ontogeny of aging without the confounding effects of accumulated functional deficits. Alternatively, the lack of age-related accumulation of activated microglia in the molecular layer and inner CA1, hippocampal subregions rich in synaptic terminals, points toward microenvironmental influences that may prove refractory to aging.</p><p>Of note, we find that an inflammatory trajectory of microglia aging can be mitigated in vitro by environmental TGFβ signaling, while loss of microglia-derived TGFB1 promoted progression along aging-associated inflammatory trajectories in vivo. Together, these data indicate that TGFβ signaling is necessary for maintaining youth-associated homeostasis and represents a modulator in mediating advancement along aging-associated inflammatory trajectories. Furthermore, our results, combined with those of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bedolla et al., 2024</xref>, strongly suggest that TGFβ signals in an autocrine fashion to return microglia to a homeostatic state after encountering stressful stimuli. Functionally, loss of microglia-derived TGFB1 resulted in hippocampal-dependent cognitive impairments in an age-dependent manner, suggesting that advancement through aging-associated trajectories may facilitate age-related cognitive decline. Given that a transient increase in <italic>Tgfb1</italic> expression is observed in middle-aged microglia, it is possible that maintaining stress response-mediated signaling into older ages may also provide a means to delay age-related microglial dysfunction and maintain cognitive function. Alternatively, TGFβ signaling impairs microglial responses to Alzheimer’s disease pathology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Yin et al., 2023</xref>), suggesting that the dynamic regulation of TGFβ signaling in response to aging-associated pathologies is necessary for tuning microglial responses.</p><p>While microglia have been demonstrated to mediate the establishment of cognitive function during development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Salter and Beggs, 2014</xref>) and play prominent roles in neurodegeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Sarlus and Heneka, 2017</xref>), little is known about how age-related changes in microglia affect cognitive function. The specificity of the cognitive deficits that we observe in <italic>Tgfb1</italic> Het and <italic>Tgfb1</italic> cKO mice suggests that age-related changes in microglia-derived TGFB1 predominantly impact hippocampal-dependent cognitive decline. Furthermore, the deficits observed in <italic>Tgfb1</italic> heterozygous mice point to the importance of maintaining youthful levels of microglia-derived TGFB1 to counteract stressors that accrue during aging.</p><p>Altogether, our results highlight the need to investigate aging across the lifespan in a region-specific manner to reveal necessary cellular intermediates in the aging process. While the present study focuses on age-related changes in microglia, our findings have broad implications for other studies in determining the extent to which aging sequelae are conserved across different cell types in the hippocampus. Furthermore, therapeutic interventions targeting intermediate states in the aging process hold far-reaching potential to counteract the development of age-related pathologies, including those promoting cognitive dysfunction.</p></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Data curation, Formal analysis, Funding acquisition, Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing - original draft, Project administration, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Conceptualization, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Writing - original draft, Project administration, Writing - review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>All animal procedures were performed in accordance with protocols approved by the UCSF Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC)(AN194088).

ScRNA-seq analysis allowed the authors to predict a trajectory and hypothesize about possible molecular checkpoints, which keep the pace of microglial aging. E.g. TGF1b was predicted as a molecule slowing down the microglial aging path and indeed, loss of TGF1 in microglia led to premature microglia aging, which was associated with premature loss of cognitive ability.

These bioinformatics approaches can reveal key patterns in scRNAseq / snRNAseq datasets and, in the present study, the authors conclude that a &quot;stress response&quot; module characterized by expression of TGFb1 represents a key &quot;checkpoint&quot; in microglial aging in midlife, after which the cells can move along distinct transcriptional trajectories as aging progresses. This is an intriguing possibility. However, pseudotime analyses need to be validated via additional bioinformatics as well as follow-up experiments. Indeed, Heumos et al, in their Nature Genetics &quot;Expert Guidelines&quot; Review, emphasize that &quot;inferred trajectories might not necessarily have biological meaning.&quot; They recommend that &quot;when the expected topology is unknown, trajectories and downstream hypotheses should be confirmed by multiple trajectory inference methods using different underlying assumptions.&quot;(15) Numerous algorithms are available for trajectory inference (e.g. Monocle, PAGA, Slingshot, RaceID/StemID, among many others) and their performance and suitability depends on the individual dataset and nature of the trajectories that are to be inferred. It is recommended to use dynGuidelines(16) for the selection of optimal pseudotime analysis methods. In the present manuscript, the authors do not provide any justification for their use of Monocle 3 over other trajectory inference approaches, nor do they employ a secondary trajectory inference method to confirm observations made with Monocle 3. Finally, follow-up validation experiments that the authors carry out have their own limitations and caveats (see below). Hence, while the microglial aging trajectories identified by this study are intriguing, they remain hypothetical trajectories that need to be proven with additional follow-up experiments.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for their suggestion. We have utilized the dynGuidelines kindly provided by the reviewer to utilize an additional trajectory inference tool to analyze our data. We selected Scorpius based on the structure of our data. The tool has provided additional support that microglia progress from a homeostatic state (<italic>Cx3cr1</italic>, <italic>Mef2c</italic>) to the induction of stress genes (<italic>Hspa1, Atf3</italic>) at an intermediate point during aging progression. Furthermore, we observe a concordant increase in ribosomal protein genes at a time point in the pseudotime analysis immediately prior to activation of inflammation-related genes (<italic>Il1b, Cst7</italic>). These additional analyses support the main findings of our original pseudotime analysis and have been added to the manuscript as Figure S3C,D. Additionally, in the statistical test that uncovers differentially expressed genes along the pseudotime trajectory in this analyses, we find that <italic>Tgfb1</italic> is one of the genes that is differentially expressed with peak expression at an intermediate timepoint along the pseudotime trajectory. Furthermore, we have done some preliminary trajectory analysis with slingshot (Street et al, BMC Genomics, PMID: 29914354) that found a similar trajectory with analogous gene expression patterns and dynamic expression of <italic>Tgfb1</italic>.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>To follow up on the idea that TGFb1 signaling in microglia plays a key role in determining microglial aging trajectories, the authors use RNAscope to show that TGFb1 levels in microglia peak in middle age. They also treat primary LPS-activated microglia with TGFb1 and show that this restores expression of microglial homeostatic gene expression and dampens expression of stress response and, potentially, inflammatory genes. Finally, they utilize transgenic approaches to delete TGFb1 from microglia around 8-10mo of age and scRNAseq to show that homeostatic signatures are lost and inflammatory signatures are gained. Hence, findings in this study support the idea that TGFb1 can strongly regulate microglial phenotype. Loss of TGFb1 signaling to microglia in adulthood has already been shown to cause decreased microglial morphological complexity and upregulation of genes typically associated with microglial responses to CNS insults(17-19). TGFb1 signaling to microglia has also been implicated in microglial responses to disease and manipulations to increase this signaling can improve disease progression in some cases(19). In this light, the findings in the present study are largely confirmatory of previous findings in the literature. They also fall short of unequivocally demonstrating that TGFb1 signaling acts as a &quot;checkpoint&quot; for determining subsequent microglial aging trajectory. To show this clearly, one would need to perturb TGFb1 signaling around 12mo of age and carry out sequencing (bulkRNAseq or scRNAseq) of microglia at 18mo and 24mo. Such experiments could directly demonstrate whether the whole microglial population has been diverted to the TGFb1-low aging trajectory (that progresses through a translational burst state to an inflammation state as proposed). Future development of tools to tag TGFb1 high or low microglia could also enable fate tracing type experiments to directly show whether the TGFb1 state in middle age predicts cell state at later phases of aging.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for the use of the term “checkpoint” when referring to the role of <italic>Tgfb1</italic> in microglial aging. Instead, our model posits that Tgfb1 expression increases in response to the early insults of the aging process in an attempt to return microglia to homeostasis. Therefore, this would predict that increasing TGFB1 levels after an insult would decrease activation and age-related progression of microglia, which we demonstrate in vitro (Figure 3). Alternatively, the loss of TGFB1 should prevent microglia from returning to a homeostatic state after an age-related stressor, and thus increase the number of microglia in activated states. We observe this increase in activated microglia in our middle-aged microglia-specific Tgfb1 knockout mouse model. Furthermore, the haploinsufficiency of Tgfb1 at this age indicates that TGFB1 signaling in microglia is sensitive to relative levels of Tgfb1. The transient increase in <italic>Tgfb1</italic> expression further suggests that the threshold for TGFB1 signaling is dynamic. Finally, RNA-Seq analysis of both in vitro TGFB1 supplemented microglia and in vivo Tgfb1 depleted microglia highlight that TGFB1 alters the aging microglia transcriptome. Combined, these results provide evidence that <italic>Tgfb1</italic> modulates advancement of microglia through an aging continuum.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The present study would also like to draw links between features of microglial aging in the hippocampus and a decline in hippocampal-dependent cognition during aging. To this end, they carry out behavioral testing in 8-10mo old mice that have undergone microglial-specific TGFb1 deletion and find deficits in novel object recognition and contextual fear conditioning. While this provides compelling evidence that TGFb1 signaling in microglia can impact hippocampus-dependent cognition in midlife, it does not demonstrate that this signaling accelerates or modulates cognitive decline (see below). Age-associated cognitive decline refers to cognitive deficits that emerge as a result of the normative brain aging process (20-21). For a cognitive deficit to be considered age-associated cognitive decline, it must be shown that the cognitive operation under study was intact at some point earlier in the adult lifespan. This requires longitudinal study designs that determine whether a manipulation impacts the relationship between brain status and cognition as animals age (22-24). Alternatively, cross-sectional studies with adequate sample sizes can be used to sample the variability in cognitive outcomes at different points of the adult lifespan (22-24) and show that this is altered by a particular manipulation. For this specific study, one would ideally demonstrate that hippocampal-based learning/memory was intact at some point in the lifespan of mice with microglial TGFb1 KO but that this manipulation accelerated or exacerbated the emergence of deficits in hippocampal-dependent learning/memory during aging. In the absence of these types of data, the authors should tone down their claims that they have identified a cellular and molecular mechanism that contributes to cognitive decline.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that to adequately demonstrate an age-dependent effect of microglia-derived TGFB1 on cognition it is necessary to perturb microglial TGFB1 at young and mature ages and assess the age-dependent effect on cognition. To address this, we have now performed a complementary behavioral study utilizing the Tmem119-CreER mouse model to drive the microglia-specific excision of <italic>Tgfb1</italic> in two separate cohorts of mice – one young (2-3 months) and one in mature mice (7-8 months) – followed by cognitive testing. Using the novel object recognition test, we find that young mice of all genotypes (WT, <italic>Tgfb1</italic> Het and <italic>Tgfb1</italic> cKO) retain the ability to recognize the novel object (as determined by having a significant preference in exploring the novel object). Alternatively, only the WT mature mice demonstrate a preference for the novel object, while the <italic>Tgfb1</italic> Het and <italic>Tgfb1</italic> cKO show no preference for the novel object. These behavioral data demonstrate an age-dependent necessity for microglia-specific TGFB1 in in maintain proper hippocampal-dependent memory and is now included in the manuscript as revised Figure 4I-J. We have also included additional behavioral tests (Y-Maze and open field) that did not show any difference between the genotypes as Figure S6D-G. Unfortunately, we were unable to perform the fear conditioning testing, as our apparatus broke during this time. Together, these results reveal that there is an age-dependent necessity for microglia-derived TGFB1 for hippocampal-dependent cognitive function.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>A final point of clarification for the reader pertains to the mining of previously generated data sets within this study. The language in the results section, methods, and figure legends causes confusion about which experiments were actually carried out in this study versus previous studies. Some of the language makes it sound as though parabiosis experiments and experiments using mouse models of Alzheimer's Disease were carried out in this study. However, parabiosis and AD mouse model experiments were executed in previous studies (25,26), and in the present study, RNAseq datasets were accessed for targeted data mining. It is fantastic to see further mining of datasets that already exist in the field. However, descriptions in the results and methods sections need to make it crystal clear that this is what was done.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer makes an excellent point. While we referenced the public dataset in the original manuscript, the citation style of superscripted numbers diminishes our ability to adequately reference the datasets. Therefore, we have added the names of the first authors (Palovics for the parabiosis dataset and Sala Frigerio for the Alzheimer’s Disease dataset) to all the instances in the results and figure legends when we refer to these datasets.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Additional recommendations:</p><p>Major comments.</p><p>(1) There is some ambiguity surrounding how to interpret the microglial TGFb1 knockout that seems incompatible with viewing this molecule as a &quot;checkpoint&quot; in microglial aging. TGFb1 is believed to be primarily produced by microglia. Secreted TGFb1 is then detected by microglial TGFbR2. Are the microglia that have high levels of TGFb1 in middle age signaling to themselves (autocrine signaling)? Or contributing to a local milieu that impacts multiple neighbor microglia (paracrine signaling)? The authors could presumably look in their own dataset to evaluate microglial capacity to detect TGFb1 via its receptors.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this insightful suggestion. We have undertaken analysis of our dataset to assess whether Tgfb1 acts through autocrine or paracrine signaling. To do so, we reanalyzed our microglia aging scRNA-Seq dataset leveraging the variation in microglia <italic>Tgfb1</italic> expression to probe the relative activity of TGFB1. Specifically, we partitioned microglia into quartiles based on their Tgfb1 expression, and subsequently investigated the expression of TGFB signaling effectors and targets. High expression of downstream TGFB signaling pathway components in microglia with high <italic>Tgfb1</italic> expression would point to autocrine mechanisms while, alternatively, high expression of downstream TGFB signaling pathway components in microglia with low <italic>Tgfb1</italic> expression would point to paracrine mechanisms. We observed highest expression of TGFB signaling pathway components and targets in microglia with the highest expression of <italic>Tgfb1</italic>. These data suggest that Tgfb1 acts through an autocrine mechanism. These results have been added to our manuscript as Figure S4E-G. Additionally, while our manuscript was under review, a paper by Bedolla et al (Nature Communications 2024; PMID: 38906887) was published that investigated the role of Tgfb1 in adult microglia. This paper utilized orthogonal techniques – sparse microglia-specific Tgfb1 knockout and IHC - to also suggest that microglia utilize autocrine Tgfb1 signaling. Together, these complementary data provide strong evidence that Tgfb1 acts through an autocrine mechanism in adult microglia.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) Conclusions of the study rest on the assumption that microglial inflammatory responses are a central driver of cognitive decline. They assume that manipulations that increase microglial progression into an inflammatory state will negatively impact cognitive function. Although there are certainly a lot of data in the field that inflammatory factors can impact synaptic function, additional experiments would be required to unequivocally demonstrate that a &quot;TGFb1 dependent&quot; progression of microglia to an inflammatory state underlies any observed changes in cognition. For example, in the context of microglial TGFb1 deletion, can NSAIDs or blockers of soluble TNFa (e.g. XENP345), or blockers of SPP1, etc. rescue behavior? Can microglial depletion in this context rescue behavior? Assuming behavior was carried out in the same microglial TGFb1 KO mice that were used for microglial scRNAseq, they could also carry out linear regression-type analyses to link microglial inflammatory status to the behavioral performance of individual mice. In the absence of additional evidence of this sort, the authors should tone down claims about mechanistic relationships between microglial state and cognitive performance.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for realizing that the link between cognition and inflammation in our paper is speculative. Therefore, we have taken the reviewer’s advice and toned down the claims linking inflammation to cognition in our manuscript. Instead, we connect the disruption in cognition to what is observed in our data, a loss of microglia homeostasis and a shift in the microglia aging trajectories.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Additional Recommendations:</p><p>Minor comments:</p><p>(1) Ideally at some point in the results or discussion, the authors should acknowledge that the hippocampus has highly distinct sub-regions and that microglia show different functions and properties across these sub-regions (e.g. microglia in hilus and subgranular zone vs microglia in stratum radiatum, vs microglia immediately adjacent to or embedded within stratum pyrimidale). Do expression levels of TGFb1 and microglial aging trajectories vary across sub-regions? To what extent can this account for heterogeneity of aging trajectories observed in microglial aging within the hippocampus?</p></disp-quote><p>We are interested in how microglia heterogeneity during aging is influenced by the specific functions, and thus microenvironments within the hippocampus. Therefore, we have expanded our IHC analysis of microglia to determine how the microenvironment influences microglia phenotypes by looking at several different regions of the hippocampus. We have included this regional analysis as Figure S2 in the manuscript. This analysis has revealed region-specific effects on microglia activation during aging.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) For immunohistochemistry data, it is not particularly convincing to see one example of one cell from each condition. Generally, an accepted approach in the field is to present lower magnification images accompanied by zoom panels for several cells from each field of view. This reassures the reader that specific cells haven't simply been &quot;cherry-picked&quot; to support a particular conclusion.</p></disp-quote><p>To allay the concerns of the reviewer that cells haven’t been “cherry-picked”, we have provided low magnification images for the aging CD68 and NF<sub>κ</sub>B stains in Supplemental Figure S2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) In immunohistochemistry data, have measures been taken to ensure that observed signals are not simply autofluorescence that becomes prominent in tissues with aging? (i.e. use of trueblack or photoquenching of tissue prior to staining) See PMID 37923732</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that autofluorescence, at least partially due to the accumulation of lipofuscin, becomes prominent in certain regions and cells of the hippocampus during aging. This most prominently occurs in the microglia of the hilus. This autofluorescence has a particular subcellular distribution, as it is localized to lyso-endosomal bodies. The microglia activation marker CD68 is also localized to lysosomes. A previous publication by Burns et al (eLife; PMID: 32579115) identified autofluorescent microglia (AF+) with unique molecular profiles that accumulate with age. They posited that these AF+ microglia resembled other microglia subsets that have pronounced storage compartments, such as the pro-inflammatory lipid droplet-containing microglia that accumulate with age reported by Marschallinger et al (Nature; PMID: 31959936). As such, autofluorescence present in microglia potentially represents distinctive and functional states of microglia. Our CD68 immunostaining accumulates with age, which could overlap with autofluorescent storage bodies. Thus, we performed a complementary CD68 immunostaining in an independent cohort of young (3 months) and aged (24 months) mice with autofluorescence quencher TrueBlack, and found that the staining pattern and accumulation of CD68 microglia with age persisted as previously observed after use of this quencher (see Authpr response image 1). Images are IBA1 (cyan) and CD68 (yellow) with the molecular layer (ML), granule cell (GC), and hilus illustrated and corresponding quantification provided (Two-way ANOVA with Sidak’s multiple comparisons test; ***p&lt;0.001; ****p&lt;0.0001).</p><p>We would like to note that the subcellular localization of the other immunostainings included in the manuscript was distinct from CD68, and not likely to be associated with the autofluorescent storage bodies. Additionally, our RNAScope staining for <italic>Tgfb1</italic> did not show an accumulation with age, but rather a transient increase at 12 months of age, which indicates that the interpretation of the RNAScope stain for <italic>Tgfb1</italic> was not unduly influenced by autofluorescence.</p><fig id="sa2fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-97671-sa2-fig1-v1.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) Ideally, more care is needed with the language used to describe microglial state during aging. The terms &quot;dystrophic,&quot; &quot;dysfunctional,&quot; and &quot;inflammatory&quot; all carry their own implications and assumptions. Many changes exhibited by microglia during aging can initially be adaptive or protective, particularly during middle age. Without additional experiments to show that specific microglial attributes during aging are actively detrimental to the tissue and additional experiments to show that microglia have ceased to be capable of engaging in many of their normal actions to support tissue homeostasis, the authors should exercise caution in using terms like dysfunctional.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewers’ suggestion.

Changes in cell state distribution along aging were made based on scRNA-seq and were not corroborated by any other method, such as imaging of cluster-specific marker expression in microglia at different ages. This analysis would allow confirming the scRNA-seq data and would also give us an idea of where the subsets are present within the hippocampus, and whether there is any interesting distribution of cell states (e.g. some are present closer to stem cells?). Since TGFb is thought to be crucial to microglia biology, it would be valuable to include more analysis of the mice with microglia-specific Tgfb deletion e.g. what was the efficiency of recombination in microglia? Did their numbers change after induction of Tgfb deletion in Cx3cr1-creERT2::Tgfb-flox mice.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for their comment regarding potential ex vivo transcriptional alterations with the approaches used in our study. We performed our aging microglia scRNA-Seq characterization prior to the release of Marsh et al (Nature Neuroscience; PMID: 35260865), which revealed the potential transcriptional artefacts induced by isolation. That being said, we took great care to minimize the amount of time samples were subjected to enzymatic digestion (15 minutes) and kept cells at 4C during the remainder of the isolation. Furthermore, we performed all isolations simultaneously, so that transcriptional changes induced by the isolation would be present across all ages and should not be observed during our analysis unless indicative of a true age-related change. Additionally, we have corroborated changes in cell state distribution across ages using several markers (<italic>Tgfb1</italic> and KLF2 for the intermediate stress state, S6 for the translation state, and NFKB and CD68 for activation states). In the revised manuscript, we have added additional hippocampal subregion analysis of several IHC immunostains to provide spatial insights into the microglia aging process (Figure S2). This analysis reveals unique spatial dynamics of microglia aging. For example, as the reviewer foresaw, we found that the granule cell layer (the location of adult hippocampal neurogenesis) had a more pronounced age-associated progression of microglial activation than several other regions. A subset of regions had minimal levels of activation during aging, such as the molecular layer and the stratum radiatum of the CA1 (inner CA1in the manuscript) – regions enriched in synaptic terminals. Furthermore, this analysis highlights the susceptibility of microglia aging to microenvironmental influences.</p><p>Regarding the temporally controlled microglia-specific genetic KO mouse model used in our original submission, the Cx3cr1-CreER allele selected (B6.129P2(Cg)-Cx3cr1tm2.1(cre/ERT2)Litt/WganJ) has been reported to have very high recombination efficiency (~94% in Parkhurst et al (Cell; PMID: 24360280)), and we used a tamoxifen induction protocol very similar to Faust et al. (Cell Reports; PMID: 37635351) that achieved ~98% recombination (they injected 100mg/kg for 5 days, while we injected 90mg/kg for 5 days). We analyzed our scRNA-Seq data for the expression of <italic>Tgfb1</italic> and found that the knockout mice had a 67% reduction in cells expressing higher levels of <italic>Tgfb1</italic> (see panel A in Author response image 2). This is likely a large underestimate of the recombination efficiency, as exon 3 is floxed and residual nonfunctional transcripts could be present, given nonsense-mediated decay is not realized in a number of knockout lines (Lindner et al, Methods, PMID: 33838271). We likely achieved a much higher excision efficiency. We would like to highlight that our data indicating increased microglia activation after tamoxifen treatment (Figure S5A) and the involvement of autonomous signaling (Figure S4E-G) are consistent with recently published work by Bedolla et al, (Nature Communications; PMID: 38906887). Additionally, as part of the revision process, we have now corroborated our behavioral data using and independent temporally controlled microglia-specific KO mouse model - Tmem119-CreER::Tgfb1 knockout mice (Figure 4I-K). We performed qPCR on sorted microglia to determine RNA levels in wildtype and knockout mice. Relative levels of <italic>Tgfb1</italic> and exon 3 of <italic>Tgfb1</italic> (the floxed exon) on technical replicates of 3 pooled samples indicated overall loss of <italic>Tgfb1</italic> expression, as well as undetectable levels of exon 3 as normalized to Actb (see panel B in Author response image 2).</p><fig id="sa2fig2" position="float"><label>Author response image 2.</label><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-97671-sa2-fig2-v1.tif"/></fig><p>With respect to the effects of aging and Tgfb1 on microglia density, we find a slight region-specific increase in microglia density with age (see Author response image 3).
