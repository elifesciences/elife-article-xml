healthy cells. Inability to maintain lysosomal acidic pH is associated with aging and neurodegenerative diseases. However, the mechanisms elicited by impaired lysosomal acidification remain poorly understood. We show here that inhibition of lysosomal acidification triggers cellular iron deficiency, which results in impaired mitochondrial function and non-apoptotic cell death. These effects are recovered by supplying iron via a lysosome-independent pathway. Notably, iron deficiency is sufficient to trigger inflammatory signaling in cultured primary neurons. Using a mouse model of impaired lysosomal acidification, we observed a robust iron deficiency response in the brain, verified by in vivo magnetic resonance imaging. Furthermore, the brains of these mice present a pervasive inflammatory signature associated with instability of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), both corrected by supplementation of the mice diet with iron. Our results highlight a novel mechanism linking impaired lysosomal acidification, mitochondrial malfunction and inflammation in vivo.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>iron</kwd><kwd>lysosome</kwd><kwd>acidification</kwd><kwd>inflammation</kwd><kwd>mitochondria</kwd><kwd>brain</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010663</institution-id><institution>H2020 European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>337327</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Raimundo</surname><given-names>Nuno</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Acid Maltase Deficiency Association</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Raimundo</surname><given-names>Nuno</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Emmy Noether award</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Milosevic</surname><given-names>Ira</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SFB1190-P02</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Milosevic</surname><given-names>Ira</given-names></name><name><surname>Raimundo</surname><given-names>Nuno</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Impaired lysosomal acidification results in retention of iron inside lysosomes, triggering functional iron deficiency, dysfunctional mitochondria (especially mtDNA loss), and inflammation in vivo in a mouse model of lysosomal disease.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Lysosomal function is now recognized as a key factor in cellular and tissue health. Recessive mutations in genes encoding lysosomal proteins result in over 50 severe lysosomal storage diseases, and carriers of these mutations are at risk of many neurodegenerative diseases, such as Parkinsonâs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Ramirez et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Murphy et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Nguyen et al., 2019</xref>), Alzheimerâs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lee et al., 2010</xref>), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Corrionero and Horvitz, 2018</xref>), frontotemporal lobar degeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lie and Nixon, 2019</xref>), among others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fassio et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>The lysosomes are now recognized as key players in cellular signaling and nutrient sensing, in addition to their roles as terminal platform of autophagy and endocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Perera and Zoncu, 2016</xref>). Lysosomes are also involved in the intracellular partitioning of several cellular building blocks, such as amino acids, cholesterol and sphingomyelin, as well as metals including calcium (Ca) and iron (Fe) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lim and Zoncu, 2016</xref>).</p><p>There are different populations of lysosomes in each cell, which can be distinguished by their position, size, acidification and reformation properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bright et al., 2016</xref>). Yet, most lysosomal functions rely on the acidification of the lysosomal lumen, as the vast majority of the enzymes residing in the lysosome have an optimal function in the pH range of 4.5â5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Perera and Zoncu, 2016</xref>). The acidic pH of the lysosomal lumen is the result of an electrochemical gradient maintained mostly by the vacuolar ATPase (v-ATPase) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Wang and Semenza, 1993</xref>), with contribution from the chloride channel CLC-7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Mindell, 2012</xref>). The v-ATPase is a multisubunit complex with two domains, the membrane-associated V<sub>O</sub> and the soluble hydrolytic V<sub>1</sub>, which hydrolyzes ATP to pump protons to the lysosomal lumen against a concentration gradient (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Stransky et al., 2016</xref>). The existence of specific v-ATPase inhibitors such as bafilomycin (Baf; interacts with the V<sub>O</sub> ring, inhibiting proton translocation) and saliphenylhalamide (saliphe; locks v-ATPase in an assembled state) provides pharmacological tools to assess loss of v-ATPase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bowman et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Garcia-Rodriguez et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Xie et al., 2004</xref>).The v-ATPase exists also in other cellular organelles, such as endosomes, Golgi complex and secretory vesicles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Farsi et al., 2018</xref>), but the effects of v-ATPase loss-of-function most severely relate to its role in lysosomal acidification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lie and Nixon, 2019</xref>).</p><p>Decreased activity of the v-ATPase has been linked to age-related decrease in lysosomal function and neurodegenerative diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lee et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Nixon, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Korvatska et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bagh et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fassio et al., 2018</xref>). It has also been shown that impaired acidification of the yeast vacuole, the evolutionary ancestor of lysosomes, results in decreased mitochondrial function and accelerated aging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hughes and Gottschling, 2012</xref>). Nevertheless, the mechanisms by which impaired lysosomal acidification result in aging and disease remain poorly characterized. In addition, the v-ATPase has been recognized as a therapeutic target in cancer, given that its inhibition positively correlates with decreased tumor mass (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">McGuire et al., 2016</xref>). Therefore, it is pivotal to characterize the mechanisms underlying the cellular response to v-ATPase inhibition.</p><p>Importantly, the potent inhibition of v-ATPase causes cell death, but the underlying mechanisms also remain unclear. The understanding of which signaling pathways are elicited in response to v-ATPase inhibition would allow the definition of therapeutic targets, for example for neurodegenerative diseases and for cancer.</p><p>Here, we show that inhibition of the v-ATPase results in impairment of lysosomal iron metabolism, which causes iron deficiency in the cytoplasm and in mitochondria. This results in activation of the pseudo-hypoxia response, loss of mitochondrial function and cell death. These effects were all ablated by iron repletion in a form that can be imported across the plasma membrane, independently of the lysosomes. Notably, iron deficiency is sufficient to trigger inflammatory signaling in cultured neurons as well as in vivo. A mouse model of impaired lysosomal acidification shows iron deficiency, activation of the pseudo-hypoxia response, and pervasive inflammation, all detectable long before the disease onset. All these phenotypes could be rescued by increasing the levels of iron in the animal diet.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>v-ATPase inhibition triggers hypoxia-inducible factor-mediated response</title><p>With the goal of identifying signaling events caused by impaired organelle acidification, we analyzed several transcriptome datasets of cells treated with the v-ATPase inhibitor bafilomycin. These datasets include bafilomycin treatment of HeLa cells (GSE16870) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Straud et al., 2010</xref>), colon carcinoma cells (GSE47836) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">DÃ¼rrbaum et al., 2014</xref>) and retinal pigment epithelial cells (GSE60570) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Santaguida et al., 2015</xref>). We performed multi-dimensional transcriptome analyses in these datasets, aiming at the identification of signaling pathways, networks and transcription factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Murdoch et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Raimundo et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Raimundo et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Schroeder et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Tyynismaa et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">West et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Yambire et al., 2019</xref>). We reasoned that those transcription factors (TF) showing similar behavior in the three datasets of bafilomycin-treated cells would be the main regulators of the response to loss of acidification, independently of the cell type. Therefore, we crossed the TF list associated with each dataset, to determine which of those were involved in all three datasets, and found eight common TF, of which seven were predicted as active and one as repressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). These TF are associated with autophagy (NUPR1), cholesterol homeostasis (SREBF1, SREBF2), hypoxia response (HIF-1Î± and EPAS1, which is also known as HIF-2Î±) and diverse stress responses (p53, myc, FoxO3a), and form a highly interconnected network (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). To determine which biological processes were associated with these TF, and identify which of them were most upstream, we performed a pathway analysis using Metascape, and found that the most affected processes dealt with cellular response to hypoxia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Lysosomal v-ATPase inhibition triggers HIF-1Î± activation.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Venn diagram illustrating common significantly changed upstream regulators (shown as a table) mediating differential gene expression in bafilomycin (Baf)-treated cells in three different transcriptome datasets from HeLa, HCT116 and RPE cells.

Furthermore, HIF-2Î± (EPAS1), whose activation mechanism is similar to HIF-1Î±, is also part of the TF list. The HIF transcription factors function as heterodimers of a regulated Î±-subunit and the constitutive Î²-subunit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Majmundar et al., 2010</xref>). The Î± subunits are regulated post-translationally by the prolyl hydroxylases. These enzymes are di-oxygenases of the Î±-ketoglutarate-dependent superfamily, and hydroxylate HIF-1Î± and HIF-2Î± in the presence of O<sub>2</sub>, Fe<sup>2+</sup> and Î±-ketoglutarate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Majmundar et al., 2010</xref>). Hydroxylated HIF-1Î± and HIF-2Î± are then recognized by the ubiquitin ligase VHL and targeted to the proteasome for degradation. Notably, the protein levels of HIF-1Î± were increased in bafilomycin (or Baf in figures)-treated fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). A similar result was obtained in fibroblasts treated with a different inhibitor of the lysosomal v-ATPase, saliphenylhalamide (henceforth, saliphe [or Sal in figures]) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). It is known that iron chelation results in HIF-1Î± accumulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Wang and Semenza, 1993</xref>); so, as positive control for the HIF-1Î± protein accumulation, we treated cells with an iron chelator, deferoxamine (Dfo in figures). Deferoxamine treatment resulted in the expected robust increase in HIF-1Î± protein levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Accumulation of HIF-1Î± can be caused by decreased function of the prolyl hydroxylases or decreased levels of O<sub>2,</sub> Fe<sup>2+</sup>, VHL or Î±-ketoglutarate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Raimundo et al., 2011</xref>). Because the fibroblasts used in this study are maintained under normoxic conditions, the lack of O<sub>2</sub> is not a factor. We therefore tested if VHL, Î±-ketoglutarate or Fe<sup>2+</sup> could explain the accumulation of HIF-1Î± and HIF-2Î±. The protein levels of VHL were not changed in bafilomycin-treated fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). To test if the reason why HIF-1Î± was accumulating upon v-ATPase inhibition was due to decreased levels of Î±-ketoglutarate, we added a cell-permeant form of Î±-ketoglutarate to the bafilomycin-treated fibroblasts, and found no decrease in the accumulation of HIF-1Î± (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Then, we tested if there were any perturbations in Fe levels. We therefore assessed the total, Fe<sup>2+</sup> and Fe<sup>3+</sup> levels in bafilomycin-treated and control fibroblasts, and found a robust decrease in total, Fe<sup>2+</sup> and Fe<sup>3+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). The hydroxylation of HIF-1Î±, which leads to its ubiquitination and degradation, is Fe<sup>2+</sup>-depedent, and therefore lower Fe<sup>2+</sup> levels are in agreement with the accumulation of HIF-1Î±. Altogether, these results suggest that perturbation of Fe homeostasis by v-ATPase inhibition triggers the pseudo-hypoxia HIF-mediated response, in agreement with a prior study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Miles et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>When the cytoplasmic Fe<sup>2+</sup> levels are low, intracellular iron is mobilized by autophagy of ferritin (ferritinophagy) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Mancias et al., 2014</xref>) and mitochondria (mitophagy) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Allen et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Schiavi et al., 2015</xref>), which deliver iron directly to the lysosomes (via autophagosomes). In parallel, transferrin receptor uptake first releases iron in the endosomes, which is then delivered by kiss-and-run to mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hamdi et al., 2016</xref>) or released to the cytoplasm. In the endosomes/lysosomes, Fe<sup>3+</sup> is reduced to Fe<sup>2+</sup> by the enzyme STEAP3, and Fe<sup>2+</sup> (but not Fe<sup>3+</sup>) is released to the cytoplasm by DMT1 (SLC11A2) or MCOLN1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dong et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Touret et al., 2003</xref>). To test whether vATPase inhibition results in cytoplasmic Fe<sup>2+</sup> deficiency due to retention of iron in the lysosomes, we purified lysosomes from fibroblasts using an immunoprecipitation protocol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abu-Remaileh et al., 2017</xref>). The lysosomes obtained from control and bafilomycin-treated fibroblasts showed enrichment in lysosomal proteins (e.g. LAMP1), while mitochondrial (VDAC1, TOM20), endoplasmic reticulum (VAPB), peroxisomal (PEX5) and cytoplasmic proteins (HPRT, GAPDH) were only detected in the input lanes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>). Using these purified lysosomes, we measured their total iron content, and found a robust increase in lysosomal iron in the bafilomycin-treated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref>) in agreement with the retention of iron in lysosomes following impaired lysosomal acidification.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Lysosomal vATPase inhibition causes functional iron deficiency</title><p>The cytoplasmic concentration of Fe<sup>2+</sup> is controlled by the iron regulatory protein 1 (IRP1), the IRP2 and the ferritinophagy receptor NCOA4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Mancias et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Rouault, 2015</xref>). When the levels of cytoplasmic Fe<sup>2+</sup> are down, IRP activity mediates a reduction in the expression of the iron storage protein ferritin, and an increase in transferrin receptor leading to extracellular (transferrin-bound) iron uptake (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Rouault, 2015</xref>).</p><p>We first tested if the lower cellular Fe<sup>2+</sup> levels when the v-ATPase is inhibited can affect iron homeostasis. We monitored cellular iron homeostasis by measuring the protein levels of ferritin light (FTL1) and heavy chain (FTH1) subunits and the transcript levels of transferrin receptor (TFRC). The lysosomal chelator deferoxamine, was used as positive control given that it retains iron in the lysosome and thus impedes its release to the cytoplasm, thus triggering functional iron deficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Doulias et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kurz et al., 2006</xref>). As TFRC mRNA has a 3â iron responsive element, its transcript levels are expected to increase upon iron deficiency. We observed in fibroblasts treated with the v-ATPase inhibitors, bafilomycin and saliphe, increased <italic>Tfrc</italic> transcript levels and decreased protein amounts of FTL1 and FTH1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). As expected, deferoxamine treatment resulted in increased <italic>Tfrc</italic> transcript (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1A</xref>) and decreased protein levels of the ferritin light and heavy chain subunits, FTL1 and FTH1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Importantly, the treatment with Deferoxamine does not impact lysosomal function, as assessed by the protein levels of autophagy markers SQSTM1 and LC3B-II (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1B</xref>).

Notably, iron deficiency elicited by bafilomycin is not a consequence of the concentration employed, as lower concentration yields a similar result (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1C</xref>). Similarly, chloroquine, a lysosomotrophic weak base, which perturbs lysosomal acidification by dissipating the pH gradient across the lysosomal membrane but not by inhibiting the vATPase, also results in functional iron deficiency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1C</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Lysosomal iron efflux regulates HIF-1Î± response.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Increased <italic>Tfrc</italic> transcript levels in 500 nM Baf- and 500 nM Sal-treated mouse embryonic fibroblasts relative to untreated fibroblasts.Â Western blot showing decreased FTH1 and FTL1 protein levels in Baf- and Sal-treated fibroblasts (nÂ =Â 6).

To ensure that his effect was specifically due to Fe, Na-citrate was used as control. This result underscores that the iron homeostatic response is regulated by the cytoplasmic iron levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Rouault, 2015</xref>), and that retention of iron in the lysosome triggers cytoplasmic iron deficiency, which can be resolved by iron import independently of the endolysosomal pathway.</p><p>To directly test if the accumulation of HIF-1Î± upon v-ATPase inhibition was due to the perturbation in Fe homeostasis, we supplemented the growth medium of the bafilomycin- or saliphe-treated fibroblasts with Fe-citrate, which restored HIF-1Î± to the barely detectable amounts observed in control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). The striking normalization of ferritin levels upon Fe-citrate supplementation of bafilomycin-treated fibroblasts further underscores that Fe-citrate is being taken up by the cells and resolves the iron deficiency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>).</p><p>To further probe the impact of HIF-1Î± accumulation upon v-ATPase inhibition, we tested if the transcriptional targets of HIF-1Î± were affected.

Interestingly, treatment of fibroblasts with the lysosomal iron chelator deferoxamine resulted in virtual absence of mitochondrial respiratory chain activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1C</xref>). Notably, supplementation of the medium with Fe-citrate was sufficient to return mitochondrial respiratory chain activity to normal levels in cells treated with bafilomycin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>), saliphe (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>) or with deferoxamine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1D</xref>).</p><p>We then explored what may be driving the decrease in mitochondrial respiration. Multiple causes are possible, including a decrease in the mass or the quality of the mitochondrial network, or a metabolic shift that shunts pyruvate away from aerobic metabolism. First, we assessed the protein levels of respiratory chain subunits in whole cell extracts by Western blot, and observed that they are decreased when v-ATPase is inhibited (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). Similar results were observed in fibroblasts treated with the iron chelator deferoxamine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>), chloroquine or lower concentration of bafilomycin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1F</xref>). To assess mitochondrial mass, we measured the protein levels of the proteins VDAC1 and Tom20, which are highly abundant in the outer mitochondrial membrane. We found a decrease in VDAC1 and Tom20 levels in v-ATPase-inhibited cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1E</xref>). Next, we tested if the mitochondrial network was affected by v-ATPase inhibition, and observed a robust phenotype of mitochondrial fragmentation and swelling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>).</p><p>Because autophagy is impaired in fibroblasts treated with v-ATPase inhibitors but not in deferoxamine-treated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1B</xref>), and the effect on mitochondrial mass is similar in vATPase-inhibited or deferoxamine-treated cells, increased mitophagy cannot explain the decrease in mitochondrial mass. Therefore, we tested if the transcriptional program of mitochondrial biogenesis was affected. We measured the transcript levels of several mitochondrial respiratory chain subunits (all encoded in the nuclear DNA), and found that they all presented a robust down-regulation when treated with bafilomycin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1G</xref>), or with saliphe (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1H</xref>). A similar effect was observed when the fibroblasts were treated with deferoxamine, as previously shown by Pagliarini and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Rensvold et al., 2013</xref>). Notably, supplementation of the cell medium with Fe-citrate returned the transcript levels of the mitochondrial respiratory chain subunits to control levels in bafilomycin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>) or saliphe treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1I</xref>). The protein levels of several mitochondrial subunits also show a recovery to control levels when Fe-citrate is given together with bafilomycin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1J</xref>).</p><p>Finally, we also assessed the efficiency of electron transfer along the mitochondrial respiratory chain by estimating the levels of superoxide (O<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup>., the product of a single-electron reduction of O<sub>2</sub>), which is a byproduct of inefficient electron transfer along the chain. Using the mitochondria-targeted superoxide-sensitive dye MitoSox, we observed a sharp increase in MitoSox levels in bafilomycin-treated fibroblasts, almost completely recovered in the fibroblasts that also received Fe-citrate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref>). We probed the levels of pro-oxidant molecules (superoxide, hydroxyl radical, among others) using the probe dichlorofluoresceine (DCF), which reacts with many reactive oxygen species (ROS). We observed a sharp increase in DCF intensity in bafilomycin-treated cells, which was normalized by co-treatment with Fe-citrate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1K</xref>). A similar pattern is observed with the dye BODIPY C11, which reports the levels of oxidized membrane phospholipids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1L</xref>). The increased levels of mitochondrial superoxide, ROS and lipid peroxidation were recapitulated in saliphe-treated fibroblasts and rescued following co-treatment with Fe-citrate (data not shown). Overall, these results show that mitochondrial biogenesis and function require iron, made available to the cytoplasm by the endolysosomal system or via direct transport through the plasma membrane (Fe-citrate supplementation). In the absence of iron, mitochondrial function is impaired and generates more superoxide, promoting an oxidative shift in the cellular redox environment.</p><p>We then set to test whether the cells with genetic perturbation of lysosomal acidification also presented mitochondrial defects. Using the <italic>Atp6v1h</italic>-silenced fibroblasts, we observed a robust decrease in their mitochondrial respiratory chain activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3âfigure supplement 2A</xref>), decreased protein levels of several OXPHOS subunits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3âfigure supplement 2B</xref>) and decreased mitochondrial biogenesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3âfigure supplement 2C</xref>). Taken together, genetic and pharmacologic impairment of lysosomal acidification yields similar effects on iron homeostasis and mitochondrial function.</p><p>Because retention of iron, due to impaired lysosomal acidification, triggers iron deficiency and mitochondrial dysfunction, we sought to test if the removal of lysosomal iron exporters, independently of acidification, could recapitulate the phenotype. Iron can be released from the lysosomes by DMT1 (SLC11A2) or MCOLN1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dong et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Touret et al., 2003</xref>). Therefore, we used fibroblasts obtained from <italic>Mcoln1</italic>-KO mice (and WT littermates), and silenced <italic>Slc11a2</italic> using siRNA. We confirmed the efficiency of <italic>Slc11a2</italic> silencing by qPCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3âfigure supplement 2D</xref>). The individual loss of <italic>Mcoln1</italic> or <italic>Slc11a2</italic>, as well as the simultaneous loss of both, triggered an increase in the transcript levels of <italic>Tfrc</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3âfigure supplement 2E</xref>) and a decrease in the protein levels of FTL1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3âfigure supplement 2F</xref>). Mitochondrial respiration was robustly inhibited in the absence of <italic>Mcoln1</italic> and/or <italic>Slc11a2</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3âfigure supplement 2F</xref>), which was underscored by the decrease in the protein levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3âfigure supplement 2G</xref>) and transcript levels of OXPHOS subunits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3âfigure supplement 2H</xref>). Altogether, these results show that iron retention in the lysosome results in functional iron deficiency and decreased mitochondrial biogenesis and function.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Lysosomal Fe<sup>2+</sup> efflux is required for cell proliferation in a mitochondrial respiratory chain-dependent manner</title><p>Given the importance of iron to many cellular processes, we tested whether iron-deficiency induced by v-ATPase inhibition could affect cell proliferation.

The addition of the mitochondrial respiratory chain complex III inhibitor antimycin A to bafilomycin-treated iron-supplemented fibroblasts ablated the recovery in cell viability conferred by the iron supplementation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). A similar result was observed in saliphe-treated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>) and in deferoxamine-treated fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4âfigure supplement 1C</xref>).</p><p>Next, we sought to characterize the cell death phenotype in response to v-ATPase inhibition. We first looked for apoptotic markers such as cleaved (active) caspase three and cleaved PARP (caspase three substrate). We could not detect either cleaved caspase-3 or cleaved PARP in bafilomycin- (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>) or saliphe-treated fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4âfigure supplement 1D</xref>), despite they were readily detectable in cells treated with the apoptosis inducer staurosporine. Accordingly, pan-caspase inhibitor ZVAD had no attenuating effect on cell death in bafilomycin- or saliphe-treated fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>), further supporting that the cell death in these conditions is not apoptotic. We then tested if the cell death induced by v-ATPase inhibition was sensitive to necrostatin (inhibitor of necrosis) or to ferrostatin (inhibitor of ferroptosis). Necrostatin-1s, which can decrease necroptotic cell death by inhibiting RIP1 kinase, had no effect on the cell death caused by v-ATPase inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4âfigure supplement 1E</xref>). Ferrostatin, an inhibitor of ferroptosis, also had no effect on v-ATPase inhibition-induced cell death (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H</xref>), despite it effectively inhibited cell death triggered by the ferroptosis inducer erastin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4âfigure supplement 1F</xref>). Therefore, v-ATPase inhibition triggers caspase-independent, RIP1K-independent, ferrostatin-unrelated cell death. These results are consistent with the previously reported caspase-independent bafilomycin-induced cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Yan et al., 2016</xref>). In agreement with this finding, the analysis of the three transcriptome datasets of bafilomycin-treated cells that were used in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> ranks necrosis (and not apoptosis) as the top cell death mechanism (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary files 1</xref>â<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">3</xref> tables S1-S3).</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Iron deficiency triggers cell-autonomous inflammatory gene expression</title><p>The occurrence of non-apoptotic cell death is often associated with triggering of sterile inflammatory responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Rock and Kono, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Weinlich et al., 2017</xref>).

The change in iron levels in the diet is most efficient when it occurs at weaning. Thus, upon separating the litters from the mothers (at post-natal day 21), we gave the weaned mice an iron-enriched diet (500 mg Fe/Kg) or a control diet (179 mg Fe/Kg). We followed the mice until they were two months of age, and measured mtDNA copy number in the cortex.

Furthermore, we establish the role of (endo)lysosomal acidification as a key step in cellular iron homeostasis. Notably, the inflammatory signaling triggered by (endo)lysosomal malfunction-induced iron deficiency can be ablated by supplementation of iron that bypasses the endo-lysosomal pathway.</p><p>We show here that iron release from (endo)lysosomes to cytoplasm requires acidic pH. This step is key to maintaining appropriate cytoplasmic iron levels. When the (endo)lysosomes are not properly acidified, Fe<sup>3+</sup> obtained from ferritinophagy, mitophagy or transferrin endocytosis cannot be reduced to Fe<sup>2+</sup>. This reduction is catalyzed by the ferroreductase STEAP3, which has an optimal acidic pH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lambe et al., 2009</xref>). The inability to reduce Fe<sup>3+</sup> to Fe<sup>2+</sup> results in the accumulation of Fe<sup>3+</sup> in the lysosomes, since only Fe<sup>2+</sup> can be exported via the channels divalent metal transporter 1 (DMT1) or mucolipin-1 (MCOLN1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dong et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Touret et al., 2003</xref>). In addition to the excess of iron in the lysosomes, there is lack of it in the cytoplasm. The proteins that sense cellular iron function are located in the cytoplasm, implying that cytoplasmic Fe levels determine when the cellular iron deficiency response is activated. Low Fe levels result in the conversion of aconitase in IRP1 and stabilization of IRP2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Rouault, 2015</xref>). Together, these proteins promote iron mobilization and uptake, while repressing its storage and export from the cell. This program is carried out by repressing the translation of ferritin heavy and light chains (to inhibit storage), and by stimulating the expression of transferrin receptor (TFRC), in order to increase the uptake of iron. This response keeps Fe within a tight range of concentrations. We show here that this program of iron homeostasis requires functional lysosomes. When lysosomes are defective, either by treatment with v-ATPase inhibitors or by genetic mutations that impair their acidification, the iron homeostatic cycle is also impaired because iron cannot be released in sufficient amounts to the cytoplasm.</p><p>Iron is an essential microelement, and life relies on iron availability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Rouault, 2015</xref>). Accordingly, inhibition of lysosomal v-ATPase and the consequent iron deficiency result in cell death. It can be argued that this is due to toxicity of the inhibitors used, or to effects in other cellular organelles (the v-ATPase is also present at the Golgi and in synaptic vesicles) or processes. Nevertheless, the simple repletion of iron through an (endo)lysosome-independent pathway was sufficient to restore cell proliferation almost to control levels. Therefore, the main contributor to cell death caused by impaired (endo)lysosomal acidification seems to be iron deficiency. We determined that the cell death caused by iron deficiency is non-apoptotic, which likely contributes to the inflammation observed in vivo in the brain of a mouse model of lysosomal malfunction (<italic>Gaa</italic>-KO). In addition, iron deficiency was sufficient to trigger inflammatory signaling in cultured primary cortical neurons. While we cannot exclude the possibility that neuronal cell death in culture was sensed by astrocytes or glia that are present in the culture (primary neurons typically have a small number of co-cultured astrocytes and microglia), our results suggest that the inflammation trigger is cell-intrinsic.</p><p>Many cellular processes rely on iron, from DNA replication (the synthesis of dNTPs is Fe-dependent) to metabolism (mitochondrial respiratory chain relies on Fe-S clusters) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Rouault, 2015</xref>). Importantly, mitochondrial respiratory chain and oxidative phosphorylation subunits are encoded by two genomes, the nuclear DNA and the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA). There is no dedicated de novo production of dNTPs for mtDNA synthesis, and mtDNA replication relies mostly on the cytoplasmic dNTP production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Copeland, 2012</xref>). A key step in dNTP production is catalyzed by the enzyme ribonucleotide reductase, a heterodimeric protein that has Fe in its active center (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Puig et al., 2017</xref>). Decreased availability of dNTPs is a known cause of mtDNA instability, which in turn is an inflammatory trigger. We show here that iron deficiency perturbs mtDNA homeostasis, regardless of the cell type (fibroblasts, neurons) or the mechanism (genetic, pharmacologic) that leads to iron deficiency. We also show here that the levels of mtDNA decrease sharply in iron deficiency. This effect is akin to what is observed in the mice lacking one allele of the mitochondrial transcription factor A (TFAM), a protein needed to replicate, transcribe and stabilize mtDNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Ekstrand et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">West et al., 2015</xref>). In the <italic>Tfam<sup>+/-</sup></italic> mice, mtDNA instability triggers interferon-dependent signaling that culminates in potent inflammatory responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">West et al., 2015</xref>). We show here that iron deficiency, either caused by iron chelation, genetic ablation of <italic>Irp1</italic> or <italic>Irp2</italic>, or genetic defects impairing lysosomal acidification, is associated both with mtDNA instability and inflammation, in vitro and, importantly, in vivo. Notably, supplying iron via an endo/lysosome-independent route resolved the iron deficiency response, the loss of mtDNA and the inflammatory signaling.</p><p>Another process that depends on iron is the activity of the Î±-ketoglutarate-dependent superfamily of dioxygenases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Raimundo et al., 2011</xref>). These enzymes transfer oxygen atoms to different substrates, in a manner that is dependent on O<sub>2</sub>, Fe<sup>2+</sup> and Î±-ketoglutarate. Absence of any of these factors or accumulation of succinate (a product of these reactions) results in inhibition of the dioxygenases. The prolyl hydroxylases are part of the Î±-ketoglutarate-dependent superfamily, and catalyze the hydroxylation of the Î±-subunit of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF-1Î±). After hydroxylation, HIF-1Î± is recognized by the ubiquitin ligase VHL, and labeled for proteasomal degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Raimundo et al., 2011</xref>). HIF-1Î± is therefore constitutively expressed and readily degraded under normal conditions, and thus barely detectable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Raimundo et al., 2011</xref>). However, in the absence of VHL or when the function of prolyl hydroxylases is impaired, HIF-1Î± accumulates and triggers a transcriptional program known as (pseudo-)hypoxia response. Therefore, the activation of HIF signaling is a novel consequence of impaired lysosomal acidificationÂ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Miles et al., 2017</xref>). It is noteworthy to point out that there may be other routes by which the lysosomal function regulates HIF-1Î±, particularly its degradation via chaperone-mediated autophagy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hubbi et al., 2013</xref>). Notably, HIF signaling can also be activated by mitochondrial malfunction, particularly loss-of-function of the citrate cycle enzymes fumarate hydratase or succinate dehydrogenase, which results in the accumulation of fumarate and succinate, and in the consequent inhibition of the prolyl hydroxylases. Therefore, HIF-1Î± can be seen as a sensor of the mitochondrial-lysosomal axis. Reciprocally, it can also be noted that the constitutive silencing of the (pseudo)hypoxia response requires both functional lysosomes and functional mitochondria. This aspect illustrates a specific mechanism of cooperation between different organelles, in this case, between mitochondria and lysosomes.</p><p>We and others have recently unveiled several signaling pathways by which dysfunctional mitochondria result in lysosomal impairment, or vice-versa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Demers-Lamarche et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">FernÃ¡ndez-Mosquera et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fernandez-Mosquera et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Osellame et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Yambire et al., 2019</xref>). This mutually destructive relationship between mitochondria and lysosomes is particularly detrimental in neurodegenerative diseases. For example, many of the genes that cause inherited Parkinsonâs disease are associated either with mitochondria or lysosomes/autophagy, and therefore the primarily-damaged organelle is likely to promote the secondary impairment of the other.</p><p>This manuscript presents a novel role of mitochondria-lysosome crosstalk in the regulation of central nervous system inflammation in vivo.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides"

After induction of anaesthesia by intraperitoneal injection of ketamine (100 mg/kg b.w.) and xylazine (10 mg/kg b.w.), animals were intubated with a purpose-built polyethylene endotracheal tube (0.58 mm inner diameter, 0.96 mm outer diameter) and artificially ventilated using an animal respirator (TSE, Bad Homberg, Germany) with a respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute and an estimated tidal volume of 0.35 ml under 0.5% isoflurane as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Watanabe et al., 2016</xref>). The animals were then placed in a prone position on a purpose-built palate holder equipped with an adjustable nose cone. Respiratory movement of the abdomen as well as rectal temperature were monitored by a unit supplied by the manufacturer (Bruker Biospin MRI GmbH, Ettlingen, Germany). At 9.4 T (Bruker Biospin MRI GmbH, Ettlingen, Germany), localized proton MRS (STEAM, TR/TE/TMÂ =Â 6000/10/10 ms) was performed with the use of a birdcage resonator (inner diameter 70 mm) and a saddle-shaped quadrature surface coil (both Bruker Biospin MRI GmbH, Ettlingen, Germany) on anesthetized mice as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Watanabe et al., 2016</xref>). Shimming of the B<sub>0</sub> field was carried out by FASTMAP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gruetter, 1993</xref>). A (20 mm)<sup>3</sup> volume-of-interest was centered on the right striatum (squares in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4âfigure supplement 1D</xref>). Water saturation was accomplished by means of three Gaussian-shaped CHESS radiofrequency (RF) pulses (90Â°â90Â°â180Â°), each of which with a duration of 7.83 ms and a bandwidth of 350 Hz. Overall duration of the CHESS module was 147 ms. Each CHESS pulse was followed by an associated spoiler gradient and a 37 ms outer volume saturation module covering a range of 3 mm around the volume-of-interest without gap. Metabolite quantification involved spectral evaluation by LCModel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Provencher, 1993</xref>) and calibration with brain water concentration of 79% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Duarte et al., 2014</xref>), for which the unsuppressed water proton signal served as internal reference. Metabolites with Cramer-Rao lower bounds above 20% were excluded from further analysis. Relaxation times and magnetization transfer ratios are determined in selected regions of the brain. T<sub>2</sub> relaxation times of water protons were determined by a multi-echo spin-echo MRI (TR/TEÂ =Â 2500/10â123 ms). T<sub>1</sub> relaxation times were determined with the use of a spin-echo saturation recovery sequence and 7 TR values from 0.15 to 6 s.

Means of control samples are typically centered at one (or 100%) to ensure easier comparisons unless otherwise noted. Estimated p values are either stated as the actual values or denoted by *p&lt;0.05; **p&lt;0.01; ***p&lt;0.001. Differences were only considered as statistically significant when the p value was less than 0.05.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2-2"><title>Data and software availability</title><p>The microarray and RNA sequencing data analysis was performed using Partek Software Suite. Microarray data analysis was performed as described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Raimundo et al. (2009)</xref>, using RMA normalization. RNAseq data was aligned to the reference genome mm10 by the BowTie algorithm, and the transcripts were quantified using the âmm10 - Ensembl Transcripts release 95â as reference. For differential expression analysis, Bonferroni multi-test correction was applied, and adjusted p-value&lt;0.05 was considered significant. Ingenuity Pathway Analysis was used for assessment of transcription factor activity, as described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Yambire et al. (2019)</xref>. The RNAseq data generated in this study from the <italic>Gaa</italic>-KO and WT cortices is deposited in Gene Expression Omnibus under the serial number GSE134704.</p></sec></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This work was supported by a Starting Grant from the European Research Council (337327, MitoPexLyso), to NR.

requests and the accompanying author responses.</p></boxed-text><p><bold>Acceptance summary:</bold></p><p>There is broad interest in diseases related to loss of lysosome acidification, and your studies on the link between this process and cellular iron regulation have important implications for our understanding of the etiology of a number of disease processes and the links between lysosome and mitochondrial function and inflammatory signaling.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Impaired lysosomal acidification triggers iron deficiency, necrotic cell death and inflammation in vivo&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Suzanne Pfeffer as the Reviewing and Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Peter S McPherson (Reviewer #1).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>In this manuscript Raimundo and colleagues investigate how inhibition of lysosomal acidification impacts cellular iron homeostasis, inflammation and cell death. The authors pursue mechanistic studies in cultured cells, before moving into an in vivo model of lysosome dysfunction, and develop a model that links lysosome de-acidification to cytosolic iron deficiency, inflammatory gene expression and motor dysfunction. This is a well-written manuscript that presents a number of interesting findings in a clear and logical manner.</p><p>Before publication can be recommended, the following issues need to be addressed to ensure that the small molecule reagents you have employed are consistent with the conclusions of your study.</p><p>1) Bafilomycin A is used to study loss of lysosomal acidification. To ensure that this is the case (as opposed to an unrelated effect of v-ATPase inhibition), compounds that dissipate or clamp lysosomal pH in an vATPase-independent manner (i.e. chloroquine) should be tested; Also, there are some concerns about the concentration of Baf used. 500nM is much higher than the IC50, which is in the low nanomolar. To rule out indirect effects, it would be important to carry out RNAi of an essential vATPase subunit and determine whether it also results in activation of the hypoxic response and disrupted mitochondrial function.</p><p>2) The authors imply that v-ATPase inhibition results in build-up of iron in the lysosome. Whole-cell measurements of iron levels show a decrease in both Fe<sup>2+</sup> and Fe<sup>3+</sup> following Baf treatment (Figure 1E). However, if iron is trapped in lysosomes, the expectation is that its subcellular distribution should be altered, not its total concentrations. The authors could repeat the iron measurements described in the Materials and methods after fractionating the cells to separate light organelle fraction from cytosol (an easy procedure that should confirm reduced cytosolic iron levels), or upon lysosomal immunoprecipitation (i.e. PMID: 29074583). If iron accumulation within lysosomes is the ultimate cause of the observed mitochondrial dysfunction, this phenotype should be recapitulated by ablation of the main iron-exporting permeases, SLC11A2 and MCOLN1, either individually or in combination.</p><p>3) An alternative explanation for the observed mitochondrial dysfunction in Baf-treated cells is impairment of mitophagy. Are Baf-dependent induction of the hypoxic response and mitochondrial dysfunction identical between wild-type cells and cells lacking essential autophagic factors (i.e. Atg7)?</p><p>4) The authors use a RIPK-1 inhibitor, known as necrostatin, to imply a role for necroptosis in Baf-induced cell death. It should be noted that the specificity of action of necrostatin is questionable (i.e. <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1038/cddis.2012.176">https://doi.org/10.1038/cddis.2012.176</ext-link>), thus it is highly recommended that the authors further support this conclusion with RNAi-based experiments. Demonstration that the cell death process is necroptosis may be beyond the scope of the present story and could be removed.</p><p>5) The GAA-defective cells and mice are assumed, but not shown, to have defective lysosomal acidification. Given the importance of this assumption for their model, the authors should re-check it on their own at least in the cell model. Also, GAA loss has more ample consequences than just loss of lysosomal acidity. This caveat should be acknowledged and adequately discussed.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.51031.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>[â¦]</p><p>1) Bafilomycin is used to study loss of lysosomal acidification.

The authors could repeat the iron measurements described in the Materials and methods after fractionating the cells to separate light organelle fraction from cytosol (an easy procedure that should confirm reduced cytosolic iron levels), or upon lysosomal immunoprecipitation (i.e. PMID: 29074583). If iron accumulation within lysosomes is the ultimate cause of the observed mitochondrial dysfunction, this phenotype should be recapitulated by ablation of the main iron-exporting permeases, SLC11A2 and MCOLN1, either individually or in combination.</p></disp-quote><p>We isolated lysosomes using the method suggested by the reviewers, and obtained a clean lysosomal preparation without endoplasmic reticulum or mitochondrial contaminants (new Figure1H). In agreement with the rest of our data, we observed an increase in total Fe levels in the lysosome following treatment with 50nM bafilomycin (new Figure 1G). We tested <italic>Mcoln1</italic>-KO fibroblasts, in which we silenced <italic>Slc11a2</italic> (DMT1), to affect both lysosomal iron exporters simultaneously. We observed decreased ferritin light chain protein levels and increased transferrin receptor (supporting the iron deficiency phenotype), decreased O<sub>2</sub> consumption and decreased OXPHOS subunits protein and transcript levels, (Figure 3âfigure supplement 2D-H).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) An alternative explanation for the observed mitochondrial dysfunction in Baf-treated cells is impairment of mitophagy. Are Baf-dependent induction of the hypoxic response and mitochondrial dysfunction identical between wild-type cells and cells lacking essential autophagic factors (i.e. Atg7)?</p></disp-quote><p>While it is expectable that vATPase inhibition impacts the autophagic pathway, and therefore mitophagy, the decrease in mitochondrial protein levels suggests that mitophagy is not the primary driver of the phenotype, which seems rather a consequence of the inhibition of the transcriptional program of mitochondrial biogenesis (even when the transcriptional program of mitochondrial biogenesis is down-regulated but mitophagy is impaired, we can observe a strong accumulation of mitochondrial proteins and mass, as described in our recent study Yambire et al., 2019). This is further supported by the rescue of mitochondrial mass and function when the cell medium is supplemented with Fe-citrate simultaneously with bafilomycin or Saliphe treatments without affecting levels of SQSTM1 and LC3B.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The authors use a RIPK-1 inhibitor, known as necrostatin, to imply a role for necroptosis in Baf-induced cell death. It should be noted that the specificity of action of necrostatin is questionable (i.e. <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.nature.com/articles/cddis2012176">https://www.nature.com/articles/cddis2012176</ext-link>), thus it is highly recommended that the authors further support this conclusion with RNAi-based experiments. Demonstration that the cell death process is necroptosis may be beyond the scope of the present story and could be removed.</p></disp-quote><p>We tested the more stable Nec1s. At the suggested concentrations for Nec1s, we didnât find inhibition of bafilomycin- or saliphe-induced cell death (Figure 4âfigure supplement 1E). We agree with the reviewers that detailing the exact mechanism of cell death in this context is not absolutely essential and will deviate from the main message of this study. Therefore, we reworded the text, and refer to the cell death process as non-apoptotic, and moved most of these data to a supplementary figure.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The GAA-defective cells and mice are assumed, but not shown, to have defective lysosomal acidification. Given the importance of this assumption for their model, the authors should re-check it on their own at least in the cell model. Also, GAA loss has more ample consequences than just loss of lysosomal acidity. This caveat should be acknowledged and adequately discussed.</p></disp-quote><p>We have tested the lysosomal pH in the <italic>Gaa</italic><sup>-/-</sup> fibroblasts, and observed decreased acidification (new Figure 2F-G), in agreement with the findings from Nina Raben and colleagues(Fukuda et al., 2006). We completely agree that the loss of GAA has broader consequences besides lysosomal acidification, and modified the text accordingly. Nevertheless, the supplementation of Fe also has a strong beneficial effect on the <italic>Gaa</italic><sup>-/-</sup> cells and <italic>Gaa</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice, suggesting that the effect of impaired lysosomal acidification in Fe homeostasis is a significant component of the response to GAA loss. We have also included the assessment of lysosomal pH when <italic>Atp6v1h</italic> is silenced, which was expectably less acidic (Figure 2âfigure supplement 1).</p></body></sub-article></article>
