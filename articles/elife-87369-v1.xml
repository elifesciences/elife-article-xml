Earlier cancer diagnosis could increase survival rates and better assessment of metastatic disease could improve patient care. As such, there is an urgent need to develop biomarkers to diagnose this deadly malignancy. Analyzing circulating extracellular vesicles (cEVs) using ‘liquid biopsies’ offers an attractive approach to diagnose and monitor disease status. However, it is important to differentiate EV-associated proteins enriched in patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) from those with benign pancreatic diseases such as chronic pancreatitis and intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (IPMN). To meet this need, we combined the novel EVtrap method for highly efficient isolation of EVs from plasma and conducted proteomics analysis of samples from 124 individuals, including patients with PDAC, benign pancreatic diseases and controls. On average, 912 EV proteins were identified per 100 µL of plasma. EVs containing high levels of PDCD6IP, SERPINA12, and RUVBL2 were associated with PDAC compared to the benign diseases in both discovery and validation cohorts. EVs with PSMB4, RUVBL2, and ANKAR were associated with metastasis, and those with CRP, RALB, and CD55 correlated with poor clinical prognosis. Finally, we validated a seven EV protein PDAC signature against a background of benign pancreatic diseases that yielded an 89% prediction accuracy for the diagnosis of PDAC. To our knowledge, our study represents the largest proteomics profiling of circulating EVs ever conducted in pancreatic cancer and provides a valuable open-source atlas to the scientific community with a comprehensive catalogue of novel cEVs that may assist in the development of biomarkers and improve the outcomes of patients with PDAC.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>pancreatic cancer</kwd><kwd>extracellular vesicles</kwd><kwd>biomarker</kwd><kwd>pancreatitis</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>UM1</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CA186709-06</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bockorny</surname><given-names>Bruno</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100005615</institution-id><institution>Institutional startup funds, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Muthuswamy</surname><given-names>Senthil K</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100002135</institution-id><institution>Hirshberg Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Huang</surname><given-names>Ling</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>UO1 (CA224193)</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Muthuswamy</surname><given-names>Senthil K</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Proteomic profiling of extracellular vesicle proteins from patients with benign and malignant pancreatic diseases offers a valuable resource for identifying biomarkers for pancreatic cancer detection.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) has the worst prognosis of all common tumors, with a 5-year survival of 10% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Siegel et al., 2020</xref>). With rising incidence, it is expected that PDAC will become the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths by 2030 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Rahib et al., 2014</xref>). A critical factor for this dismal development is the late diagnosis, with less than 20% of patients presenting with a potentially resectable and curable tumor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kamisawa et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Rahib et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bockorny et al., 2022</xref>). Earlier cancer diagnosis could increase the survival rates by an estimated fivefold, and more reliable and real-time assessment of treatment effects in patients with cancer could improve quality of life and reduce healthcare costs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Ghatnekar et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Matsuno et al., 2004</xref>). Unfortunately, there are no credentialed serologic biomarkers with high enough performance to assist in the early detection of PDAC. The best-established biomarker for PDAC, carbohydrate antigen 19–9 (CA19-9), is fraught with poor sensitivity and specificity and is only used for monitoring disease on treatment or after surgical resection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Locker et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Galli et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Extracellular vesicles (EVs), including exosomes and microvesicles, are nanosized particles released by most cell types and can be detected in the circulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chen et al., 2017</xref>). EVs play important roles in transmission of oncogenic and inflammatory signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Costa-Silva et al., 2015</xref>), communications between cells and their microenvironment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">van Niel et al., 2022</xref>). In addition, exoDNA, exoRNA and protein profiles highly reflect parental cells, therefore offering an attractive strategy for diagnosing cancers non-invasively by analyzing EVs in the circulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Costa-Silva et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Melo et al., 2015</xref>). Previous studies employed EVs to discover biomarkers for PDAC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Melo et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Madhavan et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Yang et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Castillo et al., 2018</xref>); however, those discovery proteomics experiments were carried out using cell lines or tumor tissue, which are not representative of the heterogeneity of human PDAC and are unable to recapitulate the systemic responses to cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Madhavan et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Yang et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Castillo et al., 2018</xref>). In addition, the EV biomarkers discovered in those studies have been compared only against healthy controls (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Madhavan et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Yang et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Castillo et al., 2018</xref>). It is unclear how they would perform in subjects with underlying benign diseases of the pancreas, which is highly desirable from the clinical standpoint as many patients with PDAC have underlying chronic pancreatitis and cysts.</p><p>To meet this need, we conducted a large EV proteomics study from peripheral blood across a range of patients with pancreatic cancer, benign pancreatic diseases such as chronic pancreatitis and intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (IPMN), and healthy controls. Circulating EV (cEV) proteins detected included those involved in metabolism and immune regulation, in addition to proteins involved in protein binding, exocytosis, endocytosis and regulation of cellular protein localization that have been identified in previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Fahrmann et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hoshino et al., 2020</xref>). We subsequently discovered multiple biomarker candidates for cancer diagnosis and verified several of them in an independent cohort of patients with the potential to aid in diagnosing pancreatic cancer. In addition, we identified a set of cEV proteins associated with metastasis which could provide a valuable resource for future biomarker studies.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Proteomics characterization of circulating EVs</title><p>In this study, we sought to identify proteins in extracellular vesicles in the blood that may be used as biomarkers for the diagnosis and prognosis of pancreatic cancer.

Subjects in the pancreatic cancer group (N=93) had a mean age of 66.5 years (range, 37–91), and 48.4% were female. All subjects had biopsy-proven disease. Thirty subjects had early-stage disease (stages I-II) and 63 had advanced disease (stages III-IV). Patients with benign pancreatic diseases included chronic pancreatitis (N=12) with a mean age of 57.5 years (range 37–78) and with 50% females, whereas IPMN included individuals with main duct and side branch IPMNs (N=8) with a mean age of 68.2 years (range 50–89) and with 87.5% being females.

As described in recent reports, EVtrap is a magnetic bead‐based isolation method that enables highly efficient capture of EVs from biofluids, confirmed by multiple common EV markers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Iliuk et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Wu et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Nunez Lopez et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hinzman et al., 2022a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hinzman et al., 2022b</xref>). Previous analyses using electron microscopy and nanoparticle tracking also confirmed that the vast majority of particles isolated by EVtrap had diameters between 100 and 200 nm, consistent with exosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Iliuk et al., 2020</xref>).

Previously, we reported that organoid cultures of pancreatic cancer could serve as models to discover tissue-derived EV proteins with high specificity for PDAC, as opposed to chronic pancreatitis and other benign gastrointestinal diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Huang et al., 2020</xref>). A shortcoming of these tissue-based studies is the inability to discover markers associated to the systemic responses to cancer. Here, we performed a large-scale, comprehensive analysis of circulating EV proteomes directly from plasma samples of 124 patients, with subsequent validation in a separate cohort of 36 patients. To our knowledge, this represents the largest proteomics profiling dataset of circulating EVs conducted in pancreatic cancer to date. In this study, we identified and validated new EV markers from plasma that distinguish patients with pancreatic cancer from subjects with benign pancreatic diseases. Furthermore, we discovered several cEV proteins associated with metastatic disease and poor prognosis. In contrast to the prior studies of experimental cell models or tissues extracts that were examined only against healthy subjects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Madhavan et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Yang et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Castillo et al., 2018</xref>), we report the identification of EV proteins in plasma of patients with pancreatic cancer compared to patients with underlying pancreatic diseases, which is clinically relevant as many patients with pancreatic cancer have underlying chronic inflammation and premalignant cystic lesions.</p><p>In addition, our study demonstrated the feasibility of using the novel EVtrap method <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Iliuk et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Wu et al., 2018</xref> for discovery of hundreds of EV proteins directly from a small volume (100 µL) of plasma samples. This methodological advance can be adopted for biomarker discovery in other cancer types. Other workflows traditionally employed for EV isolation from blood samples require laborious techniques including lengthy ultracentrifugation steps which are unsuitable for large-scale studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">LeBleu and Kalluri, 2020</xref>).</p><p>We identified several EV proteins as significantly associated with metastasis or survival. For instance, PSMB4 and RUVBL2 levels were increased in cEVs of patients with metastatic PDAC. Notably, PSMB4 (proteasome subunit beta type-4), a protein of the ubiquitin-proteasome degradation pathway, has been identified as the first proteasomal subunit with oncogenic properties and associated to poor prognosis in several tumors including melanoma, breast, and ovarian cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Liu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Zhang et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Zheng et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Lee et al., 2014</xref>). As expected, the EV proteomic profiles of PDAC patients exhibited significant heterogeneity. While the above-mentioned markers exhibited strong association with disease states at population levels, their abundances in individual patients varied significantly. Those observations highlight the need to develop multi-protein panels for pancreatic cancer diagnosis and prognosis.</p><p>We also discovered RALB, CRP, and CD55 expression on EVs to have a significant correlation with poor survival, while PDCD6IP expression was associated with improved outcomes. Interestingly, PDCD6IP (programmed cell death 6-interacting protein), was also identified as a PDAC-enriched protein in the tissue-based proteomics studies from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Le Large et al., 2020</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hoshino et al., 2020</xref>. In line with our findings, its tissue expression in liver metastasis of pancreatic cancer has been found to also correlate with improved prognosis in patients with PDAC in the study of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Law et al., 2020</xref>. Collectively, these data suggest that some tissue-specific proteins can be isolated from circulating EVs and their quantifiable levels in the blood may have the potential to serve as diagnostic or prognostic biomarkers in pancreatic cancer.</p><p>In our validation studies, all seven putative markers identified from the model were significantly enriched in the plasma of PDAC patients. Based on the top seven markers, we derived a seven EV protein panel that yielded an 89% prediction accuracy for diagnosing pancreatic cancer. A recent modeling study showed that a new diagnostic assay for PDAC would have to perform with a minimum sensitivity of 88% and a specificity of 85% to reduce healthcare expenditure and prolong survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Ghatnekar et al., 2013</xref>). Serum CA19-9, the best-established blood test for PDAC, has a pooled sensitivity of 75.4% and a specificity of 77.6% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Zhang et al., 2015</xref>). It commonly rises late in the disease and may be elevated in nonmalignant conditions such as biliary obstruction and pancreatitis, making it unsuitable as a diagnostic biomarker for PDAC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Duffy et al., 2010</xref>). As such, our seven EV protein signature with 89% prediction accuracy serves as a proof-of-concept and has the potential to facilitate the further development of biomarker tests for pancreatic cancer. We anticipate that for clinical use application, an even higher diagnostic performance is needed. Future studies are warranted to investigate if combining our validated cEV proteins with other biomarkers such as cell free DNA, serum proteins or metabolites, as a multi-analyte biomarker assay, would yield higher accuracy in diagnosing pancreatic cancer.</p><p>While our work involved a large cohort with 160 patients, the single-center nature is an inherent limitation of our study. Also, it would be ideal to perform validation with a larger cohort of controls to achieve greater statistical power. To balance this limitation, we increased the rigor of our validation by selecting controls with underlying benign diseases of pancreas as opposed to healthy volunteers, and an alternate quantitative technology for measuring protein abundance (Parallel Reaction Monitoring Mass Spectrometry) instead of MS-LC. While this approach increased the generalizability, it marginally reduced model prediction. Thus, the performance of our seven EV protein PDAC panel should be cross-validated in larger and multicenter populations. In addition, in this work we only used EVtrap as EV isolation method and mass spectrometry for protein quantification, and it is possible that there was some degree of heterogeneity in the extracellular vesicles analyzed. The clinical impact of biomarkers identified in our study will need to be cross-validated using other methods.</p><p>With no major treatment breakthrough for pancreatic cancer in the last decade, every effort should be made to diagnose this deadly cancer at earlier stages and to discover new proteins involved in tumorigenesis. Our study provides a valuable open resource to the scientific community with a comprehensive catalog of novel proteins packaged inside circulating EVs that may assist in the development of novel biomarkers and improve the outcomes of patients with pancreatic cancer.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Study design and patient demographics</title><p>We conducted this study at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center with the approval of the Harvard Cancer Center Institutional Review Board (IRB#17–640).

The spiked-in 11-peptides standard mixture was used to account for any variation in retention times and to normalize abundance levels among samples. 10 μL of each sample was injected into an Ultimate 3000 nano UHPLC system (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Peptides were captured on a 2 cm Acclaim PepMap trap column and separated on a heated 50 cm Acclaim PepMap column (Thermo Fisher Scientific) containing C18 resin.

Recognizing that classification models built on an extensive array of proteins may incorporate irrelevant markers, which can diminish the predictive accuracy, we started with a list of significantly differentially expressed set of 91 proteins between ‘benign’ and ‘PDAC’ patients and further employed a consensus feature selection strategy using two algorithms, ‘Recursive Feature Elimination’ (SVM-RFE), and ‘Integrated RFE with a non-parametric Wilcox rank test (sigFeature). Subsequently, we selected the top 16 markers, the classification performance of which was subjected to testing in an independent validation cohort. The classification performance evaluation of these markers, both individually and in various combinations, involved a rigorous assessment utilizing 80% of the data for training and the remaining 20% for internal-validation. To ensure the quality of the training process, we employed five repetitions of a tenfold cross-validation approach. The optimal kernel parameters were determined through tuning across a broad range of values. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis served as the metric to gauge the performance of the classifier model. All algorithms for identifying the EV signature predictive of pancreatic cancer diagnosis were implemented in R. We used Support Vector Machine (SVM) using CRAN package, e107 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Meyer et al., 2015</xref>). Ranking of genes was achieved using packages ‘sigFeature’ and ‘SVM-RFE’.

The use of extracellular vesicles as biomarkers of disease has been gaining interest in recent history, with a variety of published methods and techniques, looking at a variety of different compositions ('the molecular cargo') of EVs particularly in cancer diagnosis (Shah R, et al, N Engl J Med 2018; 379:958-966).</p><p>This study adds to the growing body of evidence in using EVs for earlier detection of pancreatic cancer, identifying both new and known proteins of interest. Limitations in studying EVs in general include dealing with low concentrations in circulation and identifying the most relevant molecular cargo. This study provides validation of assaying EVs using the novel EVtrap method (Extracellular Vesicles Total Recovery And Purification), which the authors show to be more efficient than current standard techniques and potentially more scalable for larger clinical studies.</p><p>The strength of this study is in its numbers - the authors worked with a cohort of 124 cases, 93 of them which were PDAC samples, which considered large for an EV study (Jia, E et al. BMC Cancer 22, 573 (2022)). The benign disease group (n=20, between chronic pancreatitis and IPMNs) and healthy control groups (n=11) were relatively small, but the authors were not only able to identify candidate biomarkers for diagnosis that clearly stood out in the PDAC cohort, but also validate it in an independent cohort of 36 new subjects. Proteins they've identified as associated with pancreatic cancer over benign disease included PDCD6IP, SERPINA12 and RUVBL2. They were even able to identify a set of EV proteins associated with metastasis and poorer prognosis , which include the proteins PSMB4, RUVBL2 and ANKAR and CRP, RALB and CD55. Their 7-EV protein signature yielded an 89% prediction accuracy for the diagnosis of PDAC against a background of benign pancreatic diseases that is compelling and comparable to other studies in the literature (Jia, E. et al. BMC Cancer 22, 573 (2022)).</p><p>The limitations of this study are its containment within a single institution - further studies are warranted to apply the authors' 7-EV protein PRAC panel to multiple other cases at other institutions in a larger cohort.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="author-comment" id="sa3"><front-stub><article-id

response:</p><p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>In this manuscript, Bockorny, Muthuswamy, and Huang et al. performed proteomics analysis of plasma extracellular vesicles (EVs) from pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) patients and patients with benign pancreatic diseases (chronic pancreatitis and intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm, IPMN) to develop a 7-EV protein signature that predicts PDAC. Moreover, the authors identified PSMB4, RUVBL2, and ANKAR as being associated with metastasis. These studies provide important insight into alterations of EVs during PDAC progression and the data supporting predict PDAC with EV protein signatures are solid. However, there are certain concerns regarding the rigor and novelty of the data analysis and interpretation, as well as the clinical implications, as detailed below.</p><p>(1) Plasma EVs were characterized by transmission electron microscopy and nanoparticle tracking analysis to confirm their morphology and size. The authors should also include an analysis of putative EV markers (e.g., tetraspanins, syntenin, ALIX, etc.) to confirm that the analyzed particles are EVs.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this comment. In the previous study from our co-authors who developed EVtrap method (PMID:32396726), they used electron microscopy and NTA , as well as quantification of typical EV protein markers, such as CD9, to confirm that particles isolated using EVtrap had typical characteristics of the extracellular vesicles. As such, these experiments were not replicated here. We added the following statement to the manuscript:</p><p>“Previous analyses using electron microscopy and nanoparticle tracking also confirmed that the vast majority of particles isolated by EVtrap had diameters between 100-200 nm, consistent with exosomes (PMID:32396726). In addition, EVtrap isolates demonstrates higher abundance of CD9, a common exosome marker, as compared to isolates from other traditional EV isolation methods such as size exclusion chromatography and ultracentrifugation (PMID:32396726)”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) The authors identified multiple over-expressed proteins in PDAC based on their foldchange and p-value; however, due to the heterogeneity of PDAC, it is necessary to show a heatmap displaying their abundance in all samples. High fold change does not necessarily indicate consistently high abundance in all PDAC samples.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this suggestion. We have now included the heatmap in the new Supplementary Figure 3.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) PSMB4, RUVBL2, and ANKAR were identified as being associated with metastasis. The authors state that they intended to distinguish early and late-stage cancer samples, but it is unclear why they chose to compare metastatic and non-metastatic samples, as the non-metastatic group also includes late-stage cancer samples. This sentence should be rephrased to more accurately reflect the sample types profiled.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for pointing this out. We would like to clarify that this analyses shown in Figures 3B and 3C pertain to patients with Metastatic vs Non-Metastatic disease, not early versus late stage. We edited the text to ensure this information is clear.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) Non-metastatic and metastatic patients were separated based on global protein abundance. The samples within each group display significant heterogeneity, with some samples displaying similar patterns although they were classified into different groups (Figure 3A), and the samples within the same group, particularly the metastasis group, did not consistently exhibit similar patterns of protein abundance. The authors should clarify this point.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this comment. The EV proteomic expression is anticipated not to show the exact pattern across of samples of each group. The purpose of this experiment depicted in Figure 3 heatmap is to show the enrichment for pattern of expressions, but we acknowledge that not all samples from the same group have the exact proteome pattern.</p><p>We added this statement in the discussion section:</p><p>“As expected, the EV proteomic profiles of PDAC patients exhibited significant heterogeneity. While the above mentioned markers exhibited strong association with disease states at population levels, their abundances in individual patients varied significantly. Those observations highlight the need to develop multi-protein panels for pancreatic cancer diagnosis and prognosis.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) The authors performed the survival analysis on a set of EV proteins but did not specify the origin of these markers or how many markers were examined. The authors should show their abundances across different groups, such as different stages and metastasis status.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the comments. The goal of this experiment was not to identify EV proteins that performed similarly well for diagnosing and prognostication. In Figure 3A, 3B and 3C, we identified EV proteins that had better performance for diagnosis of metastatic disease. In these experiments we made comparative analysis between patients with metastasis versus non-metastasis. In the experiment depicted in Figure 3D, the goal was to identify EV markers that had better performance is prognosticating outcomes as measured by overall survival, out of the markers identified in the previous experiments from Figure 3A. We would like to further clarify that based on our observation and others, it has become clear that EV profiles from cancer patients are highly heterogenous and we do not anticipate that a single marker will have sufficient test performance for cancer diagnosis or prognosis assessment when measured isolated. Rather, we anticipate that a panel of markers may yield better performance for diagnosis while a different combination of EV markers may have better performance for prognosis assessment.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(6) The classification model yielded a 100% accuracy, which may refer to AUC, in their discovery cohort, but it decreased to 89% in the independent cohort. This suggests that the authors have encountered overfitting issues with their model, where it performed well on the discovery cohort but did not generalize well to the independent cohort. The authors should clarify this point. The AUC score of the 7-EV signature is 0.89 and is not equivalent to prediction accuracy. In order to demonstrate prediction accuracy, the authors should show the confusion matrix of training and testing data as well as other evaluation metrics, such as accuracy, precision, and recall.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for providing these insightful comments. As you noted, the 7-biomarker signature machine learning model attained an impressive 100% accuracy within the internal Discovery Cohort, raising concerns about potential overfitting in the external validation dataset. Acknowledging the noted difference in AUROC of 0.11 in the external validation cohort, which surpasses the typical reported range of ~0.06-0.09, the model demonstrated a commendable AUROC of 0.89 in an independent patient cohort. Moreover, the utilization of an alternate technology to measure protein abundance in the validation dataset, underscores the model’s reproducibility and validity. We have provided the model metrics for both internal- and external-validation cohort. For these, please see updated Supplementary Figure 7, as well as the new Supplementary Figure 6 and Supplementary Figure 8. We also amended the discussion section to acknowledge that the validation cohort had limited sample size and proteins were measured in using a different method. Those factors likely contributed to the lower accuracy of predictions in the validation cohort. We addressed these limitations in the discussion section of the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(7) The authors should include more details of their model and the process of selection of signatures to enhance the reproducibility and transparency of their methods.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for their valuable comments. To enhance clarity, we have incorporated additional information regarding the method employed for biomarker signature identification into the ‘Methods Section’ in page 23. We note that Supplementary Table 7a provides details on ‘Sensitivity, Specificity, Precision, and AUC’ for the 16 markers included in the external validation study. Additionally, Supplementary Table 7b presents the contingency table for 7-biomarker signature, offering insights into model accuracy for both the Internal-Discovery and External Validation cohorts.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>The authors intended to identify a protein signature in extracellular vesicles of serum to distinguish pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma from benign pancreatic diseases.</p><p>A major strength of the work presented is the valuable profiling of a significant number of patient samples, with a rich cohort of patients with pancreatic cancer, benign pancreatic diseases, and healthy controls. However, despite the strong cohorts presented, the numbers of patient samples for benign pancreatic diseases as well as controls were very limited.</p><p>Also, the method used to isolate vesicles, EVTrap, recognizes double bilayers, which means that it can detect cellular debris and apoptotic bodies, which are very common in the circulation of patients that are undergoing chemotherapy. It would be important to identify the patients that are therapy naïve and the ones that are not because of this possible bias.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the Reviewer for these comments. We want to point out that the experiments presented in Supplementary Figure 1 (Transmission electron microscopy images and Nanoparticle tracking analysis) confirm that the vesicles isolated with EVTrap are not cellular debris and apoptotic bodies. Rather, these structures are in the nano range expected for exosomes. This is further supported by the additional work from our co-author and collaborator describing the development of EVtrap and its performance in isolating exosomes when compared to other traditional methods such as ultracentrifugation and size exclusion chromatography (PMID:32396726).</p><p>As per the Reviewer’s request, we have provided an additional heatmap figure depicting whose patients are treatment naïve to differentiate from those who have received treatment (revised Figure 2C).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Additionally, the transmission electron microscopy data reflect this heterogeneity of the samples, also with little identification of double bilayered vesicles. It would be important to identify some extracellular vesicles markers in those preparations to strengthen the quality of the samples analyzed.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the comment from the Reviewer and acknowledge the importance of identifying exosome markers on the isolate from EVtrap. These experiments have already been done and are reported in the original paper describing the development of this method by our co-authors in a separate work. In the manuscript PMID: 30080416, our collaborators demonstrated the detection of CD9, a well-known exosome marker, using Western Blot from isolates using EVtrap or ultra-centrifugation, a traditional technique to isolate exosomes. This work showed that EVtrap yielded much higher recovery rate of exosomes with lower contamination from soluble proteins. We did not repeat these already published experiments, but we amended our manuscript to reference these results.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>What is more, previously published work with this same methodology identifies around 2000 proteins per sample. It would be important to explain why in this study there seems to be a reduction in more than 50% of the amount of proteins identified in the vesicles.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the Reviewer for pointing out this important detail. In the previous work in which EVtrap was developed by our co-authors, the blood samples were processed using a different protocol, with shorter centrifugation (2,500g for 10 min) (PMID: 32396726). In the current work, we employed three centrifugation steps. As detailed in the Methods section of the manuscript, blood samples were centrifuged at 1,300g for 15 min. Then plasma was removed from the top carefully avoiding cell pellet; Repeat centrifugation of plasma at 2,500g for 15 min; Again, plasma was removed from the top carefully avoiding cell pellet; Third centrifugation at 2,500g for 15 min. This more extensive centrifugation process was intended to further increase the removal of platelets, apoptotic bodies, and other large particles and aggregates. Accordingly, we anticipate that the additional centrifugation steps decreased the contamination of our isolates but may have also decreased the amount of exosome proteins, hence the lower amount of exosome proteins identified in our study as compared to the original study from our co-authors (PMID: 32396726).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>One of the proteins that constantly surges on the analysis is KRT20. It would be important to proceed with the analysis by first filtering out possible contaminants of the proteomics, of which keratins are the most common ones.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the Reviewer for this comment. We would like to point out that we do believe that KRT20 is, in fact, cancer related and a not a contaminant. This is supported by our results presented in this manuscript showing enrichment or KRT20 in PDAC cases, and lower expression in benign samples. If this protein was a contaminant, its expression would be found uniformly in all samples, there would be no apparent reason for different expression between malignant vs benign cases, as all samples were processed following the same procedures. In addition, increased expression of KRT20 in PDAC tissues has also been reported by others. For instance, in a study by Schmiz-Winnthal (PMID: 16364723), the authors showed that Cytokeratin 20 (KRT20) were expressed in 76% of PDAC patients and expression of KRT20 was associated with poor survival after surgical resection. Based on these observations, we believe that the KRT20 identified in our study is indeed a tumor associated EV protein rather than contamination.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Finally, none of the 7-extracellular vesicle protein signatures has been validated by other techniques, such as western blot, in extracellular vesicles isolated by other, standard, methods, such as size exclusion chromatography.</p><p>A distinct technique for protein analysis was done but not a different method of isolation of these vesicles. This would strengthen the results and the origin of the proteins.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the Reviewer’s comment. We would like to again emphasize that the goal of this manuscript was not to compare the performance of EVtrap with other traditional EV isolation approaches such as ultracentrifugation and size exclusion chromatography. The main goal of study is to determine proteomic profiles of EVs isolated from clinical samples and provide such information to research community for further studies. As the Reviewer points out, proteins in EVs are highly heterogeneous which highlight the complexity of EV biology and interpatient heterogeneity of pancreatic cancer. We do not anticipate the development of EV-based markers for pancreatic diagnosis can be achieved by a single team, but by a community of researchers. We hope information presented in the current study will help other researchers identify additional candidates for validation in future work. Nonetheless, we edited the manuscript to discuss the limitation of not doing cross-validation of protein detection using a different method.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The conclusions that are reached do not fully meet the proposed aims of the identification of a protein signature in circulating extracellular vesicles that could improve early detection of the disease. The authors did not demonstrate the superiority of detection of these proteins in extracellular vesicles versus simply performing an ELISA, nor their superiority with respect to the current standard procedure for diagnosis.</p></disp-quote><p>We would like to clarify to the Reviewer that the goal of this manuscript was not to prove superiority of the EV signature biomarker in diagnosing pancreatic cancer as compared to current standard of care (SOC) practice, i.e., CT scans, endoscopic ultrasound and CA19-9. In order to prove such superiority, one would require a large, randomized phase III trial with several hundred patients. This was not the pursue of our discovery EV proteomics study and we double checked our manuscript to ensure no such claim was made. Rather, we aimed at developing a new pipeline for discovery of new EV biomarkers and we believe we were able to prove that this approach was successful in discovering a new class of biomarkers based on proteins expressed on extra-cellular vesicles that have predominant expression on patients with pancreatic cancer. Future studies should continue to advance this field with goals of improving on the current standard of care diagnostic methods.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors also suggest that profiling of circulating extracellular vesicles provides unique insights into systemic immune changes during pancreatic cancer development. How is this better than a regular hemogram is not clear.</p></disp-quote><p>We would like to clarify that the overall goal of this study is to provide patient-relevant information for the research community to further investigate biology of extracellular vesicles. For the state 'unique insights into systemic immune changes' we referred to the fact that we discovered EVs carrying proteins involved in immune responses. Previous studies have shown that EVs play important roles in cell-cell communication, discoveries from our study provide candidates for future studies on cellular mechanisms underlying immune regulation during pancreatic cancer development.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Finally, it would be important to determine how this signature compares with many others described in the literature that have the exact same aim. Why and how would this one be better?</p></disp-quote><p>We would like to again clarify that comparing the diagnostic performance of the EV biomarkers discovered in the study against standard of care methods (CA19-9, ctDNA, CT scan) was beyond the scope of this discovery EV proteomics work. We reviewed the manuscript to ensure that no claims were made as far as superiority against point-of-care tests available in clinic.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>This work investigates the use of extracellular vesicles (EVs) in blood as a noninvasive 'liquid biopsy' to aid in the differentiation of patients with pancreatic cancer (PDAC) from those with benign pancreatic disease and healthy controls, an important clinical question where biopsies are frequently non-diagnostic. The use of extracellular vesicles as biomarkers of disease has been gaining interest in recent history, with a variety of published methods and techniques, looking at a variety of different compositions ('the molecular cargo') of EVs particularly in cancer diagnosis (Shah R, et al, N Engl J Med 2018; 379:958-966).</p><p>This study adds to the growing body of evidence in using EVs for earlier detection of pancreatic cancer, identifying both new and known proteins of interest. Limitations in studying EVs, in general, include dealing with low concentrations in circulation and identifying the most relevant molecular cargo. This study provides validation of assaying EVs using the novel EVtrap method (Extracellular Vesicles Total Recovery And Purification),which the authors show to be more efficient than current standard techniques and potentially more scalable for larger clinical studies.</p><p>The strength of this study is in its numbers - the authors worked with a cohort of 124 cases,93 of them which were PDAC samples, which are considered large for an EV study (Jia, E etal. BMC Cancer 22, 573 (2022)). The benign disease group (n=20, between chronic pancreatitis and IPMNs) and healthy control groups (n=11) were relatively small, but the authors were not only able to identify candidate biomarkers for diagnosis that clearly stood out in the PDAC cohort, but also validate it in an independent cohort of 36 new subjects.</p><p>Proteins they have identified as associated with pancreatic cancer over benign disease included PDCD6IP, SERPINA12, and RUVBL2. They were even able to identify a set of EV proteins associated with metastasis and poorer prognosis, which include the proteins PSMB4, RUVBL2 and ANKAR and CRP, RALB and CD55. Their 7-EV protein signature yielded an 89% prediction accuracy for the diagnosis of PDAC against a background of benign pancreatic diseases that is compelling and comparable to other studies in the literature (Jia,E. et al. BMC Cancer 22, 573 (2022)).</p><p>The limitations of this study are its containment within a single institution - further studies are warranted to apply the authors' 7-EV protein PRAC panel to multiple other cases at other institutions in a larger cohort.</p></disp-quote><p>We are very thankful to the Reviewer for the positive feedback. We are similarly optimistic that EV-based biomarkers will assist future researchers to develop better diagnostic assays for patients with pancreatic cancer, as well as other tumor types lacking accurate blood-based tests.</p></body></sub-article></article>
