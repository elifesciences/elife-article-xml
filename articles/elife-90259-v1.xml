In the filamentous fungus <italic>Neurospora crassa,</italic> the proteins <bold>F</bold>requency (<bold>F</bold>RQ), the <bold>F</bold>RQ-interacting RNA helicase (FRH), and <bold>C</bold>asein-Kinase I (CK1) form the <bold>FFC</bold> complex that represses expression of genes activated by the white-collar complex (WCC). FRQ orchestrates key molecular interactions of the clock despite containing little predicted tertiary structure. Spin labeling and pulse-dipolar electron spin resonance spectroscopy provide domain-specific structural insights into the 989-residue intrinsically disordered FRQ and the FFC. FRQ contains a compact core that associates and organizes FRH and CK1 to coordinate their roles in WCC repression. FRQ phosphorylation increases conformational flexibility and alters oligomeric state, but the changes in structure and dynamics are non-uniform. Full-length FRQ undergoes liquid–liquid phase separation (LLPS) to sequester FRH and CK1 and influence CK1 enzymatic activity. Although FRQ phosphorylation favors LLPS, LLPS feeds back to reduce FRQ phosphorylation by CK1 at higher temperatures. Live imaging of <italic>Neurospora</italic> hyphae reveals FRQ foci characteristic of condensates near the nuclear periphery. Analogous clock repressor proteins in higher organisms share little position-specific sequence identity with FRQ; yet, they contain amino acid compositions that promote LLPS. Hence, condensate formation may be a conserved feature of eukaryotic clocks.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="plain-language-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Natural oscillations known as circadian rhythms influence many processes in humans and other animals including sleep, eating, brain activity and body temperature. These rhythms allow us to anticipate and prepare for regular changes in our environment including day-night cycles and the temperature of our surroundings.</p><p>Circadian clocks in animals, fungi and other ‘eukaryotic’ organisms rely on networks of components that repress their own production to generate oscillations in their levels in cells over the course of a 24-hour period. The components in animal and fungus circadian clocks are different but there are strong similarities in their properties and how the networks operate. As a result, a type of fungus known as <italic>Neurospora crassa</italic> is often used as a model to study how circadian rhythms work in animals.</p><p>A central component in the <italic>N. crassa</italic> circadian clock is a protein known as Frequency (FRQ). It is a large protein that, unlike most proteins, lacks a well-defined, three-dimensional structure. Despite this, it is able to bind to and regulate other proteins to repress its own production. One of its protein partners known as CK1 attaches small tags known as phosphate groups to FRQ to set the length of the circadian rhythm. However, it remains unclear how FRQ interacts with its protein partners or what effect the phosphate groups have on its activity.</p><p>To address this question, Tariq, Maurici et al. used biochemical approaches to study the structure of FRQ. The experiments revealed that it contains a compact core that is able to bind to CK1 and other protein partners. The way FRQ regulates its protein partners is unusual: it undergoes a chemical process known as liquid-liquid phase separation to sequester other circadian clock proteins and modulate their enzymatic activities. In this process, a solution containing molecules of FRQ separates into two distinct components (known as phases), one of which contains FRQ and its partners in a concentrated liquid-like mixture. Evidence for such mixtures has also been found in living fungal cells.</p><p>Further experiments suggest that liquid-liquid phase separation of FRQ may allow the clock to compensate for changes in temperature to maintain a regular rhythm. The circadian clocks of animals and other organisms all have proteins that perform similar roles as FRQ and maintain sequence properties that promote liquid-liquid phase separation. Therefore, it is possible that liquid-liquid phase separation may be a common feature of circadian rhythms in nature.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>LLPS</kwd><kwd>IDPs</kwd><kwd>circadian clocks</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>N. crassa</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R35GM122535</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Crane</surname><given-names>Brian R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R35GM118021</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Dunlap</surname><given-names>Jay C</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R35GM138097</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bah</surname><given-names>Alaji</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1F31GM143890</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Maurici</surname><given-names>Nicole</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>T32008704</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bartholomai</surname><given-names>Bradley M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R24GM146107</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Crane</surname><given-names>Brian R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P30GM103485</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Crane</surname><given-names>Brian R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund8"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000875</institution-id><institution>Pew Charitable Trusts</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bah</surname><given-names>Alaji</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The intrinsic disorder of the circadian clock protein Frequency organizes binding partners, facilitates liquid–liquid phase separation, modulates Frequency phosphorylation, and derives from sequence properties conserved with homologous clock components.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Eukaryotic circadian rhythms of biological phenomena arise from periodic gene expression patterns that oscillate independent of external cues but can be entrained to light and temperature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Hurley et al., 2016</xref>). At the molecular level, circadian clocks function as transcription-translation negative feedback loops (TTFLs) that consist of core positive and negative elements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Crane and Young, 2014</xref>). In the long-standing model clock of <italic>Neurospora crassa</italic>, the transcriptional repressor complex is known as the FFC, named for its three principal components: Frequency (FRQ, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), the FRQ-interacting RNA helicase (FRH), and Casein Kinase 1 (CK1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cha et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Hurley et al., 2016</xref>). FRQ is functionally analogous to Period (PER) in insects and mammals, whereas CK1 is an ortholog of the mammalian CK1 and the <italic>Drosophila</italic> kinase Doubletime (DBT) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Dunlap and Loros, 2017</xref>). FRH is found only in the core repressor of the fungal clock.

The FFC represses the positive arm of the cycle, which involves two zinc-finger transcription factors, white-collar 1 (WC-1) and white-collar 2 (WC-2) assembled into the white-collar complex (WCC).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>FRQ is a large, dynamic component of the clock oscillator.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) LLPS propensity predictions using Pi-Pi and IUPred2A disorder predictions are shown for homologs of FRQ (n=47) (purple), dPER (n=36) (teal), and hPER1 (n=57) (orange) compared to values for proteins of similar length from their respective proteomes (Prot): Nc, <italic>Neurospora crassa</italic> (n=46); Dc, <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> (n=121); Hc, Homo sapiens (n=626).

FRQ production is also highly regulated at the post-transcriptional level through the use of rare codons to retard translation, the expression of an antisense transcript and alternative splicing mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cha et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Dunlap and Loros, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Zhou et al., 2013</xref>). The latter leads to the production of either a long (L-FRQ) or short (S-FRQ) isoform, and the ratio of these isoforms fine-tunes period length in response to ambient temperatures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Diernfellner et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Liu et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Zhou et al., 2013</xref>). Translated FRQ binds to FRH via its FFD domain and to CK1 via its two FCD domains (1 and 2) to form the repressive FFC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cha et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Dunlap and Loros, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Jankowski et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), although short linear motifs within FRQ may also broadly influence the FRQ-interactome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Pelham et al., 2021</xref>). The FFC enters the nucleus where it directly inhibits the WCC and thereby downregulates <italic>frq</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Hurley et al., 2013</xref>). FRQ-mediated WCC phosphorylation by CK1 (and associated kinases) reduces interactions between the WCC and the c-box to close the feedback loop and restart the cycle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Wang et al., 2019</xref>). FRH facilitates interactions between the FFC and the WCC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Conrad et al., 2016</xref>), and thus, repressor function likely depends upon the FRQ-mediated association of CK1 and FRH. Whereas interaction regions on the FRQ protein sequence have been identified (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), there is little information on the spatial arrangement of the FFC components.</p><p>Despite low-sequence conservation among the core negative arm proteins across species, they all share a high degree of disorder (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Pelham et al., 2020</xref>). FRQ, the analogous <italic>Drosophila</italic> (d) Period (PER) protein, and the analogous mammalian (m) PER have &gt;65% disorder predicted in their sequences with ~86% of the FRQ sequence assumed to have no defined structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Pelham et al., 2020</xref>). Both FRQ and mPER2 have biochemical properties characteristic of intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Hurley et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Marzoll et al., 2022</xref>). These clock repressors also undergo extensive post-translational modification (PTM), particularly phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Dunlap and Loros, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Pelham et al., 2020</xref>). FRQ acquires over 100 phosphorylation sites over the course of the circadian day (similar to PER phosphorylation by DBT), predominantly due to CK1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Baker et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Tang et al., 2009</xref>). The phosphorylation events have two consequences: (1) those that weaken the interaction between FRQ and the WCC or CK1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cha et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Liu et al., 2019</xref>) and (2) those that direct FRQ down the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Larrondo et al., 2015</xref>), although only the former are required for circadian rhythmicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Larrondo et al., 2015</xref>). Multisite phosphorylation of FRQ influences its inhibitory function and clock period length (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Larrondo et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Liu et al., 2019</xref>). Although the consequences of phosphorylation-driven conformational changes in FRQ have been probed by proteolytic sensitivity, the challenges of producing FRQ have limited direct assessment of its conformational properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Liu et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Pelham et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Querfurth et al., 2011</xref>). IDPs such as FRQ are known to participate in liquid–liquid phase separation (LLPS), which has emerged as a key mechanism for organizing cellular components, coordinating metabolism and directing signaling through, for example, the formation of membraneless organelles (MLOs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Dignon et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Wright and Dyson, 2015</xref>).

Intriguing questions surround why clock repressor proteins are so disordered, undergo extensive PTM, and whether LLPS has a role to play in their function.</p><p>Clock proteins and their complexes have been challenging to characterize due to their large size (&gt;100 kDa), low-sequence complexity, extensive disorder, and modification states. Herein, we reconstitute FRQ and the FFC to assess the global and site-specific structural properties of these moieties, as well as the dependence of their properties on multisite phosphorylation. FRQ undergoes non-uniform conformational change upon phosphorylation and arranges FRH close to CK1 in the FFC. We also demonstrate that FRQ indeed participates in phosphorylation-dependent LLPS in vitro, and as a condensate sequesters FRH and CK1 while altering CK1 activity. Our results suggest how a massively disordered protein such as FRQ organizes the clock core oscillator and reveal the effects of extensive phosphorylation on the conformational and phase-separation properties of a large IDP.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Sequence assessment and general properties of FRQ</title><p>Analysis of an AlphaFold 2.0 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Jumper et al., 2021</xref>) model of full-length FRQ indicates that FRQ lacks a defined arrangement of large folded domains; instead, most of the molecule is unstructured (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), in agreement with previous studies predicting that FRQ mostly comprises intrinsically disordered regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Hurley et al., 2013</xref>). However, FRQ is also predicted to contain a small, clustered core, with several secondary structural elements that collapse together to form a compact nucleus surrounded by long flexible disordered regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). The AlphaFold pLDDT scores, which represent the confidence in the structural prediction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Jumper et al., 2021</xref>), are very low across the model, except within the core (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>), which contains the CK1-binding region. The FRH-binding region, FFD, falls within a more flexible region with a lower pLDDT score than that of CK1. Helices compose the majority of secondary structural elements predicted by AlphaFold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). The assignments of the helical regions were well supported by the Agadir program that predicts helical propensity based on the helix/coil transition theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Muñoz and Serrano, 1994</xref>). Four regions distributed throughout the length of FRQ (residues 194–212, 312–329, 709–719, and 801–817) have at least 10% helical propensity, and these helical regions mostly agree with those of the AlphaFold model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Together, these analyses primarily indicate that FRQ assumes a broad conformational ensemble containing an ordered nucleus that interacts extensively with partially ordered and flexible regions. However, much of the structural details of the model, including the positioning and interactions between secondary structural elements, are predicted with low confidence, thereby underscoring the need for a multi-pronged biophysical study of the protein.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Reconstitution of FRQ in unphosphorylated and highly phosphorylated states</title><p>The size and intrinsic disorder of FRQ have made it challenging to recombinantly express and purify, thereby limiting investigations of its biophysical properties.

SLs attached to Cys490 and Cys658 (490SL and 658SL) are predicted to be within an α-helix and a β-strand, respectively. These sites correspondingly showed a broad low-field (left-most line) component and a small high-field component (right-most line) indicative of slower tumbling compared to sites predicted to be in flexible regions, such as 746SL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). The 490SL site had a broader profile compared to that of the 658SL site, although both are relatively well ordered. We observed a similar trend with δ, which is the peak-to-peak width of the central line (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Hubbell et al., 2000</xref>). 490SL and 658SL had similar δ values that were higher than that of 746SL, indicating that they are less flexible than 746SL (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4">Table 4</xref>). Furthermore, the spectra also highlighted structural differences between the phospho forms: p-FRQ and np-FRQ gave very different δ values at 490SL and the C-terminus, thereby demonstrating how phosphorylation can influence conformational properties site specifically. The C-terminus may have become more dynamic in p-FRQ compared to np-FRQ because the C-terminus contains a cluster of phosphosites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>).

We produced six cysteine pair variants that each contained only two of the four native FRQ Cys residues to measure pairwise distances and one single Cys variant to test for oligomerization. Owing to association and aggregation when concentrated, np-FRQ was not amenable to DEER measurements; however, such issues were not prohibitive with p-FRQ. Nevertheless, due to the challenges of spin-labeling appreciable concentrations of p-FRQ, the modulation depths of the DEER data, which reflect the number of spins in range to produce specific dipolar interactions, are small (~2–4%). These values compare to ~10–12% for a well-ordered, highly labeled pair of sites under these instrument conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Dunleavy et al., 2023</xref>). The single Cys spin-labeled variant 490SL produced log-linear time-domain traces indicative of a uniform background with little evidence of dimerization, consistent with the MALS data showing p-FRQ to be monomeric (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>).

In general, the time-domain decays were more rapid in the FFC compared to p-FRQ alone, and the resulting distance distributions had smaller mean distances and less breadth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B–H</xref>). However, the changes were not uniform; for example, the 658SL-to-746SL distance distribution increased in the complex compared to free FRQ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>). To further assess how the distributions of p-FRQ conformations changed when the p-FFC formed, the distance data was fit to a model of one near and one far Gaussian functions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s4">Figure 5—figure supplement 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5">Table 5</xref>). Shifts in population between the near and far components were most prominent for the 370–658, 490–658, and 490–746 variants, which contain sites involved in core clock interactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s4">Figure 5—figure supplement 4</xref>). The proportion of the closer component increased from ~30% to ~70% in the 370–658 variant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s4">Figure 5—figure supplement 4</xref>) and from ~10% to ~70% in the 490–746 variant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>) when bound to FRH and CK1. Similar trends were observed when we compared the percentage change of the average separation observed in FRQ alone versus when it is bound to FRH and CK1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H</xref>). The 490, 658, and 746 sites reside in regions important for WCC interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Guo et al., 2010</xref>) and FRH may organize such binding determinants.

Thus, CK1 and FRH order p-FRQ to an appreciable degree and the two enzymes are adjacently positioned within the conformationally heterogeneous complex.</p><table-wrap id="table5" position="float"><label>Table 5.</label><caption><title>R<sup>2</sup> values for the quality of the two-component Gaussian fits to the distance distributions.</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom"/><th align="left" valign="bottom">370</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">490</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">658</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">746</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">370</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="left" valign="bottom">0.99, 0.99</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">0.96, 0.99</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">NA, 0.99</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">490</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="left" valign="bottom">0.94, 0.99</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">0.99, 0.99</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">658</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="left" valign="bottom">0.99, 0.95</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">746</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><fn><p>There are two values reported in each cell – the first value corresponds to the R<sup>2</sup> value for FRQ-only distance while the second value is for the same variant in the FFC complex (i.e., when the FRQ is bound to CK1a and FRH).</p></fn></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>FRQ exhibits behavior consistent with LLPS in vitro and in vivo</title><p>The unstructured regions and multivalent interactions of IDPs can lead to LLPS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Martin and Holehouse, 2020a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Martin et al., 2020b</xref>). Such de-mixing often manifests in the formation of biomolecular condensates and MLOs within cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Posey et al., 2018</xref>). As has been previously noted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Pelham et al., 2020</xref>), FRQ may be capable of LLPS owing to its extensive disorder. We found that FRQ has a high propensity to undergo LLPS based on a set of computational tools that evaluate charge distribution and clustering, long-range aromatic and non-aromatic π:π contacts, and nucleic acid-binding propensities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bolognesi et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Vernon et al., 2018</xref>). The overall FRQ PScore, which grades LLPS propensity on these properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Vernon et al., 2018</xref>), was 6.39, with three regions scoring above a value of 2, the threshold for favorable LLPS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). The region with the highest PScore also accounted for the majority of LLPS propensity as determined by the catGRANULE prediction algorithm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bolognesi et al., 2016</xref>). Furthermore, we found that these methods also predicted the functional analogs dPER and hPER1 to phase separate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>). The FRQ functional analogs share physicochemical characteristics with FRQ, particularly an enrichment of hydrophilic residues, increases in Gly and Pro content, and a depletion of hydrophobic residues, even though their positional sequence conservation with FRQ is low (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplements 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s4">4</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Jankowski et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Pelham et al., 2021</xref>). Similar amino acid composition patterns among FRQ, dPER, and hPER1 include the most common residues in each protein and its UniRef50 cluster (sequences with at least 50% identity with the target protein) being serine, proline, and glycine (~30% of total sequence) accompanied by a high depletion in aromatic residues (only ~7.5%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s4">Figure 6—figure supplement 4</xref>). In addition, all of the sequences have a reduced proportion of hydrophobic residues such as A, I, L, and V and a slightly acidic isoelectric point. Thus, FRQ, dPER, and hPER1 all have low overall hydropathy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3</xref>). However, in addition, FRQ and its homologs are unusual in their high Arg and Asp content, which tend to separate in charge blocks throughout their sequences (as indicated by high kappa values, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s4">Figure 6—figure supplement 4</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Jankowski et al., 2022</xref>).

Lower salt concentrations favored the LLPS of p-FRQ, whereas higher salt disfavored LLPS, compared to higher salt concentrations favoring LLPS for np-FRQ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>). Although the NaCl concentration for np-FRQ LLPS conditions is non-physiological per se, the ionic strength conditions and effective solute concentrations in cells are comparatively high (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Liu et al., 2017</xref>). Furthermore, the higher absorbance values of p-FRQ at lower temperatures relative to that of np-FRQ indicate complex phase behavior for the phosphorylated isoform that cannot be adequately explained by an LCST phase transition alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>).

We tested the effect of FRQ LLPS on its phosphorylation by CK1, a key reaction for regulating the period of the clock (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Liu et al., 2019</xref>). We compared the phosphorylation of FRQ by CK1 in a buffer that supports phase separation under different temperatures using the latter as a means to control the degree of LLPS without altering the solution composition. Both the UV-Vis turbidity assays and the differential interference contrast (DIC) micrographs of the protein at different temperatures establish that FRQ LLPS increases substantially with temperature (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figures 6C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7C</xref>). Furthermore, LLPS of p-FRQ and np-FRQ both depend highly on buffer composition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>). CK1 autophosphorylation served as an internal control and its temperature dependence was consistent with previous studies that show increased catalytic activity at higher temperatures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Marzoll et al., 2022</xref>).

Thus, the ability of increased LLPS at elevated temperature (larger gray circle) to reduce FRQ phosphorylation by CK1 will counter a shortening period that would otherwise manifest in an undercompensated system.

The reduction of CK1-mediated FRQ phosphorylation, which likely requires substantial dynamics given the distribution of phosphorylation sites throughout the FRQ sequence, may reflect this change in molecular dynamics.

They compose dynamic macromolecular assemblies that achieve specificity in their functions despite assuming highly variable structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Pelham et al., 2020</xref>). Our purification scheme enabled a multipronged biophysical characterization of FRQ. The majority of previous such studies on IDPs, particularly those that undergo de-mixing, have involved truncated proteins, excised domains, or peptides of sizes less than 200 residues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Babinchak et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Emmanouilidis et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Lin et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Lin et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Seal et al., 2021</xref>). FRQ represents a full-length, nearly 1000-residue IDP that can be investigated with respect to PTM, interaction partners, and phase separation. As anticipated from its sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Hurley et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Pelham et al., 2020</xref>), this direct characterization of structural properties shows that FRQ is indeed a highly dynamic protein, but even in isolation, it is not completely disordered. The SAXS and ESR data indicate that FRQ has compact features that localize to an ordered core interspersed with dynamic regions. Notably the shape of the Kratky plots generated from the SAXS data suggests a degree of disorder that is substantially greater than that expected of a molten globule (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kataoka et al., 1997</xref>), but far from that of a completely denatured protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kikhney and Svergun, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Martin et al., 2021</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bateman et al., 2021</xref>). Similarly, the DEER distributions, though non-uniform across the various sites examined, indicate more disorder than that of a molten globule (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Selmke et al., 2018</xref>) but more order than a completely unfolded protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">van Son et al., 2015</xref>). Although FRQ lacks the well-defined PAS domains of the analogous PER proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Pelham et al., 2020</xref>), it also maintains a structured core to anchor its more dynamic elements. The regions that bind CK1 and FRQ are the most ordered, and they organize the two partners beside each other; in fact, they are in remarkably close proximity, as judged by SLs in their ATP-binding pockets or in their binding domains. FRH mediates contacts of the FFC to the WCC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Conrad et al., 2016</xref>), whereas CK1 phosphorylates the WCC to close the TTFL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cha et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Larrondo et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Liu et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Wang et al., 2019</xref>); hence, the targeting of CK1 to the WCC likely depends on FRQ associating FRH with CK1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Wang et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Previous proteolytic sensitivity studies have suggested that increased phosphorylation across the day transitions FRQ from a ‘closed’ to a more ‘open’ state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Liu et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Pelham et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Querfurth et al., 2011</xref>). Our data paint a more nuanced picture. The SAXS data reveal that p-FRQ and p-FFC are more expansive and show greater flexibility than do np-FRQ and np-FFC, respectively. Furthermore, np-FRQ has a greater tendency to self-associate. In the cell, completely unphosphorylated FRQ is likely short-lived, if present at all (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Baker et al., 2009</xref>). Phosphorylation may stabilize FRQ against aggregation, yet also provides for enough conformational heterogeneity to poise FRQ near a degradation threshold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Larrondo et al., 2015</xref>). This idea is supported by the cw-ESR data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>), which shows that phosphorylation causes non-uniform local structural changes with some regions increasing, while others decreasing, in flexibility. The DEER data also demonstrates that binding to FRH and CK1 increases compactness of p-FRQ, particularly in the central core that is responsible for binding the partners. In contrast, the FRQ C-terminus gains considerable flexibility in the FFC. FRQ has been suggested to assume a dimeric state because of a predicted coiled-coil region and formation of mixed dimers formed in cellular pull-down assays with differentially tagged FRQ subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cheng et al., 2001</xref>). Np-FRQ does indeed dimerize when isolated, whereas p-FRQ is primarily monomeric alone. Furthermore, SAXS data indicates that there is one copy of FRQ in both the reconstituted np-FFC and p-FFC. Hence, phosphorylation has the potential to regulate the FRQ oligomeric state, which may in turn be linked to FFC assembly. Despite being a monomer in isolation, the pull-down data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cheng et al., 2001</xref>) indicate that association of p-FRQ may be mediated by other cellular factors, including LLPS.</p><p>FRQ has physicochemical features embedded within its sequence that give rise to LLPS and the FRQ clock analogs exhibit similar characteristics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplements 2</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s4">4</xref>). FRQ and negative-arm proteins in general belong to the ‘flexible disorder’ class of IDPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Shapiro et al., 2021</xref>), wherein amino acid patterns that generate intrinsic disorder are conserved, but amino acid sequence per se is not (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bellay et al., 2011</xref>). Moreover, although these proteins all clearly contain regions of low-complexity sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Hurley et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Marzoll et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Pelham et al., 2020</xref>), their conserved features include not only their intrinsic disorder, but also their propensity for LLPS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>). These two properties, although related, are not directly correlated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bolognesi et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Martin et al., 2020b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Szabó et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Vernon et al., 2018</xref>). In particular, a preponderance of aromatic and non-aromatic π-π planar contacts and charge-dense or charge-repeat regions drive LLPS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Szabó et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Vernon et al., 2018</xref>) and these features are consistently found in clock repressors, particularly FRQ. The similar amino acid compositions of these proteins may then potentially give rise to their shared function. Moreover, extensive phosphorylation may alter LLPS propensity because it increases extended states, solvation of the peptide backbone, charge density, and intermolecular hydrogen bonding capacity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bolognesi et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Szabó et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Vernon et al., 2018</xref>). For FRQ, the sequence predictions are borne out experimentally, with p-FRQ displaying a different phase behavior relative to np-FRQ. In addition to being more soluble, dynamic, and less aggregated than np-FRQ, p-FRQ also phase separates at lower temperatures and under lower salt conditions relative to np-FRQ. Increased salt disfavors p-FRQ phase separation, which, when compared to np-FRQ, is consistent with more electrostatically driven de-mixing due to the high degree of phosphorylation.</p><p>Live-cell imaging of fluorescently tagged FRQ proteins is consistent with FRQ phase separation in <italic>N. crassa</italic> nuclei. FRQ is plainly not homogeneously dispersed within nuclei, and the concentrated foci observed at specific positions in the nuclei indicate condensate behavior similar to that observed for other phase-separating proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bartholomai, 2022a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Caragliano et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Gonzalez et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Tatavosian et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Xiao et al., 2021</xref>).

A very recent manuscript (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Xie et al., 2023</xref>) calls into question the importance and very existence of LLPS of clock proteins at least in regards to mammalian cells, noting that it may be an artifact of overexpression in some instances where it is seen, and that at normal levels of expression there is no evidence for elevated levels at the nuclear periphery. Artifacts resulting from overexpression are unlikely to be a problem for our study and that of Xiao et al. as in both cases clock proteins were tagged at their endogenous locus and expressed from their native promoters. Although we noted enrichment of FRQ<sup>mNeonGreen</sup> near the nuclear envelope in our live-cell imaging, there remained abundant FRQ within the core of the nucleus.</p><p>Phosphorylation is known to modulate LLPS in other systems, but the effects are variable. For example, phosphorylation of the transcriptional silencing factor HP1α also enhances LLPS, whereas only the non-phosphorylated form of <italic>Xenopus</italic> CPEB4 involved in translation of mRNA poly-A tails undergoes LLPS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Larson et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Seal et al., 2021</xref>). FRQ, especially p-FRQ, may achieve its inhibitory function by sequestering the FFC and WCC into MLOs. The large, disordered domains and capacity for multivalency of the WC proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Pelham et al., 2020</xref>) may also facilitate their partitioning into such condensates. In the fly clock, PER and the WCC analog CLK produce liquid-like foci in the nuclei that are most prevalent during the repressive phase of the circadian cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Xiao et al., 2021</xref>). These large foci, which are few and localized to the nuclear periphery, may serve to organize clock-controlled genes during repression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Xiao et al., 2021</xref>). LLPS may also influence the nuclear transport of FRQ by affecting interactions with the nuclear import machinery as has been observed with proteins such as TD43 and FUS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Gasset-Rosa et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Gonzalez et al., 2021</xref>). Conditions favoring LLPS reduce the ability of FRQ to act as a substrate for CK1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>), and this reactivity correlates with reduced dynamics of FRQ in the phase-separated state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>). Domains and disordered regions from other spin-labeled proteins show similar reduced dynamics when induced to phase separate and monitored by cw-ESR spectroscopy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Babinchak et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Emmanouilidis et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Lin et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Seal et al., 2021</xref>), although the temperature and salt dependencies of the ordering behavior can vary considerably, with some species showing little change upon LLPS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Lin et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>In the cell, the impact of LLPS on CK1 activity may modulate the timing of FRQ phosphorylation, which is closely linked to clock period (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Larrondo et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Marzoll et al., 2022</xref>). Moreover, and collectively, the data from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figures 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7</xref> show that as temperature increases, LLPS-like behavior increases, and as LLPS increases, the ability of CK1 to phosphorylate FRQ decreases. We believe that the reduced CK1 kinase activity toward FRQ as a substrate is directly due to the impact of the generated LLPS milieu, that is, the changes in structural/dynamic properties of FRQ and/or CK1 induced by the effects of being a phase-separated microenvironment, which could be substantially different from the non-phase-separated buffer environment. For example, previous work done on the disordered region of DDX4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Brady et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Nott et al., 2015</xref>) shows that even the amount of water content and stability of biomolecules such as double-strand nucleic acids encapsulated within the droplets differ between non- and phase-separated DDX4 samples. Indeed, the spin-labeling experiments indicate that the dynamics of FRQ have been altered by LLPS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>).</p><p>The rate of FRQ phosphorylation dictates period length (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Larrondo et al., 2015</xref>). Therefore, this negative feedback of temperature on period mediated by LLPS formation could provide a mechanism for circadian temperature compensation of period length (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). Sequestration of CK1 (and FRH) into condensates may also render these factors unavailable to target other cellular substrates. Phosphorylation alters FRQ interactions throughout the circadian cycle, not unlike the workings of the cyanobacterial clock, which relies upon a timed phospho-code to regulate enzymatic components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Rust et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Wang et al., 2019</xref>). We demonstrate that FRQ likewise responds to phosphorylation with non-uniform conformational changes across its sequence and an increased propensity for LLPS. It is the latter property that appears conserved among negative-arm repressor proteins in eukaryotic clocks and may thus be a critical function of their intrinsic disorder and extensive PTMs.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides"

(residues 100–1106) (UniProt ID:Q1K502) were sub-cloned into a pET28a vector (Novagen) bearing an N-terminal His<sub>6</sub>-tag and kanamycin resistance. Note that L-FRQ contained the S513A substitution to improve protein stability as noted in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Querfurth et al., 2007</xref>. Cysteine to serine substitution mutants of FRQ were produced using standard mutagenesis, with the primers described in the Key Resources Table. The plasmids encoding the proteins were transformed into BL21 (DE3) <italic>E. coli</italic> cells, grown in LB media containing 50  μg/mL kanamycin to an optical density (OD<sub>600</sub>) of ~0.6–0.8 at 37°C and protein expression was induced with 1 mM IPTG at 17°C or room temperature. Cells were harvested after 12–18 hr by centrifugation at 5000  rpm and 4°C. FRH and CK1 were purified by standard Ni-NTA chromatography followed by ion-exchange and size-exclusion chromatography. Briefly, cells were resuspended in lysis buffer (50 mM Tris pH 8.0, 500 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 5 mM imidazole) and sonicated on ice. The lysate was clarified by centrifugation at 20,000 rpm for 1 hr. The clarified lysate was applied to a gravity Ni-NTA column and washed with five column volumes (CVs) of wash buffer (50 mM Tris pH 8.0, 500 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 20 mM imidazole). The protein was eluted using the elution buffer (50 mM Tris pH 8.0, 500 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 500 mM imidazole). The protein was then diluted into ion-exchange (IEX) buffer A (50 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 10% glycerol), applied to an S cation exchange column (GE Healthcare) and eluted over a 20 CV gradient against IEX buffer B (50 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 1 M NaCl, 10% glycerol). Fractions containing the protein were pooled, concentrated, and run over an S200 26/60 gel-filtration column pre-equilibrated in gel-filtration buffer (GFB; 50 mM HEPES, 200 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol). L-FRQ was purified under denaturing conditions. Cells were resuspended in lysis buffer (50 mM Na<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub> pH 7.42, 300 mM NaCl, 5 mM imidazole, 4 M guanidinium hydrochloride [GuHCl]) and sonicated on ice. The lysate was clarified by centrifugation at 20,000 rpm for 1 hr. The clarified lysate was applied to a gravity Ni-NTA column and washed with 3 CV of lysis buffer. The protein was eluted using the elution buffer (50 mM Na<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub> pH 7.42, 300 mM NaCl, 500 mM imidazole, 4 M GuHCl). The protein was concentrated and applied to a S200 26/60 gel-filtration column pre-equilibrated in 50 mM Na<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub> pH 7.42, 300 mM NaCl, 5 mM imidazole, and 4 M GuHCl.

Samples were eluted at flow rates of 0.05–0.1 mL/min. For each sample, 2 s exposures were collected throughout elution until the elution profile had returned to buffer baseline, and scattering profiles of the elution buffer were averaged to produce a background-subtracted SEC-SAXS dataset. The scattering data was processed in RAW (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hopkins et al., 2017</xref>) and regions with homogeneous R<sub>G</sub> values were chosen for the Guinier and Kratky analyses.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Protein labeling for ESR spectroscopy and microscopy experiments</title><p>Sort/AEP1-tagged FRQ was cloned into a pET28a (Novagen) vector as described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chandrasekaran et al., 2021</xref>.

The ESR measurements were carried out at room temperature with a modulation amplitude of 0.5–2 G and modulation frequency of 100 kHz. All spectra were digitized to 1024 points with a sweep width of ~100 G and an average of 4–16 scans. The δ values were calculated using the display distance function on the Bruker Xepr 2.6b software.</p><p>For four-pulse DEER, the samples were exchanged into deuterated buffer containing 30% d8-glycerol, checked by cw-ESR, and plunge frozen into liquid N<sub>2</sub>. The pulse ESR measurements were carried out at Q-band (~34 GHz) on a Bruker E580 spectrometer equipped with a 10 W solid-state amplifier (150 W equivalent TWTA) and an arbitrary waveform generator . DEER was carried out using four pulses (π/2-τ1-π-τ1-πpump-τ2-π-τ2-echo) with 16-step phase cycling at 60 K. The pump and probe pulses were separated by 56 MHz (~20 G). The DEER data was background subtracted with an exponential background and the distance reconstruction was carried out using denoising and the SVD method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Srivastava et al., 2017a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Srivastava and Freed, 2017b</xref>). Uncertainty in the distance distributions was calculated using the method described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Srivastava and Freed, 2019</xref>. Briefly, the uncertainty plotted shows the ‘range’ of singular values (SVs) over which the singular value decomposition (SVD) solution remains converged. For most of the data displayed, we only used the first few SVs and the solution remained converged for ±1 or 2 SVs near the optimum solution. For example, if the optimum solution was four SVs, then the range in which the solution remained converged is ~3–6 SVs. We plot three lines – lowest range of SVs, highest range of SVs, and optimum number of SVs – in the supplementary information figures; the optimum SV solution is shown in black and the region between the converged solutions with the highest and lowest number of SVs is shaded in red. Owing to the pointwise reconstruction of the distance distribution, the SVD method enables localized uncertainty at each distance value. Therefore, some points will have high uncertainty, whereas others low.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Turbidity assays</title><p>Cysteine-less (cys-less) FRQ was created in order to minimize disulfide cross-linking at the high protein concentrations needed for in vitro phase separation experiments. For this, all four of the native cysteine residues were substituted to serine using standard molecular biology techniques. For the phase separation experiments, this cys-less FRQ variant was purified and concentrated for dialysis into phase separation buffer. Cys-less FRQ was dialyzed overnight into 25 mM Tris pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, or 25 mM Tris pH 8.0, 500 mM NaCl for p-FRQ and np-FRQ, respectively, at 4°C. Phase separation was induced by dialyzing in either low or high salt and increasing temperature. The protein solution was observed as a clear solution before dialysis and then turbid after dialysis, indicating that LLPS had occurred. Microscopy (see ‘DIC and fluorescence microscopy’) confirmed the turbid solution is due to LLPS and not aggregation. Turbidity as measured by absorbance at 300–600 nm was then recorded with an Agilent Cary 3500 UV-Vis Multicell Peltier using a temperature ramp rate of 5°C/min increasing from 10°C to 80°C. A final protein concentration of 5–15 μM was used for all turbidity assays.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>DIC and fluorescence microscopy</title><p>Phase separation was induced via overnight dialysis into 25 mM Tris pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, or 25 mM Tris (pH 8.0), 500 mM NaCl for p-FRQ and np-FRQ, respectively.

The analysis was carried out using an Orbitrap Fusion Tribrid (Thermo Fisher Scientific, San Jose, CA) mass spectrometer equipped with a nanospray Flex Ion Source and coupled with a Dionex UltiMate 3000 RSLCnano system (Thermo, Sunnyvale, CA). The peptide samples (5 μL) were injected into a PepMap C-18 RP nano-trapping column (5 µm, 100 µm i.d. × 20 mm) and then separated on a PepMap C-18 RP nano column (2 µm, 75 µm × 25 cm) at 35°C. The Orbitrap Fusion was operated in positive ion mode, with spray voltage set at 1.5 kV and source temperature at 275°C. External calibration for FT, IT, and quadrupole mass analyzers was performed. In data-dependent acquisition (DDA) analysis, the instrument was operated using FT mass analyzer in MS scan to select precursor ions followed by 3 s ‘Top Speed’ data-dependent CID ion trap MS/MS scans at 1.6 m/z quadrupole isolation for precursor peptides with multiple charged ions above a threshold ion count of 10,000 and normalized collision energy of 30%. MS survey scans at a resolving power of 120,000 (FWHM at m/z 200) for the mass range of m/z 375–1600. Dynamic exclusion parameters were set at 35 s of exclusion duration with ±10 ppm exclusion mass width. All data were acquired using Xcalibur 4.4 operation software (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The DDA raw files with MS and MS/MS were subjected to database searches using Proteome Discoverer (PD) 2.4 software (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Bremen, Germany) with the Sequest HT algorithm. The database search was conducted against a <italic>Neurospora crassa</italic> database and <italic>E. coli</italic> database by adding LFRQ sequence into the database. The peptide precursor tolerance was set to 10 ppm and fragment ion tolerance was set to 0.6 Da with 2 miss-cleavage allowed for either trypsin or chymotrypsin. Variable modification of methionine oxidation, deamidation of asparagines/glutamine, phosphorylation of serine/threonine/tyrosine, acetylation, M-loss and M-loss + acetylation on protein N-terminus, and fixed modification of cysteine carbamidomethylation were set for the database search.

Concerning the reduced activity of sequestered CK1 within LLPS droplets with FRQ, to what extent is this decrease attributed to distinct buffer conditions for LLPS formation compared to non-LLPS conditions?</p></disp-quote><p>We don’t believe that these buffer conditions significantly influence the change in FRQ phosphorylation by CK1 observed at elevated temperatures. The pH and ionic strength of the buffer are in keeping with physiological conditions (300 mM NaCl, 50 mM sodium phosphate, 10 mM MgCl2, pH 7.5); CK1 autophosphorylation is robust and generally increases with temperature under these conditions (Figure 7B). However, as LLPS increases CK1 autophosphorylation remains high, whereas phosphorylation of FRQ dramatically decreases. In fact, we chose to alter temperature specifically to induce changes in phase behavior under constant buffer conditions. In this way LLPS could be increased, and FRQ phosphorylation evaluated, without altering the solution composition. Thus, we believe that the reduced CK1 kinase activity toward FRQ as a substrate is directly due to the impact of the generated LLPS milieu, i.e. the changes in structural/dynamic properties of FRQ and/or CK1 induced by the effects of being a phase separate microenvironment, which could be substantially different from non-phase separated buffer environment. For example, previous work done on the disordered region of DDX4 [Brady et al. 2017, and Nott et al. 2015] show that even the amount of water content and stability of biomolecules such as double strand nucleic acids encapsulated within the droplets differ between non- and phase separated DDX4 samples.</p><p>Nott T.J. et al. Phase transition of a disordered nuage protein generates environmentally responsive membraneless organelles. Mol. Cell. 2015 57 936-947.</p><p>Brady J.P. et al. Structural and hydrodynamic properties of an intrinsically disordered region of a germ cell-specific protein on phase separation. PNAS 2017 114 8194-8203.</p><p>In the results section we have clarified the use of temperature to control LLPS, “We compared the phosphorylation of FRQ by CK1 in a buffer that supports phase separation under different temperatures, using the latter as a means to control the degree of LLPS without altering the solution composition.”</p><p>On p.16 of the discussion we have elaborated on the above point, “We believe that the reduced CK1 kinase activity toward FRQ as a substrate is directly due to the impact of the generated LLPS milieu, i.e. the changes in structural/dynamic properties of FRQ and/or CK1 induced by the effects of being a phase separate microenvironment, which could be substantially different from non-phase separated buffer environment. For example, previous work done on the disordered region of DDX4 {Brady, 2017 #130;Nott, 2015 #131} show that even the amount of water content and stability of biomolecules such as double strand nucleic acids encapsulated within the droplets differ between non- and phase separated DDX4 samples. Indeed, the spin-labeling experiments indicate that the dynamics of FRQ have been altered by LLPS (Fig. 7D).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. The DEER technique demonstrated spatial proximity between FRH and CK1 when bound to FRQ in the FFC. Is there evidence suggesting their lack of proximity in the absence of FRQ? Also, how important is this spatial proximity to FFC function?</p></disp-quote><p>We have additional data substantiating that FRH and CK1 do not interact in the absence of FRQ. In the revised paper we have included the results of a SEC-MALS experiment showing that FRH and CK1 elute separately when mixed in equimolar amounts and applied to an analytical S200 column coupled to a MALS detector (Figure 1 below and Fig. S8). The importance of the FRH and CK1 proximity is currently unknown, but there are reasons to believe that it could have functional consequences. For example, CK1, as recruited by FRQ, phosphorylates the White-Collar Complex (WCC) in the repressive arm of the circadian oscillator [e.g. He et al. Genes Dev. 20, 2552 (2006); Wang et al, Mol. Cell 74, 771 (2019)]. Interactions between the WCC and the FFC are mediated at least in part by FRH binding to White Collar-2 [Conrad et al. EMBO J. 35, 1707 (2016)]. Thus, FRH:FRQ may effectively bridge CK1 to the WCC to facilitate the phosphorylation of the latter by the former.</p><p>He et al.

Is there any indication that impairing FRQ's ability to undergo LLPS disrupts clock function?</p></disp-quote><p>We do not currently have direct evidence that LLPS of FRQ is essential for clock function. These experiments are ongoing, but complicated by the fact that changes to FRQ predicted to alter LLPS behavior also have the potential to perturb its many other clock-related functions that include dynamic interactions with partners, dynamic post-translational modification and rates of synthesis and degradation. That said, the intrinsic disorder of FRQ is important for it to act as a protein interaction hub, and large intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) very often mediate LLPS, as is certainly the case here. In this work, we argue that the ability of FRQ to sequester clock proteins during the TTFL may involve LLPS. Additionally, we show that the phosphorylation state of FRQ, which is a critical factor in clock period determination, depends on LLPS. Given that the conditions under which FRQ phase separates are physiological in nature and that live-cell imaging is consistent with FRQ phase separation in the nucleus, it seems likely that FRQ does phase separate in Neurospora. Furthermore, given that the sequence features of FRQ that mediate phase-separation are conserved not only across FRQ homologs but also in other functionally related clock proteins, it is probable, albeit worthy of further investigation, that LLPS has functional consequences for the clock.

The horizontal lines are meant to only denote the average molecular weights of the elution peaks and not correlate with the A280 values. The disconnected lines are the light-scattering molecular weight readouts from which the horizontal lines are derived.

Depicting the raw data here unfortunately obscures the differences in the traces and we believe that showing the data as a superposition is quite useful to convey the main differences among the sites. However, we have now explicitly stated in the figure legend that the corresponding raw data traces are given in Figures S5-6.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. Fig.5: For all distance distributions, error intervals should be added (typically done in terms of shaded bands around the best-fit distribution). As shown, precision is visually overstated. The error analysis shown in the SI is dubious, as it shows some distances have no error whatsoever (e.g. 6nm in 370C-490C), which is not possible.</p></disp-quote><p>We did previously show the error intervals in the SI, but we agree that it is better to include them here as well, and have done so in the new Figure 5. With respect to the error analysis, we are following the methodology described in the following paper:</p><p>Srivastava, M. and Freed J., Singular Value Decomposition Method To Determine Distance Distributions in Pulsed Dipolar Electron Spin Resonance: II. Estimating Uncertainty. J. Phys Chem A (2019) 123:359-370. doi: 10.1021/acs.jpca.8b07673.</p><p>Briefly, the uncertainty we are plotting is showing the &quot;range&quot; of singular values over which the singular value decomposition (SVD) solution remains converged. For most of the data displayed in this paper we only used the first few singular values (SVs) and the solution remained converged for ± 1 or 2 SVs near the optimum solution. For example, if the optimum solution was 4 SVs then the range in which the solution remained converged is ~3-6 SVs. We plot three lines - lowest range of SVs, highest range of SVs and optimum number of SVs – in the SI figures the optimum SV solution is shown in black and the region between the converged solutions with the highest and lowest number of SVs is shaded in red. Owing to the point-wise reconstruction of the distance distribution, the SVD method enables localized uncertainty at each distance value. Therefore, some points will have high uncertainty, whereas others low. The distance that may appear to have no uncertainty has actually very low uncertainty; which can be seen at close inspection. In these cases, we observe this &quot;isosbestic&quot; type behavior where the P(r) appears to change little across the acceptable solutions and hence there is only a small range of P(r) values at that particular r. This behavior results from multimodal distributions wherein the change in SVs shifts neighboring peaks to lower and higher distances respectively, producing an apparent cancelation effect. What we believe is most important for the biochemical interpretation, and accurately reflected by this analysis, is the general width of the uncertainty across the distribution and how this impacts the error in both the mean and the overall skewing of the distribution at short or long distances.</p><p>Details of the error treatment as described above have been added to the supplementary methods section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1.

To date condensates have been seen in cyanobacteria (Cohen et al, 2014, Pattanayak et al, 2020) where there are foci containing KaiA/C during the night, in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (Xiao et al, 2021) where PER and dCLK colocalize in nuclear foci near the periphery during the repressive phase, and in Neurospora (Bartholomai et al, 2022) where the RNA binding protein PRD-2 sequesters frq and ck1a transcripts in perinuclear phase separated regions. Because the proteins responsible for the phase separation in cyanobacteria and <italic>Drosophila</italic> are not known, it is not possible to seamlessly disrupt the separation to test its biological significance (Yuan et al, 2022), so only in Neurospora has it been possible to associate loss of phase separation with clock effects. There, loss of PRD-2, or mutation of its RNA-binding domains, results in a ~3 hr period lengthening as well as loss of perinuclear localization of frq transcripts. A very recent manuscript (Xie et al., 2024) calls into question both the importance and very existence of LLPS of clock proteins at least as regards to mammalian cells, noting that it may be an artefact of overexpression in some places where it is seen, and that at normal levels of expression there is no evidence for elevated levels at the nuclear periphery. Artefacts resulting from overexpression plainly cannot be a problem for our study nor for Xiao et al. 2021 as in both cases the relevant clock protein, FRQ or PER, was labeled at the endogenous locus and expressed under its native promoter. Also, it may be worth noting that although we called attention to enrichment of FRQ[NeonGreen] at the nuclear periphery, there remained abundant FRQ within the core of the nucleus in our live-cell imaging.</p><p>Cohen SE, et al.: Dynamic localization of the cyanobacterial circadian clock proteins.

FRQ is plainly not homogenously dispersed within nuclei, and the concentrated foci observed at specific positions in the nuclei indicate condensate behavior similar to that observed for other phase separating proteins (Bartholomai, et al., 2022; Caragliano, et al., 2022; Gonzalez, A., et al., 2021; Tatavosian, et al., 2019; Xiao, et al., 2021). While ongoing experiments are exploring more deeply the spatiotemporal dynamics of FRQ condensates in nuclei, the small size of fungal nuclei as well as their rapid movement with cytoplasmic bulk flow through the hyphal syncytium makes these experiments difficult. Of particular interest is drawing comparisons between FRQ and the <italic>Drosophila</italic> Period protein, which has been observed in similar foci that change in size and subnuclear localization throughout the circadian cycle (Meyer, et al., 2006; Xiao, et al., 2021), although it must be noted that the foci we observed are considerably more dynamic in size and shape than those reported for PER in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (Xiao, et al., 2021). A very recent manuscript (Xie, et al., 2024) calls into question the importance and very existence of LLPS of clock proteins at least in regards to mammalian cells, noting that it may be an artifact of overexpression in some instances where it is seen, and that at normal levels of expression there is no evidence for elevated levels at the nuclear periphery. Artifacts resulting from overexpression are unlikely to be a problem for our study and that of Xiao et al as in both cases clock proteins were tagged at their endogenous locus and expressed from their native promoters. Although we noted enrichment of FRQmNeonGreen near the nuclear envelope in our live-cell imaging, there remained abundant FRQ within the core of the nucleus.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Recommendations For The Authors:</bold></p><p>The data in Fig 6 showing microscopy of Neurospora is suggestive but needs more information/controls. Does the strain that expresses FRQ-mNeonGreen have normal circadian rhythms? How were the cultures handled (in terms of circadian entrainment etc.) for imaging? Do samples taken at different clock times appear different in terms of punctate structures in microscopy? The authors cite the Xiao 2021 paper in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, but would be good to see if the in vivo picture is fundamentally similar in Neurospora.</p></disp-quote><p>All of the live-cell images we report were from cells grown in constant light; in the dark, strains bearing FRQ[NeonGreen] have normally robust rhythms with a slightly elongated period length as measured by a frq Cbox-luc reporter. Although we are interested, of course, in whether and if so how the punctate structures changed as function of circadian time, this is work in progress and beyond the scope of the present study. This said, it is plain to see from the movie included as a Supplemental file here that the puncta we see are moving and fusing/splitting on a scale of seconds whereas those reported in <italic>Drosophila</italic> by Xiao et al. (Xiao et al, 2021, above) were stable for many minutes; thus the FRQ foci seen in Neurospora are quite a bit more dynamic than those in <italic>Drosophila</italic>.</p><p>We have updated the results section on p. 11 to provide this information more clearly:“FRQ thus tagged and driven by its own promoter is expressed at physiologically normal levels, and strains bearing FRQmNeonGreen as the only source of FRQ are robustly rhythmic with a slightly longer than normal period length. Live-cell imaging in <italic>Neurospora crassa</italic> offers atypical challenges because the mycelia grow as syncytia, with continuous rapid nuclei motion during the time of imaging. This constant movement of nuclei is compounded by the very low intranuclear abundance of FRQ and the small size of fungal nuclei, making not readily feasible visualization of intranuclear droplet fission/fusion cycles or intranuclear fluorescent photobleaching recovery experiments (FRAP) that could report on liquid-like properties. Nonetheless, bright and dynamic foci-like spots were observed well inside the nucleus and near the nuclear periphery, which is delineated by the cytoplasm-facing nucleoporin Son-1 tagged with mApple at its C-terminus (Fig. 6D,E, Movie S1). Such foci are characteristic of phase separated IDPs (Bartholomai, et al., 2022; Caragliano, et al., 2022; Gonzalez, A., et al., 2021; Tatavosian, et al., 2019) and share similar patterning to that seen for clock proteins in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (Meyer, et al., 2006; Xiao, et al., 2021), although the foci we observed are substantially more dynamic than those reported in <italic>Drosophila</italic>.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Another issue where some commentary would be helpful: Fig 7 shows that phase separation behavior is strongly temperature dependent (not biophysically surprising). Is that at odds with the known temperature compensation of the circadian rhythm if LLPS indeed plays a key role in the oscillator?</p></disp-quote><p>We believe that the dependence of CK1-mediated FRQ phosphorylation on temperature, as manifested by FRQ phase separation, is consistent with temperature compensation within the Neurospora circadian oscillator. The phenomenon of temperature compensation by circadian clocks involves the intransigence of the oscillator period to temperature change. Stability of period with temperature change would not necessarily be expected of a generic chemical oscillator, which would run faster (shorter period) at higher temperature owing to Arrhenius behavior of the underlying chemical reactions. Circadian phosphorylation of FRQ is one such chemical process that contributes to the oscillation of FRQ abundance on which the clock is based. Reduced CK1 phosphorylation of FRQ causes both longer periods [Mehra et al., 2009] and loss of temperature compensation (manifested as a reduction of period length at higher temperature) [Liu et al, Nat Comm, 10, 4352 (2019); Hu et al, mBio, 12, e01425 (2021)]. Thus, the ability of increased LLPS formation at elevated temperature to reduce FRQ phosphorylation by CK1 (but not intrinsic CK1 autophosphorylation) would be a means to counter a decreasing period length that would otherwise manifest in an under compensated system. As further negative feedback on the system, LLPS is also promoted by FRQ phosphorylation itself, which in turn will reduce phosphorylation by CK1. Thus, both increased FRQ phosphorylation and temperature will couple to increased LLPS and mitigate period shortening through reduction of CK1 activity.</p><p>Mehra et al., A Role for Casein Kinase 2 in the Mechanism Underlying Circadian Temperature Compensation.

Reduced CK1 phosphorylation of FRQ causes both longer periods (Mehra, et al., 2009) and loss of temperature compensation (manifested as a shortening of period at higher temperature) (Hu, et al., 2021; Liu, X., et al., 2019). Thus, the ability of increased LLPS at elevated temperature (larger grey circle) to reduce FRQ phosphorylation by CK1 will counter a shortening period that would otherwise manifest in an under compensated system. As further negative feedback, LLPS is also promoted by increased FRQ phosphorylation, which in turn will reduce phosphorylation by CK1. Thus, both increased FRQ phosphorylation and temperature favor LLPS and reduction of CK1 activity.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>one minor comment: The chemical structures in Fig 3A have some issues where the &quot;N&quot; and &quot;S&quot; are flipped.
