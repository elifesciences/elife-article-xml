model system for studies of their structure and function. Although the vital role of ACs in cellular signalling is well established, the function of their transmembrane (TM) regions remains unknown. Here, we describe the cryo-EM structure of Cya bound to a stabilizing nanobody at 3.6 Å resolution. The TM helices 1–5 form a structurally conserved domain that facilitates the assembly of the helical and catalytic domains. The TM region contains discrete pockets accessible from the extracellular and cytosolic side of the membrane. Neutralization of the negatively charged extracellular pocket Ex1 destabilizes the cytosolic helical domain and reduces the catalytic activity of the enzyme. The TM domain acts as a functional component of Cya, guiding the assembly of the catalytic domain and providing the means for direct regulation of catalytic activity in response to extracellular ligands.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd><italic>M. tuberculosis</italic></kwd><kwd>adenylyl cyclase</kwd><kwd>membrane protein</kwd><kwd>cyclic adenosine monophosphate</kwd><kwd>signalling</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001711</institution-id><institution>Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Förderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>150665</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Korkhov</surname><given-names>Volodymyr M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001711</institution-id><institution>Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Förderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>176992</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Korkhov</surname><given-names>Volodymyr M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001711</institution-id><institution>Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Förderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>184951</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Korkhov</surname><given-names>Volodymyr M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection, and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Structure of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> Rv1625c/Cya provides clues to the potential functional role of the transmembrane domain in the membrane adenylyl cyclases.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Adenylyl cyclases (ACs) convert molecules of ATP into 3,5-cyclic AMP (cAMP), a universal second messenger and a master regulator of cellular homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Linder, 2006</xref>).

This protein is one of the sixteen ACs present in genome of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>, and one of five ACs predicted to be polytopic membrane proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bai et al., 2011</xref>). The exact function of Cya is not clear, although available evidence indicates that the protein may be involved in CO<sub>2</sub> sensing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Townsend et al., 2009</xref>) and cholesterol utilization by <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Johnson et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">VanderVen et al., 2015</xref>). Cholesterol utilization during infection by <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> is linked to its pathogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Wilburn et al., 2018</xref>), indicating a potential role of Cya at some stages of macrophage infection. The catalytic domain of Cya belongs to the class III AC/guanylyl cyclase (GC) fold, similar to the mammalian membrane ACs. Unlike the mammalian ACs, Cya is predicted to include only six TM helices, with TM6 extending into a HD connected to the catalytic domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B, C</xref>). The protein has to dimerize to form a functional unit that has been previously presumed to resemble the pseudo-heterodimeric fold of the full-length mammalian ACs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Ketkar et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Vercellino et al., 2017</xref>). Although the structures of the <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> Cya-soluble domain in monomeric form (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Ketkar et al., 2006</xref>) and that of the homologous <italic>M. intracellulare</italic> Cya in dimeric form <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Vercellino et al., 2017</xref> have been solved using X-ray crystallography, a structure of a full-length mycobacterial AC that includes the TM region has not been determined until now.</p><p>The role of the membrane domain in membrane ACs is a mystery. Polytopic membrane nucleotidyl cyclases with membrane domains of known function have been described in several organisms. The ACs in <italic>Paramecium</italic>, <italic>Plasmodium</italic>, and <italic>Tetrahymena</italic> are fused to an ion channel module (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Weber et al., 2004</xref>), and the light-sensitive GCs in several fungi, such as <italic>Blastocladiella emersonii</italic>, which are fused to a rhodopsin-like membrane module that binds a light-sensitive retinal chromophore (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Avelar et al., 2014</xref>). However, the functional role of the TM regions in the mammalian membrane ACs remains unclear. Although our structure of the bovine AC9 provided a description of the unique TM helix arrangement in the membrane anchor of the protein, it shed relatively little light on the possible function of the membrane domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Qi et al., 2019</xref>). Interestingly, experiments with domain-substituted Cya, a presumptive evolutionary ancestor of the mammalian ACs, have suggested that its membrane region may have a regulatory role, potentially acting as a receptor for yet unidentified ligands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Beltz et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Understanding the structure and function of the AC membrane domains, conserved through evolution from bacteria to mammals, is essential for understanding the regulation of cAMP generation by the cells at rest and during AC activation. The importance and necessity of a complex polytopic membrane domain in the membrane ACs is one of the key open questions in the cAMP signalling field.

One of these reagents, nanobody 4 (NB4), had no effect on the catalytic activity of the full-length cyclase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>), but had a nanomolar affinity for the SOL domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E</xref>). We reconstituted a complex of the detergent-purified full-length Cya and NB4 (mixed at a molar ratio of 1:1.5), in the presence of 0.5 mM MANT-GTP (a non-cyclizable nucleotide-derived AC inhibitor), and 5 mM MnCl<sub>2</sub>. The sample was subjected to cryo-EM imaging and single particle analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>), yielding a 3D reconstruction of the protein in C1 symmetry at 3.8 Å resolution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplements 2</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>).</p><p>The reconstruction revealed the full-length Cya arranged as a dimer bound to three copies of NB4 nanobody: two copies bound symmetrically to the SOL portions of the Cya dimer, and one asymmetrically bound to the extracellular surface of the protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). To visualize the details of the Cya–NB4 interaction, we crystallized the SOL construct in the presence of NB4 and solved the X-ray structure of the complex at 2.1 Å resolution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>).

This may be an indication that the exact structural alignment of the TM domain and the relatively remote catalytic domain may not be a conserved feature of the membrane ACs. Instead, it is likely that the precise TM–HD and HD–catalytic domain coupling plays the key role in the formation and regulation of the catalytic centre in the membrane AC, consistent with the function of the HD as a transducer element in the AC structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Ziegler et al., 2017</xref>).</p><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>The role of the transmembrane (TM) domain as a chaperone for helical domain (HD)/adenylyl cyclase (AC) assembly.</title><p>Guide rail-like structures are formed by the TM1–5 in Cya (black, <bold>A</bold>) and the TM1–5/TM7–11 in AC9 (white, <bold>B</bold>).

A comparison of the 6-TM bundle of Cya with the corresponding regions in the bovine AC9 (TM1–6 and TM7–12) shows that the helices TM1–5 (and TM7–11 for the AC9) form a well defined structural motif (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D, E</xref>). A striking difference between the Cya and AC9 membrane domains is that the TM region that forms the HD helix is swapped in AC9: the TM12 of AC9 occupies the same position as the TM6 of Cya. Similarly, TM6 in AC9 is placed in a corresponding position relative to the TM7–11 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F, G</xref>). The TM1–5 bundle in Cya appears to act as a ‘guide rail’ for the TM6/HD helix of Cya, guiding the correct assembly of the HD coiled coil and the catalytic domain of the cyclase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). This feature is remarkably similar in AC9, with TM1–5 and TM7–11 arranged in a near-identical way (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>), and with a closely matching HD core (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>).</p><p>The previous experiments in <italic>M. intracellulare</italic> Cya have shown that the HD and the TM regions of the protein are critically important for the protein’s dimerization and functional assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Vercellino et al., 2017</xref>). The lack of the TM region results in failure to form a stable active dimer of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> Rv1625c/Cya, even in the presence of a nucleotide analogue MANT-GTP, judged by the inability of MANT-GTP to induce crystallization of the protein in a dimeric form (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5</xref>). In contrast, the soluble domain of the <italic>M. intracellulare</italic> Cya is effectively dimerized by MANT-GTP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Vercellino et al., 2017</xref>). The importance of the TM domain as a factor that promotes correct protein folding is further illustrated by the ability of the isolated Cya-SOL construct to form an inactive domain-swapped dimeric assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Barathy et al., 2014</xref>). It is thus tempting to suggest that the key function of the TM domain in a membrane AC is to guide the assembly of the enzyme in a catalytically competent form.</p><p>This may have important implications for AC regulation. In a related enzyme, the NO-sensing sGC, the heme-containing NO-receptor domain is fused to the HD region in place of the TM regions seen in Cya or in the mammalian AC9 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E–G</xref>). In its inactive form, the sGC displays a conformation where HD helices are bent, with an accompanying substantial unwinding of the HD core (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). Comparison of the Cya HD core with that of the sGC HD core highlights this discrepancy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). In contrast, activation of sGC is accompanied with a large-scale conformational change, ‘straightening’ the HD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref>) and adopting the HD conformation that closely matches that of Cya (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref>). The position of the ‘kink’ in the HD of sGC approximately corresponds to the membrane–cytosol interface in Cya. Thus, the very distant yet related proteins sGC and Cya (as well as AC9 and other membrane ACs) may be subject to very similar modes of regulation involving changes in the HD, which may result in changes in the catalytic domain of the protein. While in sGC the process is guided by the heme-containing receptor domain, in the membrane ACs this function is likely performed by the TM domain.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>The TM domain of Cya as a putative receptor module</title><p>The structure of Cya revealed several prominent cavities in the TM domain of the protein, which may serve a stabilizing or regulatory role (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>).

Comparative analysis of the LiP-MS profile of the wild-type Cya and the Ex1-5A mutant revealed a significant increase in protease accessibility of the HD in the mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G, H</xref>). Thus, modification of the extracellular site Ex1 of Cya leads to changes in the dynamics of its cytosolic HD, accompanied by a dramatic reduction in enzymatic activity.</p><p>Interestingly, only two of the site Ex1 residues are well conserved, based on the alignment of 180 close homologues of Cya (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplements 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">3A</xref>): while T122 and Q127 are relatively well conserved, the residues D123, E164, and D170 are not. Although our evidence points to a possibility of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> Cya Ex1 site’s involvement in cation binding, this region may play distinct roles in the Cya homologues of other mycobacterial species. Likewise, the site Ex2 is lined by largely nonconserved residues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3B</xref>). Developing a more precise understanding of this site’s functional role will be a prerequisite for understanding the significance of the few conserved residues in this pocket (F87, A109, G125 in the <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> Cya).</p><p>To further support our insights derived from the experiments with the Ex1-5A mutant we performed the MD simulations with Ex1-5A protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>), using the identical protocol as those used for the wild-type Cya (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref>).

As expected, metal ion binding was preserved at the cytosolic domain of the Ex1-5A, but was completely disrupted at the extracellular Ex1 site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2B, C</xref>). Analysis of the distances between select residues in Cya and in Ex1-5A showed that although the core remains relatively stable for both protein, the TM1–5 region may be more conformationally flexible (judged by the increased average distances between the residues A77–A77 and L92–L92 within the dimer; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2D, E</xref>). The same is true for portions of the catalytic domain, evident from the increased average distance in the residue Q289. Together with the functional data, the results of the MD simulations strongly suggest that disruption of the extracellular surface of Cya (site Ex1) leads to profound changes within the intramembrane part of the protein, as well as at a distant catalytic domain.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The cryo-EM structure of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> Cya provides a unique insight into the assembly and regulation of a model membrane AC. To this day, the functional role of the TM region in the polytopic membrane AC, such as Cya or the mammalian AC1–9, remains elusive. Why does a cell need an AC with such an elaborate membrane anchor? A lipid anchor or a single TM helix would be sufficient to target the catalytic domain to the membrane compartment where cAMP production is required. Our structure provides two possible reasons for the ACs to have such a TM domain: (1) to facilitate the assembly of the HD domain and (2) to act as a receptor module, binding ligands at several newly identified putative ligand-binding sites, including the pockets within the Cya monomers and at the Cya–Cya interface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). The two functions are not mutually exclusive, as the ligand interactions with the membrane region of the AC may influence the HD assembly and thus regulate the cyclase function. Previous work utilizing chimeric constructs composed of fragments of the quorum sensing receptor CqsS from <italic>Vibrio harveyi</italic> and Cya (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Beltz et al., 2016</xref>) or mammalian membrane ACs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Seth et al., 2020</xref>) revealed that the membrane anchors of the ACs may act as orphan receptors for yet unknown ligands. Together with the proposed functional coupling between the TM domain and the catalytic site of Cya, the structure described here is consistent with these findings, offering molecular insights into the potential receptor role of the membrane anchor of a model membrane AC.</p><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Function and structure of Rv1625c/Cya.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Known regulators and cellular functions of Cya.

It is possible that transient interactions of cations with protein surfaces play a basic role in surface charge compensation. However, the properties of the Ex1 site are strongly suggestive of a specific ligand-binding site, with a cluster of 10 polar residues (6 negatively charged residues) at the Cya dimer interface pointing towards the Ex1 cavity. The most telling evidence for the role of this site in cation binding is the MD simulation, which revealed two locations on the Cya surface where the metal ions dwell: the established metal-binding site in the catalytic pocket, and the site Ex1. Modification of the charges of the Ex1 by mutagenesis reduced the activity of the protein, further suggesting that this site at the extracellular surface of the protein likely plays a pivotal role in controlling the assembly of the catalytically active dimeric Cya.</p><p>It is worth noting that sensing of extracellular metals is well established in eukaryotic and prokaryotic cell signalling. For example, a prominent example in mammalian signalling pathway is the calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR), a GPCR involved in regulation of Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gao et al., 2021</xref>). In bacteria, salt sensing has been shown in histidine kinases (<italic>Sphingomonas melonis</italic> KipF) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kaczmarczyk et al., 2015</xref>) and in chemotaxis receptors (<italic>E. coli</italic> Tar) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bi et al., 2018</xref>). Thus, a potential link between extracellular metal ion sensing and cAMP signalling that may be mediated by the <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> Cya is within the realm of possibility and presents an interesting avenue for future investigations.</p><p>The presence of potential ligand-binding pockets at the extracellular surface of Cya lends strong support to the long-standing idea that the TM domains of the ACs may act as receptor modules for yet unknown ligands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Beltz et al., 2016</xref>). The possibility of direct regulation of cAMP production via the membrane anchors of the ACs would have long-reaching consequences: a vast repertoire of pharmacological agents on the market today act via GPCRs coupled to membrane ACs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Sriram and Insel, 2018</xref>). Direct modulation of the cAMP production through the AC membrane domains could revolutionize the approaches to drug development for a wide range of diseases where the GPCRs are currently the primary drug targets. A related notion of importance for molecular pharmacology and medicinal chemistry is the potential interactions between the already existing drugs and the membrane domains of the ACs. Such interactions may lead to unwanted side effects associated with cAMP signalling, such as emesis and changes in heart rate and contractility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Parnell et al., 2015</xref>). An example of this is the antifungal drug miconazole, which is known to have cardiotoxic effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fainstein and Bodey, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Won et al., 2012</xref>). Miconazole has recently been shown to directly activate AC9, likely via its TM domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Simpson et al., 2019</xref>). The interaction with AC9 may contribute to the cardiorespiratory side effects of this drug. Similar interactions involving other drug/AC combinations may have to be systematically evaluated, especially in the cases where changes in cAMP levels or in the downstream signalling events are recognized as side effects.</p><p>In the absence of known interaction partners for the membrane regions of the ACs it is difficult to predict the effect of ligand binding to any of the pockets we find in the Cya structure. Nevertheless, the structure hints at ways that could be exploited by various agents to affect the AC activity via the membrane domain. The closest example of cyclase modulation through the receptor-mediated effect on the HD helices is the case of soluble GC, described at atomic resolution, has been detailed above (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kang et al., 2019</xref>). The presence of disease-linked mutations in the HD regions of AC5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chen et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Carecchio et al., 2017</xref>) and retGC1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Tucker et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Zhao et al., 2013</xref>) underscore the importance of this domain for cyclase structure and function. It is clear that the HD region plays a vital part in AC and GC assembly and stability. This is evident from our experiments with the <italic>M. intracellulare Cya</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Vercellino et al., 2017</xref>), as well as the results of others using Cya and mammalian ACs as model enzymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Guo et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Ziegler et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Seth et al., 2020</xref>). It remains to be determined whether any agents can elicit conformational changes in the membrane domain of Cya (or in any of the mammalian membrane ACs), leading to substantial changes in the HD similar in scale to the changes observed in the sGC during its activation. Our MD simulations and the experiments with the Ex1-5A mutant of Cya are suggestive of a receptor–transducer–catalyst relay, where the extracellular portion of the TM region acts as a ‘receptor’ for a yet unknown ligand, the HD transduces the activation, and the catalytic domain catalyses ATP to cAMP conversion. This notion is further supported by previous work on Cya that identified the HD region as a transducer of a putative signal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Beltz et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Ziegler et al., 2017</xref>).

The resolution cutoff was chosen taking into account the values of CC1/2 and mean I/sigma(I) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Karplus and Diederichs, 2012</xref>). Phasing/refinement was performed using Phenix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adams et al., 2010</xref>). Phases were resolved by molecular replacement using templates (cya: 5O5K, nanobody: 6FPV). Coot was used for model building and geometrical optimization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Emsley and Cowtan, 2004</xref>).

The missing N- and C-terminus of Cya were modelled using I-TASSER server (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Yang et al., 2015</xref>), and the protein was inserted into lipid membrane, solvated and ionized using the Membrane Builder tools in CHARMM-GUI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jo et al., 2008</xref>). Lipid membrane composed of 60 POPC, 40 POPG, 40 POPE, 20 POPI, 20 DLGL, and 20 cholesterol molecules. The system was solvated with TIP3 water molecules extended to 25 Å from the edge of the protein and with per lipid hydration number of 50. Subsequently the system was neutralized with Cl<sup>−</sup> ions, and then was brought to a final concentration of 0.15 M KCl or 0.15 M MgCl<sub>2</sub>. All of the generated systems were subjected to energy minimization, and six-step NVT and NPT equilibration using the default scheme provided in the CHARM-GUI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Halls and Cooper, 2011</xref>), followed by 200 ns of a production run. Final trajectories were analysed using tools in available the GROMACS package. The Volmap tool in VMD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Humphrey et al., 1996</xref>) was used for generating occupancy/density maps. The figures related to the MD simulations were prepared using VMD or Pymol.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Limited proteolysis-coupled mass spectrometry</title><p>Wild-type and mutant Cya protein preparations were diluted in LiP buffer (1 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 150 mM KCl, 100 mM N-2-hydroxyethylpiperazine-N’-2-ethanesulfonic acid (HEPES)–KOH pH 7.4) with 0.1% digitonin. Mutant and wild-type samples were split into eight samples each at a protein amount of 2 µg of protein per 50 µl of buffer. Four out of eight WT and mutant samples were treated with PK from <italic>Tritirachium album</italic> (Sigma-Aldrich) (limited proteolysis, LiP), whereas the other four were treated with water instead (TC). The samples were incubated in a Thermocycler for 5 min at 25°C. PK was inactivated by heating the samples to 99°C for 5 min, then incubating them at 4°C for 5 min, followed by the addition of the same volume of 10% sodium deoxycholate. LiP and TC underwent the same procedures.</p><sec id="s4-11-1"><title>Tryptic digest</title><p>Following the addition of sodium deoxycholate, disulfide bonds were reduced by adding tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine to a final concentration of 5 mM and incubating the samples at 37°C for 40 min with slight agitation. Free cysteine residues were alkylated with iodoacetamide at a final concentration of 40 mM and 30 min of incubation at room temperature in the dark with slight agitation. The samples were diluted with 100 mM ammonium bicarbonate to a final sodium deoxycholate concentration of 1%. Lysyl endopeptidase LysC was added at an enzyme to substrate ratio of 1:50 and samples were incubated for 1 hr at 37°C with slight agitation. Next, trypsin was added at an enzyme to substrate ration of 1:50 and incubated at 37°C overnight with slight agitation. The digestion was stopped by adding 50% formic acid to the samples to achieve a final concentration of 2% formic acid. Precipitated sodium deoxycholate was removed by filtering through a Corning 2 µM polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) plate and samples were further desalted on a 96-well MacroSpin plate (The Nest Group). Peptides were eluted with 80% acetonitrile, 1% formic acid and dried in a vacuum centrifuge. After drying, samples were reconstituted in 20 µl 0.1% formic acid and iRT peptides (Biognosys) were added.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11-2"><title>LC–MS/MS data acquisition</title><p>Samples were measured on an Orbitrap Exploris 480 mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher), equipped with a nanoelectrospray source and an Easy-nLC 1200 nano-flow LC system (Thermo Fisher). 1 µl of digest was injected and separated on a 40 cm × 0.75 i.d. column packed in-house with 1.9 µm C18 beads (Dr. Maisch Reprosil-Pur 120) using a linear gradient from 3% to 35% B (eluent A: 0.1% formic acid, eluent B: 95% acetonitrile, 1% formic acid). Gradient duration was 30 min, whereas the whole method was 60 min long. Samples were measured at a constant flowrate of 300 nl/min while the column was heated to 50°C. All samples were acquired in DIA (41 windows, 1 <italic>m</italic>/<italic>z</italic> overlap) and analysed in Spectronaut v15 (Biognosys). Further data analysis was carried out in R using mainly the R package protti (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Quast, 2021</xref>). Briefly, the abundances of Rv1625c mutant and wild type were compared in the tryptic controls and the protein abundances in the LiP samples were corrected accordingly. Statistical testing on peptide level to detect peptide abundance differences was conducted employing the proDA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ahlmann-Eltze, 2020</xref>) algorithm, implemented in protti. The Rv1625c PDB file was edited and the <italic>B</italic> factors were replaced with the maximum absolute value of the calculated log<sub>2</sub>(fold change) at each position. In pyMOL, the protein was then coloured according to the replaced <italic>B</italic> factors to highlight regions changing regions.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11-3"><title>LiP-MS data interpretation</title><p>Whether a peptide decreases or increases in abundance is dependent on the accessibility of the native protein to PK. In a standard LiP-MS experiment, three peptide types can be detected, dependent on the proteolytic cleavage:</p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Semi-tryptic peptides are generated by a cleavage of PK on either the N-terminal or the C-terminal side of the peptide and a cleavage by trypsin on the respective other side.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Tryptic peptides are not cleaved by PK at all.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Non-tryptic peptides were cleaved by PK on both sides.</p></list-item></list><p>Depending on the peptide type an increase or decrease in abundance can be interpreted in different ways. A tryptic peptide that decreases in abundance was additionally cleaved by PK, hence it disappears. This likely means that the protein region became more accessible to PK. On the other hand, a tryptic peptide that increases in abundance can be interpreted as the region becoming less accessible to PK. A semi-tryptic peptide that increases in abundance can be explained as the protein region cleaved by PK becoming more accessible. A semi-tryptic peptide that decreases in abundance can be explained in two different ways: either the protein region became more protected, hence inaccessible to PK, or the protein region became more accessible and the peptide was not detected because of additional PK cleavage sites that were introduced with the conformational change.</p></sec></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf2"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Investigation, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Conceptualization, Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Investigation, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Investigation, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con8"><p>Data curation, Validation, Investigation, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con9"><p>Resources, Supervision, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con10"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Data curation, Formal analysis, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s6"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="supp1"><label>Supplementary file 1.</label><caption><title>Cryo-EM analysis and statistics.</title></caption><media xlink:href="elife-77032-supp1-v3.docx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="docx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="supp2"><label>Supplementary file 2.</label><caption><title>X-ray data analysis and statistics.</title></caption><media xlink:href="elife-77032-supp2-v3.docx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="docx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="transrepform"><label>Transparent reporting form</label><media xlink:href="elife-77032-transrepform1-v3.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="s7"><title>Data availability</title><p>The atomic coordinates and structure factors have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank (7YZ9, 7YZI, 7YZK); the density maps have been deposited in the Electron Microscopy Data Bank (EMD-14388, EMD-14389).

Your article has been reviewed by 2 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Nancy Carrasco as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The manuscript would benefit from a more detailed comparison with the AC9 structure. In particular, are the four potential pockets in Cya also found in AC9?</p><p>2) It would be helpful to comment and show a figure of the conservation of the pockets. Are they conserved both among similar mycobacterial enzymes and the mammalian family? Does this tell the authors anything about their role (i.e. are they different, suggesting different ligand binding sites, or the same suggesting a similar compound could be bound)?</p><p>3) The authors suggest site Ex1 binds a metal and that this may play a sensing role. if the authors make this claim I think they should provide evidence that the occupancy of the site can change under the expected physiological concentration changes. Can MD provide some hints to the metal affinity? Can changing buffers or adding chelating agents remove the ion? Is there any evidence for extracellular ion sensors?</p><p>4) The authors show in Figure 1, that SOL Cya (203-433) is not active. It binds NB4 with high affinity but no mention of its effect on activity. A data set of SOL-NB4 should be added to panel 1D for completeness. Moreover, the authors should contrast their results with a previous report (Guo, 2001) showing a similar construct [MRGSH6GS-Cya (204-443)] fully active (sp. act. ~ 1-2 μmol cAMP/mg/min) as a dimer.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The authors show in Figure 1, that SOL Cya (203-433) is not active.

As expected, metal ion binding was preserved at the cytosolic domain of the Ex1-5A, but was completely disrupted at the extracellular Ex1 site (Figure S13B-C). Analysis of the distances between select residues in Cya and in Ex15A showed that although the core remains relatively stable for both protein, the TM1-5 region may be more conformationally flexible (judged by the increased average distances between the residues A77-A77 and L92-L92 within the dimer; Figure S13D-E). The same is true for portions of the catalytic domain, evident from the increased average distance in the residue Q289.

Furthermore, the membrane protein only experiences the nanobody shortly before plunge-freezing into liquid ethane. Thus, at the folding/assembly stage (in the cell) the protein does not encounter the nanobody. This consideration excludes the risk of affecting the fold of the protein.
