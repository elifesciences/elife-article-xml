substrates. As these enzymes are large, multi-subunit complexes that generally lack natural small-molecule ligands and are difficult to inhibit via conventional means, alternative strategies are needed to target them in diseases, and peptide-based inhibitors derived from degrons represent a promising approach. Here we explore peptide inhibitors of Cdc20, a substrate-recognition subunit and activator of the E3 ubiquitin ligase the anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C) that is essential in mitosis and consequently of interest as an anti-cancer target. APC/C engages substrates via degrons that include the ‘destruction box’ (D-box) motif. We used a rational design approach to construct binders containing unnatural amino acids aimed at better filling a hydrophobic pocket that contributes to the D-box binding site on the surface of Cdc20. We confirmed binding by thermal-shift assays and surface plasmon resonance and determined the structures of a number of the Cdc20-peptide complexes. Using a cellular thermal shift assay, we confirmed that the D-box peptides also bind to and stabilise Cdc20 in the cell. We found that the D-box peptides inhibit ubiquitination activity of APC/C<sup>Cdc20</sup> and are more potent than the small-molecule inhibitor Apcin. Lastly, these peptides function as portable degrons capable of driving the degradation of a fused fluorescent protein. Interestingly, we find that although inhibitory activity of the peptides correlates with Cdc20-binding affinity, degradation efficacy does not, which may be due to the complex nature of APC/C regulation and effects of degron binding of subunit recruitment and conformational changes. Our study lays the groundwork for the further development of these peptides as molecular therapeutics for blocking APC/C as well as potentially for harnessing the APC/C for targeted protein degradation.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome</kwd><kwd>APC/C</kwd><kwd>peptide inhibitor</kwd><kwd>protein–protein interaction</kwd><kwd>degron</kwd><kwd>ubiquitin</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>E. coli</italic></kwd><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000289</institution-id><institution>Cancer Research UK</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>C17838/A27225</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Itzhaki</surname><given-names>Laura S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100011704</institution-id><institution>Pancreatic Cancer Research Fund</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Itzhaki</surname><given-names>Laura S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000854</institution-id><institution>Human Frontier Science Program</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id award-id-type="doi">10.52044/hfsp.rgp00272020.pc.gr.165420</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Itzhaki</surname><given-names>Laura S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000268</institution-id><institution>Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BB/R004137/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lindon</surname><given-names>Catherine</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004325</institution-id><institution>AstraZeneca</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Eapen</surname><given-names>Rohan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000833</institution-id><institution>Rosetrees Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Okoye</surname><given-names>Cynthia</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100005370</institution-id><institution>Gates Cambridge Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Okoye</surname><given-names>Cynthia</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund8"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000265</institution-id><institution>Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Barford</surname><given-names>David</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Peptide inhibitors of E3 ubiquitin ligase anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome, engineered for enhanced affinity by incorporating unnatural amino acids, are able to block substrate ubiquitination and drive degradation of a fused target.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>E3 ubiquitin ligases recognise their substrates via short linear motifs (SLiMs) known as degrons on the substrates, which are often located in intrinsically disordered regions and bind with rather weak affinities (in the micromolar range) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Tompa and Fuxreiter, 2008</xref>;

Recognition of the substrate by the proteasome depends on the number, type, and length of polyubiquitin chains and requires poly-ubiquitination through multiple rounds of recruitment of a ubiquitin-loaded conjugating E2 enzyme (UbcH10 or Ube2S) to the substrate-bound E3. There are numerous examples in which ubiquitination and degradation require the E3 to bind to multiple degrons on the substrate, a particularly striking case being the anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C), a giant multi-protein complex that controls progression of cells out of mitosis via the coordinated ubiquitination and degradation of over 100 different substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Karamysheva et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Di Fiore et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Tian et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Okoye et al., 2022</xref>). APC/C function requires one of two coactivators, Cdc20 and Cdh1/FZR1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Min et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Davey and Morgan, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bakos et al., 2018</xref>), which comprise a substrate-binding WD40 domain and N- and C-terminal disordered regions that bind to other APC/C subunits and lead to conformational change and enhanced E2 binding. APC/C<sup>Cdc20</sup> activity is further controlled by the mitotic checkpoint complex (MCC) that inhibits APC/C in the presence of faulty chromosome attachments to the mitotic spindle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Izawa and Pines, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Di Fiore et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Qiao et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alfieri et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Watson et al., 2019</xref>). APC/C<sup>Cdc20</sup> activity reduces as cells exit mitosis, the coactivator is switched to Cdh1/FZR1, and APC/C<sup>FZR1</sup> is active until the end of G1 phase. In addition to coactivator switching and post-translational modifications, the APC/C further controls the order of substrate degradation via differential degron-binding affinities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Davey and Morgan, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alfieri et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bodrug et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Okoye et al., 2022</xref>), leading to different processivity of ubiquitination and chain linkages and thereby effective engagement of the proteasome, although the precise details of the relationship between APC/C-substrate interactions and the number, type, and length of polyubiquitin chains formed have not been fully resolved (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Structure and function of anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C).</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic of APC/C activity during mitotic exit, indicating the switch in co-activator from Cdc20 to FZR1.

Coactivators Cdc20 and FZR1 have at least three binding sites for substrate degrons: the ‘Destruction-box’ (D-box), the KEN motif, and the ABBA motif (thought to be required for Cyclin A degradation only; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Qin et al., 2017</xref>). A study of the structure of APC/C-FZR1 in complex with its pseudo-substrate inhibitor Acm1 showed that all three of the Acm1 degrons can bind simultaneously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">He et al., 2013</xref>). The KEN motif is recognised by the ‘top’ surface of the WD40 beta-propeller domain of the co-activator, and the ABBA motif binds to the ‘side’ of the beta-propeller at one of its blades. The D-box binding site comprises a cleft between two of the beta-propeller blades and the neighbouring APC/C subunit APC10, which is thought to result in stabilisation of the active complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Burton and Tsakraklides, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Buschhorn et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">da Fonseca et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chang et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Matyskiela and Morgan, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Qin et al., 2019</xref>). Most recently, single-molecule studies have shed new insights into the key role of degron multivalency in enabling efficient substrate ubiquitination and degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hartooni et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p>Inhibitors of APC/C<sup>Cdc20</sup> activity represent an interesting therapeutic approach to target dividing cells in cancer. Given the large size of the APC/C machine (14 subunits) and the complex mechanisms described above that regulate its function, it is not surprising that it is challenging to inhibit. Apcin and TAME are recently identified small-molecule inhibitors, but they have limited activity and complicated output (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Richeson et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Sackton et al., 2014</xref>). In this paper, we use a rational design approach, based on D-box consensus sequences and a ‘Super D-box’ peptide derived from Hsl1, and examination of the Cdc20-degron interface, to design a series of more potent binders containing unnatural amino acids aimed at better filling the D-box hydrophobic pocket on the interaction interface. We quantified binding by thermal shift assays (TSAs) and surface plasmon resonance (SPR) and used a cellular thermal shift assay (CETSA) to demonstrate target engagement within the cellular context. The peptides also show functional engagement with APC/C in the cell as evidenced by their ability to drive the degradation of a fluorescent protein. Most strikingly, in vitro ubiquitination assays with recombinant APC/C<sup>Cdc20</sup> show that these peptides are more potent inhibitors of Cyclin B1 ubiquitination than Apcin. Interestingly, we find that although inhibitory activity of the peptides correlates with Cdc20-binding affinity, their degradation efficacy does not. This may be due to the complex nature of APC/C degrons and their bipartite interaction with different subunits, role in E2 recruitment, and consequent impact of positioning for effective ubiquitination. The results provide a useful starting point for the further development of these peptides as molecular therapeutics for blocking APC/C, as well as potentially also for harnessing APC/C for targeted protein degradation.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Cloning, expression, and purification of Cdc20</title><p>DNA encoding residues 161–477 of human Cdc20 (Cdc20<sup>WD40</sup>) was cloned into a pU1 vector with an N-terminal His<sub>6</sub>-tag followed by a TEV protease cleavage site. The plasmid was then transformed into DH10 MultiBac cells expressing a Cre-recombinase. Positive clones were grown up and bacmid DNA prepared by standard protocols. Sf21 or Sf9 cells were grown at 27°C in Erlenmeyer flasks (Corning) and maintained in mid-log phase of growth prior to all experiments. High-titre baculovirus was produced by transfecting bacmid DNA into Sf21 cells at 0.5×10<sup>6</sup> cells/ml cells using Superfect (QIAGEN) in 24 deep-well blocks. Virus was harvested 1 week post transfection. For protein over-expression, Sf21 or Sf9 cells were infected with the virus stock and harvested about 60 hours post infection. Cell pellets were resuspended in 50 mM Tris-HCl, 300 mM NaCl, 1 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 mM TCEP, 5% (v/v) glycerol, SigmaFAST EDTA-free protease inhibitor cocktail (1 tablet/100 ml), pH 8.5.

Proteins were then eluted with the above buffer including 300 mM imidazole directly into a 26/10 desalting column pre-equilibrated in the above buffer without imidazole. Eluted protein fractions were then pooled, and the His<sub>6</sub>-tag was removed using His<sub>6</sub>-TEV protease (S219V) overnight at 4°C.

One of the clearest examples is a study that tested the degradation of 15 substrates of yeast APC/C in strains carrying alleles of Cdh1 in which the docking sites for D-box, KEN, or ABBA were mutated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Qin et al., 2017</xref>). The authors observed that, whereas degradation of all 15 substrates depended on D-box binding, only a subset required the KEN binding site on Cdh1 and only one required the ABBA binding site. A more recent study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hartooni et al., 2022</xref>) of binding affinities of different degron peptides concluded that KEN motif has very low affinity for Cdc20 and is unlikely to mediate degradation of APC/C-Cdc20 substrates. Engagement of substrate with the D-box receptor is therefore the most critical event mediating APC/C activity and the interaction that needs to be blocked for most effective inhibition of substrate degradation.</p><p>Crystal structures of the D-box-coactivator interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chao et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">He et al., 2013</xref>) show that there are three key residues, Arginine 1, Leucine 4, and Asparagine 9 in the RxxLxxxxN D-box motif (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Leucine 4 contacts a hydrophobic pocket in the co-activator subunit, whereas the ‘tail’ of the D-box degron and its flanking sequence (residues 8–12) contact the APC10 subunit.

Despite the relatively high affinity of <bold>D21</bold> and the approximate 1:1.5 ratio of protein to peptide used in co-crystallisation experiments, crystals were absent of peptide ligands and instead contained the 2-methyl-2,4-pentanediol (MPD) molecule in the leucine-(P4) binding cleft (data not shown), originating from the crystallisation solution. We therefore adopted a similar protocol to that described by Sackton et al., whereby MPD was ‘washed’ out from the crystal prior to performing a soaking experiment with the desired ligand. We attempted these soaking experiments with our four highest affinity peptides, <bold>D21</bold>, <bold>D20</bold>, <bold>D7</bold>, and <bold>D19</bold> (in order of highest affinity to lowest) and were able to observe sufficient ligand density for all but <bold>D19</bold>.</p><p>The crystal structures of Cdc20<sup>WD40</sup> in complex with each of the other three D-box peptides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A–C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>) show that they bound to Cdc20<sup>WD40</sup> at the canonical D-box degron binding site, with a largely similar topology to the <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> Acm1-Cdh1 structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>; overlay of <bold>D21</bold> with Acm1 D-box). The guanidino group of the P1 arginine residue of the D-box peptides forms hydrogen bonds with the carboxylate side chains of Asp177 and Glu465 of Cdc20<sup>WD40</sup>. The nitrogen backbone atom of the (<italic>S</italic>)–2-amino-4,4,4-trifluorobutanoic acid/(<italic>S</italic>)–2-amino-4,4-dimethylpentanoic acid unnatural amino acids also forms a hydrogen bond with the carbonyl of Asp177. Additionally, the carbonyl of S5 belonging to <bold>D21</bold>/<bold>D20</bold> forms a H-bond with the nitrogen backbone atom of Asp177. Lastly, Asp6 forms inter-molecular H-bonds with Arg174. We also observed an intra-molecular H-bond between the carbonyl of A2 with the amine of Gly5/Ser5, in addition to the carbonyl of A2 to the hydroxyl of Ser5 in <bold>D21</bold>/<bold>D20</bold>. Crystal packing of an adjacent asymmetric unit of the WD40 domain likely occludes the assumed binding site for the C-terminal three residues (…<bold>ITN</bold>-NH<sub>2</sub>). We therefore conclude that this is the reason for the lack of observed density in this region of the peptides <bold>D20</bold> and <bold>D21</bold> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1E and F</xref>, respectively). We believe that it causes a reduction in binding affinities of all peptides <italic>in crystallo</italic>, given the evidence from SPR highlighting a role of position 7 in the interaction (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). Interestingly, the observed electron density of the peptide correlates with Cdc20 binding affinity: <bold>D21</bold> and <bold>D20</bold>, having the highest affinities, display the clearest electron density allowing six amino acids to be modelled, whereas <bold>D7</bold> shows relatively poor density permitting modelling of only four residues. For <bold>D19</bold>, the lack of density observed likely reflects its intrinsically weaker affinity compared to the other peptides, in addition to losing the interactions from position 7 due to crystal packing. This hypothesis also correlates to the comments made by Tian et al. in their attempt to co-crystallise securin D-box peptides with Cdc20, in the identical space group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Tian et al., 2012</xref>). A recent 2.9 Å cryo-EM structure of the APC/C<sup>Cdh1.Emi1</sup> complex showed that the aliphatic residue at P7 interacts with Val178 of Cdh1 and would be predicted to contact the conserved Ile175 of Cdc20 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Höfler et al., 2024</xref>). This non-polar interaction between coactivator and D-box explains our observation that modifying the size of the aliphatic residue at P7 optimises D-box-Cdc20 affinity. Residues P8 and P9 of the D-box do not contact the coactivator but instead interact with APC10.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Crystal structures of Cdc20-D-box complexes.</title><p>X-ray crystal structures of peptides (<bold>A</bold>) <bold>D21</bold>, (<bold>B</bold>) <bold>D20</bold>, and (<bold>C</bold>) <bold>D7</bold> bound to the canonical D-box binding pocket of Cdc20.

However, due to the low throughput of the assay we also explored a more high-throughput approach by making use of Promega’s split-luciferase HiBiT tag appended to the C-terminus of full-length Cdc20 and based on protocols previously described by Martinez and co-workers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Martinez et al., 2018</xref>).

The D-box sequences were swapped into an RxxL motif previously shown to have no degron activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abdelbaki et al., 2023</xref>), which we here refer to as ‘D0’, adjacent to the endogenous C-terminal IDR of AURKA to enable processing of the ubiquitinated fusion proteins at the 26S proteasome. We found that all four new D-box variants tested could target mNeon for degradation, with timing consistent with targeting by APC/C<sup>Cdc20</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>). We predicted that the higher affinity D-box peptides from the in vitro assays (D1 and D19) would mediate increased rates and extent of degradation compared to the lower affinity peptides (D2 and D3). However, we found the opposite effect: D2 and D3 showed increased rates of mNeon degradation compared to D1 and D19 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C and D</xref>). This observation is consistent with conclusions from other studies that affinity of degron binding does not necessarily correlate with efficiency of degradation. Indeed, there is no evidence that Hsl1, which is the highest affinity natural D-box (D1) used in our study, is degraded any more rapidly than other substrates of APC/C in yeast mitosis. A number of studies of a yeast ‘pseudo-substrate’ inhibitor Acm1 have shown that mutation of the high-affinity D-box in Acm1 converts it from inhibitor to substrate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Choi et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Enquist-Newman et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Burton et al., 2011</xref>) through a mechanism that governs recruitment of APC10 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Qin et al., 2019</xref>). Our study does not consider the contribution of APC10 to binding of our peptides to APC/C<sup>Cdc20</sup> complex, but since there is strong cooperativity provided by this additional interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hartooni et al., 2022</xref>) we propose this as the critical factor in determining the ability of the different peptides to mediate degradation of mNeon.</p><fig id="fig8" position="float"><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>D-box variants can drive degradation in mitotic cells.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic of D-box-mNeon constructs used in fluorescence timelapse imaging.

We confirmed the success of this approach by determining X-ray crystal structures of Cdc20-peptide complexes. We showed target engagement by the peptides in the cellular context, and we found that the two highest affinity peptides were more potent inhibitors of APC/C<sup>Cdc20</sup> activity than the small molecule Apcin. Lastly, we found that the D-box peptide is a portable motif that can drive productive ubiquitination, leading to degradation when fused to a fluorescent protein target.</p><p>The finding that the peptides were more potent than Apcin as APC/C<sup>Cdc20</sup> inhibitors was interesting since Apcin has a slightly higher Cdc20-binding affinity than the peptides. It suggests that inhibiting APC/C<sup>Cdc20</sup> ubiquitination activity may require larger molecules to compete with substrates effectively. It may also be that, unlike Apcin, the peptides not only block the interaction of substrates with Cdc20 but additionally the interaction with APC10 and/or prevent the conformational change in APC/C that enables recruitment of the E2. In addition, although the inhibitory activity of the D-box peptides roughly correlates with their binding affinity, binding and degron activity (substrate degradation) are not directly correlated. Studies have shown that residues C-terminal of the D-box sequence in Acm1, the ‘D-Box Extension’ DBE motif, have the potential to inhibit reaction processivity by influencing the conformation of APC10 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Qin et al., 2019</xref>). The mNeon-D-box constructs used in our current study all contain the same DBE motif, so a potential contribution from this motif will not affect the interpretation of our results, but it could certainly be added as an element in future inhibitor design.</p><p>In summary, the findings presented here represent a useful starting point for the further development of APC/C inhibitors as both research tools and also molecular therapeutics. Future directions could involve enhancing potency through avidity by incorporating multiple degrons into our molecules and additions to the D-box core sequence to include motifs that engage other components of the APC/C machinery – namely APC10 and the E2 – thereby not only blocking substrate binding more effectively but also better impeding ubiquitination activity. The results also have implications for the design of small-molecule and peptide-based degraders that harness the APC/C.</p><sec id="s4-1"><title>Statistical analyses</title><p>GraphPad Prism 9 (GraphPad Software Inc) and Microsoft Excel (Microsoft Corporation) were used to analyse data, generate graphs, and perform statistical analyses.

On page 10, what is the solubility of D2 before a modification was made? The authors mentioned that position 2 is likely solvent exposed, it is not immediately clear to me why the mutation made was from one hydrophobic residue to another. What was the level of improvement in solubility? Are there any affinity data associated with the peptide that differ with D2 only at position 2?</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer is correct that we have not done any detailed solubility characterisation; we refer only to observations rather than quantitative analysis. We wrote that we reverted from Leu to Ala due to solubility - we have clarified this statement (page 11) to say that that we reverted to Ala, as it was the residue present in D1, for which we observed a measurable affinity by SPR and saw a concentration-dependent response in the thermal shift analysis. We do not have any peptides or affinity data that explore single-site mutations with the parental peptide of D2. D2 is included in the paper because of its link to the consensus D-box sequence and thus was the logical path to the investigations into positions 3 and 7 that come later in the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) I'm not entirely convinced that the D19 density not observed in the crystal structure was due to crystal packing. This peptide is peculiar as it also did not induce any thermal stabilization of Cdc20 in the cellular thermal shift assay. Perhaps the binding of this peptide could be investigated in more detail (i.e., NMR?) Or at least more explanation could be provided.</p></disp-quote><p>This section has been clarified (page 16). The lack of observed density was likely due to the relatively low affinity of D19 and also to the lack of binding of the three C-terminal residues in the crystal, and consequently it has a further reduced affinity. The current wording in the manuscript puts greater emphasis on this second aspect being a D19-specific issue, even though it applies to all four soaked peptides. The extent of peptide-induced thermal stabilisations observed by TSA and CETSA is different, with the latter experiment consistently showing smaller shifts. This observation may be due to the more complex medium (cell lysate vs. purified protein) and/or different concentrations of the proteins in solution. In the CETSA, we over-expressed a HiBiT-tagged Cdc20, which is present in addition to any endogenously expressed Cdc20. Although we did not investigate it, the near identical D-box binding sites on Cdc20 and Cdh1 would suggest that there will be cross-specificity, which could further influence the CETSA experiments.</p><p>The section now reads:</p><p>“We therefore assume that this is the reason for the lack of observed density in this region of the peptides D20 and D21 (Fig. S3E and S3F, respectively). We believe that it causes a reduction in binding affinities of all peptides in crystallo, given the evidence from SPR highlighting a role of position 7 in the interaction (Table 1). Interestingly, the observed electron density of the peptide correlates with Cdc20 binding affinity: <bold>D21</bold> and <bold>D20</bold>, having the highest affinities, display the clearest electron density allowing six amino acids to be modeled, whereas D7 shows relatively poor density permitting modelling of only four residues. For <bold>D19</bold>, the lack of density observed likely reflects its intrinsically weaker affinity compared to the other peptides, in addition to losing the interactions from position 7 due to crystal packing.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>The authors took a well-characterised (partly by them), important E3 ligase, in the anaphase-promoting complex, and decided to design peptide inhibitors for it based on one of the known interacting motifs (called D-box) from its substrates. They incorporate unnatural amino acids to better occupy the interaction site, improve the binding affinity, and lay foundations for future therapeutics - maybe combining their findings with additional target sites.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>The paper is mostly strengths - a logical progression of experiments, very well explained and carried out to a high standard. The authors use a carefully chosen variety of techniques (including X-ray crystallography, multiple binding analyses, and ubiquitination assays) to verify their findings - and they impressively achieve their goals by honing in on tight-binders.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>Some things are not explained fully and it would be useful to have some clarification. Why did the authors decide to model their inhibitors on the D-box motif and not the other two SLiMs that they describe?</p></disp-quote><p>For completeness, in addition to the D-box we did originally construct peptides based on the ABBA and KEN-box motifs, but they did not show any shift in melting temperature of cdc20 in the thermal shift assay whereas the D-box peptides did; consequently, we focused our efforts on the D-box peptides. Moreover, there is much evidence from the literature that points to the unique importance of the D-box motif in mediating productive interactions of substrates with the APC/C (i.e. those leading to polyubiquitination &amp; degradation). One of the clearest examples is a study by Mark Hall’s lab (described in Qin et al. 2016), which tested the degradation of 15 substrates of yeast APC/C in strains carrying alleles of Cdh1 in which the docking sites for D-box, KEN or ABBA were mutated. They observed that whereas degradation of all 15 substrates depended on D-box binding, only a subset required the KEN binding site on Cdh1 and only one required the ABBA binding site. A more recent study from David Morgan’s lab (Hartooni et al. 2022) looking at binding affinities of different degron peptides concluded that KEN motif has very low affinity for Cdc20 and is unlikely to mediate degradation of APC/C-Cdc20 substrates. Engagement of substrate with the D-box receptor is therefore the most critical event mediating APC/C activity and the interaction that needs to be blocked for most effective inhibition of substrate degradation.</p><p>We have added the following text to the Results section “Design of D-box peptides” (page 10):</p><p>“We focused on D-box peptides, as there is much evidence from the literature that points to the unique importance of the D-box motif in mediating productive interactions of substrates with the APC/C (i.e. those leading to polyubiquitination &amp; degradation).

It's an interesting thing to think about, and probably the paper they cite explains it more but I would like to know without having to find that other paper.</p></disp-quote><p>Interesting results from a number of labs (Choi et al. 2008, Enquist-Newman et al. 2008, Burton et al. 2011, Qin et al. 2019) have shown that mutation of degron SLiMs in Acm1 that weaken interaction with the APC/C have the unexpected consequence of converting Acm1 from APC/C inhibitor to APC/C substrate. A necessary conclusion of these studies is that the outcome of degron binding (i.e. whether the binder functions as substrate or inhibitor) depends on factors other than D-box affinity and that D-box affinity can counteract them. One idea is that if a binder interacts too tightly, this removes some flexibility required for the polyubiquitination process. The most recent study on this question (Qin et al.2019) specifically pins the explanation for the inhibitory function of the high affinity D-box in Acm1 on its ‘D-box Extension’ (i.e. residues 8-12) preventing interaction with APC10. In our current study, the binding affinity of peptides is measured against Cdc20. In cellular assays however, the D-box must also engage APC10 for degradation to occur. It may be that the peptide binding most strongly to the D-box pocket on Cdc20 is less able to bind to APC10 and therefore less effective in triggering APC10-dependent steps in the polyubiquitination pathway. The important Hartooni et al. paper from David Morgan’s lab confirms that even though the binding of D-box residues to APC10 is very weak on its own, it can contribute 100X increase in affinity of a peptide by adding cooperativity to the interaction of D-box with co-activator. Re Figure 6 and the fact that we did look at peptide binding in cells, these experiments were done in unsynchronised cells, so most Cdc20 would not be bound to APC/C.</p><p>We have modified the text (page 18) from:</p><p>“However, we found the opposite effect: D2 and D3 showed increased rates of mNeon degradation compared to D1 and D19 (Fig. 8C,D). This observation is consistent with the idea that high-affinity binding at degron binding sites on APC/C, such as in the case of the yeast ‘pseudo-substrate’ inhibitor Acm1, acts to impede polyubiquitination of the bound protein (Qin et al. 2019). Indeed, there is no evidence that Hsl1, which is the highest affinity natural D-box (D1) used in our study, is degraded any more rapidly than other substrates of APC/C in yeast mitosis. As shown in Qin et al., mutation of the high affinity D-box in Acm1 converts it from inhibitor to substrate (Qin et al. 2019). Overall, our results support the conclusions that all the D-box peptides engage productively with the APC/C and that the highest affinity interactors act as inhibitors rather than functional degrons of APC/C.”</p><p>to:</p><p>“However, we found the opposite effect: D2 and D3 showed increased rates of mNeon degradation compared to D1 and D19 (Fig. 8C,D). This observation is consistent with conclusions from other studies that affinity of degron binding does not necessarily correlate with efficiency of degradation. Indeed, there is no evidence that Hsl1, which is the highest affinity natural D-box (D1) used in our study, is degraded any more rapidly than other substrates of APC/C in yeast mitosis. A number of studies of a yeast ‘pseudo-substrate’ inhibitor Acm1, have shown that mutation of the high affinity D-box in Acm1 converts it from inhibitor to substrate (Choi et al. 2008, Enquist-Newman et al. 2008, Burton et al. 2011) through a mechanism that governs recruitment of APC10 (Qin et al. 2019). Our study does not consider the contribution of APC10 to binding of our peptides to APC/C<sup>Cdc20</sup> complex, but since there is strong cooperativity provided by this additional interaction (Hartooni et al. 2022) we propose this as the critical factor in determining the ability of the different peptides to mediate degradation of associated mNeon.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>Eapen and coworkers use a rational design approach to generate new peptide-inspired ligands at the D-box interface of cdc20.

A necessary conclusion of these studies is that the outcome of degron binding (i.e. whether the binder functions as substrate or inhibitor) depends on factors other than D-box affinity and that D-box affinity can counteract them. One idea is that if a binder interacts too tightly, this removes some flexibility required for the polyubiquitination process. The most recent study on this question (Qin et al.2019) specifically pins the explanation for the inhibitory function of the high affinity D-box in Acm1 on its ‘D-box Extension’ (i.e. residues 8-12) preventing interaction with APC10. In our current study, the binding affinity of peptides is measured against Cdc20. In cellular assays however, the D-box must also engage APC10 for degradation to occur. It may be that the peptide binding most strongly to the D-box pocket on Cdc20 is less able to bind to APC10 and therefore less effective in triggering APC10-dependent steps in the polyubiquitination pathway. The important Hartooni et al. paper from David Morgan’s lab confirms that even though the binding of D-box residues to APC10 is very weak on its own, it can contribute 100X increase in affinity of a peptide by adding cooperativity to the interaction of D-box with co-activator. Re Figure 6 and the fact that we did look at peptide binding in cells, these experiments were done in unsynchronised cells, so most Cdc20 would not be bound to APC/C.</p><p>We have modified the text (page 18) from:</p><p>“However, we found the opposite effect: D2 and D3 showed increased rates of mNeon degradation compared to D1 and D19 (Fig. 8C,D). This observation is consistent with the idea that high-affinity binding at degron binding sites on APC/C, such as in the case of the yeast ‘pseudo-substrate’ inhibitor Acm1, acts to impede polyubiquitination of the bound protein (Qin et al. 2019). Indeed, there is no evidence that Hsl1, which is the highest affinity natural D-box (D1) used in our study, is degraded any more rapidly than other substrates of APC/C in yeast mitosis. As shown in Qin et al., mutation of the high affinity D-box in Acm1 converts it from inhibitor to substrate (Qin et al. 2019). Overall, our results support the conclusions that all the D-box peptides engage productively with the APC/C and that the highest affinity interactors act as inhibitors rather than functional degrons of APC/C.”</p><p>to:</p><p>“However, we found the opposite effect: D2 and D3 showed increased rates of mNeon degradation compared to D1 and D19 (Fig. 8C,D). This observation is consistent with conclusions from other studies that affinity of degron binding does not necessarily correlate with efficiency of degradation. Indeed, there is no evidence that Hsl1, which is the highest affinity natural D-box (D1) used in our study, is degraded any more rapidly than other substrates of APC/C in yeast mitosis. A number of studies of a yeast ‘pseudo-substrate’ inhibitor Acm1, have shown that mutation of the high affinity D-box in Acm1 converts it from inhibitor to substrate (Choi et al. 2008, Enquist-Newman et al. 2008, Burton et al. 2011) through a mechanism that governs recruitment of APC10 (Qin et al. 2019). Our study does not consider the contribution of APC10 to binding of our peptides to APC/C<sup>Cdc20</sup> complex, but since there is strong cooperativity provided by this additional interaction (Hartooni et al. 2022) we propose this as the critical factor in determining the ability of the different peptides to mediate degradation of associated mNeon.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Recommendations for the authors:</bold></p><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p><p>(1) On page 12 (towards the end), the author stated D10 contained an A3P mutation, they meant P3A right?

Due to the low affinities of many peptides for Cdc20, many techniques would have required more protein than we were able to produce. We believe that the qualitative TSA combined with the SPR is sufficient to convince the readers; indeed there is a correlation between SPR-determined binding affinities and the thermal shifts: For the natural amino acid-containing peptides (Table 1) D19 has the highest affinity and causes the largest thermal shift in the Cdc20 melting temperature, D10 has the lowest affinity and causes the smallest thermal shift, and D1, D3, D4, and D5 and all rank in the middle by both techniques. For those peptides containing unnatural amino acids (Table 2), again higher affinities are reflected in larger thermal shifts.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p><p>The data seem fine to me.
