achieved remains unclear. Here we use a ‘multi-omics’ approach to demonstrate that the duration of polymerase pausing generally limits the productive frequency of transcription initiation in human cells (‘pause-initiation limit’). We further engineer a human cell line to allow for specific and rapid inhibition of the P-TEFb kinase CDK9, which is implicated in polymerase pause release. CDK9 activity decreases the pause duration but also increases the productive initiation frequency. This shows that CDK9 stimulates release of paused polymerase and activates transcription by increasing the number of transcribing polymerases and thus the amount of mRNA synthesized per time. CDK9 activity is also associated with long-range chromatin interactions, suggesting that enhancers can influence the pause-initiation limit to regulate transcription.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.29736.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Genes can contain the coded instructions to make proteins. These instructions must first be copied, or transcribed, into an intermediate molecule called a messenger RNA by an enzyme known as RNA polymerase II. Shortly after it begins, this enzyme – which is called Pol II for short – pauses, and it only starts again after it recruits other proteins, including one called CDK9.</p><p>The number of RNA copies made of a gene depends upon how many Pol II enzymes begin transcription. Pol II pausing also has an effect – if the enzymes pause for longer, less messenger RNA is transcribed. But why does this happen? One hypothesis is that paused Pol II enzymes interfere with other Pol II enzymes initiating transcription. Yet, until recently it was not possible to measure if this actually happens in living cells.</p><p>Now, Gressel, Schwalb et al. used a new biochemical method together with a compound that blocks CDK9 to measure pausing and transcription initiation for active genes in living human cells. The CDK9 inhibitor was used to make Pol II enzymes pause for longer than normal. Gressel, Schwalb et al. found that different genes responded differently to CDK9 inhibition, meaning that some remained paused for longer than others. The number of Pol II enzymes that initiated transcription was calculated by measuring how many RNA copies had been made locally at that the site of transcription. These experiments showed that blocking the release of paused Pol II strongly reduced the number of RNA copies made.</p><p>Gressel, Schwalb et al. conclude that Pol II pausing can control initiation of transcription. Cells may use Pol II pausing to adjust how many copies of an RNA are made, helping to ensure that different cell types make the appropriate number of RNA copies from a gene. Many diseases are associated with gene transcription being incorrectly regulated. This and future studies will help scientists to better understand how Pol II pausing contributes to the control of transcription in both normal and diseased cells.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>CRISPR-Cas9</kwd><kwd>TT-seq</kwd><kwd>mNET-seq</kwd><kwd>CDK9</kwd><kwd>RNA polymerase II</kwd><kwd>Pausing</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000781</institution-id><institution>European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>TRANSREGULON</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cramer</surname><given-names>Patrick</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001663</institution-id><institution>Volkswagen Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cramer</surname><given-names>Patrick</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SFB 1064 TP A17</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Leonhardt</surname><given-names>Heinrich</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SFB 1064</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Eick</surname><given-names>Dirk</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Max Planck Institute for Biophysical Chemistry</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Open-access funding</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cramer</surname><given-names>Patrick</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>CDK9 inhibition in human cells uncovers that Pol II pause duration regulates the frequency of productive transcription initiation.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Transcription in metazoan cells is often regulated at the level of promoter-proximal pausing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Core et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Day et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Henriques et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Nechaev et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Rougvie and Lis, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Strobl and Eick, 1992</xref>), which can be detected by measuring the occupancy with paused Pol II by ChIP-seq (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Johnson et al., 2007</xref>), GRO-seq (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Core et al., 2008</xref>), (m)NET-seq (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Mayer et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Nojima et al., 2015</xref>), or PRO-seq (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kwak et al., 2013</xref>). Genes with paused Pol II are conserved across mammalian cell types and states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Day et al., 2016</xref>). The mechanisms underlying how Pol II pausing can regulate RNA transcript synthesis remain unclear.</p><p>Transcription of a human protein-coding gene of average length takes at least half an hour to be completed. The duration of pausing however lies in the range of minutes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Jonkers et al., 2014</xref>) and does not considerably change the overall time it takes to complete a transcript. Thus, how can changes in the pause duration lead to synthesis of a different number of RNA transcripts per time? It has been suggested that a decreased pause duration goes along with a higher initiation frequency, because occupancy peaks for promoter-proximal Pol II can increase upon gene activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Boehm et al., 2003</xref>) or can remain high even when pausing is impaired (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Henriques et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>The height of Pol II occupancy peaks however cannot directly inform on initiation frequency or pause duration because it depends not only on the number of polymerases that pass the pause site but also on their residence time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Ehrensberger et al., 2013</xref>). A kinetic model of transcription predicted that pause duration delimits the initiation frequency and suggested that paused Pol II sterically interferes with initiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Ehrensberger et al., 2013</xref>). Indeed, modeling reveals that a paused polymerase positioned up to around 50 bp downstream of the TSS could sterically interfere with formation of the Pol II initiation complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Even if a paused polymerase is located further downstream, it may still interfere with initiation if one or more additional elongating polymerases line up behind it.</p><p>The critical relationship between pausing and initiation could thus far not be tested experimentally, as no methods were available to measure initiation frequencies. A recently developed method, transient transcriptome sequencing (TT-seq) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Schwalb et al., 2016</xref>), now allows to unveil the flow of polymerases as it measures local RNA synthesis rates genome-wide at nucleotide resolution.</p><p>Here we investigate whether changes in pause duration alter initiation frequency in living cells. We specifically inhibit the kinase CDK9, which facilitates Pol II pause release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Laitem et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Marshall and Price, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Peterlin and Price, 2006</xref>), and monitor RNA synthesis and initiation frequencies by TT-seq. A combination of TT-seq data with mNET-seq data allows us to derive pause durations for active genes. We conclude that the duration of pausing can control transcription initiation at human genes, and derived determinants for CDK9-dependent pause release and initiation activation.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>CRISPR-Cas9-engineered mutation allows for specific CDK9 inhibition</title><p>To specifically inhibit CDK9, we used a chemical biology approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lopez et al., 2014</xref>) that circumvents off-target effects of standard CDK9 inhibitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Morales and Giordano, 2016</xref>).

Our results have implications for understanding gene regulation. Genes that show initiation frequencies below the pause-initiation limit may be activated by increasing the initiation frequency without changing pause duration. However, activation of genes that are transcribed at the pause-initiation limit requires a decrease in pause duration, that is stimulation of pause release, to enable higher initiation frequencies. We suggest that pause-controlled initiation evolved because mutations in the promoter-proximal region can change pause duration, and thereby limit initiation, but do not compromise a high initiation capacity of the core promoter around the TSS. This may have enabled the evolution of genes that remain highly inducible but can be efficiently downregulated.</p><p>After our work had been completed, a publication appeared that concluded that polymerase pausing inhibits new transcription initiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Shao and Zeitlinger, 2017</xref>). The conclusion in this paper is consistent with our general finding of an interdependency of Pol II pausing and transcription initiation, but the two studies differ in three aspects. First, we used human cells whereas the published work was conducted in Drosophila cells. Second, our work uses a multi-omics approach to enable a kinetic description, whereas the published work is based on changes in factor occupancy. Third, we selectively inhibited CDK9 using CRISPR-Cas9-based engineering and chemical biology, whereas the published work used small molecule inhibitors that may target multiple kinases. Despite these differences, the general conclusion that promoter-proximal pausing of Pol II sets a limit to the frequency of transcription initiation holds for both human and Drosophila cells and is likely a general feature of metazoan gene regulation.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Key resources table</title><table-wrap id="inlinetable1" position="anchor"><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Reagent type (species) <break/>or resource</th><th valign="top">Designation</th><th valign="top">Source or reference</th><th valign="top">Identifiers</th><th valign="top">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">cell line (Homo sapiens; male)</td><td valign="top">Raji B lymphocyte cells (wild type)</td><td valign="top">DSMZ</td><td valign="top">DSMZ Cat# ACC-319; RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/CVCL_0511">CVCL_0511</ext-link></td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">cell line (Homo sapiens; male)</td><td valign="top">Raji B lymphocyte cells (CDK9<sup>as</sup>)</td><td valign="top">This paper</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">Raji B cells were obtained from DSMZ Cat# ACC-319, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/CVCL_0511">CVCL_0511</ext-link>.

Briefly, 1.6 × 10<sup>8</sup> Raji B (CDK9<sup>as</sup>) cells were treated for 15 min with solvent DMSO (control) or 5 µM of 1-NA-PP1 (CDK9<sup>as</sup> inhibitor). Cell fractionation was performed as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Conrad and Ørom, 2017</xref>). Isolated chromatin was digested with micrococcal nuclease (MNase) (NEB, Ipswich, MA USA) at 37°C and 1,400 rpm for 90 s. To inactivate MNase, EGTA was added to a final concentration of 25 mM. Digested chromatin was collected by centrifugation at 4°C and 13,000 rpm for 5 min. The supernatant was diluted tenfold with IP buffer containing 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 0.05% (vol/vol) NP-40, and 1% (vol/vol) empigen BB (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO USA). For each IP, 50 µg of Pol II antibody clone MABI0601 (BIOZOL, Eching, Germany) was conjugated to Dynabeads M-280 Sheep Anti-Mouse IgG (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA USA). Pol II antibody-conjugated beads were added to diluted sample. IP was performed on a rotating wheel at 4°C for 1 hr. The beads were washed six times with IP buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 0.05 % NP-40, and 1% empigen BB) and once with 500 µL of PNKT buffer containing 1 x T4 polynucleotide kinase (PNK) buffer (NEB, Ipswich, MA USA) and 0.1% (vol/vol) Tween-20 (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO USA). Beads were incubated in 100 µL of PNK reaction mix containing 1 x PNK buffer, 0.1% (vol/vol) Tween-20, 1 mM ATP, and T4 PNK, 3’ phosphatase minus (NEB, Ipswich, MA USA) at 37°C for 10 min.

RNA was precipitated with GlycoBlue co-precipitant (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA USA) and resolved on 6% denaturing acrylamide containing 7 M urea (PanReac AppliChem, Darmstadt, Germany) gel for size purification. Fragments of 35–100 nt were eluted from the gel using elution buffer containing 1 M NaOAc, 1 mM EDTA, and precipitated in ethanol. RNA libraries were prepared according to the TruSeq Small RNA Library Kit (Illumina, Massachusetts USA) and as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Nojima et al., 2016</xref>).

Further data processing was carried out using the R/Bioconductor environment. Antisense bias (ratio of spurious reads originating from the opposite strand introduced by the RT reactions) was determined using positions in regions without antisense annotation with a coverage of at least 100 according to Refseq annotated genes (UCSC RefSeq GRCh38). mNET-seq coverage tracks were size factor normalized on 260 TUs that showed a response of less than 5% (<inline-formula><mml:math id="inf22"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>&lt;</mml:mo><mml:mn>0.05</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula>) in the TT-seq signal upon 1-NA-PP1 (CDK9<sup>as</sup> inhibitor) treatment.

Additionally, we applied a size selection similar to that in the original protocol for fragments below 80 bp in length with a sigmoidal curve that mimics a typical size selection spread. Given a pause position of 80 bp downstream of the TSS and pause duration of 1 or 2 min we adjusted the elongation velocity profile to simulate polymerase pausing. Note that neither reasonable changes in labeling probability, size selection probability nor changes in uracil residue content change the general observation that longer pause durations induce a greater shortage of TT-seq coverage in the region between the TSS and the pause site.</p></sec><sec id="s4-23"><title>Estimation of gene-wise elongation velocity (without of response ratio)</title><p>For each condition <italic>j</italic> (control or CDK9<sup>as</sup> inhibited) the antisense bias corrected number of transcribed bases <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf51"><mml:msubsup><mml:mrow><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mi>b</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>j</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msubsup></mml:math></inline-formula> was calculated on all expressed TUs <italic>i</italic> exceeding 35 kbp in length, excluding the first 200 bp.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors and the evaluation has been overseen by Kevin Struhl as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>In this manuscript, 4sU-seq and NET-seq were used in combination with an analogue-sensitive CDK9 mutant to investigate the relationship between transcriptional pausing and initiation. The reviewers agree that the findings definitively show that transcription initiation rates vary at strongly versus weakly paused RNA polymerase II promoters, and that inactivation of CDK9 thus affects transcription initiation, whether directly or indirectly, in a manner that correlates with pausing strength. The reviewers consider these conclusions extremely important and timely, and help explain how strongly paused genes can effectively and synchronously upregulate mRNA levels.</p><p>Comments are provided for revision:</p><p>1) Prior cell-free transcription experiments have shown large effects on mRNA synthesis due to pause-release under conditions that do not support enhancer-linked transcription initiation or chromatin templates to facilitate transcription reinitiation. The differences in pause frequency and strength between different promoters can also be recapitulated in vitro in the absence of long-range connections between enhancers or chromatin- the resulting changes in mRNA levels in these studies are quite large and P-TEFb/NELF-DSIF-dependent. Should the changes in initiation secondary to pausing observed here be more accurately described as indirect? Or would 4sU-seq and NET-seq reveal a stronger effect on initiation in these systems?</p><p>2) The authors should comment on the fact that the estimates for pause duration and initiation frequency in subsection “Multi-omics analysis provides pause duration <italic>d</italic> and initiation frequency <italic>I</italic>” disregard any differences there might be in transcriptional processivity between different genes and regions.</p><p>3) Why are the position-markers truncated in '<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>' and '<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>'?

The only (indirect) experimental evidence they have showing that pol II pausing is regulating pol II initiation at the promoter is the decrease in TT-seq signal between the TSS and the pause site after CDK9 inhibition.

We carefully considered whether we should describe the changes as indirect. We wish to maintain the current wording. One may argue that steric exclusion of PIC assembly is a direct, not an indirect, effect. Also, it may be that the word indirect leads readers to think that one must assume additional mechanisms, such as posttranslational modification etc. to explain the effect of pausing on initiation, but this is not the case.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The authors should comment on the fact that the estimates for pause duration and initiation frequency in subsection “Multi-omics analysis provides pause duration d and initiation frequency I” disregard any differences there might be in transcriptional processivity between different genes and regions.</p></disp-quote><p>This is an important point. It is correct that transcriptional processivity is not modeled in a gene-wise manner as far as if it happens at the pause site. However, early termination that might occur upstream of the pause site is irrelevant to our model and its conclusions. Additionally, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4 —figure supplement 1</xref> shows that early termination events at the pause site occur rarely if at all. The minor role that transcriptional processivity might play is also negligible for the conclusions we draw on metagene analysis, involving 500 up to more than 2000 genes. We nevertheless made sure that we point out in the main text that the possibility exists that a fraction of paused polymerases is lost, i.e. processivity at this step is not 100%.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Why are the position-markers truncated in '<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>' and '<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>'?

Note that an increase in occupancy can stem from a higher initiation frequency, but also from a longer live time of the PIC or from filling of unbound promoters in a cell population. TT-seq however measures RNA production at each genomic location. The TT-seq signal in genes measures the number of RNA-producing polymerases that initiated from the promoter and were successfully released form the pause site, i.e. the ‘productive initiation frequency’. Using the term ‘pause release’ for the initiation frequency would lead to many misunderstandings. The term ‘pause release rate’ would refer to the rate at which a paused polymerase is released, but this is conceptually different from the productive initiation frequency, and it is a critical point of the paper to say this. In order to avoid such confusion, we wish to maintain the term ‘productive initiation frequency’. It is true that this is only identical to the initiation frequency if no paused polymerases undergo early termination, but we show that the fraction of such early terminating polymerases is low. To account for the possibility of a fraction of Pol II terminating early, we added the term ‘productive’ to the term ‘initiation frequency’. We went through the entire text again and made sure it is all consistent, the right terminology is used throughout, and that misunderstandings are avoided.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) In subsection “TT-seq monitors immediate response to CDK9 inhibition”, they can't claim that pol II that is still going through the EEC after CDK9 inhibition is independent of CDK9 function.

The problem here is that it is not entirely clear whether CDK9 activity is doing something upstream of the pausing site and is involved in elongation between the TSS and the pause site.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer is correct that we cannot be certain of this point. We have therefore included a corresponding statement that we cannot exclude that CDK9 inhibition was incomplete. However, according to the distribution shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>, and the additional genome browser views pasted below (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref>), where the response is around 90%, the portion of CDK9 that has not been fully inhibited by 10 min treatment with 1-NA-PP1 must be very low. This conclusion is based on the assumption that the inhibitor is evenly distributed across cells and within cells. Note also that inhibitory effects on pausing observed until now might have been also caused by unspecific inhibition of other kinases.</p><fig id="respfig1"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Example genome browser views of TT-seq signals in CDK9<sup>as</sup> cells with high responsiveness (~ 90%).</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) CYB5R4 gene locus (107,781 [bp]) on chromosome 6.
