production of blood cells from hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs), is tightly regulated by extrinsic signals from the microenvironment called ‘niche’. Bone marrow HSPCs are heterogeneous and controlled by both endosteal and vascular niches. The Drosophila hematopoietic lymph gland is located along the cardiac tube which corresponds to the vascular system. In the lymph gland, the niche called Posterior Signaling Center controls only a subset of the heterogeneous hematopoietic progenitor population indicating that additional signals are necessary. Here we report that the vascular system acts as a second niche to control lymph gland homeostasis. The FGF ligand Branchless produced by vascular cells activates the FGF pathway in hematopoietic progenitors. By regulating intracellular calcium levels, FGF signaling maintains progenitor pools and prevents blood cell differentiation. This study reveals that two niches contribute to the control <italic>of</italic>Drosophila blood cell homeostasis through their differential regulation of progenitors.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>hematopoiesis</kwd><kwd>microenvironment/niche</kwd><kwd>lymph gland</kwd><kwd>cardiac/vascular cells</kwd><kwd><italic>Drosophila</italic></kwd><kwd>FGF signaling</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Ministère de l'Education Nationale, de l'Enseignement Superieur et de la Recherche</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>'ANR programme blanc'</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Crozatier</surname><given-names>Michele</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004097</institution-id><institution>Fondation ARC pour la Recherche sur le Cancer</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ARC</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Destalminil-Letourneau</surname><given-names>Manon</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002915</institution-id><institution>Fondation pour la Recherche Médicale</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>FRM</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Crozatier</surname><given-names>Michele</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004099</institution-id><institution>Ligue Contre le Cancer</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Crozatier</surname><given-names>Michele</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004543</institution-id><institution>China Scholarship Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tian</surname><given-names>Yushun</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Société francaise d'hématologie</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Destalminil-Letourneau</surname><given-names>Manon</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Two niches contribute to the control of Drosophila blood cell homeostasis through their differential regulation of hematopoietic progenitors.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>In adult mammals, HSPCs in the bone marrow ensure the constant renewal of blood cells. The cellular microenvironment of HSPCs, called ‘niche’, regulates hematopoiesis under both homeostatic and immune stress conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Asada et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Calvi et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Calvi and Link, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">He et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kiel et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kobayashi et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Morrison and Scadden, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Zhao and Baltimore, 2015</xref>). Recent studies have revealed significant molecular and functional heterogeneity within the HSPC pool (for review <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Haas et al., 2018</xref>). These findings challenge the differential contribution of niche cell types to HSPC diversity. Given the high conservation of regulatory networks between insects and vertebrates, Drosophila has become an important model to study how hematopoiesis is controlled (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Evans et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hartenstein, 2006</xref>). Insect blood cells, or hemocytes, are related to the mammalian myeloid lineage. In Drosophila, three blood cell types are produced: plasmatocytes that are macrophages involved in phagocytosis, crystal cells involved in melanisation and wound healing and lamellocytes required for encapsulation of pathogens too large to be destroyed by phagocytosis. Lamellocytes represent a cryptic cell fate since they only differentiate at the larval stage and in response to specific immune challenges such as wasp parasitism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lemaitre and Hoffmann, 2007</xref>). The lymph gland is the larval hematopoietic organ and is composed of paired lobes, one pair of anterior lobes and several pairs of posterior lobes, aligned along the anterior part of the cardiac tube (CT) which corresponds to the vascular system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lanot et al., 2001</xref>). In third instar larvae, the anterior lobes comprise three zones: a medullary zone (MZ) containing hematopoietic progenitors, a cortical zone (CZ) composed of differentiated blood cells, and a small group of cells called the Posterior Signaling Center (PSC) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Crozatier et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Jung et al., 2005</xref>). The PSC produces a variety of signals that regulate lymph gland homeostasis (for review see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Banerjee et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Letourneau et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Yu et al., 2018</xref>). Recently we established that cardiac cells produce the ligand Slit which, through the activation of Robo receptors in the PSC, controls the proliferation and clustering of PSC cells and in turn their function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Morin-Poulard et al., 2016</xref>). Furthermore, the MZ progenitor population is heterogeneous and a subset of progenitors called ‘core progenitors’ which express the <italic>knot/Collier (Kn/Col</italic>) and the <italic>thioester-containing protein-4</italic> (<italic>tep4</italic>) genes is aligned along the cardiac tube and are maintained independently from the PSC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baldeosingh et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Benmimoun et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Oyallon et al., 2016</xref>). Altogether, these data led us to ask whether signals derived from cardiac cells are involved in the control of lymph gland homeostasis, i.e. the balance between progenitors and differentiated blood cells, independently from the PSC. To address this possibility we performed a candidate RNAi screen in cardiac cells to identify new potential signaling pathways involved in the crosstalk between the vascular and the hematopoietic organs.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Lymph gland organization and RNAi screen results.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Representation of lymph gland anterior and posterior lobes from third instar larvae. The anterior lobe is composed of progenitors (red) and core progenitors (hatched red), and the cortical zone (CZ, green).

We investigated in more detail the role of the Fibroblast Growth Factor (FGF) ligand Branchless (Bnl). FGF signaling is conserved during evolution and is less complex in Drosophila than in humans. Ligand binding to a FGF receptor (FGFR) promotes its dimerization, which results in its tyrosine-phosphorylation, thus providing a scaffold to recruit different partners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Muha and Müller, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Ornitz and Itoh, 2015</xref>). In mammals, ligand binding to the FGFR activates Ras/Raf-Mek-MAPK, PI3K/AKT, and PLCγ-Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Turner and Grose, 2010</xref>).The Drosophila genome encodes two FGF receptors, Breathless (Btl) and Heartless (Htl), and three ligands, Bnl, Thisbe (Ths) and Pyramus (Pyr), (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Beiman et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Glazer and Shilo, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gryzik and Müller, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Klämbt et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Sutherland et al., 1996</xref>). Htl is activated by Ths and Pyr, while Btl is activated by Bnl. We established that Bnl is expressed in cardiac cells and signals to its receptor Breathless (Btl) expressed in progenitors. Bnl/Btl-FGF activation controls progenitor intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration, probably by activating Phospholipase Cγ (PLCγ) which regulates endoplasmic reticulum Ca<sup>2+</sup> stores. Altogether, these data strongly support the conclusion that the cardiac tube plays a role similar to a niche by regulating lymph gland hematopoiesis.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>A cardiac screen identifies genes controlling lymph gland homeostasis</title><p>To investigate the role of cardiac cells in the control of lymph gland hematopoiesis, we performed a functional screen based on the expression, in cardiac cells, of RNAis directed against transcripts encoding known Drosophila ligands. For this we used the cardiac <italic>handΔ-gal4</italic> driver which is expressed in cardiac cells throughout the three larval stages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1a–c’</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Monier et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Morin-Poulard et al., 2016</xref>) to screen a collection of RNAi lines corresponding to 49 Drosophila ligands (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata2">Figure 1—source data 2</xref>). As read-outs, we analyzed blood cell differentiation with the crystal cell reporter BcGFP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Tokusumi et al., 2009</xref>), and PSC cell numbers and morphology by performing Antennapedia (Antp) immunostaining (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Mandal et al., 2007</xref>). Compared to the control, 17 RNAi lines showed lymph gland homeostasis defects that were classified into three groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>). Class 1: Increased PSC cell numbers but no effect on crystal cell differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c–f</xref>). Two RNAis against <italic>ilp6</italic> and <italic>spätzle4</italic> transcripts belong to this class (source data). Class 2: Decreased PSC cell numbers and increased crystal cell differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1g–i</xref>). Only one RNAi against <italic>dachsous</italic> (<italic>ds</italic>) belongs to this class (source data) Class 3: No effect on PSC cell numbers but increased crystal cell differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1j–l</xref>); 14 RNAis belong to this class. The class three phenotype strongly suggested that signals from cardiac cells could control crystal cell differentiation independently from the PSC. We extended the analysis of the 14 corresponding genes by labeling the core progenitors with <italic>tep4</italic> in situ hybridization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Krzemień et al., 2007</xref>). Reduced <italic>tep4</italic> expression was observed for 12 RNAi treatments out of 14 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1m–o</xref> andsource data), indicating that the corresponding genes are required in cardiac cells to maintain <italic>tep4</italic> expression in lymph gland progenitors and to prevent crystal cell differentiation. To avoid any bias due to the <italic>handΔ-gal4</italic> driver, we also tested <italic>NP1029-gal4</italic>, an independent cardiac cell driver (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1d–f’</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Monier et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Morin-Poulard et al., 2016</xref>). Among the 14 RNAi candidates, nine gave a similar phenotype with both drivers (source data). In conclusion, our functional screen allowed us to identify nine ligands involved in communication between cardiac cells and hematopoietic progenitors to control lymph gland homeostasis.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>The FGF ligand Bnl from cardiac cells controls lymph gland homeostasis</title><p>One candidate identified in our screen was Bnl. Previous studies have shown that Htl-FGF signaling is required during both early embryogenesis for lymph gland specification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Grigorian et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Mandal et al., 2007</xref>) and in L3 larvae to control lymph gland progenitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dragojlovic-Munther and Martinez-Agosto, 2013</xref>). However, no role for <italic>bnl</italic> in the lymph gland has been described yet. Since <italic>bnl</italic> knock-down in cardiac cells significantly enhanced crystal cell differentiation in the lymph gland we decided to pursue an analysis of the Bnl-FGF pathway. Since Bnl is a diffusible ligand, we first documented <italic>bnl</italic> mRNA expression by in situ hybridization. <italic>bnl</italic> is expressed in cardiac and pericardial cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a–a’’</xref>), in agreement with previously published data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Jarecki et al., 1999</xref>). We also observed a weak <italic>bnl</italic> expression in MZ progenitors (as labeled by domeMESO &gt;GFP in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a–a”</xref>), in differentiating hemocytes (as labeled by hml &gt;GFP) and in a subset of crystal cells (marked by BcGFP) whereas no expression was detected in the PSC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1a–c”</xref>). In a heterozygous <italic>bnl</italic> loss-of-function mutant context where one copy of <italic>bnl (bnl<sup>P2</sup>/+)</italic> is missing, we observed an increased number of crystal cells compared to the control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b–d</xref>). To specifically knock down <italic>bnl</italic> in cardiac cells, we expressed <italic>bnl-RNAi</italic> under the control of the cardiac tube specific driver <italic>handΔgal4. bnl</italic> loss-of-function experiments were performed from the L2 larval stage on, after the cardiac tube had formed, to avoid possible cardiac tube morphological defects (see MM and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1d–e</xref>). <italic>bnl</italic> down-regulation in cardiac cells resulted in increased differentiation of both crystal cells and plasmatocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2e–f,i</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1f–h</xref>).

Depending on the cellular context, the FGF pathway activates the MAPK or PI3K pathways, or PLCγ that controls intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Ornitz and Itoh, 2015</xref>). Inactivation of MAPK or PI3K in lymph gland progenitors leads to a phenotype opposite to that of knock-down of <italic>btl</italic> in progenitors or of <italic>bnl</italic> in cardiac cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dragojlovic-Munther and Martinez-Agosto, 2013</xref>). This strongly suggests that Bnl/Btl-FGF signaling in progenitors does not involve MAPK or PI3K activity. It was previously reported that intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels regulate hematopoietic progenitor maintenance: reduction of cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> in lymph gland progenitors leads to the loss of progenitor markers and to increased blood cell differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Shim et al., 2013</xref>). Since Bnl/Btl-FGF knock-down and reduction of Ca<sup>2+</sup> in progenitors induce similar lymph gland defects, we asked whether both mechanisms were functionally linked. We investigated Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels within MZ progenitors using the Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensor GCaMP3, which emits green fluorescence only with high Ca<sup>2+</sup>levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Nakai et al., 2001</xref>). This sensor is expressed under the control of the <italic>dome-gal4</italic> driver. In agreement with previous reports, high Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels were detected in MZ progenitors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Shim et al., 2013</xref>). Knocking down <italic>btl</italic> in MZ progenitors starting from L1 stage led in third instar larvae to decreased fluorescence compared to the control, indicating a reduction in Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a–c</xref>). Since no difference with control larvae could be observed at L2 stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1a–c</xref>), we conclude that the Bnl/Btl-FGF pathway is not required for MZ progenitor specification but is required in third instar larvae to regulate Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels. We then asked whether restoring high Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels in progenitors could rescue the lymph gland defects due to reduced Bnl/Btl-FGF function. When free Ca<sup>2+</sup> was high within the progenitors, such as following overexpression of Calmodulin dependent kinase II (CaMKII; <italic>dome &gt;CaMKII</italic>) or of IP3R (Tep4 &gt;UAS-IP3R) which controls ER-mediated Ca<sup>2+</sup> release into the cytosol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Shim et al., 2013</xref>), a significant decrease in crystal cell numbers was observed compared to the control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5d–h</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1d–h</xref>). This indicates that high Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels in progenitors inhibit blood cell differentiation, which is in agreement with previously published data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Shim et al., 2013</xref>). Simultaneous <italic>btl</italic> reduction and Ca<sup>2+</sup> increase in progenitors, through CaMKII or IP3R overexpression (<italic>dome &gt;CamKII;btl-RNAi</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5g–h</xref> and <italic>tep4 &gt;IP3R&gt;btl-RNAi;</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1g–h</xref>), leads to a decrease in crystal cell numbers compared to the sole <italic>btl-RNAi</italic> knockdown. Overall, these data suggest that in MZ progenitors, regulation of Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels functions downstream of the Bnl/Btl-FGF pathway. In vertebrates, FGF activation can recruit and activate PLCγ, which induces Ca<sup>2+</sup> release from the ER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Ornitz and Itoh, 2015</xref>). <italic>small wing</italic> (<italic>sl</italic>) encodes the sole Drosophila PLCγ homolog (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Thackeray et al., 1998</xref>).

Compared to the control, increased crystal cell differentiation was observed (as labeled by Hnt <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5j,m</xref>).

Knocking down PLCγ in progenitors (<italic>dome &gt;sl-RNAi</italic>) led to increased crystal cell differentiation compared to the control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5i,l</xref>), revealing that PLCγ in MZ progenitors regulates lymph gland hemocyte differentiation.

These data establish that <italic>sl</italic> acts downstream of the Bnl/Btl-FGF pathway. Altogether, our data support the hypothesis that in MZ progenitors, Bnl/Btl-FGF signaling leads to the activation of PLCγ, which controls Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels and in turn hemocyte differentiation.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Btl receptor interacts genetically with CamKII to control blood cell differentiation by preventing high Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels in progenitors.</title><p>(<bold>a, b</bold>) GCaMP3 Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensor (<italic>dome &gt;UAS-GCaMP3</italic>) is white. GCaMP3 intensity decreases when <italic>btl is</italic> knocked down in MZ progenitors (<bold>b</bold>) compared to the control (<bold>a</bold>).

The niche is defined by its capacity to directly regulate, through signals, stem cells and progenitors. In the mammalian bone marrow HSPCs are under the control of the endosteal and vascular niches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Asada et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Calvi et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Calvi and Link, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">He et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kiel et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Morrison and Scadden, 2014</xref>). In Drosophila, lymph gland studies have so far concentrated on the PSC acting as a niche. However, a subset of lymph gland progenitors (core progenitors), which express Col and <italic>tep4</italic> and are aligned along the cardiac tube, is maintained in the lymph gland even when the PSC function is impaired, suggesting that other signals alongside those from the PSC are required (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baldeosingh et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Benmimoun et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Oyallon et al., 2016</xref>). Here, we report that cardiac cells play a role similar to a niche, since they directly control core progenitor maintenance. We show that communication between the vascular system and the lymph gland involves Bnl/Btl-FGFsignaling. Bnl secreted by cardiac cells activates Bnl/Btl-FGF in progenitors, which in turn controls hemocyte homeostasis. Our data indicate that Bnl/Btl-FGF signaling regulates lymph gland homeostasis by controlling calcium levels in progenitors via PLCγ activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). In a previous study, we showed that signals from the cardiac tube, namely Slit, can act on the PSC, but that no cellular communication between the cardiac tube and MZ progenitors is involved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Morin-Poulard et al., 2016</xref>). Now we establish that cardiac cells regulate the extent of progenitor differentiation in the lymph gland. Therefore, two separate niches (the PSC and the cardiac tube) control lymph gland homeostasis. While the PSC acts only on a subset of MZ progenitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baldeosingh et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Oyallon et al., 2016</xref>), the cardiac tube directly regulates core progenitors and in turn all MZ progenitors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>).The identification of two niches that differentially regulate lymph gland progenitors sheds further light on the parallels existing between Drosophila lymph gland and mammalian bone marrow hematopoiesis.</p><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Two niches control lymph gland homeostasis.</title><p>(<bold>a–b</bold>) Schematic representation of third instar larvae lymph gland anterior lobes.

How the ligand Bnl diffuses from its source to activate Btl in neighboring cells remains a controversial issue. Studies performed on Drosophila larval Air-Sac-Primordium (ASP), using endogenous tagged versions of Bnl and Btl, brought to light a key role of long range direct cellular contacts mediated by long thin cellular extensions called cytonemes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Roy et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sato and Kornberg, 2002</xref>). In this process, rather than diffusing passively, Bnl produced by wing disc cells is delivered directly to ASP cells by cytonemes to activate FGF signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Du et al., 2018</xref>). No cytoplasmic extensions from either cardiac cells or MZ progenitors were observed so far, ruling out the delivery of Bnl from cardiac cells though long cytoplasmic extensions. Instead, both cardiac cells and MZ progenitors are embedded in a dense network of extra-cellular matrix (ECM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Grigorian et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Krzemień et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Volk et al., 2014</xref>). The role of ECM components and associated cell-surface proteins, such as heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Muha and Müller, 2013</xref>), in lymph gland Btl-FGF activation deserves additional investigation.</p><p>Bnl::GFP secreted by cardiac cells is detected in MZ progenitors as cytoplasmic punctate dots positive for Rab11, a marker for recycling vesicles, for Rab7, a marker for late endosomes, and for the receptor Btl.

While Htl-FGF signaling acts through Ras and MAPK activation, we show here that Btl-FGF signaling controls intracellular calcium concentration in hematopoietic progenitors probably through PLCγ activation. By performing epistasis experiments, we further establish the absence of hierarchy between Htl-FGF and Btl-FGF signaling pathways in the MZ and that both pathways are required simultaneously to control lymph gland hematopoiesis. To our knowledge, this is the first example in which Btl and Htl are both expressed and required in the same cell population. We postulate that simultaneous regulation by the two pathways and a Bnl contribution by two separate tissues confers robustness to lymph gland hematopoiesis under normal developmental conditions and flexibility in response to environmental fluctuation. Since Htl and Btl inactivation leads to opposite lymph gland phenotypes, this raises the question of their respective downstream targets.</p><p>In vertebrates, FGF signaling controls both primitive and definitive hematopoiesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dzierzak and Bigas, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Muha and Müller, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Ornitz and Itoh, 2015</xref>). Additional studies indicate that FGFR1 in adult HSPCs is activated during hematopoietic recovery following injury, in order to stimulate HSPC proliferation and mobilization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Zhao et al., 2012</xref>). Furthermore, FGF2 facilitates HSPC expansion by amplifying mesenchymal stem cells, a niche cell type (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Itkin et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Itkin et al., 2012</xref>). Thus, in vertebrate adult bone marrow, the FGF pathway plays a major role in the control of hematopoiesis both under steady state conditions and in response to an immune stress. However, deciphering how FGF controls hematopoiesis in bone marrow remains an arduous task since many FGF ligands and receptors are expressed in HSPC and/or niche cells and redundancy and compensation mechanisms between different FGF members can occur (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Haas et al., 2018</xref>). Given the high conservation of signaling pathways between Drosophila and mammals, the low genetic redundancy in Drosophila and the striking similarities between mammalian bone marrow and fly lymph gland, there is promise that our newly identified regulation of FGF signaling in the lymph gland will shed light on the complex regulation of FGF signaling in mammalian bone marrow.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Fly strains</title><p> <italic>w<sup>1118</sup></italic> (wild type, <italic>WT</italic>), <italic>UAS-mCD8-GFP</italic> and PG125<italic>dome-gal4</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Krzemień et al., 2007</xref>), <italic>antp-gal4</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Mandal et al., 2007</xref>)<italic>, handΔ-gal4</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Morin-Poulard et al., 2016</xref>) and <italic>NP1029-gal4</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Monier et al., 2005</xref>). <italic>handΔ-gal4</italic> corresponds to the 3<sup>rd</sup> intron of <italic>hand</italic> deleted from the specific visceral mesoderm enhancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Popichenko et al., 2007</xref> and Laurent Perrin personal communication).

The authors identified through a genetic screen the Fibroblast Growth Factor (FGF) ligand Branchless (Bnl) produced by cardiac cells that maintain hematopoietic lymph gland progenitors by controlling intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration via PLCγ activation. This result brings advancement in the study of central hematopoiesis in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> larvae, although, it was already shown that the cardiac cells impact central hematopoiesis via the regulation of PSC morphology. While this article has some merits, I am not sure that it is strong enough to deserve publication in e<italic>Life</italic>.</p><p>First, this newly identified pathway is not integrated with the other pathways that regulate lymph gland homeostasis already described by this team and other research groups. As such, it is unclear what are the specificity of this pathway and what it brings to the process of hematopoiesis. In order to answer these questions, it would be necessary to analyse the impact of the cardiac cell-progenitor loop on hematopoiesis during an infestation.</p><p>1) A first concern is that this new pathway involving cardia cells and progenitor through Bnl and Btl is not integrated with other pathways. There is only a little insight provided on how this signaling cascade impact differentiation except for an increase of Ca<sup>2+</sup>.</p><p>2) A second concern here is that this inter-organ communication between the cardiac cells and the lymph gland has been studied under homeostatic but not immune stress conditions. Some additional experiments are needed to show how the cardiac cells might act as a niche to regulate the hematopoietic response to immune stress such as wasp parasitism.</p><p>3) The authors demonstrated the diffusion of Bnl from the cardiac cells to the lymph gland progenitors. However, the data concerning the internalization of Bnl in the lymph gland by endocytosis is not convincing. First, Figure 4 (B,B',B') is unclear. More generally, the authors should look at the colocalization of Bnl-GFP with the early endosomal Rab5 and the late endosomal Rab7 that have a key role in the transport along the endocytic pathway. In Figure 4 (A,A'): They should use an endogenously tagged version of Btl to validate further that Bbl is secreted by the cardiac cells and not only an over-expression of Bnl tagged protein.</p><p>4) A weakness of the manuscript is that we do not know the time during larval development at which this pathway plays a role.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>In this study, the authors describe the importance of cardiac/vascular cells in regulating the hematopoietic progenitor maintenance in the lymph gland. The authors propose that FGF ligand Branchless (identified as a result of a functional screen) is emanated by the vascular cells which activates FGF receptor, Breathless in the progenitor cells, necessary to maintain their homeostasis and prevent excessive differentiation. Down-stream of Btl receptor activation, the authors demonstrate the involvement of PLC-γ mediated control of progenitor calcium levels that is necessary to execute their homeostasis. Overall, the present work attempts to address the fundamental concept of understanding unidentified signal from vascular niche to control maintenance of differential population of hematopoietic progenitor cells, via utilizing a simpler and a conserved model organism <italic>Drosophila</italic> with allied similarity with the vertebrate bone marrow system. Their perusal for finding additional signals from the vascular cells in regulating hematopoiesis stems from an earlier study where PSC dependent and independent progenitors were shown to reside in the medullary zone suggesting heterogeneity in the progenitor population (Baldeosingh et al., 2018).</p><p>Although the findings seem appealing and interesting, there are certain concerns that I have regarding the main conclusions drawn in the manuscript and the experimental strategies employed to infer them. I list them point-by-point below. It is important the authors address them to prove their model and demonstrate clarity in their proposed work.</p><p>a) Specificity of Bnl source: The major concern that I have in this manuscript is regarding the specificity by which the authors prove it is the cardiac cells derived Bnl whose function is necessary for progenitor homeostasis. Given that there are two sources of Bnl production, the cardiac cells and the progenitor cells themselves, the HandΔ-gal4 line utilized in this study is confusing in accurately dissecting the source. The specificity of HandΔ-gal4, which the authors claim is a cardiac cell-specific driver, is also reported to be expressed in early LG hematopoietic compartment cells (Hand is a direct target of Tinman and GATA factors during <italic>Drosophila</italic> cardiogenesis and hematopoiesis http://dev.biologists.org/content/132/15/3525), (Pvr expression regulators in equilibrium signal control and maintenance of <italic>Drosophila</italic> blood progenitors https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4185420/), and lineage tracing with Hand-gal4 marks lymph gland progenitor cells. Given the progenitor differentiation phenotype observed upon blocking Bnl using Dome-gal4, the interpretation of the cardiac cells being the source is confusing and needs to be clarified. I understand that the authors have utilized NP1029-gal4, but again, if this has any overlapping expression in the lymph gland remains unaddressed. A lineage tracing of NP1029-gal4 to show no overlapping expression in the lymph gland is important. Secondly, both Hand and Dome are co-expressed very early (24hours AEL) in lymph gland progenitor cells, following which Hand is only restricted to cardiac and PSC cells, while Dome continues to be expressed in progenitor cells. If the loss of progenitor maintenance in HandΔ&gt;BnlRNAi or Dome&gt;BnlRNAi is a consequence of this early over-lapping expression needs to be tested. Temporal analysis of the lymph gland phenotype using gal80ts based experiments should help resolve this concern.</p><p>b) Temporal role of Bnl in progenitor cells: The two Bnl sources, cardiac and blood cells, loss of Bnl in either gives the same phenotype. It is important to address the temporal requirement of Branchless and the dependence or independence of one source over the other to highlight the importance of the cardiac niche in establishing progenitor homeostasis. In its current form, the manuscript fails to highlight the importance of this niche. A comparative analysis of Bnl-GFP expression during lymph gland development (from early to late3rd instar) should be undertaken to reveal its expression profile within the cardiac cells and blood progenitor cells. Secondly, changes in Bnl-GFP pattern upon expressing BnlRNAi in cardiac cells or using Dome-gal4 will hopefully address the important contribution of cardiac niche in regulating progenitor Bnl levels. Finally, with regards to the role of Bnl, the other conceptual concern that is raised is its requirement either as a progenitor development signal or that it is required post progenitor development only as a maintenance cue. Again, using gal80ts as mentioned in the previous comment, should help clarify this aspect.</p><p>c) Calcium homeostasis and FGF signaling: Although the authors show a down-regulation of GCAMP3 expression in lymph gland progenitor cells upon loss of FGF signaling, the analysis has been mostly done in the 3rd instar lymph gland when most of the tissue is differentiated. Hence it is hard to predict if the down-regulation is indeed because of loss of FGF signaling or is a consequence of progenitor differentiation and loss of these cells that maintain elevated GCAMP3 expression. Analysis of GCAMP3 levels in 2nd instar lymph glands prior to the onset of differentiation will help resolve this matter. Secondly, over-expression of PLC-γ in BtlRNAi condition may be important to prove the connection between Btl and activation of its downstream cascade linking to Calcium homeostasis more affirmatively.</p><p>d) Cardiac niche to maintain progenitor heterogeneity: The authors talk about heterogeneity in progenitors and the importance of the cardiac niche in this &quot;Furthermore, the MZ progenitor population is heterogeneous and a subset of progenitors, called &quot;core progenitors&quot;, which express […]these data led us to ask whether signals derived from cardiac cells were involved in the control of lymph gland homeostasis, i.e.: the balance between progenitors and differentiated blood cells, independently from the PSC&quot;. This idea doesn't seem to crystallize in the course of the findings made. The readouts for the assays done are looking at crystal cell differentiation and progenitor maintenance status to decipher FGF signaling in progenitors with ligand contribution from cardiac cells. There needs to be some way to reconcile this either experimentally (differential effects on Tep4 and Dome expression under some genetic manipulations already shown in the manuscript) or textually in the Discussion.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>In this manuscript, Destalminil-Letourneau et al. describe a novel mechanism of progenitor maintenance in the hematopoietic organ, the lymph gland. They provide evidence for the presence of a vascular niche via cardiac cells, that regulates blood progenitor maintenance in the lymph gland. This manuscript provides interesting and novel insights by showing that the existence of a vascular niche as a conserved mechanism of blood stem cell maintenance as it also exists in flies. The authors provide mechanistic insight by providing data that supports the assertion that vascular niche-lymph gland mediated FGF pathway (via Bnl-Btl) signalling positively regulates hematopoietic progenitor maintenance by controlling intracellular calcium levels in the medullary zone of the lymph gland. The manuscript reports some exciting findings but could benefit from a few improvements requiring further experimentation, validation, and analysis. Major comments are as follows:</p><p>1) In Figure 2A-A' the authors that the Bnl signal is present throughout the primary lymph gland lobe. This raises the possibility that cells in Posterior Signaling Centre or the Cortical Zone can also be a source of Bnl for the prohemocytes via a type of reciprocal signalling. One way to look at the possibility that the PSC cells or CZ cells are a potential source of Bnl is to include high resolution images where Bnl is detected (either via antibody or in situ) and simultaneously label PSC cells (with collier or Antp-Gal4 driven mCD8GFP) or CZ cells (for example with Hmldelta-Gal4 driven mCD8GFP) with an in-situ against Bnl or with Bnl antibody – to rule out the possibility.</p><p>2) The author's arguments about tissue specific requirement of Bnl would be strengthened by testing whether the increased differentiation in bnlP2 mutants can be rescued by restoring bnl levels by transgene-mediated expression in the cardiac tube and the MZ. For example it could be determined whether the constitutive activation of Btl in prohemocytes in the genetic background of Btl mutants used (btldev1/+) rescues the crystal cell and plasmatocyte differentiation. Additionally, the authors could check if expressing Bnl in the MZ using dome or tep4-Gal4 can rescue the BnlRNAi phenotype of increased prohemocyte differentiation.</p><p>3) Figure 3A also shows strong expression of Btl receptor in the cells towards the cortical zone (periphery of the LG). This raises some intriguing mechanistic questions. First, the manuscript would greatly benefit with a better, systematic, analysis of Bnl and Btl expression both in each of the zonal compartments with appropriate markers (PSC, MZ and CZ) – with high magnification/high resolution images. Second, One can envision a scenario where are the cells in the CZ themselves act as a source of Bnl that binds to Btl in neighboring (MZ) cells to regulate differentiation. Currently the authors have not ruled out this alternative model. If the Bnl is indeed secreted by differentiated cells then there could be 2 modes of signalling – either cell autonomous/paracrine mode or reciprocal signalling to maintain the MZ. It would be helpful if further clarification is provided of the role played by Bnl/Btl-FGF signalling in the CZ. It is possible is that the Bnl secreted by the cardiac cells is transcytosed/transported to the differentiated cells where it regulates differentiation cell autonomously. The authors could test this by perturbing Bnl and Btl in the CZ (using Hmldelta-Gal4 or eater-Gal4 for plasmatocytes and lz-Gal4 for crystal cells) and asking whether this affects crystal cell or plasmatocyte differentiation cell autonomously.</p><p>4) As noted by the authors it was previously shown that another FGF pathway in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, mediated by Heartless, is required for regulating hematopoiesis in the lymph gland (Dragojlovic-Munther et al., 2013). In this previous report overexpressing Btl in the progenitors had no effect (Figure S6B and K of that paper), this merits some discussion ad explanation from the authors. Furthermore, since both Btl and Heartless signalling work through the transcription effector gene pointed we would expect cross talk between the two FGF pathways. This raises an important question of how the two pathways coordinated in the lymph gland. Some genetic interaction analysis between the components of the two arms of FGF signalling will be particularly useful. Specifically, determining if one of the FGF pathways is epistatic to the other, as well as establishing whether indeed both pathways converge on Pointed.</p><p>5) The Rab11 data in Figure 4B-B' is not as strong as it could be. First, the addition of a cell membrane marker and images of a better and higher resolution would allow greater clarity. Also, since Rab11 marks the recycling endosome, it would be more appropriate to look at other endocytic markers like Rab5 (early endosome marker) and/or Rab7 (late endosome) in addition to Rab11. Also, the co-expression data in the above cases with the Rabs is currently qualitative. It is appropriate in this sort of instance to include quantitative measurement of co-localization. The authors should consider including a staining showing endocytic localization (marked with the Rabs) of the Btl receptor (by in-situ or by antibody) in the prohemocytes. Also in Figure 4B-B' shows only two cells which have Rab11-bnl co-expression/co-localization whereas the field of interest seems to have many more cells in the area. Why don't all the prohemocytes show this co-expression? Finally, also in Figure 4 Bnl diffusion data in a-a' does not look convincing without a cellular marker to identify the hemocyte populations in the LG. Such a marker should be added.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.64672.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>[Editors’ note: the authors resubmitted a revised version of the paper for consideration.

Previous studies established that the PSC acts as a niche to control lymph gland homeostasis (for review Letourneau et al., 2016 and Banerjee et al., 2019) The hematopoietic progenitor pool in the lymph gland is heterogeneous, and a subset is not controlled by PSC signals (Baldeosingh et al., 2018). We showed previously that the cardiac/vascular system controls the PSC size and its function. Thus, through an indirect regulation involving the PSC, cardiac cells control lymph gland hematopoiesis (Morin–Poulard et al., 2016).</p><p>In this study, for the first time we provide evidence that the vascular system which directly controls blood cell progenitors independently from the PSC acts as a niche. Thus, these data establish that 2 niches control the lymph gland. Furthermore, we provide evidence that through the activation of Fibroblast Growth Factor (FGF) signaling, the vascular system prevents hematopoietic progenitors from massive differentiation, ensuring the proper balance between blood cell populations within the lymph gland. Finally, FGF activation in blood cell progenitors prevents their differentiation by regulating their intracellular calcium levels probably via PLCg activation. We sincerely think that these data bring very important and novel knowledge on the mechanisms that control lymph gland hematopoiesis and open new avenues of investigation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>First, this newly identified pathway is not integrated with the other pathways that regulate lymph gland homeostasis already described by this team and other research groups.

Furthermore, we analyze the relationship between BtlFGF and Htl-FGF signaling that was previously reported to be required in MZ progenitors (Dragojlovic-Munther and Martinez-Agosto, 2013). We provide evidence that there is no hierarchy between Btl-FGF and Htl-FGF signaling in the MZ. Altogether, these data reveal a primary level of integration that occurs in the lymph gland.</p><p>Unraveling the integration of Bnl/Btl activation with other pathways that regulate lymph gland homeostasis represents a huge task, since many regulators (and the list is still growing) have been identified, and there is evidence for both intrinsic and extrinsic regulations (for a review please see Letourneau et al., 2016 and Banerjee et al., 2019). If the analysis is restricted to the mechanisms that control lymph gland MZ progenitors, two main problems arise. Indeed, most studies examining the role of genes/signaling pathways involved in MZ progenitors do not distinguish whether they are required for progenitor specification at the L1 or L2 larval stages, or for progenitor maintenance at the L3 stage. In addition, most of them analyze the lymph gland progenitor pool as labelled by dome&gt;GFP without looking at defects in the “core progenitor” pool (labelled by Col and tep4). Thus, before being able to “integrate Bnl/Btl signaling”, one would have to reinvestigate the previously identified genes/signaling pathways with respect to when and in which lymph gland progenitor pools they are required. This represents as such entirely independent studies that could take years and are out of the focus of this paper.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) A second concern here is that this inter-organ communication between the cardiac cells and the lymph gland has been studied under homeostatic but not immune stress conditions. Some additional experiments are needed to show how the cardiac cells might act as a niche to regulate the hematopoietic response to immune stress such as wasp parasitism.</p></disp-quote><p>We performed wasp parasitism when bnl (hand&gt;bnl-RNAi) or btl (dome&gt;btl-RNAi) were knocked down in cardiac cells and progenitors respectively, and measured the % of wasp egg encapsulation. In both conditions, a defect in wasp egg encapsulation was observed compared to control, indicating that Bnl from cardiac cells and Btl in progenitors are required for an efficient cellular immune response against wasps. But now a detailed analysis is required to decipher how Btl-FGF signaling is involved. This question is out of the scope of this paper and will be the focus of intense future analyses.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The authors demonstrated the diffusion of Bnl from the cardiac cells to the lymph gland progenitors. However, the data concerning the internalization of Bnl in the lymph gland by endocytosis is not convincing. First, Figure 4 (B,B',B') is unclear.

In Figure 4 (A,A'): They should use an endogenously tagged version of Btl to validate further that Bbl is secreted by the cardiac cells and not only an over-expression of Bnl tagged protein.</p></disp-quote><p>In agreement with the reviewer’s comment we better defined bnl::GFP propagation from cardiac cells to MZ progenitors (HandD&gt;Uas bnl::GFP). We used the ubi-Rab11-cherryFP reporter and performed Rab7 immunostaining, which label recycling vesicles and late endosomes, respectively. Unfortunately we cannot look at Rab5 vesicles since the Rab5 reporter is tagged by GFP and therefore colocalisation with Bnl::GFP cannot be done. We also performed Col immunostaining to visualize core progenitors. These additional data are provided in Figure 4 A, C-D”. In addition, we looked at Bnl::GFP colocalisation with the Btl receptor in progenitors (Figure 4 B-B”’) and finally at Bnl::GFP diffusion from the CT to the CZ when the secretion of cardiac cells was impaired by <italic>sar1-RNAi</italic> expression. These data are provided in Figure 4 E-G. Altogether, they strongly support the proposition that Bnl::GFP secreted by cardiac cells is internalized in MZ progenitors likely through receptor-mediated endocytosis. This is discussed in the revised version of the manuscript.</p><p>Finally we analyzed endogenous Bnl expression using the <italic>bnl:GFP<sup>endo</sup></italic> knock-in allele (Du et al., 2018).

This is now clearly stated in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>In this study, the authors describe the importance of cardiac/vascular cells in regulating the hematopoietic progenitor maintenance in the lymph gland. The authors propose that FGF ligand Branchless (identified as a result of a functional screen) is emanated by the vascular cells which activates FGF receptor, Breathless in the progenitor cells, necessary to maintain their homeostasis and prevent excessive differentiation. Down-stream of Btl receptor activation, the authors demonstrate the involvement of PLC-γ mediated control of progenitor calcium levels that is necessary to execute their homeostasis. Overall, the present work attempts to address the fundamental concept of understanding unidentified signal from vascular niche to control maintenance of differential population of hematopoietic progenitor cells, via utilizing a simpler and a conserved model organism <italic>Drosophila</italic> with allied similarity with the vertebrate bone marrow system. Their perusal for finding additional signals from the vascular cells in regulating hematopoiesis stems from an earlier study where PSC dependent and independent progenitors were shown to reside in the medullary zone suggesting heterogeneity in the progenitor population (Baldeosingh et al., 2018).</p><p>Although the findings seem appealing and interesting, there are certain concerns that I have regarding the main conclusions drawn in the manuscript and the experimental strategies employed to infer them. I list them point-by-point below. It is important the authors address them to prove their model and demonstrate clarity in their proposed work.</p><p>a) Specificity of Bnl source: The major concern that I have in this manuscript is regarding the specificity by which the authors prove it is the cardiac cells derived Bnl whose function is necessary for progenitor homeostasis. Given that there are two sources of Bnl production, the cardiac cells and the progenitor cells themselves, the HandΔ-gal4 line utilized in this study is confusing in accurately dissecting the source. The specificity of HandΔ-gal4, which the authors claim is a cardiac cell-specific driver, is also reported to be expressed in early LG hematopoietic compartment cells (Hand is a direct target of Tinman and GATA factors during <italic>Drosophila</italic> cardiogenesis and hematopoiesis http://dev.biologists.org/content/132/15/3525), (Pvr expression regulators in equilibrium signal control and maintenance of <italic>Drosophila</italic> blood progenitors https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4185420/), and lineage tracing with Hand-gal4 marks lymph gland progenitor cells. Given the progenitor differentiation phenotype observed upon blocking Bnl using Dome-gal4, the interpretation of the cardiac cells being the source is confusing and needs to be clarified. I understand that the authors have utilized NP1029-gal4, but again, if this has any overlapping expression in the lymph gland remains unaddressed. A lineage tracing of NP1029-gal4 to show no overlapping expression in the lymph gland is important. Secondly, both Hand and Dome are co-expressed very early (24hours AEL) in lymph gland progenitor cells, following which Hand is only restricted to cardiac and PSC cells, while Dome continues to be expressed in progenitor cells. If the loss of progenitor maintenance in HandΔ&gt;BnlRNAi or Dome&gt;BnlRNAi is a consequence of this early over-lapping expression needs to be tested. Temporal analysis of the lymph gland phenotype using gal80ts based experiments should help resolve this concern.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for creating confusion about the HandD-gal4 driver we used. The HandD-gal4 diver is NOT the hand-gal4 driver (also called hand cardiac and hematopoiesis (HCH)-gal4) described in (Han and Olson, 2005) and used in the 2 papers cited by the reviewer. The HandD-gal4 has been used previously in Morin–Poulard et al., 2016. In larvae, the HandD-gal4 driver is expressed in cardiac cells and pericardial cells but not in lymph gland cells. The expression profiles of HandD-gal4&gt;GFP and NP1029-gal4&gt;GFP in L1, L2 and L3 larval lymph glands are now provided in Figure 1—figure supplement 1 A-F’. Complementary information concerning these drivers is added in Materials and methods.</p><p>In all experiments, crosses and the subsequent raising of larvae until late L1/early L2 stage were performed at 22°C, before shifting larvae to 29°C until their dissection at the L3 stage. This information is now given both in the Materials and methods and the Results sections. Furthermore, according to the reviewer’s advice we performed temporal analysis of the lymph gland phenotype using tub-gal80ts (Figure 2—figure supplement 1O-Q) and looked at GCaMP3-expression at the L2 stage (Figure 5—figure supplement 1A-C). In conclusion, bnl/btl-FGF signaling is not involved in progenitor development till L2 but is required in third instar larvae to control the balance between MZ progenitor maintenance and hemocyte differentiation. This is now clearly stated in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>b) Temporal role of Bnl in progenitor cells: The two Bnl sources, cardiac and blood cells, loss of Bnl in either gives the same phenotype. It is important to address the temporal requirement of Branchless and the dependence or independence of one source over the other to highlight the importance of the cardiac niche in establishing progenitor homeostasis. In its current form, the manuscript fails to highlight the importance of this niche. A comparative analysis of Bnl-GFP expression during lymph gland development (from early to late3rd instar) should be undertaken to reveal its expression profile within the cardiac cells and blood progenitor cells. Secondly, changes in Bnl-GFP pattern upon expressing BnlRNAi in cardiac cells or using Dome-gal4 will hopefully address the important contribution of cardiac niche in regulating progenitor Bnl levels. Finally, with regards to the role of Bnl, the other conceptual concern that is raised is its requirement either as a progenitor development signal or that it is required post progenitor development only as a maintenance cue. Again, using gal80ts as mentioned in the previous comment, should help clarify this aspect.</p></disp-quote><p>A detailed expression profile of Bnl is now provided. Since Bnl is diffusible, we performed ISH with simultaneous immunostainings with markers for different lymph gland cell types. These new data are provided in Figure 2a-a” and in Figure 2—figure supplement 1A-C”. We also looked at endogenous Bnl protein using the bnl:GFP<sup>endo</sup> knock-in alleles described by Du et al., 2018 (please see Figure 2S-T’).</p><p>When <italic>bnl</italic> was knocked-down in the cardiac tube (<italic>handD&gt;bnl RNAi, bnl:GFP<sup>endo</sup></italic> ) lower Bnl:GFP<italic><sup>endo</sup></italic> levels were recorded in MZ progenitors (Figure 2S-U). This result illustrates that Bnl secreted by cardiac cells contributes to Bnl levels in progenitors. These novel data are provided in Figure 2 and discussed in the text.</p><p>Concerning the temporal requirement of Bnl/Btll-FGF signaling, please see above our answer to point a.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>c) Calcium homeostasis and FGF signaling: Although the authors show a down-regulation of GCAMP3 expression in lymph gland progenitor cells upon loss of FGF signaling, the analysis has been mostly done in the 3rd instar lymph gland when most of the tissue is differentiated. Hence it is hard to predict if the down-regulation is indeed because of loss of FGF signaling or is a consequence of progenitor differentiation and loss of these cells that maintain elevated GCAMP3 expression. Analysis of GCAMP3 levels in 2nd instar lymph glands prior to the onset of differentiation will help resolve this matter. Secondly, over-expression of PLC-γ in BtlRNAi condition may be important to prove the connection between Btl and activation of its downstream cascade linking to Calcium homeostasis more affirmatively.</p></disp-quote><p>As proposed by the reviewer, we looked at lymph gland GCaMP3 levels in second instar larvae. No difference compared to controls was observed (Figure 5—figure supplement 1 A-C), indicating that there is no difference in MZ progenitors till L2 stage.</p><p>Thanks to the reviewer’s remark about the connection between Btl and PLC-, we examined the relationship between <italic>sl</italic> and the Btl-FGF pathway and performed epistasis experiments (Figure 5J, K-N). Our data establish that <italic>sl</italic> acts downstream of the Bnl/Btl-FGF pathway.</p><p>Altogether, these data support the conclusion that in MZ progenitors, Bnl/Btl-FGF signaling leads to the activation of PLCg, which controls Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels and in turn hemocyte differentiation. These new data are provided in (Figure 5J, K-N), discussed in the text and indicated on the model in Figure 6.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>d) Cardiac niche to maintain progenitor heterogeneity: The authors talk about heterogeneity in progenitors and the importance of the cardiac niche in this &quot;Furthermore, the MZ progenitor population is heterogeneous and a subset of progenitors, called &quot;core progenitors&quot;, which express […] these data led us to ask whether signals derived from cardiac cells were involved in the control of lymph gland homeostasis, i.e.: the balance between progenitors and differentiated blood cells, independently from the PSC&quot;. This idea doesn't seem to crystallize in the course of the findings made. The readouts for the assays done are looking at crystal cell differentiation and progenitor maintenance status to decipher FGF signaling in progenitors with ligand contribution from cardiac cells. There needs to be some way to reconcile this either experimentally (differential effects on Tep4 and Dome expression under some genetic manipulations already shown in the manuscript) or textually in the Discussion.</p></disp-quote><p>Our apologies for not being clear on this point. It has been previously established that lymph gland MZ progenitors are labelled by either dome-MESO-LacZ (Krzemien et al., 2007) or domeMESO-RFP (Louradour et al., 2017). Col and <italic>tep4</italic> are expressed in a subset of MZ progenitors called “the core progenitors”, which also express domeMESO-LacZ or domeMESO-RFP (Oyallon et al., 2016). In this study we carefully distinguished both progenitor types using the corresponding markers (DomeMESO-RFP and <italic>tep4</italic> and/or Col). Knocking down <italic>bnl</italic> in cardiac cells or <italic>btl</italic> in MZ progenitors leads to a decrease in both DomeMESO-RFP and Col/<italic>tep4</italic> expression, establishing that both progenitor types are affected. We modified the text in order to clarify this point.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>In this manuscript, Destalminil-Letourneau et al. describe a novel mechanism of progenitor maintenance in the hematopoietic organ, the lymph gland. They provide evidence for the presence of a vascular niche via cardiac cells, that regulates blood progenitor maintenance in the lymph gland. This manuscript provides interesting and novel insights by showing that the existence of a vascular niche as a conserved mechanism of blood stem cell maintenance as it also exists in flies. The authors provide mechanistic insight by providing data that supports the assertion that vascular niche-lymph gland mediated FGF pathway (via Bnl-Btl) signalling positively regulates hematopoietic progenitor maintenance by controlling intracellular calcium levels in the medullary zone of the lymph gland. The manuscript reports some exciting findings but could benefit from a few improvements requiring further experimentation, validation, and analysis. Major comments are as follows:</p><p>1) In Figure 2A-A' the authors that the Bnl signal is present throughout the primary lymph gland lobe. This raises the possibility that cells in Posterior Signaling Centre or the Cortical Zone can also be a source of Bnl for the prohemocytes via a type of reciprocal signalling. One way to look at the possibility that the PSC cells or CZ cells are a potential source of Bnl is to include high resolution images where Bnl is detected (either via antibody or in situ) and simultaneously label PSC cells (with collier or Antp-Gal4 driven mCD8GFP) or CZ cells (for example with Hmldelta-Gal4 driven mCD8GFP) with an in-situ against Bnl or with Bnl antibody – to rule out the possibility.</p></disp-quote><p>A detailed expression profile of Bnl is provided. Since Bnl is diffusible, we performed ISH with simultaneous immunostainings with specific markers for the different lymph gland cell types (PSC, MZ, crystal cell and differentiating hemocytes (Hml&gt;GFP)). These new data are provided in Figure 2-A-A” and in Figure 2—figure supplement 1A-C”. We also looked at endogenous Bnl expression using the bnl:GFP<sup>endo</sup> knock-in alleles described by Du et al., 2018 (please see Figure 2S-T’). For Btl, we used the btl:mcherry<sup>endo</sup> knock-in allele generated by Du et al., 2018 and performed co-staining with markers for different lymph gland cell types (PSC, MZ, crystal cell and differentiating hemocytes (Hml&gt;GFP)). These new data are provided in Figure 3A-A” and Figure 3—figure supplement 1 A-C”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The author's arguments about tissue specific requirement of Bnl would be strengthened by testing whether the increased differentiation in bnlP2 mutants can be rescued by restoring bnl levels by transgene-mediated expression in the cardiac tube and the MZ. For example it could be determined whether the constitutive activation of Btl in prohemocytes in the genetic background of Btl mutants used (btldev1/+) rescues the crystal cell and plasmatocyte differentiation. Additionally, the authors could check if expressing Bnl in the MZ using dome or tep4-Gal4 can rescue the BnlRNAi phenotype of increased prohemocyte differentiation.</p></disp-quote><p>We expressed simultaneously <italic>bnl-RNAi</italic> and <italic>bnl</italic> in MZ progenitors (<italic>dome-gal4&gt;bnl-RNAi&gt;bnl</italic>) and observed a rescue in crystal cell numbers compared to the reduction of <italic>bnl</italic> alone (please see the quantification below). This result confirms that <italic>bnl-RNAi</italic> is specific to <italic>bnl</italic>, but this result does not say much about the relative contribution of <italic>bnl</italic> provided by MZ progenitors and <italic>bnl</italic> secreted by cardiac cells since we perform an overexpression of <italic>bnl</italic> in the MZ. As we already include many supplementary figures and as this information is not essential we did not integrate this result in the manuscript. However, what is more informative relative to the <italic>bnl</italic> source (CT versus MZ) are the novel data given in Figure 2S-U. We looked at endogenous Bnl using the bnl:GFP<sup>endo</sup> knock-in allele (Du et al., 2018). When <italic>bnl</italic> was knocked-down in the cardiac tube (<italic>handD&gt;bnl RNAi, bnl:GFP</italic><sup>endo</sup> ), lower Bnl:GFP<sup>endo</sup> levels were recorded in MZ progenitors (Figure 2S-U). This result illustrates that Bnl secreted by cardiac cells contributes to Bnl levels in progenitors. These novel data are provided in Figure 2 and discussed in the text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Figure 3A also shows strong expression of Btl receptor in the cells towards the cortical zone (periphery of the LG). This raises some intriguing mechanistic questions. First, the manuscript would greatly benefit with a better, systematic, analysis of Bnl and Btl expression both in each of the zonal compartments with appropriate markers (PSC, MZ and CZ) – with high magnification/high resolution images. Second, One can envision a scenario where are the cells in the CZ themselves act as a source of Bnl that binds to Btl in neighboring (MZ) cells to regulate differentiation. Currently the authors have not ruled out this alternative model. If the Bnl is indeed secreted by differentiated cells then there could be 2 modes of signalling – either cell autonomous/paracrine mode or reciprocal signalling to maintain the MZ. It would be helpful if further clarification is provided of the role played by Bnl/Btl-FGF signalling in the CZ. It is possible is that the Bnl secreted by the cardiac cells is transcytosed/transported to the differentiated cells where it regulates differentiation cell autonomously. The authors could test this by perturbing Bnl and Btl in the CZ (using Hmldelta-Gal4 or eater-Gal4 for plasmatocytes and lz-Gal4 for crystal cells) and asking whether this affects crystal cell or plasmatocyte differentiation cell autonomously.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now established a detailed expression pattern of <italic>bnl</italic> and Btl using markers for the different LG compartments (please see above our response to point 1). Following the reviewer’s recommendation, we have studied the consequence of reducing bnl levels in crystal cells and in differentiating hemocytes with the specific Lz-Gal4 and HmlGal4 drivers, respectively. A decrease in mature crystal cells (labelled by Hnt) and mature plasmatocytes (labelled by P1) is observed when Lz-gal4 and Hml-gal4, respectively, are used to express bnl-RNAi (please see below the data). This result reveals a cell-autonomous function of <italic>bnl</italic> in these cells. These phenotypes are opposite to those due to <italic>bnl</italic> or <italic>btl</italic> reduction in cardiac cells and MZ progenitors, respectively. Multiple and distinct functions depend on the cellular context. Since this manuscript is centered on the communication between the cardiac tube and MZ progenitors, for the sake of clarity and to avoid a dilution of the main message, we choose to not present these data in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) As noted by the authors it was previously shown that another FGF pathway in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, mediated by Heartless, is required for regulating hematopoiesis in the lymph gland (Dragojlovic-Munther et al., 2013). In this previous report overexpressing Btl in the progenitors had no effect (Figure S6B and K of that paper), this merits some discussion ad explanation from the authors.</p></disp-quote><p>In the paper Dragojlovic-Munther et al., 2013, no data were reported relative to the overexpression of the receptor breathless (Btl) in lymph gland progenitors. For Figure S5B of this paper, the authors performed the overexpression of the ligand <italic>bnl</italic> in progenitors. They measured the % of <italic>pxn</italic> labelled cells (<italic>pxn</italic> is a Cortical Zone marker) relative to all lymph gland cells and did not observe a significant difference compared to control. Unfortunately they did not analyze crystal cell or MZ progenitor indexes which might have been more sensitive reporters of the phenotype than <italic>pxn</italic> expression.</p><p>In our study, we used 2 independent UAS-Bnl transgenic lines (UASbnl described in Jarecki et al., 1999 and UAS-Bnl::GFP from Lin and Affolter, 2009) and the UAS-Btl<sup>CA</sup> (Pares and Ricardo, 2016). All 3 gave similar results (see Figure 2I; Figure 3G and Figure 2—figure supplement 2I).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Furthermore, since both Btl and Heartless signalling work through the transcription effector gene pointed we would expect cross talk between the two FGF pathways. This raises an important question of how the two pathways coordinated in the lymph gland. Some genetic interaction analysis between the components of the two arms of FGF signalling will be particularly useful. Specifically, determining if one of the FGF pathways is epistatic to the other, as well as establishing whether indeed both pathways converge on Pointed.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you to the reviewer for her/his suggestion. To investigate the hierarchy between Htl/FGF and Btl/FGF pathways in MZ progenitors we performed epistasis experiments. Our results suggest that there is no hierarchy between these pathways and that both are required simultaneously in MZ progenitors to control lymph gland hematopoiesis. These new data are given in (Figure 3N-P) and are discussed in the text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The Rab11 data in Figure 4B-B' is not as strong as it could be. First, the addition of a cell membrane marker and images of a better and higher resolution would allow greater clarity. Also, since Rab11 marks the recycling endosome, it would be more appropriate to look at other endocytic markers like Rab5 (early endosome marker) and/or Rab7 (late endosome) in addition to Rab11. Also, the co-expression data in the above cases with the Rabs is currently qualitative. It is appropriate in this sort of instance to include quantitative measurement of co-localization. The authors should consider including a staining showing endocytic localization (marked with the Rabs) of the Btl receptor (by in-situ or by antibody) in the prohemocytes. Also in Figure 4B-B' shows only two cells which have Rab11-bnl co-expression/co-localization whereas the field of interest seems to have many more cells in the area. Why don't all the prohemocytes show this co-expression? Finally, also in Figure 4 Bnl diffusion data in a-a' does not look convincing without a cellular marker to identify the hemocyte populations in the LG. Such a marker should be added.</p></disp-quote><p>In agreement with the reviewer’s comment we better defined bnl::GFP propagation from cardiac cells to MZ progenitors. We used the ubiRab11-cherryFP reporter and performed Rab7 immunostaining, which label recycling vesicles and late endosomes, respectively. Unfortunately we cannot look at Rab5 vesicles since the Rab5 reporter is tagged by GFP and therefore colocalisation with Bnl::GFP cannot be done. We also performed Col immunostaining to visualize core progenitors. These additional data are provided in Figure 4 A-A”. In addition, we looked at Bnl::GFP co-localisation with the Btl receptor (Figure 4 B-B”) and finally at Bnl::GFP diffusion from the CT to the CZ when the secretion of cardiac cells was impaired by <italic>sar1-RNAi</italic> expression. These data are provided in Figure 4 E-G. Altogether, they strongly support the proposition that Bnl::GFP secreted by cardiac cells is internalized in MZ progenitors likely through receptor-mediated endocytosis. This is discussed in the revised version of the manuscript.</p></body></sub-article></article>
