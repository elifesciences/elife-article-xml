the improvement in a scalable culture system that can precisely control the cellular status of hiPSCs is needed. Utilizing suspension culture without microcarriers or special materials allows for massive production, automation, cost-effectiveness, and safety assurance in industrialized regenerative medicine. Here, we found that hiPSCs cultured in suspension conditions with continuous agitation without microcarriers or extracellular matrix components were more prone to spontaneous differentiation than those cultured in conventional adherent conditions. Adding PKCβ and Wnt signaling pathway inhibitors in the suspension conditions suppressed the spontaneous differentiation of hiPSCs into ectoderm and mesendoderm, respectively. In these conditions, we successfully completed the culture processes of hiPSCs, including the generation of hiPSCs from peripheral blood mononuclear cells with the expansion of bulk population and single-cell sorted clones, long-term culture with robust self-renewal characteristics, single-cell cloning, direct cryopreservation from suspension culture and their successful recovery, and efficient mass production of a clinical-grade hiPSC line. Our results demonstrate that precise control of the cellular status in suspension culture conditions paves the way for their stable and automated clinical application.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>induced pluripotent stem cells</kwd><kwd>suspension culture</kwd><kwd>protein kinase C</kwd><kwd>WNT</kwd><kwd>bioreactor</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100009619</institution-id><institution>Japan Agency for Medical Research and Development</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>JP23bm1423010</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hayashi</surname><given-names>Yohei</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100009619</institution-id><institution>Japan Agency for Medical Research and Development</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>JP15bm0104001</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tsukahara</surname><given-names>Masayoshi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Kaneka Corporation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hayashi</surname><given-names>Yohei</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>CiRA Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hayashi</surname><given-names>Yohei</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Adding suppressors of spontaneous differentiation enables precise control of human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC) status in suspension culture conditions and leads to scalable and automated cell therapy using hiPSCs.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) are promising resources for various types of tissues in regenerative medicine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Takahashi et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Yu et al., 2007</xref>).

From screening of candidate molecules to suppress the spontaneous differentiation of hiPSCs, we have identified that inhibitors of PKCβ and Wnt signaling pathways suppress their differentiation into ectoderm and mesendoderm, respectively. In these conditions, we aimed to complete the processes of handling hiPSCs including the generation of hiPSCs with the expansion of bulk population and single-cell sorted clones, long-term culture with robust self-renewal characteristics, single-cell cloning, direct cryopreservation from suspension conditions and their successful recovery, and efficient mass production of a clinical-grade hiPSC line.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Suspension-cultured hiPSCs are prone to spontaneous differentiation</title><p>First, we investigated whether the quality of hiPSCs in suspension and adherent conditions is equivalent or not. hiPSCs (WTC11 line) were cultured in a conventional medium, StemFit AK02N (Ajinomoto, Tokyo, Japan), with continuous agitation (90 rpm) in non-adhesive cell culture plates for two passages (5 days during passages) and examined (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). In suspension conditions on days 5 and 10, hiPSCs formed round cell assemblies with slightly uneven surfaces (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Gene expression analysis with RT-qPCR revealed that the expression of differentiation markers, such as <italic>PAX6</italic> (ectoderm), <italic>SOX17</italic> (endoderm), and <italic>T</italic> (mesoderm), increased in suspension-cultured hiPSCs for 10 days (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). To monitor the spontaneous differentiation at single-cell resolution, we established knock-in reporter hiPSC lines of PAX6-tdTomato and SOX17-tdTomato to visualize and quantify the expression of PAX6 and SOX17 at the protein level, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A–H</xref>). tdTomato-positive cells were clearly observed in day 10 samples in suspension-cultured hiPSCs, whereas no fluorescent-positive cells were observed in adherent culture conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Flow cytometric analysis revealed that hiPSCs in the suspension conditions contained non-negligible percentages of PAX6-tdTomato-positive and SOX17-tdTomato-positive cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E and F</xref>). Western blot analysis revealed that protein expression of PAX6 and SOX17 in the suspension conditions was significantly increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A–D</xref>). The ratio of positive cells for a cell surface marker for undifferentiated hiPSCs, TRA1-60, was significantly lower in the suspension conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1E and F</xref>). These results suggest that a portion of hiPSCs are spontaneously differentiated in the suspension conditions when cultured in conventional media. To examine global changes in gene expression patterns between suspension and adherent conditions, whole-transcriptomic RNA-seq experiments with statistical tests were performed. Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) of all the genes and Gene Ontology Enrichment Analysis (GOEA) on differentially regulated genes revealed that, in the suspension conditions, many genes involved in differentiation toward various tissues and cell–cell adhesions were significantly upregulated. In contrast, genes involved in nucleotide metabolism, hypoxic responses, and ECM organization were downregulated significantly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G–J</xref>). These results suggest that hiPSCs in the suspension conditions are in the process of spontaneous differentiation into various cell lineages and are characterized by specific signatures of gene expression patterns.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) maintained under suspension conditions undergo spontaneous differentiation.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematics representing hiPSCs in suspension conditions.

As a candidate for the inducer of spontaneous differentiation, Wnt signaling induces the differentiation of human pluripotent stem cells into mesendoderm lineages exogenously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Nakanishi et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Sumi et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Tran et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Vijayaragavan et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Woll et al., 2008</xref>). Also, endogenous expression and activation of Wnt signaling in pluripotent stem cells are involved in the regulation of mesendoderm differentiation potentials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dziedzicka et al., 2021</xref>). Thus, we hypothesized that adding Wnt signaling inhibitors/activators may alter the spontaneous differentiation of hiPSCs into mesendoderm. Therefore, Wnt signaling inhibitors, IWP2 or IWR-1-endo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chen et al., 2009</xref>), or an activator, CHIR99021 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Ring et al., 2003</xref>), were added to the culture medium under suspension conditions. hiPSC aggregates treated with or without Wnt inhibitors showed similar round shapes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). In contrast, hiPSC aggregates treated with CHIR99021 formed heterogeneously shaped cyst-like structures, suggesting that these cells were largely differentiated. In samples treated with inhibitors, both T and SOX17 expression levels were significantly reduced to the level of adherent-cultured hiPSCs; however, there was only a small reduction in <italic>PAX6</italic> expression in the IWR-1-endo-treated condition and no reduction in the IWP2-treated condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Conversely, CHIR99021-treated cell aggregates showed markedly increased <italic>T</italic> and <italic>SOX17</italic> expression and decreased <italic>OCT4</italic> expression. Additionally, SOX17 protein expression was suppressed in hiPSCs treated with IWR-1-endo in suspension conditions, although its expression increased in hiPSCs in suspension conditions with conventional culture medium compared to adherent conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A and B</xref>).

Out of the candidate molecules tested, Gö6983, a pan-PKC inhibitor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gschwendt et al., 1996</xref>), and BMP4 showed strong inhibition effects on <italic>PAX6</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>).

To confirm these screening test results, the dose-dependent effect of Gö6983 or another PKCα, β, γ inhibitor GF109203X (GFX) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Toullec et al., 1991</xref>) on the inhibition of <italic>PAX6</italic> expression was observed at constant concentrations of IWR-1-endo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E and F</xref>).

Moreover, phosphorylated PKCβ protein expression was significantly elevated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B and C</xref>).

Compared to controls, hiPSCs (WTC11 line) cultured in suspension conditions treated with IWR-1-endo and LY333531 formed homogeneous, round, smooth-surfaced aggregates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). <italic>PAX6</italic> expression was strongly suppressed by the addition of LY333531 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Furthermore, after adding IWR-1-endo, the inhibitory effect of <italic>PAX6</italic> expression was further enhanced, and simultaneously, <italic>OCT4</italic> expression was restored to the same level as in the adherent-culture. PAX6 protein expression was also suppressed in hiPSCs treated with IWR-1-endo and LY333531 in suspension conditions while its expression increased in suspension conditions with conventional culture medium compared to adherent conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C and D</xref>). The ratio of TRA-1-60-positive cells was higher in suspension conditions supplemented with IWR-1-endo and LY333531 than in control conditions without these inhibitors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1E and F</xref>). These results indicate that the maintenance of suspension-cultured hiPSCs is specifically facilitated by the combination of PKCβ and Wnt signaling inhibition. To examine the reproducibility of the effect of the inhibition of PKCβ and Wnt signaling pathways on the maintenance of the self-renewal of hiPSCs in suspension conditions among various hiPSCs, we evaluated the expression of self-renewal and differentiation markers among five different hiPSC lines, 1231A3, 1383D6, 201B7, HiPS-NB1RGB, and WTC11, simultaneously. Compared to adherent conditions, hiPSCs cultured in suspension conditions without chemical treatment decreased the positive ratio of TRA-1-60/SSEA4 and OCT4 and increased the expression levels of differentiation markers, <italic>SOX17</italic>, <italic>T</italic>, and <italic>PAX6</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C–E</xref>). These results indicate that suspension conditions without chemical treatment are unstable to maintain self-renewal and contain spontaneously differentiated cells. The addition of PKCβ and Wnt signal inhibitors increased the positive ratio of TRA-1-60/SSEA4 and OCT4 and decreased the expression levels of <italic>SOX17</italic>, <italic>T</italic>, and <italic>PAX6</italic> to the comparable level of adherent conditions. Interestingly, the expression of KLF2 and KLF5, which were known as naïve pluripotency markers, was upregulated in the suspension conditions treated with PKCβ and Wnt signal inhibitors. We also examined whether the combination of PKCβ and Wnt signaling inhibition affects cell survival in suspension conditions. In this experiment, we used another PKC inhibitor, Staurosporine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Omura et al., 1977</xref>), which has a strong cytotoxic effect as a positive control of cell death in suspension conditions. The addition of IWR-1-endo and LY333531 for 10 days had no effects on the apoptosis while the addition of Staurosporine for 2 hours induced Annexin-V-positive apoptotic cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2A–D</xref>). These results indicate that the combination of PKCβ and Wnt signaling inhibition has no or little effects on the cell survival in suspension conditions. We next performed long-term culture for 10 passages in suspension conditions and compared hiPSC growth in the presence of LY333531 or Gö6983. When hiPSCs were seeded at 4 × 10<sup>5</sup> cells/well, the average cell number reached approximately 12-fold after 5 days under both conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A and B</xref>). After 10 passages, aggregates of hiPSCs cultured in the presence of LY333531 showed a uniform spherical shape, whereas aggregates cultured in the presence of Gö6983 were heterogeneously spherical (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). Notably, in LY333531-treated cells, OCT4-positive cell numbers were significantly higher than in Gö6983-treated samples, as determined by immunostaining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D and E</xref>). To evaluate whether hiPSCs cultured in suspension conditions with PKCβ and Wnt signaling inhibitors for 10 passages maintain pluripotency, we performed embryoid body (EB) formation assay. These EBs contained positive cells for TUJ1, SMA, and AFP as ectodermal, mesodermal, and endodermal marker, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). Copy number variation (CNV) array analysis showed that hiPSCs cultured long term in the presence of PKCβ and Wnt inhibitors retained their normal human karyotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>). These results indicate that, for long-term culture, the inhibition of Wnt signaling and PKCβ in suspension conditions is sufficient to maintain the self-renewal, pluripotency, and genomic integrity of hiPSCs. Thus, we used the combination of IWR-1-endo and LY333531 for the rest of this study. We further investigated whether the effects of PKCβ and Wnt inhibitors on suppressing hiPSCs spontaneous differentiation in suspension conditions are applicable to other culture media. First, morphologies and gene expression profiles of hiPSCs cultured in suspension conditions with another commercially available maintenance medium, StemScale (Thermo Fisher Scientific, MA), were examined (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>). An hiPSC line, WTC11, cultured in suspension conditions treated with IWR-1-endo and LY333531 formed homogeneously round and smooth-surfaced aggregates compared to controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>). The differentiation markers expression, which was elevated under suspension conditions, was suppressed by the simultaneous addition of PKCβ and Wnt signal inhibitors, as observed with StemFit medium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1C and D</xref>). Second, morphologies and gene expression profiles of hiPSCs, cultured in suspension conditions with another commercially available maintenance medium, mTeSR1 (STEMCELL Technologies, Vancouver, Canada), were examined in four different hiPSC lines (1231A3, 201B7, HiPS-NB1RGB, and WTC11) simultaneously (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2A</xref>). Compared to adherent culture conditions, hiPSCs cultured in suspension conditions without chemical treatment significantly decreased the positive ratio of TRA-1-60/SSEA4 and OCT4 and increased the expression levels of differentiation markers, <italic>SOX17</italic>, <italic>T</italic>, and <italic>PAX6</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2B–D</xref>). These results indicated that suspension conditions using mTeSR1 medium contain spontaneous differentiated cells. The addition of PKCβ and Wnt signal inhibitors increased the positive ratio of TRA-1-60/SSEA4 and OCT4 and decreased the expression levels of SOX17, T, and PAX6 to the comparable level of adherent conditions. Together, these results suggest that conventional suspension conditions contain spontaneous differentiating cells and that the addition of inhibitors of PKCβ and Wnt signaling pathways to conventional culture media generally suppresses spontaneous differentiation and maintains self-renewal.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>The inhibitors of Wnt and PKCβ efficiently maintain the self-renewal of human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) in suspension conditions.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Phase-contrast images of suspension-cultured hiPSCs on day 10 (two passages) in the presence of IWR-1-endo, LY333531, or both.

To test the feasibility of mass production under suspension conditions supplemented with PKCβ and Wnt signal inhibitors, we first performed suspension culture using a healthy donor-derived hiPSC line, 1383D6, in a 30 mL bioreactor with stirring conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Matsumoto et al., 2022</xref>) at different cell seeding densities and different stirring speeds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A</xref>). At 150 rpm of stirring speed, hiPSCs steadily proliferated at 0.5 × 10<sup>5</sup>–2 × 10<sup>5</sup> cells/mL of the cell seeding density, but cells hardly proliferated at 8 × 10<sup>5</sup> cells/mL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Since the number of total collected cells was the lowest at a seeding density of 0.5 × 10<sup>5</sup> cells/mL, the seeding density of 1 × 10<sup>5</sup>–2 × 10<sup>5</sup> cells/mL is considered suitable. Also, at the seeding density of 2 × 10<sup>5</sup> cells/mL, hiPSCs steadily proliferated at 50–150 rpm of the stirring speed, but not at 250 rpm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Then, we analyzed protein expression of PAX6 and SOX17 in these cells after three passages with these conditions at 50–150 rpm of stirring speed. The addition of PKCβ and Wnt inhibitors decreased the positive ratio of PAX6 and SOX17 in these reactor stirring speeds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1D</xref>). These results suggest that PKCβ and Wnt inhibitors suppressed spontaneous differentiation in bioreactor conditions at suitable stirring speeds.</p><p>Next, we examined that undifferentiated hiPSCs were efficiently maintained in these bioreactor conditions with five serial passages using two hiPSC lines, 1383D6 and 1231A3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2A</xref>). These cell lines showed higher cell density in the bioreactor at each passage after 3 days (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2B</xref>). Under these conditions, the concentration of glucose decreased daily (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2C</xref>), whereas that of L-lactic acid increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2D</xref>). These results indicate that the cell lines proliferated with active energy consumption. Further, RT-qPCR analysis showed no marked differences in the undifferentiated and differentiation markers expression between hiPSCs cultured in adhesion conditions and suspension conditions with PKCβ and Wnt inhibitors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2E and F</xref>). Flow cytometric analysis showed that more than 90% of these cells were positive for pluripotency marker proteins: NANOG, OCT4, and SOX2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2G</xref>). G-band analysis of suspension-cultured hiPSCs after five passages revealed normal karyotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2H</xref>). These results demonstrate that undifferentiated hiPSCs were efficiently maintained in the bioreactor using the culture medium supplemented with inhibitors of PKCβ and Wnt signaling pathways.</p><p>Then, we expanded hiPSCs in a large-scale culture system under perfusion conditions in the presence of IWR-1-endo and LY333531. In this experiment, a clinical-grade hiPSC line, Ff-l14s04, which is derived from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of a donor carrying homozygous alleles for major HLA loci (HLA-A, HLA-B, and HLA-DR), was used (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kitano et al., 2022</xref>). Large-scale hiPSCs preparation using a perfusion-culture system with 320 mL bioreactor having stirred wing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kropp et al., 2016</xref>) was performed in GMP-compliant, clinical-grade StemFit AK03N medium containing IWR-1-endo and LY333531 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). When the culture was started at 1 × 10<sup>5</sup> cells/mL in 320 mL medium scale, hiPSCs proliferated approximately tenfold after 3–4 days to produce ~300 stock vials (1 × 10<sup>6</sup> cells/vial). This large-scale culture was repeated three times (passages 1–3). Since the population doubling time (PDT) of this hiPSC line in adherent culture conditions is 21.8–32.9 hours measured at its production, the proliferation rate in this large-scale suspension culture is comparable to adherent culture conditions. Next, the frozen vials of this hiPSC line obtained at each passage in large-scale suspension culture conditions were characterized. After these vials were thawed and seeded in adherent-culture conditions, these cells formed typical hiPSC-like colonies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). These samples from suspension conditions showed similar or higher viability (&gt;90%) to that of adherent-culture-derived vials (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). When compared to adherent conditions, these samples from suspension conditions showed a similar or higher proliferation rate after thawing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). Flow cytometric analysis showed that over 90% of cells were positive for pluripotent cell markers expression: TRA-1-60, SSEA4, and OCT4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E and F</xref>). Further, G-band analysis revealed that hiPSCs retained their normal karyotype even after three passages under large-scale suspension conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G</xref>). When large-scale suspension-cultured hiPSCs were incubated in each germ layer-specific differentiation medium for 4–7 days, the expression of early differentiation markers for ectoderm (<italic>PAX6</italic> and <italic>SOX1</italic>), mesoderm (<italic>T</italic> and <italic>PDGFRA</italic>), and endoderm (<italic>SOX17</italic> and <italic>CXCR4</italic>) was significantly induced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6H</xref>). These cells were then directly differentiated into dopaminergic neural progenitors, cardiomyocytes, and hepatocytes to evaluate their differentiation capacity and propensity. There were no differences in the differentiation efficiency toward these lineages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6I–M</xref>). These results indicate that the characteristics and quality of clinical-grade hiPSCs cultured in large-scale suspension conditions in the presence of PKCβ and Wnt inhibitors are equivalent to those of hiPSCs maintained under adherent conditions.

After 36 days of culture, 59% double-positive cells for TRA-1-60 and SSEA4 were observed in control, whereas 78% were seen in the presence of IWR-1-endo and LY333531 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s1">Figure 9—figure supplement 1B and C</xref>). We performed cell sorting of TRA-1-60 and SSEA4 double-positive cells and further repeated five more passages in the absence or presence of IWR-1-endo and LY333531. Cell aggregates cultured in culture medium supplemented with IWR-1-endo and LY333531 showed uniform spherical structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s1">Figure 9—figure supplement 1D</xref>), and most of these cells were TRA-1-60 and SSEA4 double-positive (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s1">Figure 9—figure supplement 1E</xref>). In contrast, cell aggregates cultured without these inhibitors showed lumpy, heterogeneous shapes, and decreased undifferentiated population. Immunostaining of OCT4 on dissociated cell aggregates resulted in higher OCT4-positive cells in IWR-1-endo and LY333531-treated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s1">Figure 9—figure supplement 1F and G</xref>). We further performed single-cell sorting of TRA-1-60-positive cells from bulk-cultured populations at 10 passages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s1">Figure 9—figure supplement 1H and I</xref>). We selected three clones to be characterized further. These clones showed round spherical shapes in their aggregates and expression of OCT4, NANOG, and TRA-1-60 proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s1">Figure 9—figure supplement 1J–L</xref>). Pluripotency into three germ layers was confirmed in vitro with EB formation assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s1">Figure 9—figure supplement 1M</xref>) and teratoma formation analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s1">Figure 9—figure supplement 1N</xref>). These clones retained a normal karyotype even after a long-culture period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s1">Figure 9—figure supplement 1O</xref>). These results demonstrate that single-cell-derived hiPSC lines were successfully established using the transfection of episomal plasmid vectors in suspension conditions in the presence of PKCβ and Wnt signaling inhibitors.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In this study, we have developed a series of methods to generate and maintain hiPSCs in suspension conditions. First, we have identified compounds that suppress the spontaneous differentiation of hiPSCs in suspension conditions. Based on these findings, we have newly achieved a complete series of culture processes including hiPSC establishment, long-term culture, mass culture, single-cell cloning, and direct freeze and thaw. Our methods are validated in several conventional culture media and many hiPSC lines. Thus, our findings show that suspension conditions with Wnt and PKCβ inhibitors (IWRLY suspension conditions) can precisely control cell conditions and are comparable to conventional adhesion cultures regarding cellular function and proliferation. Many previous 3D culture methods intended for mass expansion used hydrogel-based encapsulation or microcarrier-based methods to provide scaffolds and biophysical modulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chan et al., 2020</xref>). These methods are useful in that they enable mass culture while maintaining scaffold dependence. However, the need for special materials and equipment and the labor and cost involved are concerns toward industrial mass culture of hiPSC-related products. On the other hand, our IWRLY suspension conditions do not require special materials such as hydrogels, microcarriers, or dialysis bags, and have the advantage that common bioreactors can be used. Furthermore, we have observed some differences in conventional media used for suspension-culture conditions in maintaining self-renewal characteristics, preventing spontaneous differentiation into specific lineages, and performing stability among different experimental times. Overcoming these heterogeneity caused by conventional media, the IWRLY suspension conditions robustly maintain hiPSC self-renewal and pluripotency. Therefore, this IWRLY suspension conditions for hiPSCs is advantageous in terms of mass culture, automation, safety assurance, and is expected to have novel industrial applications that could not be achieved by conventional methods.</p><p>HiPSCs have been generally considered to be scaffold-dependent and are cultured under adherent monolayer culture conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hayashi and Furue, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Xu et al., 2001</xref>). On the other hand, some studies reported that floating cultures without external ECM addition or scaffolds have been successfully performed on hiPSCs for their long-term and/or mass expansion (summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). However, dissociation into single cells and amplification from these single cells in suspension conditions have never been achieved. Thus, it remains arguable whether culturing human pluripotent stem cells without providing a scaffold is possible. In this study, we demonstrated that many existing hiPSCs quickly acclimatized to the IWRLY suspensionconditions and that they could be successfully cultured even under harsh conditions such as colony formation from single cells or direct freeze–thaw processes. These findings suggest that hiPSCs can be sufficiently cultured even without scaffolds or exogenous ECM proteins. However, as previous studies have shown, hiPSCs themselves secrete scaffold substances such as ECM proteins, which may affect the status of suspension conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kim et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>It is interesting to see whether and how the properties of hiPSCs cultured in IWRLY suspension conditions are altered from the adherent conditions. Our transcriptome results in comparison to adherent conditions show that gene expression associated with cell-to-cell attachment, including E-cadherin (CDH1), is more activated. This may be due to the status that these hiPSCs are more dependent on cell-to-cell adhesion where there is no exogenous cell-to-substrate attachment in the three-dimensional culture. Previous studies have shown that cell-to-cell adhesion by E-cadherin positively regulates the survival, proliferation, and self-renewal of human pluripotent stem cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aban et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Li et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Ohgushi et al., 2010</xref>). Furthermore, studies have shown that human pluripotent stem cells can be cultured using an artificial substrate consisting of recombinant E-cadherin protein alone without any ECM proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Nagaoka et al., 2010</xref>). Also, cell-to-cell adhesion through gap junctions regulates the survival and proliferation of human pluripotent stem cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Wong et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Wong et al., 2004</xref>). These findings raise the possibility that the cell-to-cell adhesion, such as E-cadherin and gap junctions, is compensatory activated and supports hiPSC self-renewal in situations where there are no exogenous ECM components and its downstream integrin and focal adhesion signals are not forcedly activated in suspension conditions. It will be interesting to elucidate these molecular mechanisms related to E-cadherin and gap junctions in the hiPSC survival and self-renewal in IWRLY suspension conditions in the future.</p><p>We have identified two compounds as factors that ameliorate the disadvantages of the suspension conditions of hiPSCs. Wnt signaling inhibitors suppressed spontaneous differentiation toward mesendoderm, PKCβ inhibitors suppressed spontaneous ectodermal differentiation, and the combination of these two inhibitors maintained the undifferentiated nature of hiPSCs with high efficiency in suspension conditions. As for Wnt activation in human pluripotent stem cells, previous studies reported some Wnt agonists were expressed in undifferentiated human pluripotent stem cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dziedzicka et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Jiang et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Konze et al., 2014</xref>). In suspension conditions, cell aggregation causes tight cell–cell interaction. The autocrine and paracrine effects of Wnt agonists in the cell aggregation may strongly affect neighbor cells to induce spontaneous differentiation into mesendodermal cells. Thus, the inhibition of Wnt signaling should be effective in suppressing the spontaneous differentiation into mesendodermal lineages in suspension conditions. Gö6983, a pan-PKC inhibitor, has been used to promote the self-renewal of mammalian PSCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dutta et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kinehara et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Rajendran et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Takashima et al., 2014</xref>); however, in these cases, the role of specific isoforms of PKC in PSC self-renewal and differentiation is not fully elucidated yet. Also, PKC signaling is involved in neural induction conserved in animals shown in sea urchin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Range et al., 2013</xref>), <italic>Xenopus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Otte et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Otte et al., 1989</xref>), and mouse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Stumpo et al., 1995</xref>). Our findings suggested the involvement of PKCβ in human neuroectodermal differentiation using hiPSCs. It will be interesting to elucidate the molecular mechanisms of how PKC signaling is involved in neuroectoderm differentiation in the future.</p><p>Interestingly, these combinations of chemical inhibitors against Wnt and PKC signaling pathways are also being used in the induction and maintenance of human naïve pluripotent stem cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bayerl et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bredenkamp et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Guo et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Khan et al., 2021</xref>). Previous studies suggested that cell state transition toward naïve state in hPSCs had beneficial effects in the suspension conditions of hiPSCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lipsitz et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Rohani et al., 2020</xref>). While we did not aim to drive hiPSCs to a naïve state by the use of these chemical inhibitors in suspension conditions, we found that naïve pluripotency marker genes were upregulated in the IWRLY suspension conditions consistently. The question of why the transition to the naïve PSCs type facilitates the culture adaptation to suspension conditions remains elusive; however, considering early development, the inner cell mass in blastocysts in the earlier stages that maintains pluripotency forms a three-dimensional morphology, whereas epiblasts, where the development is more proceeded, form a flattened epithelial morphology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Sheng, 2015</xref>). The same is true for pluripotent stem cells in mice, where naïve mouse embryonic stem cells derived from blastocysts form three-dimensional colonies, whereas epiblast stem cells derived from the later developmental stages form flattened epithelial colonies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brons et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Tesar et al., 2007</xref>). We previously showed that these differences in the morphology of mouse pluripotent stem cells could be regulated by the activation state of ECM and integrin signaling and that the situation where these signals are not active is suited to the naïve state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hayashi et al., 2007</xref>). The same characteristics may be applied to human pluripotent stem cells, although no direct results have yet been shown in human pluripotent stem cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hayashi and Furue, 2016</xref>). IWRLY suspension conditions may allow hiPSCs to adapt easily to form three-dimensional colony morphology by shifting to naïve state.</p><p>Last but not least, we successfully generated hiPSC lines from PBMCs in suspension conditions for the first time by adding the abovementioned compounds to the culture medium. Both transduction methods with SeVdp and episomal plasmid vectors enabled the establishment of hiPSCs under IWRLY suspension conditions. Clonal expansion of hiPSCs was also performed by single-cell sorting with flow cytometry, and the established hiPSCs were successfully characterized for their self-renewal, pluripotency, and genomic integrity. These results indicate that hiPSC lines generated in IWRLY suspension conditions have the same quality in terms of their pluripotency, self-renewal, and genomic integrity as those generated with conventional adherent conditions. This consistent process from establishing hiPSCs from somatic cells to their mass expansion with precise control of cellular status in suspension conditions may pave the way for their stable and automated clinical application toward autologous cell therapy of hiPSCs.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource"

Briefly, adherent- or suspension-cultured hiPSCs were dissociated with 0.5 mM EDTA solution in D-PBS or Accutase, respectively. Dissociated cells (0.5 or 1 × 10<sup>6</sup> cells) were collected and centrifuged at 200 × <italic>g</italic> for 3 minutes and resuspended in 500 or 1000 µL PBS containing 0.1% BSA and 0.5 mM EDTA, then incubated with or without anti-TRA-60 antibody or anti-SSEA4 antibody for 1 hour at 4°C under oblique light conditions. After washing with PBS, cells were resuspended in 500 µL D-PBS containing 0.1% BSA and 0.5 mM EDTA, and filtrated with 35 µm cell strainer (Cat#352235, FALCON, Thermo Fisher Scientific). For PAX6-TEZ and SOX17-TEZ hiPSC lines, adherent- or suspension-cultured hiPSCs were dissociated into single cells and collected cells were resuspended in 500 µL PBS containing 0.1% BSA and 0.5 mM EDTA. After passing through the 35 µm cell strainer, cells were analyzed for tdTomato. The primary and secondary antibodies used in this study are listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref>, respectively. Flow cytometry was performed with SH800 cell Sorter (SONY).</p></sec><sec id="s4-18"><title>RNA-seq</title><p>Total RNA was extracted using the FastGene RNA premium kit, and strand-specific library preparation was performed. The prepared library was sequenced using a NovaSeq6000 (Illumina, Inc, CA). Sequencing was performed in a 150 bp ×2 paired-end configuration with a data output of about 6 Gb per sample (~20 million paired reads). Library preparation and sequencing were performed in GENEWIZ (Azenta, MA). To identify differentially regulated genes, sequencing data was analyzed with a CLC Genomics Workbench (QIAGEN) and R package, edgeR (v3.30.3) in R language (v 4.1.0). An MA plot (log2 fold change versus mean average expression) comparing transcriptomes between suspension and adherent conditions from RNA-seq data. Transcripts with log2 fold change ≧ 2 or ≦ –2 (false discovery rate [FDR] &lt; 0.01) are highlighted with red and blue dots, respectively. The extracted genes were analyzed for Gene Ontology enrichment and biological pathways using the R package, clusterProfiler (v3.16.1). GSEA was also performed using clusterProfiler. An enrichment map was used to visualize the GSEA results with enrichment score (ES) and FDR values. The software used for the analysis is listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp5">Supplementary file 5</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s4-19"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Statistical analysis was performed using Student’s <italic>t</italic>-test, Dunnett’s test for multiple comparisons with a single control condition, and one-way ANOVA and Tukey’s tests for multiple comparisons with all the conditions. p-values &lt;0.05 were considered statistically significant. *, **, or *** in the graphs indicate p&lt;0.05, p&lt;0.01, or p&lt;0.001, respectively. No statistical methods were used to predetermine sample size. The experiments were not randomized and the investigators were not blinded to allocation during experiments and outcome assessment.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>Inventor of patents arising from this work (WO/2021/162090 and PCT/JP2020/005255)</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf2"><p>Was employed with KANEKA corporation during this study.

According to your comments, we have performed several experiments to optimize the bioreactor conditions in revised manuscripts. We tested several cell seeding densities and several stirring speeds with or without WNT/PKCβ inhibitors (Figure 6—figure supplement 1). We found that 1 - 2 x 105 cells/mL of the seeding densities and 50 - 150 rpm of the stirring speeds were applicable in the proliferation of these cells. Also, PKCβ and Wnt inhibitors suppressed spontaneous differentiation in bioreactor conditions regardless with stirring speeds. As for the impeller shape and reactor design, we just used commonly-used ABLE's bioreactor for 30 mL scale and Eppendorf's bioreactors for 320 mL scale, which had been designed and used for human pluripotent stem cell culture conditions in previous studies, respectively (Matsumoto et al., 2022 (doi: 10.3390/bioengineering9110613); Kropp et al., 2016 (doi: 10.5966/sctm.2015-0253)). We cited these previous studies in the Results and Materials and Methods section. We believe that these additional data and explanation are sufficient to satisfy your concerns on the optimization of bioreactor experiments.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>This study by Matsuo-Takasaki et al. reported the development of a novel suspension culture system for hiPSC maintenance using Wnt/PKC inhibitors.

The treatment of LY333531 and IWR-1-endo increased the expression of self-renewal marker genes/proteins and decreased the expression levels of SOX17, T, and PAX6 in these hiPSC lines in general. These results indicated that these chemical treatments in suspension culture were robust in general while addressing the observed variability among iPSC lines.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Additionally, there is a lack of information regarding the specific role of the two small molecules in these conditions.</p></disp-quote><p>In this revised manuscript, we have added data and discussion regarding the specific role of the two small molecules in these conditions in the Results and Discussion section. For using WNT signaling inhibitor, we hypothesized that adding Wnt signaling inhibitors may inhibit the spontaneous differentiation of hiPSCs into mesendoderm. Because exogenous Wnt signaling induces the differentiation of human pluripotent stem cells into mesendoderm lineages (Nakanishi <italic>et al</italic>, 2009; Sumi <italic>et al</italic>, 2008; Tran <italic>et al</italic>, 2009; Vijayaragavan <italic>et al</italic>, 2009; Woll <italic>et al</italic>, 2008). Also, endogenous expression and activation of Wnt signaling in pluripotent stem cells are involved in the regulation of mesendoderm differentiation potentials (Dziedzicka <italic>et al</italic>, 2021). For using PKC inhibitors, &quot;To identify molecules with inhibitory activity on neuroectodermal differentiation, hiPSCs were treated with candidate molecules in suspension conditions. We selected these candidate molecules based on previous studies related to signaling pathways or epigenetic regulations in neuroectodermal development (reviewed in GiacomanLozano <italic>et al</italic>, 2022; Imaizumi &amp; Okano, 2021; Sasai <italic>et al</italic>, 2021; Stern, 2024) or in pluripotency safeguards (reviewed in Hackett &amp; Surani, 2014; Li &amp; Belmonte, 2017; Takahashi &amp; Yamanaka, 2016; Yagi <italic>et al</italic>, 2017).&quot;</p><p>We also found that the expression of naïve pluripotency markers, <italic>KLF2</italic>, <italic>KLF4</italic>, <italic>KLF5</italic>, and <italic>DPPA3</italic>, were up-regulated in the suspension conditions treated with LY333531 and IWR-1-endo while the expression of <italic>OCT4</italic> and <italic>NANOG</italic> was at the same levels (Figure 5—figure supplement 2). Combined with RT-qPCR analysis data on 5 different hiPSC lines (Figure 3E), these results suggest that IWRLY conditions may drive hiPSCs in suspension conditions to shift toward naïve pluripotent states.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors have not attempted to elucidate the underlying mechanism other than RNA expression analysis.</p></disp-quote><p>Regarding the underlying mechanisms, we have added results and discussion in the revised manuscript. For Wnt activation in human pluripotent stem cells, several studies reported some WNT agonists were expressed in undifferentiated human pluripotent stem cells (Dziedzicka <italic>et al.</italic>, 2021; Jiang <italic>et al</italic>, 2013; Konze <italic>et al</italic>, 2014). In suspension culture, cell aggregation causes tight cell-cell interaction. The paracrine effect of WNT agonists in the cell aggregation may strongly affect neighbor cells to induce spontaneous differentiation into mesendodermal cells. Thus, we think that the inhibition of WNT signaling is effective to suppress the spontaneous differentiation into mesendodermal lineages in suspension culture.</p><p>For PKC beta activation in human pluripotent stem cells, we have shown that phosphorylated PKC beta protein expression is up-regulated in suspension culture than in adherent culture with western blotting (Figure 3 - figure supplement 1). The treatment of PKCβ inhibitor is effective to suppress spontaneous differentiation into neuroectodermal lineages. For future perspectives, it is interesting to examine (1) how and why PKCβ is activated (or phosphorylated), especially in suspension culture conditions, and (2) how and why PKCβ inhibition can suppress the neuroectodermal differentiation. Conversely, it is also interesting to examine how and why PKCβ activation is related to neuroectodermal differentiation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>For these reasons some aspects of the manuscript need to be extended:</p><p>(1) It is crucial for authors to specify the culture media used for suspension cultures. In the Materials and Methods section, the authors mentioned that cells in suspension were cultured in either StemFit AK02N medium, 415 StemFit AK03N (Cat# AK03N, Ajinomoto, Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan), or StemScale PSC416 suspension medium (A4965001, Thermo Fisher Scientific, MA, USA). The authors should clarify in the text which medium was used for suspension cultures and whether they observed any differences among these media.</p></disp-quote><p>Sorry for this confusion. Basically in this study, we use StemFit AK02N medium (Figure 1-5, 7-9). For bioreactor experiments (Figure 6), we use StemFit AK03N medium, which is free of human and animalderived components and GMP grade. To confirm the effect of IWRLY chemical treatment, we use StemScale suspension medium (Figure 4 - figure supplement 1) and mTeSR1 medium (Figure 4 - figure supplement 2 and Figure 8 - figure supplement 1). In the revised manuscript we clarified which medium was used for suspension cultures in the Results and Materials and Methods section.</p><p>Although we have not compared directly among these media in suspension culture (, which is primarily out of the focus of this study), we have observed some differences in maintaining self-renewal characteristics, preventing spontaneous differentiation (including tendencies to differentiate into specific lineages), stability or variation among different experimental times in suspension culture conditions.

We have added more results on the simultaneous comparison using StemFit AK02N medium in 5 different hiPSC lines (Figure 3 C-E) and using mTeSR1 medium in 4 different hiPSC lines (Figure 4 - figure supplement 2). From both results, we have shown that the treatment of LY333531 and IWR-1-endo was beneficial in maintaining the self-renewal of hiPSCs while suppressing spontaneous differentiation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) Single-cell sorting can be confusing.

We have improved the clarity of the schematics (Figure 7A). Also, we added the data on the cloning efficiency, which are compared with adherent cultures (Figure 7B). The cloning efficiency of adherent cultures was around 30%. While the cloning efficiency of suspension cultures without any chemical treatment was less than 10%, the IWR-1-endo treatment in the suspension cultures increased the efficiency was more than 20%. However, the treatment of LY333531 decreased the efficiency. These results indicated that the IWR-1-endo treatment is beneficial in single-cell cloning in suspension culture.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) The authors have not addressed the naïve pluripotent state in their suspension cultures, even though PKC inhibition has been shown to drive cells toward this state.

Interestingly, the expression of <italic>KLF2, KLF4, KLF5, and DPPA3</italic> is significantly up-regulated in IWRLY conditions.

More optimization data is required for the suspension culture to truly show that the differentiation they are observing is not an artifact of a non-optimized protocol.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your thoughtful comments. Following your comments, we have performed several experiments to optimize the bioreactor conditions in revised manuscripts. We tested several cell seeding densities and several stirring speeds with or without WNT/PKCβ inhibitors (Figure 6—figure supplement 1). From these optimization experiments, we found that 1 - 2 x 105 cells/mL of the seeding densities and 50 - 150 rpm of the stirring speeds were applicable in the proliferation of these cells. Also, PKCβ and Wnt inhibitors suppressed spontaneous differentiation in bioreactor conditions regardless with acceptable stirring speeds. As for the impeller shape and reactor design, we just used commonly-used ABLE's bioreactor for 30 mL scale and Eppendorf's bioreactors for 320 mL scale, which had been designed and used for human pluripotent stem cell culture conditions in previous studies, respectively Matsumoto et al., 2022 (doi: 10.3390/bioengineering9110613); Kropp et al., 2016 (doi:10.5966/sctm.2015-0253).

Together, the treatment of LY333531 and IWR-1-endo in these media reversed the decreased expression of these undifferentiated markers and suppressed the increased expression of differentiation markers in suspension culture conditions.

However, since the hiPSCs cultured in suspension culture conditions without IWR1+LY quickly lost their self-renewal ability, these frozen cells could not be recovered in these conditions nor counted.

The size of hiPSC aggregates is critical in maintaining self-renewal in our method as previous studies showed. Stirring speed is a key to make the proper size of hiPSC aggregates in suspension culture. Also, the culture period between passages is another key not to exceed the proper size of hiPSC aggregates. Thus, we keep stirring speed at 90 rpm (135 rpm for bioreactor conditions) basically and passaging every 3 - 5 days in suspension culture conditions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(16) Several previous studies have described the development of hiPSC suspension culture system using hydrogel encapsulation to provide biophysical modulation (reviewed in PMID: 32117992). In comparison, it seems that the IWR1+LY suspension system described here does not require ECM addition which further simplifies the culture system for iPSC. It would be good to add more discussion on this topic in the manuscript, such as the potential role of the E-cadherin in mediating this effect - as RNAseq results indicated that CDH1 was upregulated in the IWR1+LY condition.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this valuable suggestion. We have added more discussion on this topic in the Discussion section as below.</p><p>&quot;Thus, our findings show that suspension culture conditions with Wnt and PKCβ inhibitors (IWRLY suspension conditions) can precisely control cell conditions and are comparable to conventional adhesion cultures regarding cellular function and proliferation. Many previous 3D culture methods intended for mass expansion used hydrogel-based encapsulation or microcarrier-based methods to provide scaffolds and biophysical modulation (Chan <italic>et al</italic>, 2020). These methods are useful in that they enable mass culture while maintaining scaffold dependence. However, the need for special materials and equipment and the labor and cost involved are concerns toward industrial mass culture. On the other hand, our IWRLY suspension conditions do not require special materials such as hydrogels, microcarriers, or dialysis bags, and have the advantage that common bioreactors can be used. &quot;</p><p>&quot;On the other hand, it is interesting to see whether and how the properties of hiPSCs cultured in IWRLY suspension culture conditions are altered from the adherent conditions. Our transcriptome results in comparison to adherent conditions show that gene expression associated with cell-to-cell attachment, including E-cadherin (CDH1), is more activated. This may be due to the status that these hiPSCs are more dependent on cell-to-cell adhesion where there is no exogenous cell-to-substrate attachment in the three-dimensional culture. Previous studies have shown that cell-to-cell adhesion by E-cadherin positively regulates the survival, proliferation, and self-renewal of human pluripotent stem cells (Aban <italic>et al</italic>, 2021; Li <italic>et al</italic>, 2012; Ohgushi <italic>et al</italic>, 2010). Furthermore, studies have shown that human pluripotent stem cells can be cultured using an artificial substrate consisting of recombinant E-cadherin protein alone without any ECM proteins (Nagaoka <italic>et al</italic>, 2010). Also, cell-to-cell adhesion through gap junctions regulates the survival and proliferation of human pluripotent stem cells (Wong <italic>et al</italic>, 2006; Wong <italic>et al</italic>, 2004). These findings raise the possibility that the cell-to-cell adhesion, such as E-cadherin and gap junctions, are compensatory activated and support hiPSC self-renewal in situations where there are no exogenous ECM components and its downstream integrin and focal adhesion signals are not forcedly activated in suspension culture conditions. It will be interesting to elucidate these molecular mechanisms related to E-cadherin in the hiPSC survival and self-renewal in IWRLY suspension conditions in the future.&quot;</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>(1) I am a bit confused about the passage of adherent cultures.

In short, we found that the suppression of PAX6 expression in hiPSCs cultured in suspension conditions was observed with many PKC inhibitors, all of which possessed PKCβ inhibition activity (Figure 2—figure supplement 2B-D). Also, elevated expression of PKCβ in suspension-cultured hiPSCs could affect the spontaneous differentiation (Figure 3—figure supplement 1A-C). To further explore the possibility that the inhibition of PKCβ is critical for the maintenance of self-renewal of hiPSCs in the suspension culture, we evaluated the effect of LY333531, a PKCβ specific inhibitor. The maintenance of suspension-cultured hiPSCs is specifically facilitated by the combination of PKCβ and Wnt signaling inhibition (Figure 3A and B; Figure 2—figure supplement 1). Last, we performed longterm culture for 10 passages in suspension conditions and compared hiPSC growth in the presence of LY333531 or Go6983. LY333531 was superior in the proliferation rate and maintaining OCT4 protein expression in the long-term culture (Figure 4).

In this experiment, we used another PKC inhibitor, Staurosporine (Omura <italic>et al</italic>, 1977), which has a strong cytotoxic effect as a positive control of cell death in suspension conditions. The addition of IWR-1-endo and LY333531 for 10 days had no effects on the apoptosis while the addition of Staurosporine for 2 hours induced Annexin-V-positive apoptotic cells (Figure 3—figure supplement 2).

We intended that these differences should be reflected in the degree of the expression from these reprogramming vectors. The expression of reprogramming factors from these vectors should suppress the spontaneous differentiation in reprogramming cells. Sendai viral vectors should last longer than episomal plasmid vectors. Thus, we thought that adding these chemical inhibitors for episomal plasmid vector conditions from the early phase of reprogramming and for Sendai viral vector conditions from the late phase of reprogramming. For future perspectives, we might further need to optimize the timing of adding these molecules.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(10) The protocol for three germ layer differentiation using a specific differentiation medium requires further elaboration.
