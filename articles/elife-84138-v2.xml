DNA topology. In higher eukaryotes, meiotic chromosome function, and therefore fertility, requires cohesin complexes containing meiosis-specific kleisin subunits: REC8 and RAD21L in mammals and REC-8 and COH-3/4 in <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>. How these complexes perform the multiple functions of cohesin during meiosis and whether this involves different modes of DNA binding or dynamic association with chromosomes is poorly understood. Combining time-resolved methods of protein removal with live imaging and exploiting the temporospatial organisation of the <italic>C. elegans</italic> germline, we show that REC-8 complexes provide sister chromatid cohesion (SCC) and DNA repair, while COH-3/4 complexes control higher-order chromosome structure. High-abundance COH-3/4 complexes associate dynamically with individual chromatids in a manner dependent on cohesin loading (SCC-2) and removal (WAPL-1) factors. In contrast, low-abundance REC-8 complexes associate stably with chromosomes, tethering sister chromatids from S-phase until the meiotic divisions. Our results reveal that kleisin identity determines the function of meiotic cohesin by controlling the mode and regulation of cohesin–DNA association, and are consistent with a model in which SCC and DNA looping are performed by variant cohesin complexes that coexist on chromosomes.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>meiosis</kwd><kwd>cohesin</kwd><kwd>sister chromatid cohesion</kwd><kwd>WAPL</kwd><kwd>SCC-2</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>C. elegans</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000265</institution-id><institution>Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MC-A652-5PY60</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Martinez-Perez</surname><given-names>Enrique</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004410</institution-id><institution>European Molecular Biology Organization</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Postdoctoral Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Castellano-Pozo</surname><given-names>Maikel</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100008052</institution-id><institution>Fundacion Alfonso Martin Escudero</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Postdoctoral Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Castellano-Pozo</surname><given-names>Maikel</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004410</institution-id><institution>European Molecular Biology Organization</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Scientific exchange grant</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lopez-Jimenez</surname><given-names>Pablo</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004593</institution-id><institution>Universidad Autonoma de Madrid</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Page</surname><given-names>Jesus</given-names></name><name><surname>Lopez-Jimenez</surname><given-names>Pablo</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Meiosis-specific cohesin complexes differing in their kleisin subunit display different chromosome binding dynamics and perform specialised functions in sister chromatid cohesion, chromosome axis organisation, and double-strand break repair.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Cohesin belongs to a family of structural maintenance of chromosomes (SMCs) protein complexes that are essential components of mitotic and meiotic chromosomes due to their ability to modify the topology of DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Yatskevich et al., 2019</xref>). In somatic cells, cohesin ensures correct chromosome segregation by providing sister chromatid cohesion (SCC) between S-phase and the onset of anaphase, ensures genome stability through its role in DNA damage repair, and regulates gene expression by controlling genome folding through DNA looping. In addition, during meiosis, cohesin orchestrates the formation of proteinaceous axial elements that promote pairing and recombination between homologous chromosomes and facilitates the two-step release of SCC during the consecutive meiotic divisions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Klein et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Grey and de Massy, 2021</xref>). As inter-homologue recombination and the step-wise release of SCC are prerequisites for the formation of euploid gametes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Petronczki et al., 2003</xref>), the correct function of meiotic cohesin is essential for fertility.</p><p>The core of cohesin consists of a ring-shaped complex formed by two SMC proteins (Smc1 and Smc3) and a kleisin subunit that bridges the ATPase heads of Smc1 and Smc3. A family of HAWK (Heat repeat proteins Associated With Kleisin) proteins are recruited by the kleisin to control the loading, removal, and activity of cohesin on DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Wells et al., 2017</xref>). These include Scc3, Pds5, and the cohesin loader Scc2, which is required for the association of cohesin with mitotic and meiotic chromosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lightfoot et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Ciosk et al., 2000</xref>). Pds5 and Scc3 in turn interact with Wapl, a factor that promotes removal of cohesin throughout the cell cycle in a manner that allows reloading of removed complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kueng et al., 2006</xref>). Cleavage of the kleisin subunit by separase at anaphase onset during the mitotic and meiotic divisions triggers irreversible cohesin removal and release of SCC to promote chromosome segregation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Uhlmann et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Buonomo et al., 2000</xref>). Thus, the kleisin subunit plays a key role in controlling cohesin’s action on DNA.</p><p>An essential aspect of meiotic chromosome morphogenesis is the loading of cohesin complexes in which the mitotic kleisin Scc1 is replaced by the meiosis-specific kleisin Rec8 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Klein et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Watanabe and Nurse, 1999</xref>). Substitution of Rec8 by Scc1 during yeast meiosis results in severe defects during meiotic prophase and in premature loss of SCC during the first meiotic division (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Brar et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Tóth et al., 2000</xref>), evidencing that Rec8 cohesin is functionally different from Scc1 cohesin. Higher eukaryotes express additional meiosis-specific kleisins beyond REC8, including RAD21L in mammals and the highly identical and functionally redundant COH-3 and COH-4 in <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>, which could act as functional counterparts of mammalian RAD21L (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Severson et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gutiérrez-Caballero et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lee and Hirano, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Ishiguro et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Severson and Meyer, 2014</xref>). How complexes differing in their kleisin subunit perform the multiple roles of meiotic cohesin remains poorly understood. Moreover, the dynamic association of cohesin with chromosomes is key for some of cohesin’s functions in somatic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Tedeschi et al., 2013</xref>), but whether meiotic cohesin associates dynamically with chromosomes is not known. In this study, we exploit the experimental advantages of the <italic>C. elegans</italic> germline to investigate how REC-8 and COH-3/4 complexes contribute to different aspects of meiotic cohesin function and whether this involves dynamic association of these complexes with meiotic prophase chromosomes.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results|discussion"><title>Results and discussion</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Dynamically bound COH-3/4 complexes are the main organisers of axial elements</title><p>We first set up to determine the relative abundance of the three meiotic kleisins (REC-8, COH-3, and COH-4) on the axial elements of three-dimensionally intact pachytene nuclei. The endogenous <italic>rec-8</italic>, <italic>coh-3</italic>, and <italic>coh-4</italic> loci were individually tagged with GFP by CRISPR to generate three strains homozygous for GFP-tagged versions of each of the meiotic kleisins. GFP tagging of meiotic kleisins did not affect protein functionality as strains homozygous for <italic>rec-8::GFP,</italic> or for both <italic>coh-3::GFP</italic> and <italic>coh-4::GFP</italic> showed normal chiasma formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). To quantify the signal intensity of meiotic kleisins in pachytene nuclei, germlines were dissected, stained with anti-GFP antibodies, and imaged under the same exposure conditions. Half-nucleus sum projections (sums pixel values of each XY coordinate in the Z series) were made to prevent overlap between axial elements from different chromosomes and to capture all signal associated with individual axial elements. This was followed by quantification of the fluorescent signal at the axis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). This demonstrated that COH-3 is the most abundant kleisin on pachytene axial elements, which contain similar amounts of COH-4 and REC-8 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). The ratio of COH-3/4 to REC-8 cohesin is 3.5, consistent with the observation that COH-3/4 cohesin plays a more prominent role than REC-8 cohesin in axis integrity of pachytene nuclei (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Castellano-Pozo et al., 2020</xref>) and with previous estimations of REC-8 and COH-3/4 abundance on spread pachytene nuclei (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Woglar et al., 2020</xref>). To explore the contribution of REC-8 and COH-3/4 cohesin to the organisation of axial elements, we first used structural illumination microscopy (SIM) to image SMC-1::GFP (a cohesin SMC subunit common to all types of cohesin in worms) in germlines of controls, <italic>rec-8</italic> single, and <italic>coh-3 coh-4</italic> double mutants. Continuous axial elements labelled by SMC-1::GFP were observed in wild-type controls and <italic>rec-8</italic> mutants, while SMC-1::GFP signals appeared as discontinuous weak signals in pachytene nuclei of <italic>coh-3 coh-4</italic> double mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), in agreement with previous observations using SMC-3 antibodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Severson and Meyer, 2014</xref>). Next, we performed a quantitative analysis of the SMC-1::GFP signal in wild-type controls and kleisin mutants. Given the lack of continuous axial elements in <italic>coh-3 coh-4</italic> double mutants, we used whole-nucleus mean intensity instead of sum intensity at axial elements to quantify SMC-1::GFP signal in pachytene nuclei (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). SMC-1::GFP signal intensity was similar in wild-type controls and <italic>rec-8</italic> mutants, while <italic>coh-3 coh-4</italic> double mutants displayed a clear reduction in signal intensity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>), confirming that in pachytene nuclei most SMC-1 is associated with COH-3/4 cohesin complexes. The large differences in the abundance of REC-8 and COH-3/4 complexes in axial elements of pachytene nuclei can explain the discontinuous appearance of HORMAD proteins and synaptonemal complex components in <italic>coh-3 coh-4</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Severson et al., 2009</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Thus, by ensuring the integrity of axial elements, COH-3/4 complexes are key regulators of higher-order chromosome organisation during meiotic prophase.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Highly abundant COH-3/4 complexes promote axis integrity and associate dynamically with pachytene chromosomes.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Projections of diakinesis oocytes stained with DAPI and anti-GFP antibodies to visualise COH-3::GFP COH-4::GFP (top panel) or REC-8::GFP (bottom panel).

To further confirm these observations, we also performed high-resolution FRAP experiments (see ‘Methods’) in which we bleached a larger area spanning more than one nucleus and acquired images at only three times points (to minimise bleaching caused by acquisition) in pachytene nuclei from transgenic strains expressing fully functional fluorescently tagged versions of REC-8 and COH-3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Castellano-Pozo et al., 2020</xref>). Consistent with the full time-course experiment shown above, high-resolution FRAP demonstrated clear reloading of COH-3::mCherry, but not REC-8::GFP to axial elements of pachytene nuclei 10 min after photobleaching (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G and H</xref>). Thus, in contrast with REC-8 cohesin, COH-3/4 complexes associate dynamically with pachytene axial elements. In mammalian somatic cells, the creation of a stable pool of cohesin requires passage through S-phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gerlich et al., 2006</xref>) and in worms only REC-8 complexes associate with chromosomes during meiotic S-phase, while COH-3/4 load post S-phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Severson and Meyer, 2014</xref>). Therefore, the different loading time of REC-8 and COH-3/4 cohesin may be a determinant of the dynamics of these complexes. As RAD21L complexes also associate post S-phase during mouse meiosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Ishiguro et al., 2014</xref>), our results suggest that, similar to COH-3/4, RAD21L may also associate dynamically with pachytene chromosomes. Elucidating the dynamics of REC8 and RAD21L during mammalian meiosis remains an important question.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>WAPL-1 and SCC-2 promote the dynamic association of COH-3/4 cohesin with pachytene chromosomes</title><p>The dynamic association of COH-3/4 cohesin with pachytene axial elements led us to test whether factors that promote loading and removal of cohesin during the mitotic cell cycle also control COH-3/4 dynamics. In mammalian somatic cells, WAPL is required to maintain a pool of cohesin that associates dynamically with chromosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Tedeschi et al., 2013</xref>), and we have previously shown that in the absence of WAPL-1 the levels of axis-associated COH-3/4 are increased (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Crawley et al., 2016</xref>), suggesting that WAPL-1 may control the dynamic association of COH-3/4 complexes. To determine whether this was the case, we performed FRAP in <italic>wapl-1</italic> mutant worms. While the dynamics of REC-8::GFP were similar in the presence and absence of WAPL-1, showing almost no increase of post-photobleaching fluorescence intensity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>), in the case of COH-3::GFP and COH-4::GFP the increase in post-photobleaching intensity was largely lost in the absence of WAPL-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Therefore, WAPL-1 is required to ensure the dynamic association of COH-3/4 cohesin with axial elements in pachytene nuclei. WAPL also induces cohesin removal during late meiotic prophase in yeast and plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Challa et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">De et al., 2014</xref>), but whether this also occurs at earlier meiotic stages is not currently understood. Removal of WAPL in mouse oocytes at the end of meiotic prophase results in increased binding of SCC1 cohesin, but not REC8 cohesin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Silva et al., 2020</xref>), suggesting that REC8 cohesin is also largely refractory to WAPL-mediated removal during mammalian meiosis. Thus, the establishment of a population of cohesin that is refractory to the removal activity of WAPL may be a conserved feature of the meiotic programme.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>WAPL-1 and SCC-2 control the dynamic association of COH-3/4, but not REC-8, complexes with pachytene chromosomes.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) analysis of REC-8::GFP and COH-3::GFP COH-4::GFP in pachytene nuclei of WT and <italic>wapl-1</italic> mutants.

We first verified that SCC-2 is indeed required for the initial loading of COH-3/4 cohesin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>) as previous studies only assessed this indirectly by monitoring SMC-1 loading (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lightfoot et al., 2011</xref>). As auxin-mediated protein degradation allows cohesin depletion from pachytene nuclei (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Castellano-Pozo et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Zhang et al., 2015</xref>), we tagged the endogenous <italic>scc-2</italic> locus with GFP and AID tags at its C-terminus using CRISPR and crossed this strain to worms expressing TIR1 (required for auxin-mediated degradation). Homozygous <italic>scc-2::AID::GFP TIR1</italic> worms displayed normal chiasma formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>), confirming SCC-2 functionality. We reasoned that if SCC-2 promotes reloading of COH-3/4 complexes that are removed by WAPL-1 (see below), then, depletion of SCC-2 following normal cohesin loading during early meiosis should induce a decrease of COH-3/4 cohesin in pachytene nuclei. As nuclei take about 36 hr to progress from meiotic S-phase to late pachytene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jaramillo-Lambert et al., 2007</xref>), treating <italic>scc-2::AID::GFP</italic> homozygous worms with auxin for 8–14 hr should result in germlines containing mid and late pachytene nuclei that underwent meiotic S-phase in the presence of SCC-2 plus a population of early prophase nuclei that lacked SCC-2 from the onset of meiosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). We confirmed that auxin treatment for 8 and 14 hr induced efficient depletion of SCC-2::AID::GFP from meiotic nuclei (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Staining of auxin-treated germlines with anti-COH-3/4 antibodies showed that SCC-2 depletion for 8 hr induced a reduction of 35% of COH-3/4 signal intensity (quantified as whole-nucleus mean intensity) in mid pachytene nuclei that underwent meiotic S-phase before the start of auxin treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D</xref>). COH-3/4 signal intensity in mid pachytene nuclei was further reduced to 48% of untreated controls following 14 hr of auxin treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D</xref>). In contrast, SCC-2 depletion resulted in only a moderate decrease (9%) of REC-8 signal intensity in mid pachytene nuclei after 14 hr of auxin treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). As expected, SCC-2 depletion did eliminate REC-8 staining from axial elements of early prophase nuclei that underwent meiotic S-phase following auxin exposure, resulting in germlines containing REC-8-negative nuclei in early prophase followed by mid and late pachytene nuclei displaying strong REC-8 signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1E</xref>). These findings show that SCC-2 is required for maintaining the levels of chromosome-bound COH-3/4, but not REC-8, cohesin in pachytene nuclei.</p><p>A possible explanation for our findings above is that the cohesin-releasing activity of WAPL-1 creates a pool of soluble COH-3/4 that is then loaded in an SCC-2-dependent manner onto axial elements of pachytene nuclei. We tested this hypothesis by inducing auxin-mediated removal of SCC-2 from pachytene nuclei of worms lacking WAPL-1 (<italic>wapl-1 RNAi</italic>), reasoning that in the absence of WAPL-1’s removal activity the loading activity of SCC-2 may not be required to maintain COH-3/4 at pachytene axial elements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). As expected, <italic>wapl-1</italic> RNAi caused an increase in COH-3/4 levels, while auxin-mediated SCC-2 removal from pachytene nuclei of control worms (empty RNAi) caused reduced levels of COH-3/4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). When SCC-2 was depleted from pachytene nuclei of <italic>wapl-1</italic> RNAi worms, COH-3/4 levels were not reduced compared to untreated (empty RNAi, no auxin) worms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>), consistent with SCC-2 and WAPL-1 having antagonistic loading and unloading activities in pachytene nuclei. Interestingly, SCC-2 depletion from pachytene nuclei of <italic>wapl-1</italic> RNAi worms resulted in levels of COH-3/4 that were lower than those seen in nuclei from worms lacking just WAPL-1 (<italic>wapl-1</italic> RNAi, no auxin) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). This suggests that that in addition to promoting loading of COH-3/4 complexes removed by WAPL-1, SCC-2 may also act to prevent WAPL-1-independent removal of COH-3/4 complexes. Precedents for such mechanism have been reported in yeast, where Scc2 prevents removal of cohesin by a Wapl-independent mechanism during the G1 phase of the mitotic cell cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Srinivasan et al., 2019</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>REC-8 complexes provide sister chromatid cohesion (SCC).</title><p>(<bold>A–D</bold>) Diakinesis oocytes of indicated genotypes stained with DAPI and anti-GFP (REC-8) or anti-mCherry (COH-3) antibodies from untreated controls (-TEV) and 3.5 hr post TEV-mediated kleisin removal.

Similar to worms, mouse NIPBL (SCC2) also localises to axial elements of pachytene nuclei (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kuleszewicz et al., 2013</xref>), suggesting that cohesin turnover during pachytene, presumably of non-cohesive RAD21L complexes, may be a conserved feature of meiosis. This possibility is further supported by observations in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, where the C(2)M kleisin, which does not provide SCC, is incorporated into axial elements during pachytene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gyuricza et al., 2016</xref>). The localisation of SCC-2/NIPBL to pachytene axial elements may also indicate that active loop extrusion takes place at this stage as Scc2 is required for activating cohesin’s ATPase activity and loop extrusion in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Davidson et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Petela et al., 2018</xref>), as well as for cohesin-mediated loop formation in mammalian cells during G2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Mitter et al., 2020</xref>).

However, this possibility is largely inferred from observations in mutants in which only REC-8 or COH-3/4 cohesin is present and therefore in which chromosome morphogenesis was partially impaired. Moreover, an involvement of COH-3/4 cohesin in SCC has also been proposed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Severson and Meyer, 2014</xref>) and in the absence of both WAPL-1 and proteins required for crossover formation COH-3/4 appear to mediate inter-sister attachments in diakinesis oocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Crawley et al., 2016</xref>). A direct assessment of the contribution of REC-8 and COH-3/4 cohesin to SCC under normal conditions requires the ability to specifically remove these complexes in a temporally resolved manner after normal chromosome morphogenesis. For example, in mouse oocytes arrested at metaphase I, TEV-mediated removal of REC8 revealed that SCC is exclusively provided by REC8 cohesin, despite the presence of SCC1 cohesin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Tachibana-Konwalski et al., 2010</xref>). We have previously shown that versions of REC-8::GFP and COH-3::mCherry carrying TEV recognition motifs in the central region of these kleisins are fully functional and allow kleisin cleavage following TEV protease micro injection into the germline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Castellano-Pozo et al., 2020</xref>). We took advantage of these strains to assess REC-8 and COH-3 contribution to SCC at different stages of meiosis. In the case of COH-3, experiments were performed in a <italic>coh-4</italic> mutant background due to functional redundancy between COH-3 and COH-4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Severson et al., 2009</xref>). We first evaluated the impact of removing REC-8 or COH-3 from diakinesis oocytes, which contain six bivalents as a result of SCC and the presence of inter-homologue crossover events (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A and B</xref>). TEV-mediated removal of REC-8::GFP caused partial disassembly of diakinesis bivalents, which in most cases appeared as four lobed structures that remained weakly connected at the crossover site, with each lobe likely corresponding to one of the four chromatids present in a bivalent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). We called these structures ‘lobed bivalents’. In addition to lobed bivalents, TEV-mediated REC-8 removal resulted in 35% of oocytes displaying individual chromatids that were fully detached (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). A similar situation was observed when REC-8 was removed from diakinesis oocytes using auxin-mediated depletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Importantly, visualisation of COH-3 and condensin II confirmed that these SMC complexes remained bound to diakinesis chromosomes following REC-8 removal, including on fully detached chromatids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B and C</xref>). Therefore, the observed disruption in SCC is specifically caused by the loss of REC-8 and not by an indirect effect of REC-8 removal on other SMC complexes.</p><p>The fact that COH-3 remains associated with fully detached chromatids following REC-8 removal in diakinesis oocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C</xref>) suggests that COH-3/4 complexes associate with individual chromatids and therefore do not partake in SCC. Indeed, TEV-mediated removal of COH-3 or the mitotic kleisin SCC-1, which also associates with meiotic prophase chromosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Severson and Meyer, 2014</xref>), caused no obvious morphological changes in diakinesis bivalents (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1D</xref>), consistent with COH-3/4 or SCC-1 not providing SCC in diakinesis oocytes. We also attempted to simultaneously remove all cohesin variants by inducing auxin-mediated depletion of SMC-1, a subunit common to all cohesin complexes. SMC-1 depletion produced the appearance of lobed bivalents and detached chromatids in diakinesis oocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1E</xref>), as observed following REC-8 depletion. We noted that in most oocytes a small pool of SMC-1 signal remained associated with the crossover site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1E</xref>). We have previously observed that a population of REC-8 cohesin associated with crossover sites in late pachytene chromosomes is partially resistant to TEV-mediated removal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Castellano-Pozo et al., 2020</xref>). Thus, it is possible that a feature of chromosome structure present in the vicinity of crossover sites makes cohesin complexes associated with these regions more resistant to removal by the methods used here. To test whether a recombination-dependent feature could explain the weak inter-chromatid connections present in the lobed diakinesis bivalents induced by REC-8 removal, we removed REC-8 from diakinesis oocytes of <italic>spo-11</italic> mutants, which lack crossovers due to the absence of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) that initiate meiotic recombination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dernburg et al., 1998</xref>). In this case, REC-8 removal induced a more penetrant loss of SCC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>), suggesting that a recombination-dependent feature of chromosome organisation is involved in the weak chromatid connections observed when REC-8 is removed from diakinesis bivalents. We also tested a possible role of COH-3 in mediating SCC in diakinesis bivalents of <italic>spo-11</italic> mutants, but in this case, SCC remained intact following COH-3 removal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). These results suggest that SCC is exclusively provided by REC-8 complexes in diakinesis oocytes. This is consistent with the observation that the SPO-11-dependent tethering of sister chromatids observed in diakinesis oocytes of <italic>rec-8</italic> mutants represents inter-sister exchanges (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Crawley et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cahoon et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Almanzar et al., 2021</xref>), reinforcing that inter-sister attachments mediated by canonical SCC depend on REC-8 cohesin.</p><p>Next, we focused our attention on SCC in oocytes at the metaphase I stage, when SCC is required to ensure correct orientation of bivalents on the spindle. Removal of REC-8 from metaphase I-arrested oocytes caused a general loss of SCC, with most oocytes displaying between 17 and 24 DAPI-stained bodies (full loss of SCC would result in 24 chromatids), while six bivalents remained present following COH-3 or SCC-1 removal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E and F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1F</xref>). These results are consistent with REC-8 complexes providing SCC in metaphase I oocytes and suggest that the weak chromatid attachments that remain in diakinesis bivalents following REC-8 removal are resolved in metaphase I oocytes. This may be due to the assembly of the first meiotic spindle, which may be sufficient to pull apart weakly attached chromatids, or to the resolution of a crossover-associated chromosome structure between diakinesis and metaphase I. Regardless, the clear conclusion from our temporally resolved kleisin removal experiments is that, similar to mouse oocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Tachibana-Konwalski et al., 2010</xref>), SCC is exclusively provided by REC-8 cohesin in metaphase I oocytes of <italic>C. elegans</italic>.</p><p>Since SCC is established during meiotic S-phase and must persist until the meiotic divisions, and given that REC-8 provides SCC during metaphase I, we hypothesised that SCC is provided by REC-8 cohesin at all stages of meiotic prophase. We tested whether this was the case in pachytene nuclei by monitoring SCC at the chromosomal end of the X chromosomes bound by the HIM-8 protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Phillips et al., 2005</xref>). Imaging of HIM-8 foci in late pachytene nuclei demonstrated that removal of REC-8, but not of COH-3 or SCC-1, caused loss of SCC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>). These observations suggest that SCC is provided by REC-8 complexes in pachytene nuclei, consistent with a model in which complexes that provide SCC are stably bound to chromosomes between DNA replication and the onset of the meiotic divisions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Burkhardt et al., 2016</xref>). The stable association of cohesion-providing REC-8 complexes with meiotic chromosomes is also supported by our findings that SCC-2 is not required for maintaining REC-8 on pachytene chromosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B and E</xref>). Moreover, we found that both REC-8 and SCC remained intact in diakinesis oocytes after 14 hr of auxin-mediated SCC-2 depletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref>). In contrast, maintenance of normal levels of COH-3/4 complexes, presumably associated with individual chromatids, does require SCC-2 in pachytene nuclei (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). These differences between REC-8 and COH-3/4 in terms of their participation in SCC and their dependency on SCC-2 to sustain chromosomal association are reminiscent of observations in yeast mitotic cells, where Scc2 is essential for loading cohesin and maintaining cohesin’s association with unreplicated DNA, but has no role in maintaining cohesion during G2/M phases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Ciosk et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Srinivasan et al., 2019</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>REC-8 cohesin plays a more prominent role in DNA repair than COH-3/4 cohesin</title><p>Cohesin is thought to have diverse functions in the repair of DSBs, including an SCC-dependent role in homologous recombination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Sjögren and Nasmyth, 2001</xref>), and roles in regulating homology search of DSB ends and in the formation of repair foci, which are proposed to depend on the loop extrusion activity of cohesin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Arnould et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Piazza et al., 2021</xref>). Our results so far show that stably bound REC-8 cohesin provides SCC while a larger population of dynamically associated COH-3/4 cohesin orchestrates chromosome organisation. We sought to clarify whether these differential activities correlate with the ability of REC-8 and COH-3/4 cohesin to promote DSB repair. Analysis of chromosome morphology in diakinesis oocytes after exogenous DSBs are introduced by ionising radiation (IR) provides a clear read out of DSB repair capability, as impaired DSB repair during pachytene leads to chromosome fragmentation in diakinesis oocytes. Then, 26 hr after irradiation, chromosome fragments were largely lacking from diakinesis oocytes of wild-type worms exposed to 100 Gy of IR, evidencing efficient DSB repair (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). In contrast, extensive chromosome fragmentation was evident in diakinesis oocytes of irradiated r<italic>ec-8</italic> mutants, with around 40% of the DAPI-stained bodies displaying a surface area consistent with chromosome fragments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Chromosome fragmentation was also detected in diakinesis oocytes of irradiated <italic>coh-3 coh-4</italic> double mutants, although to a much lesser extent than in <italic>rec-8</italic> mutants. We also evaluated IR-induced DSB repair in pachytene nuclei by visualising recombination intermediates containing RAD-51 in backgrounds lacking SPO-11 and therefore endogenous DSBs. Then, 24 hr after exposure to 10 Gy, which induces a large accumulation of RAD-51 foci (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lightfoot et al., 2011</xref>), low numbers of RAD-51 foci were present in late pachytene nuclei of <italic>spo-11</italic> and <italic>spo-11 coh-3 coh-4</italic> mutants, consistent with efficient DSB repair (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). In contrast, late pachytene nuclei of irradiated <italic>rec-8</italic> mutants contained high numbers of RAD-51 foci, evidencing impaired DSB repair (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). Thus, SCC-providing REC-8 complexes appear to play a more prominent role in DSB repair than non-cohesive, dynamically bound, COH-3/4 complexes. Moreover, in pachytene nuclei of <italic>rec-8</italic> mutants, most sister chromatids are paired up due to the assembly of inter-sister synaptonemal complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cahoon et al., 2019</xref>), a phenomenon also observed in mouse <italic>Rec8</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Xu et al., 2005</xref>), which can promote inter-sister repair of SPO-11 DSBs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cahoon et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Almanzar et al., 2021</xref>). Supporting this possibility, double mutants lacking REC-8 and SC components display a striking accumulation of RAD-51 foci that persisted into diakinesis oocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cahoon et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). These late RAD-51 intermediates suggest the presence of unrepaired DSBs, which would explain the chromosome fragmentation seen in oocytes of mutants lacking the SC and REC-8 cohesin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Crawley et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Colaiácovo et al., 2003</xref>). In addition to high numbers of regular size RAD-51 foci, <italic>rec-8 syp-2</italic> double mutant germlines also display elongated RAD-51 structures (stretches) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>), suggesting the presence of abnormal recombination intermediates. In contrast to <italic>rec-8 syp-2</italic> double mutants, RAD-51 foci gradually decrease during late pachytene of <italic>coh-3 coh-4 syp-2</italic> triple mutant germlines and are largely lacking in diplotene and diakinesis oocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>), consistent with the lack of chromosome fragments in oocytes of these mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Crawley et al., 2016</xref>). Thus, removing the SC from mutants lacking COH-3/4 cohesin does not compromise DSB repair, suggesting that inter-sister DSB repair mediated by REC-8 cohesin is sufficient to repair SPO-11 DSBs that accumulate in the absence of SC. Therefore, although COH-3/4 complexes are much more abundant than REC-8 complexes and are essential for the integrity of axial elements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B and C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>), SCC-providing REC-8 complexes play a much more prominent role in the repair of endogenous (SPO-11-dependent) and exogenous (IR) DSBs during late meiotic prophase. Our results suggest that similar to yeast Scc1 cohesin during mitotic G2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Sjögren and Nasmyth, 2001</xref>), the role of REC-8 in DSB repair during meiotic prophase is mechanistically coupled to its ability to provide SCC.</p><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>REC-8 complexes promote double-strand break (DSB) repair.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Diakinesis oocytes of indicated genotypes stained with DAPI in untreated controls and 26 hr after worms were exposed to 100 Gy of IR.

Our studies suggest functional conservation between worm and mouse REC8 cohesin, with these complexes providing SCC and being largely refractory to WAPL-mediated removal in both organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Crawley et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Silva et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Tachibana-Konwalski et al., 2010</xref>). Moreover, as we provide evidence suggesting that functional conservation may also extend to COH-3/4-RAD21L complexes, we hypothesise that, similar to <italic>C. elegans</italic> COH-3/4, mammalian RAD21L complexes may associate dynamically with meiotic chromosomes in a manner regulated by WAPL and NIPBL. Our studies support a model in which REC-8 complexes loaded during meiotic S-phase tether sister chromatids until the meiotic divisions, while COH-3/4 loaded post S-phase on individual chromatids act to control higher-order chromosome structure, likely by performing loop extrusion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Mitotic yeast and human cohesin complexes containing the Scc1 kleisin mediate both SCC and loop extrusion, but these processes are thought to involve different modes of DNA–cohesin interactions and are therefore proposed to be mutually exclusive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Srinivasan et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Davidson et al., 2019</xref>).

Images were deconvolved using SoftWoRx 3.0 (Applied Precision) and mounted in Photoshop. The number and appearance of DAPI-stained bodies in diakinesis and metaphase I oocytes were scored in 2D projections of three-dimensional intact germlines/embryos. Projections of diakinesis and metaphase I oocytes result in some overlap of DAPI-stained bodies, especially in situations where loss of SCC results in high numbers of DAPI-stained bodies; therefore in some cases, the number of DAPI-stained bodies may represent a slight underestimation of the overall number of individual chromatin bodies present.</p><p>The area in pixels of DAPI-stained bodies in diakinesis oocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>) was calculated by generating maximum intensity projections of diakinesis nuclei and using CellProfiler to obtain the size in pixels of individual DAPI-stained bodies identified in 2D projections.</p></sec><sec id="s3-9"><title>Gamma irradiation</title><p>Worms were irradiated in a IBL 637 cell irradiator containing a caesium-137 source.

After incubation at 37°C overnight, L3 animals were transferred onto the plates and allowed to lay F1 embryos that grew in these plates until the young adult stage.

Dissected gonads of strains carrying GFP-tagged versions (generated by CRISPR) of REC-8, COH-3, and COH-4 were stained with FITC-conjugated aGFP antibodies. Acquisition was carried out on the Deltavision microscope, with a set exposure time. Sum-projections of the raw images were made on ImageJ to only include the half top or bottom of each nucleus (six-slice projections). Every nucleus was examined separately. To measure the peak axis intensity, a line was drawn over at least two clear axes of the nuclei, and the line profile was generated using the built-in ‘Plot profile’ function of ImageJ. Peak values were called using an online-available macro (found <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.imperial.ac.uk/medicine/facility-for-imaging-by-light-microscopy/equipment/software---fiji/">here</ext-link>:). The macro used was the ‘Intensity’ macro (Maxima and Minima of line profile Tool). Fluorescence measurements (in arbitrary units) were collected and the raw values were used to compare the different tagged protein occupancy by calculating the relative ratio of the proteins on the meiotic axis.</p><p>We used whole-nucleus mean fluorescence intensity to compare the immunostaining intensity of (1) SMC-1::GFP (using anti-GFP antibodies) in different genetic backgrounds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>), (2) COH-3/4 (using anti-COH-3/4) antibodies in experiments testing the effect of SCC-2 and WAPL-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B and C</xref>), and (3) REC-8::HA (using anti-HA antibodies) in experiments in which SCC-2::AID::GFP was depleted by auxin treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Images were acquired on a Delta Vision microscope as 3D stacks using the same exposure settings in auxin-treated and untreated controls. For comparing fluorescence levels, non-deconvolved images were analysed in ImageJ. Nuclei of interest were manually circled using the ‘oval’ tool, one nucleus at a time, and the fluorescence of each slice was measured. The mean fluorescence of that nucleus was then calculated, after normalising for the number of z-stack slices and the area of the circle drawn. Normalised, mean fluorescence values were directly compared between control and mutant strains, as arbitrary units.</p></sec><sec id="s3-13"><title>Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP)</title><p>The FRAP method used here was modified from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Nadarajan et al., 2017</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Pattabiraman et al., 2017</xref>. Young adult worms were used for all FRAP experiments and immobilised on 5% agarose pads for imaging, covered in a solution of 2 mM levamisole in M9 medium. Imaging was performed in a Leica TCS SP5 system using the FRAP wizard (LASAF software), which allows for photobleaching of the regions of interest (ROIs). The FRAP wizard was only used for the pre-bleach, photobleaching and the 0 min post-bleach images. Images were taken in 2D every minute using the ×60 oil immersion lens, as 3D stack images were found to increase photobleaching in this setup. Nuclei of mid-pachytene were selected so that at least two axes were visible at the top of the gonad, where resolution was better. ROIs for photobleaching were designed to span at least two axes, with the ROI size being kept similar throughout experiments. One or two nuclei were bleached for every gonad, but only one nucleus per gonad was analysed for curve fitting. For acquisition, the following settings were used: 100 Hz scanning speed, two times line averaging, 1 AU pinhole. A 488 Argon laser was used at 30% power and 15% sub-power, and a HyD filter was used, set at 502–552 nm range. Bleaching was performed with the same laser at 60% sub-power, for 100 ms. Images were exported as .lif files and were analysed using ImageJ (version 2.0.0-rc-59/1.51k). The ImageJ built-in StackRreg algorithm was used to align the frames of the time series.</p><p>Aligned time-series images were analysed as described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Nadarajan et al., 2017</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Pattabiraman et al., 2017</xref>. In short, three ROIs were designed: bleached area of the axis (ROI 1), the whole nucleus (ROI 2), and a background control, defined as a region in the gonad, but far enough from the bleached area (ROI 3). Intensity measurements were carried out for all ROIs using ImageJ, and data was analysed using Microsoft Excel. The analysis involved background subtraction (ROI 3) from ROI 1 and ROI 2. The subtracted values were then normalised against each other, so that fluorescence loss in ROI 2 was accounted for in ROI 1 (adapted from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Phair et al., 2004</xref>). The ROI 1 post-bleach values were also normalised as relative intensities of the pre-bleach ROI 1 values. The resulting ‘double-normalised’ values were finally normalised again, this time by setting the initial post-bleach value to 1, by dividing all values by the initial difference (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Stenoien et al., 2001</xref>).</p><p>Curve fitting was performed in GraphPad Prism software. Statistical analysis was performed using the one-phase association predicted Y<sub>max</sub> values (where the fitted curve is expected to plateau) and comparing them between different genotypes using the Mann–Whitney statistical test.</p><p>High-resolution FRAP images (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G and H</xref>) were acquired on a Leica TCS SP5 system with the following settings: 100 Hz scanning speed, three times line averaging, 1 AU pinhole. REC-8::GFP was imaged with 488 laser at 30% overall power and 10% sub-power for acquiring, HyD detector set to 502–552 nm range at 300 gain. COH-3::mCherry was imaged with a 561 laser and 10% imaging power, HyD detector set to 590–680 nm range, at 350 gain. Some manual adjustment of Z and X-Y focus was needed due to nuclear movement over long time points, which was done using very low-intensity imaging (1400 Hz) to minimise acquisition bleaching. Images were exported as TIFFs.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s4"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Funding acquisition, Investigation, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Investigation, Methodology, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Investigation, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Investigation, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Investigation, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con8"><p>Investigation, Methodology, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con9"><p>Investigation, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con10"><p>Supervision, Funding acquisition, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con11"><p>Conceptualization, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="mdar"><label>MDAR checklist</label><media xlink:href="elife-84138-mdarchecklist1-v2.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="s6"><title>Data availability</title><p>All data generated or analysed during this study are included in the manuscript and supporting files; source data for all graphs on the manuscript are provided in source data files associated with each figure containing graphs.</p></sec><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank D Dormann and C Whilding from the MRC LMS microscopy facility for help with analysis of FRAP, Nicola Silva for providing anti-RAD-51 antibodies, and Barbara Meyer for providing anti-HCP-6 antibodies.

However, some data presented in the Figures are not yet sufficiently convincing to support the authors' conclusions. In addition, the description of the experiments including the controls is insufficient to judge the validity of the results. Therefore, several points need to be addressed. Since there are several major concerns, we may ask for a second round of review on the revised version.</p><p>1. Images in Figures 1C, 1D, 1E, 1F, 2B, and 2C should be replaced with more proper ones.</p><p>Figure 1C: The claim that axial elements stain continuously is not substantiated in the figure. Additional staining of an axis protein such as HTP-3 will be checked.</p><p>Figure 1D: Examples for differences in REC-8 and COH-3/4 recovery are not convincing.

For image quantification such as intensity measurement, it is critical to show how to normalize the intensity between strains, in some cases with a high background signal, e.g. in Figures 1B 2B, and 2C, COH-4 and REC-8 show two distinct populations for the fluorescence. In Figures 2B, and C, a high background made it hard to quantify the intensity.</p><p>In addition, the differences between COH-3/4 staining between Figure 1 and Figure 2 are enormous (ca 7x), suggesting that SCC-2::AID is strongly sub-functional. This issue needs to be addressed at the minimum, or better eliminated by using a construct that behaves more like SCC-2.</p><p>2. For the AID experiments (Figure 2), it is critical to understand how fast SCC-2 is depleted and whether depletion is complete and therefore, for how long the depletion lasts in the various cell types. If possible, please show how much depletion of the protein was achieved by western blotting. Is the loading of COH-3/4 dependent on SCC-2? A gonad, like that in Figure 2C for REC-8, could be shown and analyzed for COH-3/4 as well.</p><p>3. The results showing the role of COH-3/4 in meiotic DSB repair are very weak at present. Additional experiments for DAPI and RAD-51 focus counting in spo-11 coh-3/4 with irradiation could help, introducing a second mutation (e.g. rad-54), which stalls any repair to eliminate the possibility of &quot;rapid&quot; repair.</p><p>4. One concern about the manuscript is how much different the contents of the paper are from the authors' previous publication (Crawley et al. <italic>eLife</italic> 2014; Castellano-Pozo et al. Nature Commun, 2020). It is essential to clarify what is new in this paper and what is confirmation of the previous works (or maybe correction of the work).</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The paper elegantly reveals the role of REC-8 (but not of COH-3/4) in sister chromatid cohesion (SCC) in diakinesis and metaphase I. Importantly, REC-8 coheisin binds to meiotic chromosomes stably while COH-3/4-cohesin is more dynamic, probably accompanied by dissociation and association, which is controlled by cohesin regulators, SCC-2 and WAPL-1. The experiments in this paper were mostly conducted in a good shaper and most of the conclusions were supported by the data. The paper is clearly written and the conclusion is straightforward. On the other hand, there are some concerns about the data in the paper, which should be addressed prior to publication.</p><p>1. The results shown by FRAP experiments (Figures 1 and 2A) were not convincing. In <italic>C. elegans</italic> meiosis, chromosomes show motion driven by microtubule-dynein, which clearly affects the recovery of FRAP signals. It is best to perform FRAP in the absence of the motion in the Dynein mutants such as the dlc-1 mutant. Alternatively, the authors must argue that the motion did not affect their conclusion in a logical manner. Moreover, Figures 1E and 1F show peculiar behavior of signals. In the outside of the dotted square, GFP/mCherry signals diminished and GFP signals were recovered in Figure 1E (0 versus 10 min).</p><p>2. Figure 2A analyzed the effect of the wapl-1 (Wapl) mutation on Coh-3 dynamics and showed that the Wapl-1 promotes the re-association of Coh-3/4 on chromosomes. However, the authors did not discuss this in a reasonable way. Given that Wapl-1 promote the dissociation of the COH-3/4 cohesin from meiotic chromosomes (previously shown by the authors' group), this result suggests either that Wapl-1 has a new function to promote the association of the cohesin to the chromosomes or that WAPL-1 could remove COH-3/4 cohesin for its re-association. This should be discussed or addressed by analyzing wapl-1 scc-2 double mutants.</p><p>3. Since the authors had nice antibodies against COH-3/4 for immuno-staining some experiments should be done in double-staining for REC-8::HA and COH-3/4 in as Figure 2B right and Figure 2C-in Figure 2C. Moreover, in addition to Figure 2B let, it is essential to show the localization of COH-3/4 under SCC-2 depletion in &quot;whole&quot; gonads like in Figure 2C.</p><p>4. If the WAPL-1 controls the localization of COH-3/4, but not of REC-8, GFP-intensity measurement should show more COH-3/4-GFP signals in the wapl-1 mutant than the control, but the same amount of REC-8-GFP by measuring the intensity as shown in Figure 1B. This should be shown.</p><p>5. It is nice for the authors to show a more detailed structure of lobed bivalent in Figure 3A, by analyzing the structure with a super-resolution fluorescent microscope. For readers, it is nice to show a schematic drawing of the structure.</p><p>6. Given the contribution of cohesin in the formation of meiosis-specific chromosome axis structure, the authors showed and/or mentioned the role of REC-8 and COH-3/4 in axis structure by looking at the localization of axis proteins such as HORMD proteins.</p><p>7. Reproducibility: In some experiments such as Figure 2B, multiple nuclei in a single worm were measured.

This issue needs to be addressed at the minimum, or better eliminated by using a construct that behaves more like SCC-2.</p></disp-quote><p>We have implemented multiple changes in figures and text to clarify the issues mentioned above.</p><p>First, we show new examples of raw images of COH-3/4 and REC-8::HA before and after SCC-2::AID::GFP depletion and have also performed experiments at an earlier time point now shown in Figure S2C-E. These confirmed that the effect on the reduction of COH-3/4 staining is weaker at 8 hours post auxin treatment than after 14 hours. As expected, the region of nuclei that failed to load REC-8 during meiotic S-phase is also larger at 14 hours post auxin exposure than at 8 hours. We have included whole germlines examples of these experiments in Figure S2D-E.</p><p>Second, REC-8 and COH-3/4 intensity staining in Figure 1B and Figure 2B can’t be directly compared to one another as REC-8 and COH-3/4 were visualised using different antibodies and signal intensity was calculated used different methods. In Figure 1B, all three kleisins were imaged with anti-GFP antibodies to allow direct comparison of REC-8::GFP, COH-3::GFP, and COH-4::GFP intensity at axial elements. On the other hand, experiments shown in Figures 2B-C were performed in strains expressing SCC-2::AID::GFP, and therefore anti-GFP antibodies were used to visualise SCC-2::AID::GFP, while COH-3/4 were visualised with anti-COH-3/4 antibodies and REC-8::HA was visualised using anti-HA antibodies. Because of the use of different primary and secondary antibodies, the fluorescence intensity values are not directly comparable between Figure 1B and Figures 2B-C, or between anti-COH-3/4 staining and anti-HA (REC-8) staining in Figure 2B. The method used for signal-intensity quantification is also different between Figure 1B and Figures 2B-C, with Figure 1B using axis intensity measured in half-nucleus sum projections while Figure 2 uses mean intensity of whole nucleus projections. The reason for using these two different methods is that the goal of the experiment in Figure 1B was to show the relative intensity of REC-8::GFP, COH-3::GFP, and COH-4::GFP at axial elements, which was possible as all three kleisins displayed clear axis staining. In contrast, the weaking of COH-3/4 signal at axial elements following SCC-2 depletion meant that whole nucleus projections offer a more accurate representation of signal intensity. We apologise for not clearly explaining this on the previous version. We now describe the rationale for both signal quantification methods in the text (lines 97-100 and 113-115) and have also added diagrams in Figures 1B (axis sum intensity) and 1D (whole nucleus mean intensity) to describe these two approaches.</p><p>Third, regarding the functionality of SCC-2::AID::GFP, we now show that crossover formation is normal in worms homozygous for <italic>scc-2::AID::GFP</italic> and <italic>TIR1</italic> (Figure S2B).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. For the AID experiments (Figure 2), it is critical to understand how fast SCC-2 is depleted and whether depletion is complete and therefore, for how long the depletion lasts in the various cell types. If possible, please show how much depletion of the protein was achieved by western blotting.</p></disp-quote><p>As mentioned above, we now include experiments showing depletion of SCC-2::AID::GFP at an earlier time point (8 hours). Anti-GFP staining confirms efficient depletion of SCC-2::AID::GFP at this point and visualisation of REC-8::HA and COH-3/4 in whole germlines now shown in Figures S2D-E confirms that SCC-2 function is lacking at both time points. We have also included cartoons in Figures 2B-C to explain how nuclei progress through the germline. Because nuclei progress moving at about 1 row per hour and take about 36 hours to transition from early meiosis to late pachytene, using 8 and 14 hours time points means that we can clearly assess the effect of depleting SCC-2::AID::GFP from pachytene nuclei. We appreciate the suggestion to monitor SCC-2::AID::GFP depletion using western blots (WB), however, monitoring protein levels by WB requires using whole worm lysates and as the promoter driving TIR1 expression (required for auxin-meditated protein degradation) is germline specific, SCC-2::GFP::AID is still present in somatic tissues after auxin treatment. Therefore, we can’t use western blotting to monitor SCC-2::AID::GFP depletion. However, as mentioned above, the impairment of REC-8::HA loading in early meiosis nuclei seen after 8 and 14 hours of auxin treatment, together with the loss of GFP signals, clearly confirms efficient depletion of SCC-2::AID::GFP.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Is the loading of COH-3/4 dependent on SCC-2?</p></disp-quote><p>We have confirmed that the initial loading of COH-3/4 to chromosomes depends on SCC-2 by performing anti-COH-3/4 staining in germlines of homozygous <italic>scc-2</italic> mutant worms (Figure S2A).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>A gonad, like that in Figure 2C for REC-8, could be shown and analyzed for COH-3/4 as well.</p></disp-quote><p>We now show full germlines stained with anti-COH-3/4 antibodies after 8 and 14 hours of SCC-2::AID::GFP depletion (Figure S2D).

The results showing the role of COH-3/4 in meiotic DSB repair are very weak at present. Additional experiments for DAPI and RAD-51 focus counting in spo-11 coh-3/4 with irradiation could help, introducing a second mutation (e.g. rad-54), which stalls any repair to eliminate the possibility of &quot;rapid&quot; repair.</p></disp-quote><p>Our main conclusion from the DSB repair experiments is that COH-3/4 play a minor role in DSB repair compared to REC-8 complexes. We have further confirmed this by comparing RAD-51 staining in late pachytene nuclei of mutants lacking SC, which prevents inter-homologue DSB repair and therefore induces accumulation of RAD-51 foci, and either REC-8 or COH-3/4. While mutants lacking SC and REC-8 accumulate huge numbers RAD-51 foci even in diakinesis oocytes, RAD-51 foci disappear during late pachytene-diplotene of mutants lacking SC and COH-3/4. This result is consistent with our proposal that REC-8 cohesin promotes inter-sister DSB repair that is likely linked to its role in providing SCC.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. One concern about the manuscript is how much different the contents of the paper are from the authors' previous publication (Crawley et al. eLife 2014; Castellano-Pozo et al. Nature Commun, 2020). It is essential to clarify what is new in this paper and what is confirmation of the previous works (or maybe correction of the work).</p></disp-quote><p>The current manuscript elaborates on some of the findings and experimental approaches reported in our previous studies to reveal novel and important aspects of meiotic cohesin function. First, using FRAP, we show that REC-8 and COH-3/4 complexes display differential dynamics in pachytene nuclei and then show that this process is regulated by WAPL-1 and SCC-2. Our analysis of <italic>wapl-1</italic> mutants reported in Crawley et al. 2016 showed that WAPL-1 restricted COH-3/4 loading at early meiotic prophase, but that study did not address the question of whether REC-8 and COH-3/4 associated dynamically with meiotic chromosomes and whether SCC-2 or WAPL-1 affected this process in pachytene nuclei. Our finding that SCC-2 is required for maintaining the levels of COH-3/4 cohesin in pachytene nuclei has important implications to understand meiotic chromosome organisation. As SCC2 is required for the loop extrusion activity of cohesin, we now propose that COH-3/4 complexes may carry out loop extrusion in pachytene nuclei. Second, using TEV-tagged versions of REC-8 and COH-3/4 we unequivocally establish that SCC is uniquely provided by REC-8 complexes in metaphase I oocytes. Although we and others have suggested previously that this may be the case based on observations made in different meiotic mutants, a convincing demonstration of this possibility was lacking and an alternative model proposing that COH-3/4 cohesin do provide SCC had been proposed (Severson et al. 2014). Although the Castellano-Pozo et al. 2020 manuscript described the creation of TEV-tagged versions of REC-8 and COH-3/4, the questions of which complexes provide SCC was not addressed in that study. Our current findings lead us to propose a model in which different populations of cohesin (defined by kleisin identity in worms) perform SCC and loop extrusion. This is an important conceptual advance that is likely a conserved feature of meiosis. Third, by introducing DSBs by IR in pachytene nuclei we demonstrate that low abundance REC-8 complexes play a much more prominent role in DSB repair than highly-abundant COH-3/4 complexes and suggest that this activity is coupled to REC-8’s role in SCC. The role of REC-8 and COH-3/4 complexes in repairing DSBs introduced in pachytene nuclei had not been explored in our previous manuscripts. We have introduced changes in the text and figures (including a model) to highlight the main findings of the current manuscript.</p><p>The suggestion that our current work contradicts results from our 2020 Nature Communications manuscript is derived from comments made in the public review of reviewer 3. This reviewer refers to data shown in Figure 1C saying that we used a degron system to degrade COH-3/4 and REC-8 from pachytene nuclei: “The current study uses a degron instead of TEV and SIM to revisit the same result. This time, degradation of COH-3/4 alone, but not of Rec8 alone completely eliminates axial elements. It seems that, if the conclusion is now correct, the previous headline must be incorrect, showing that more care has to be taken in the conclusions.”</p><p>This statement is factually incorrect, the SIM images shown in Figure 1C correspond to <italic>rec-8</italic> and <italic>coh-3 coh-4</italic> double mutants (as indicated in main text and figure legend) and therefore to germlines lacking REC-8 or COH-3/4 from the onset of meiosis. In contrast, in the Castellano-Pozo et al. 2020 study REC-8 or COH-3/4 were removed from pachytene chromosomes using the TEV approach following normal chromosome morphogenesis at meiosis onset. This experiment was performed to specifically address how kleisin removal in nuclei at the pachytene stage impacted on meiotic progression, this experiment is not revisited in the current manuscript. In addition to this, Figure 1C does not show that lack of COH-3/4 “completely eliminates axial elements”, as stated by the reviewer, but rather that “SMC-1::GFP signals appeared as discontinuous weak signals in pachytene nuclei” (see description of this result in lines 103-104 of original submission). Moreover, as requested, we now show that axial elements (visualised by HORMAD protein HIM-3) are also discontinuous in <italic>coh-3 coh-4</italic> double mutants but form linear structures in <italic>rec-8</italic> mutants, as also reported by others. Thus, findings in the current manuscript are entirely consistent with those of the Castellano-Pozo et al. 2020 study, where we reported that staining of HORMADs (used to visualise axial elements) became weaker and more discontinuous following removal of COH-3/4 than REC-8 from pachytene axial elements (this observation is also mentioned in lines 96-97 of original submission).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>The paper elegantly reveals the role of REC-8 (but not of COH-3/4) in sister chromatid cohesion (SCC) in diakinesis and metaphase I.

The results shown by FRAP experiments (Figures 1 and 2A) were not convincing.

Regarding the issue of chromosome active chromosome movements during early prophase: these occur during the leptotene and zygotene stages, but our FRAP images correspond to mid pachytene nuclei, which don’t display this movement. Some level of nuclear movement is unavoidable when imaging pachytene nuclei in the germline of a live worm. In all FRAP experiments the focal plane in Z was adjusted to keep the bleached region in focus at all time points. We have readjusted the panels in Figures 1G-H (1E-F in previous version) to ensure that levels are equally adjusted in all panels. As focal plane was adjusted to ensure that the bleached area was in focus at all time points, differences in intensity outside this area can also reflect slight changes in focus on chromosomes outside the bleached area due to movements.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. Figure 2A analyzed the effect of the wapl-1 (Wapl) mutation on Coh-3 dynamics and showed that the Wapl-1 promotes the re-association of Coh-3/4 on chromosomes. However, the authors did not discuss this in a reasonable way. Given that Wapl-1 promote the dissociation of the COH-3/4 cohesin from meiotic chromosomes (previously shown by the authors' group), this result suggests either that Wapl-1 has a new function to promote the association of the cohesin to the chromosomes or that WAPL-1 could remove COH-3/4 cohesin for its re-association. This should be discussed or addressed by analyzing wapl-1 scc-2 double mutants.</p></disp-quote><p>As requested by the reviewer we have now depleted SCC-2 from pachytene nuclei of worms lacking WAPL-1 (<italic>wapl-1</italic> RNAi) (Figure 2C). This experiment confirms that SCC-2 is required to sustain normal levels of COH-3/4 cohesin on pachytene nuclei. We now clearly state that WAPL-1 and SCC-2 display antagonistic activities in pachytene nuclei, with WAPL-1 acting to promote the creation of a soluble pool of COH-3/4 cohesin that can be loaded onto pachytene chromosomes by SCC-2. This is also reflected in the new model shown on Figure 5.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. Since the authors had nice antibodies against COH-3/4 for immuno-staining some experiments should be done in double-staining for REC-8::HA and COH-3/4 in as Figure 2B right and Figure 2C-in Figure 2C. Moreover, in addition to Figure 2B let, it is essential to show the localization of COH-3/4 under SCC-2 depletion in &quot;whole&quot; gonads like in Figure 2C.</p></disp-quote><p>Performing the co-staining of REC-8::HA and COH-3/4 is technically challenging as those experiments will actually become a quadruple staining including: anti-HA, anti-COH-3/4, anti-GFP (to monitor depletion of SCC-2::AID::GFP), and DAPI. This will force us to image either REC-8 or COH-3/4 with secondary antibodies that emit in the far-red channel, which in our hands provides weaker signal. Because of this limitation we decided to image REC-8::HA and COH-3/4 on separate experiments using secondary antibodies that allow imaging on the red channel.</p><p>As requested, we now show full germlines at the different time points after SCC-2::AID::GFP depletion showing REC-8::HA and COH-3/4 staining (Figures S2D-E).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. If the WAPL-1 controls the localization of COH-3/4, but not of REC-8, GFP-intensity measurement should show more COH-3/4-GFP signals in the wapl-1 mutant than the control, but the same amount of REC-8-GFP by measuring the intensity as shown in Figure 1B. This should be shown.</p></disp-quote><p>The fact that COH-3/4 cohesin is the main targets of WAPL-1 has been shown by us (Crawley et al. 2016) and confirmed by others (Hernandez et al. 2018 PLoS Genet 14: e1007382; Yu et al. 2023 Nat Struct Mol Biol 30: 436). In the new experiment shown on Figure 2C we also show increased levels of COH-3/4 in wapl-1RNAi worms. Therefore, we do not think it necessary to include this again in another figure.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. It is nice for the authors to show a more detailed structure of lobed bivalent in Figure 3A, by analyzing the structure with a super-resolution fluorescent microscope. For readers, it is nice to show a schematic drawing of the structure.</p></disp-quote><p>In our opinion, the magnified insets provided in Figure 3A provide clear examples of partial or full separation of sister chromatids after TEV-mediated REC-8 removal from diakinesis oocytes. We do not think that using SR microscopy, which will involve a substantial amount of additional work, will provide further insight. We provide additional examples of the effect of REC-8 removal (TEV or auxin) in diakinesis oocytes in Figures S3A-B, which confirm partial disassembly of diakinesis bivalents following REC-8 removal.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. Given the contribution of cohesin in the formation of meiosis-specific chromosome axis structure, the authors showed and/or mentioned the role of REC-8 and COH-3/4 in axis structure by looking at the localization of axis proteins such as HORMD proteins.</p></disp-quote><p>As requested, we now include staining of HORMAD protein HIM-3 in WT controls, <italic>rec-8</italic> single, and <italic>coh-3 coh-4</italic> double mutants in Figure S1A.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7. Reproducibility: In some experiments such as Figure 2B, multiple nuclei in a single worm were measured.

Should scc-2::AID cause the (7 fold)! reduction of COH-3/4 levels on chromatin, then scc-2::AID is a strongly sub-functional scc-2 version. It would be ideal, to change to a construct with better performance, but at the very minimum, those constitutive scc-2::AID defects should be directly addressed and described.</p></disp-quote><p>REC-8 and COH-3/4 intensity staining in Figure 1B and Figure 2B can’t be directly compared to one another as REC-8 and COH-3/4 were visualised using different antibodies and signal intensity was calculated used different methods. In Figure 1B, all three kleisins were imaged with anti-GFP antibodies to allow direct comparison of REC-8::GFP, COH-3::GFP, and COH-4::GFP intensity at axial elements. On the other hand, experiments shown in Figures 2B-C were performed in strains expressing SCC-2::AID::GFP, and therefore anti-GFP antibodies were used to visualise SCC-2::AID::GFP, while COH-3/4 were visualised with anti-COH-3/4 antibodies and REC-8::HA was visualised using anti-HA antibodies. Because of the use of different primary and secondary antibodies, the fluorescence intensity values are not directly comparable between Figure 1B and Figures 2B-C, or between anti-COH-3/4 staining and anti-HA (REC-8) staining in Figure 2B. The method used for signal-intensity quantification is also different between Figure 1B and Figures 2B-C, with Figure 1B using axis intensity measured in half-nucleus sum projections while Figure 2 uses mean intensity of whole nucleus projections. The reason for using these two different methods is that the goal of the experiment in Figure 1B was to show the relative intensity of REC-8::GFP, COH-3::GFP, and COH-4::GFP at axial elements, which was possible as all three kleisins displayed clear axis staining. In contrast, the weaking of COH-3/4 signal at axial elements following SCC-2 depletion meant that whole nucleus projections offer a more accurate representation of signal intensity. We apologise for not clearly explaining this on the previous version. We now describe the rationale for both signal quantification methods in the text (lines 97-100 and 113-115) and have also added diagrams in Figures 1B (axis sum intensity) and 1D (whole nucleus mean intensity) to describe these two approaches.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Also, SCC-2 staining does suffer from high background. Therefore it is close to impossible to judge the amount of SCC-2 after depletion. If cells are treated with auxin for 14 hours, secondary effects may arise.</p><p>It would be helpful to perform Western blotting, demonstrating how late after the addition of auxin SCC-2 disappears, and to which levels it is reduced. At the same time, it can be used as a control to test whether overall cellular levels of COH-3/4 and REC-8 are</p><p>unaffected at least by the scc-2::AID construct in the absence of auxin. Unfortunately, the moving window shown in Figure 2C right panel, cannot be captured by such an analysis.</p></disp-quote><p>We now show new images of SCC-2::AID::GFP depletion and include experiments after 8 and 14 hours of auxin exposure. Anti-GFP staining confirms efficient depletion of SCC-2::AID::GFP at both points and visualisation of REC-8::HA and COH-3/4 in whole germlines now shown in Figures S2D-E confirms that SCC-2 function is also lacking at both time points. We have also included cartoons in Figures 2B-C to explain how nuclei progress through the germline. Because nuclei progress moving at about 1 row per hour and take about 36 hours to transition from early meiosis to late pachytene, using 8 and 14 hours time points means that we can clearly assess the effect of depleting SCC-2::AID::GFP from pachytene nuclei. We appreciate the suggestion to monitor SCC-2::AID::GFP depletion using western blots (WB), however, monitoring protein levels by WB requires using whole worm lysates and as the promoter driving TIR1 expression (required for auxin-meditated protein degradation) is germline specific, SCC-2::GFP::AID is still present in somatic tissues after auxin treatment. Therefore, we can’t use western blotting to monitor SCC-2::AID::GFP depletion. However, as mentioned above, the impairment of REC-8::HA loading in early meiosis nuclei seen after 8 and 14 hours of auxin treatment, together with the loss of GFP signals, clearly confirms efficient depletion of SCC-2::AID::GFP.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 3</p><p>312-314 „Since SCC is established during meiotic S-phase and must persist until the meiotic divisions, and given that REC-8 provides SCC during metaphase I, we hypothesised that SCC is provided by REC-8 cohesin throughout the meiotic prophase.

Our experiments were performed to compare the DSB repair capacity of both types of meiotic cohesin, not to determine whether the role of REC-8 in DSB repair is different from its role in SCC.
