innervate the skin of vertebrates, where they detect physical touch via mechanically gated ion channels (mechanotransducers). While the afferent terminal is generally understood to be the primary site of mechanotransduction, the functional properties of mechanically activated (MA) ionic current generated by mechanotransducers at this location remain obscure. Until now, direct evidence of MA current and mechanically induced action potentials in the mechanoreceptor terminal has not been obtained. Here, we report patch-clamp recordings from the afferent terminal innervating Grandry (Meissner) corpuscles in the bill skin of a tactile specialist duck. We show that mechanical stimulation evokes MA current in the afferent with fast kinetics of activation and inactivation during the dynamic phases of the mechanical stimulus. These responses trigger rapidly adapting firing in the afferent detected at the terminal and in the afferent fiber outside of the corpuscle. Our findings elucidate the initial electrogenic events of touch detection in the mechanoreceptor nerve terminal.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>mechanosensitivity</kwd><kwd>mechanosensation</kwd><kwd>Meissner corpuscle</kwd><kwd>Grandry corpuscle</kwd><kwd>duck</kwd><kwd><italic>Anas platyrhynchos</italic></kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd><kwd>Mallard</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1923127</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bagriantsev</surname><given-names>Sviatoslav N</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2114084</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bagriantsev</surname><given-names>Sviatoslav N</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1754286</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gracheva</surname><given-names>Elena O</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01NS097547</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bagriantsev</surname><given-names>Sviatoslav N</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01NS126277</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bagriantsev</surname><given-names>Sviatoslav N</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A novel experimental approach reveals how mechanical force acting on the skin is converted into electrical signaling in sensory neurons to evoke the sensation of touch.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>In vertebrates, extrinsic touch is detected in the skin by cutaneous mechanoreceptors and somatosensory neurons of the peripheral nervous system. The afferent nerve fibers of these cells innervate the skin, where they form specialized ending structures which sense mechanical stimuli. Within the afferent terminals, mechanically gated ion channels (mechanotransducers), such as Piezo2, detect touch and transform it into mechanically activated (MA) current (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Handler and Ginty, 2021</xref>). Extracellular recordings of mechanoreceptor afferents have previously revealed voltage changes originating from the terminals in response to mechanical stimulation, but the intracellular dynamics of these signals are not understood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Loewenstein and Rathkamp, 1958</xref>). As a result, direct evidence of mechanotransduction and MA current in the nerve endings of mechanoreceptors is lacking.</p><p>Studies of MA current and mechanotransducer biophysics have been limited to heterologous expression systems and dissociated somatosensory neurons <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Coste et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Lewis et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Schneider et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Zheng et al., 2019</xref>). Most notably, Piezo2, which mediates the detection of touch, displays fast-inactivating MA current in cultured cells and in dissociated neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">von Buchholtz et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Chesler et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Coste et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Ranade et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Wang et al., 2019</xref>). However, it is unclear whether electrophysiological responses from somas of dissociated neurons accurately reflect that of MA current in the afferent terminal in the skin, due to potential differences in membrane geometry, level of ion channel expression, intracellular factors, and cellular/tissue environment between the two (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Richardson et al., 2022</xref>). To our knowledge, intracellular recordings of mechanoreceptor terminals have not been previously reported due to the technical difficulties of accessing the axonal endings with patch-clamp electrodes. Consequently, the functional characteristics of mechanotransduction at the normal physiological site of touch detection remain unknown.</p><p>To address this gap in knowledge, we acquired patch-clamp recordings from the afferent terminals of Grandry (Meissner) corpuscles in the bill skin of the tactile specialist Mallard duck (<italic>Anas platyrhynchos domesticus</italic>). The Grandry corpuscle is an avian tactile end-organ innervated by rapidly adapting mechanoreceptors, which form thin terminals between Schwann cell-derived lamellar cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Nikolaev et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Schneider et al., 2017</xref>). The Grandry corpuscleâs layered architecture, rapid adaptation, and sensitivity to transient touch make it structurally and functionally analogous to the mammalian Meissner corpuscle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Neubarth et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Schwaller et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Ziolkowski et al., 2022</xref>). Compared to mammals, the high density of corpuscles in the bill of tactile-foraging waterfowl enables persistent electrophysiological investigation of the afferent terminals in these end-organs, the results of which we report here.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results|discussion"><title>Results and discussion</title><p>We acquired patch-clamp recordings from the afferent terminal within the Grandry corpuscle using an <italic>ex vivo</italic> bill-skin preparation from late-stage duck embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Mechanical stimulation of the voltage-clamped afferent terminal revealed fast-inactivating MA current only in response to the dynamic onset (ON) and offset (OFF) phases of the stimulus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). In current-clamp, both indentation with a probe (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>) and current injection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>) caused depolarization of the membrane voltage, which initiated action potentials (APs) in the terminal during both phases. In three corpuscles in which the afferent terminal was patched, simultaneous single-fiber nerve recordings were also established using a section of the same afferent outside of the corpuscle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and E</xref>). In these cases, propagating APs from the afferent terminal were recorded in the afferent fiber with a one-to-one correlation to APs in the terminal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1BâD</xref>, bottom). When comparing the responses during the ON and OFF phases, we detected a difference between the rates of current inactivation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>), but not the rates of activation, current-indentation relationship, or AP threshold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1EâI</xref>). The inactivation rate of MA current in the ON phase (<italic>Ï</italic>=8.95 Â± 1.82 ms) in the terminal is notably similar to the inactivation rate of fast-inactivating MA current measured from the somas of murine and duck mechanoreceptors <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Coste et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Schneider et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Viatchenko-Karpinski and Gu, 2016</xref>). Though duck Piezo2 also displays fast-inactivating MA current (<italic>Ï</italic>&lt;10 ms at negative membrane potentials; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Schneider et al., 2017</xref>), whether the ON phase MA current in the terminal is mediated by Piezo2 or another, unknown ion channel remains to be determined. Interestingly, the MA current seen during the OFF phase is a unique response not reported in dissociated neurons or expression systems, even though the OFF response is typical of rapidly adapting mechanoreceptors in <italic>ex vivo</italic> single-fiber recordings. The fast inactivation rate of the OFF response compared to the ON response implies a distinct or modified mechanism of mechanotransduction. This could potentially be dependent on the cellular structure or function of lamellar cells in the corpuscle.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Mechanotransduction in the afferent terminal of the Grandry (Meissner) corpuscle.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Illustrated representation of the experimental setup.

The static plateau of the step stimulus lasted 150 ms, while the ramp had a duration of 3 ms for both the ON and OFF phases. For both phases in each terminal, the inactivation rate (Ï) of the MA current was calculated by fitting a single exponential function (I = I<sub>0</sub>Ãexp^(â <italic>t</italic>/Ï), where I<sub>0</sub> is the baseline-subtracted peak current amplitude, <italic>t</italic> is the time from the peak current, and Ï is the inactivation constant) to the decaying portion of the largest three MA current responses and averaging the fitted Ï values. The activation Ï was calculated similarly using the rise portion of the response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Nikolaev et al., 2020</xref>). The threshold was measured in current-clamp as the smallest indentation which elicited an AP. In current-clamp, depolarizing current steps (from 10 to 100 pA in 10 pA increments) were applied to elicit APs in the afferent terminal and lamellar cells. The first AP in these recordings was used to calculate the peak amplitude, width at half-maximum, and maximum slope of rise and decay for the terminal versus lamellar cells. Experiments were not corrected for liquid-junction potential.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Single-fiber recording</title><p>Recordings from single afferent fibers of corpuscles were acquired simultaneously with patch-clamp recordings for three corpuscles, using the second channel of the MultiClamp 700B amplifier. Single-fiber recording pipettes were manufactured from thin-wall, 1.5 mm diameter borosilicate glass capillaries using a P-1000 micropipette puller (Sutter Instruments) to create tip diameters of 5â30 Î¼m, then filled with Krebs solution. Pipettes were placed on an electrode headstage connected to a High-Speed Pressure Clamp (ALA Scientific Instruments). Light (1â20 mmHg) positive pressure was applied from the recording electrode to clear away tissue from a corpuscle-associated afferent. Negative pressure was then applied until a large section (~5 Î¼m) of the afferent was sucked into the pipette. Extracellular afferent voltage was recording in current-clamp mode, sampled at 20 kHz and low-pass filtered at 1 kHz.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Data analysis</title><p>Data from afferent terminals and lamellar cells were acquired from separate, individual preparations from different animals.

These recordings produce rapid excitatory currents (with fast activation and inactivation kinetics) when applying the mechanical stimulus (ON) and after removing it (OFF). This mechanically activated ionic current (MA) propagates through action potentials out of the terminals from a certain threshold. These action potentials are also sensitive to TTX, demonstrating a role of voltage-gated sodium channels in the process. In this study the authors overcome a long-existing technical challenge and present an experimental model to study skin mechanoreceptors. The contents seem adequate for a short report, and future work should warrant more detailed characterization of the ion channels involved in these MA currents (Piezo2 seems to be the clearest candidate due to all the literature on the subject).</p><p>This short report is very well written and structured. Suggestions that may help to improve the manuscript are:</p><p>â The activation and inactivation kinetics (Figure 1F-G) of the MA current, both ON and OFF, is fast and very similar, although for inactivation, the MA OFF current seems to be twice as fast as the ON current ( figure 1F). However, this difference is not clearly inferred from the recordings of panel 1B.

Here the authors performed elegant recordings from afferent terminal (within the Grandry corpuscles) as well as afferent fiber (single-fiber recordings), not done before to the best of our knowledge.

Though the mechanisms are not explored in this study, this strategy provides the baseline for future electrophysiological studies for various mechanoreceptors.</p><p>Another interesting aspect of this study is the presence of electrical responses during the off phase (retrieval of mechanical stimuli). Usually in dissociated neurons and in other in vitro studies, mechanical stimuli evoke currents during the start of the stimulus.
