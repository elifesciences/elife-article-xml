responses is critical in neuronal computation by shaping input-output characteristics of neurons. However, arithmetics of summation for metabotropic signals are not known. We characterized the combined ionotropic and metabotropic output of neocortical neurogliaform cells (NGFCs) using electrophysiological and anatomical methods in the rat cerebral cortex. These experiments revealed that GABA receptors are activated outside release sites and confirmed coactivation of putative NGFCs in superficial cortical layers in vivo. Triple recordings from presynaptic NGFCs converging to a postsynaptic neuron revealed sublinear summation of ionotropic GABA<sub>A</sub> responses and linear summation of metabotropic GABA<sub>B</sub> responses. Based on a model combining properties of volume transmission and distributions of all NGFC axon terminals, we predict that in 83% of cases one or two NGFCs can provide input to a point in the neuropil. We suggest that interactions of metabotropic GABAergic responses remain linear even if most superficial layer interneurons specialized to recruit GABA<sub>B</sub> receptors are simultaneously active.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>cerebral cortex</kwd><kwd>interneuron</kwd><kwd>microcircuit</kwd><kwd>GABA</kwd><kwd>synaptic transmission</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd><kwd>Rat</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Eötvös Loránd Research Network</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ELKH-SZTE Research Group for Cortical Microcircuits</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tamás</surname><given-names>Gábor</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100010024</institution-id><institution>Hungarian Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GINOP 2.3.2-15-2016-00018</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tamás</surname><given-names>Gábor</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100010024</institution-id><institution>Hungarian Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Élvonal KKP 133807</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tamás</surname><given-names>Gábor</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100011019</institution-id><institution>NRDI Office</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>OTKA K128863</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Molnár</surname><given-names>Gábor</given-names></name><name><surname>Tamás</surname><given-names>Gábor</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000780</institution-id><institution>European Commission</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ÚNKP-20-5 - SZTE-681</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tamás</surname><given-names>Gábor</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003825</institution-id><institution>Hungarian Academy of Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>János Bolyai Research Scholarship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Molnár</surname><given-names>Gábor</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund8"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100010428</institution-id><institution>Innovation and Technology Fund</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>New National Excellence Program</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Molnár</surname><given-names>Gábor</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Summation of metabotropic GABAergic responses remain linear even if most superficial layer interneurons specialized to recruit GABA<sub>B</sub> receptors are simultaneously active.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Each neuron in the cerebral cortex receives thousands of excitatory synaptic inputs that drive action potential (AP) output. The efficacy and timing of excitation is effectively governed by GABAergic inhibitory inputs that arrive with spatiotemporal precision onto different subcellular domains. Synchronization of GABAergic inputs appears to be crucial in structuring cellular and network excitation and behaviorally relevant rhythmic population activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Klausberger and Somogyi, 2008</xref>). Diverse subpopulations of GABAergic neurons contribute to network mechanisms at different temporal windows and synchronized cells of particular interneuron types appear to fire in a stereotyped fashion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Klausberger and Somogyi, 2008</xref>). In general, this frequently results in coactivation of similar (and asynchronization of dissimilar) GABAergic inputs arriving to target neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Jang et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Karnani et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Kvitsiani et al., 2013</xref>), which leads to postsynaptic summation of GABAergic responses synchronously activated by presynaptic cells of the same type. Most GABAergic cell types exert inhibitory control through ionotropic GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors allowing Cl<sup>−</sup> ions to pass rapidly through the membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Barker and Ransom, 1978</xref>) and depending on the magnitude of GABA release and/or the number of synchronously active presynaptic interneurons, synaptic and extrasynaptic GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors could be recruited. The integration of ionotropic inhibitory signals on the surface of target cell dendrites is temporally precise and spatially specific (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bloss et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Klausberger, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Müller et al., 2012</xref>). Summation of ionotropic receptor-mediated responses are extensively studied in the neocortex and predominantly characterized by nonlinear rules of interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Jadi et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Koch et al., 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">London and Häusser, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Qian and Sejnowski, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Silver, 2010</xref>). In addition to GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors, metabotropic GABA<sub>B</sub> receptor activation can occur during synchronized and/or long-lasting activation of GABAergic inputs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dutar and Nicoll, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Isaacson et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Mody et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Scanziani, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Thomson and Destexhe, 1999</xref>).</p><p>Among the various interneuron subtypes identified in the neocortex neurogliaform cells (NGFCs) form a large subset of interneuron population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ascoli et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Markram et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Schuman et al., 2019</xref>). Compared to other interneuron subtypes, NGFCs form dense axonal arborization with an unusually high presynaptic bouton density that is highly interconnected with other neighboring neurons. NGFCs are known to be especially effective in recruiting metabotropic GABA<sub>B</sub> receptors in addition to ionotropic GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors by sporadic firing using single cell triggered volume transmission in the microcircuit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Oláh et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Tamás et al., 2003</xref>).</p><p>GABA binding to GABA<sub>B</sub> receptors catalyzes GDP/GTP exchange at the Gα subunit and the separation of Gβγ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bettler et al., 2004</xref>). The Gβγ subunits – as membrane-anchored proteins – locally diffuse in the plasma membrane and up to four Gβγ subunits bind cooperatively to G-protein gated inward rectifier potassium (GIRK) channels and trigger a channel opening that drives the membrane potential toward the K<sup>+</sup> reverse potential (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dascal, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Inanobe and Kurachi, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Stanfield et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Wang et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Wickman and Clapham, 1995</xref>). Activation of GABA<sub>B</sub> receptors by NGFCs controls the firing of dendritic spikes in the distal dendritic domain in pyramidal cells (PCs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Larkum et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Palmer et al., 2012a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Wozny and Williams, 2011</xref>) and activity in the prefrontal cortex is effectively controlled by the strong feed-forward GABA<sub>B</sub> inhibition mediated by NGFCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Jackson et al., 2018</xref>). Moreover, GABA<sub>B</sub> receptors contribute to termination of persistent cortical activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Craig et al., 2013</xref>) and slow inhibition contributes to theta oscillations in the hippocampus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Capogna and Pearce, 2011</xref>).</p><p>Relative to the summation of ionotropic responses, postsynaptic summation properties of metabotropic receptors are unexplored and to date, there has been no experimental analysis of how neurons integrate electric signals that are linked to inhibitory metabotropic receptors. We set out to test the summation of metabotropic receptor-mediated postsynaptic responses by direct measurements of convergent inputs arriving from simultaneously active NGFCs and to characterize the likelihood and arithmetics of metabotropic receptor interactions in a model of population output by incorporating experimentally determined functional and structural synaptic properties of NGFCs.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Quantal and structural characteristics of GABAergic connections established by individual NGFCs</title><p>NGFCs are capable of activating postsynaptic receptors in the vicinity of their presynaptic boutons via volume transmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Oláh et al., 2009</xref>). To gain insight into the possible effective radius of volume transmission, we characterized properties of NGFC-PC connections. In vitro simultaneous dual whole-cell patch clamp recordings were carried out on synaptically connected L1 NGFC to L2/3 PC pairs in brain slices from the somatosensory cortex of juvenile male Wistar rats. Pre- and postsynaptic cells were chosen based on their characteristic passive membrane and firing properties (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) and recorded neurons were filled with biocytin, allowing post hoc anatomical reconstruction of recorded cells and estimation of putative synaptic release sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B,H</xref>). Single APs triggered in NGFCs elicit biphasic GABA<sub>A</sub> and GABA<sub>B</sub> receptor-mediated responses on the target neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Tamás et al., 2003</xref>). To determine the number of functional release sites (Nfrs), we recorded induced pluripotent stem cells (IPSCs) under different release probability by varying extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> and Mg<sup>2+</sup> concentrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C,F</xref>). NGFC evoked inhibitory postsynaptic potentials (IPSPs) show robust use-dependent synaptic depression, therefore we limited the intervals of AP triggered in NGFCs to 1 min (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Karayannis et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Tamás et al., 2003</xref>). We collected a dataset of n = 8 L1 NGFC to L2/3 PC pairs with an average of 65.5 ± 5.26 trials per pair and 32.75 ± 4.16 trials for a given Mg<sup>2+</sup>/Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration per conditions. The limited number of trials due to the use-dependent synaptic depression of NGFCs restricted our approach to Bayesian quantal analysis (BQA) previously shown to be robust for the estimation of quantal parameters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bhumbra and Beato, 2013</xref>). As expected, IPSC peak amplitudes were modulated by elevated (3 mM Ca<sup>2+</sup> and 1.5 mM Mg<sup>2+</sup>; mean amplitude: 32.7 ± 22.17 pA; rise time: 6.47 ± 1.34 ms; decay time: 12.27 ± 2.42 ms) and reduced (1.5 mM Ca<sup>2+</sup> and 3 mM Mg<sup>2+</sup>; mean amplitude: 13.58 ± 6.95 pA; rise time: 7.64 ± 3.53 ms; decay time: 11.79 ± 3.21 ms or 2 mM Ca<sup>2+</sup> and 2 mM Mg<sup>2+</sup>; mean amplitude: 12.47 ± 10.9 pA; rise time: 6.95 ± 1.52 ms; decay time: 15.5 ± 10.54 ms) extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentrations consistent with the decline in release probability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Distributions of IPSC amplitudes detected in paired recordings were in good agreement with the estimated quantal amplitude distribution derived from the BQA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). According to BQA, the estimated mean Nfrs was 10.96 ± 8.1 with a mean quantal size (q) of 3.93 ± 1.21 pA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). We performed n=4 experiments in which the use of low extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> reduced release probability to a level at which postsynaptic uniqantal events appeared in response to NGFC activation. We evaluated our uniquantal event detection dataset by measuring multiple parameters of each event. We measured the slope of fitted line on the initial phase of events/failures, amplitude (averaged maximum), and the area of events. Using K-means cluster analysis on the three parameters, we managed to separate the events into three groups having failures, uniquantal and multiquantal responses as separate groups. Having separated uniquantal events this way, we found that averaged quantal amplitude was 4.59±0.73 pA (n=4) which is statistically not different (p=0.68, Mann-Whitney test) from quantal amplitude measured with BQA. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Full reconstruction of functionally connected NGFC-PC pairs (n = 6) allowed comparisons of the Nfrs estimated by BQA and the number of putative release sites by counting the number of presynaptic boutons located within increasing radial distances measured from postsynaptic dendrites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>). Previous experiments showed that direct synaptic junctions are not required for functional NGFC to PC connections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Oláh et al., 2009</xref>) and GABA reaches receptors up to 3 µm from the release site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Farrant and Nusser, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Overstreet-Wadiche and McBain, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Overstreet et al., 2000</xref>). In agreement with earlier observations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Oláh et al., 2009</xref>), direct appositions were not observed in most NGFC to PC pairs and the number of NGFC axonal boutons potentially involved in eliciting postsynaptic responses increased by systematically increasing the radial distance from the dendrites of PCs. Projecting the range of BQA-derived Nfrs estimates over the number of NGFC boutons putatively involved in transmission for the same connections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>, red lines) suggests an effective range of 0.86–1.75 µm for nonsynaptic volume transmission from NGFCs to PCs supporting previous reports on distances covered by extrasynaptic GABAergic communication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Farrant and Nusser, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Overstreet-Wadiche and McBain, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Overstreet et al., 2000</xref>). Moreover, we detected linear correlation (r = 0.863, p = 0.027) between BQA-derived Nfrs and the number of NGFC boutons putatively involved in transmission at radial distances &lt;1.5 µm from PC dendrites; decreasing or increasing the distance resulted in the loss of correlation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Quantal and structural characteristics of GABAergic connections established by individual neurogliaform cells (NGFCs).</title><p>(<bold>A–E</bold>) Quantal and structural properties of a neurogliaform to pyramidal cell (PC) connection.

Unitary volume transmission by NGFCs is limited to their extremely dense axonal arborization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Oláh et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Rózsa et al., 2017</xref>) Therefore, we determined the three-dimensional (3D) distribution of axon lengths of individual NGFCs with Sholl analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). By superimposing individual NGFC reconstructions centered by their somata (n = 16; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>), a representative distribution of axons was calculated as a function of distance from the soma (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). We also assessed the distance between axonal boutons (n = 1456) along reconstructed axons of NGFCs (n = 6) and found that interbouton distances were 3.36 ± 2.54 µm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Next, we developed an algorithm that generates model NGFCs (n = 52) by growing axon arborizations similar (p = 0.99, two-sided K-S test, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>) to the population of the experimentally reconstructed representative distribution of NGFC axons (n = 16) using interactions of segment lengths, branch point locations, and segment orientations while keeping the density of axonal boutons along axon segments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B,C</xref>). In order to achieve a relatively complete representation of all NGFC axon terminals in a model at the population level, we performed immunhistochemical labeling of α-actinin2, which is known to label the overwhelming majority of supragranular NGFCs in the neocortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Uematsu et al., 2008</xref>). Somata immunoreactive for α-actinin2 in superficial cortical layers showed distribution along the axis perpendicular to the surface of the cortex with a peak at ~50–150 µm distance from the pia mater (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). According to this radial distribution and with no apparent tendency along the horizontal axis, we placed NGFC somatas in a 354 × 354 × 140 µm<sup>3</sup> volume to create a realistic spatial model of L1 NGFC population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). 3D pairwise shortest distances between α-actinin2 + somata (n = 152) and distances between somata placed into the model space (n = 374) were similar (p = 0.51, two-sided K-S test, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>). We then used the axon growing algorithm detailed above from each soma position to model a population-wide distribution of NGFC axonal release sites. Quantal and structural properties of NGFC to PC connections shown above suggest a volume transmission distance of ~1.5 µm from potential sites of release (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H,I</xref>), thus we mapped the coverage of surrounding tissue with GABA simultaneously originating from all NGFC terminals with a 1.5 µm of transmitter diffusion in the model. Using these conditions in simulations (n = 36), less than eight NGFC axonal terminals contributed as effective GABA sources at any location in the superficial neocortex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>). Moreover, these boutons originated from a limited number of presynaptic NGFCs; when considering the extreme case of population-level cooperativity, that is, when all putative NGFCs were active, most frequently a single NGFC release site serves as a GABA source (67.7 ± 7%) and potential interactions between two, three, or more different NGFCs take place in limited occasions (15.34 ± 2.1%, 8.5 ± 2.6%, and 8.45 ± 3.16%, respectively). The outcome of these simulations is consistent with earlier results suggesting that single cell-driven volume transmission covers only the close proximity of NGFCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Oláh et al., 2009</xref>) but also indicates potential interactions between a restricted number of neighboring NGFCs.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Structural characteristics of collective GABAergic output formed by the population of layer 1 neurogliaform cells (NGFCs).</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Sholl analysis on the axonal arborization of an individual NGFC.

To further identify L1 neurons active during hindlimb stimulation, we performed immunohistochemistry for the actin-binding protein α-actinin2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Uematsu et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D and F</xref>) using the same cortical area of L1 on which two-photon imaging was performed previously. Mapping α-actinin2 positive cells among in vivo two-photon Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging monitored interneurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>) showed that closely located presumed NGFCs were active (on average 216.09 ± 77.93 µm soma to soma distance from two experiments, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>) allowing summation of outputs by presumptive NGFCs. Cross-examination of neurons responsive/non-responsive to hindlimb stimulation versus neurons immunopositive/negative for α-actinin2 revealed that the majority of the active neurons were α-actinin2 positive (10 out of 15 neurons, 67%, n = 2 animals) and the majority of inactive neurons were α-actinin2 negative (22 out of 26 neurons, 85%, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>) suggesting that a substantial fraction of L1 NGFCs are activated during hindlimb stimulation. Combination of the datasets derived from the structural analysis of GABAergic connections established by the population of layer 1 NGFCs above and the in vivo mapping of coactivated putative NGFCs suggests that summation of NGFC output is feasible and, at the same time, is dominated by GABA released from boutons of a one or two NGFCs: having approximately two-thirds of NGFCs simultaneously active further suppresses the potentially synchronous contribution of three or more NGFCs (8.5% and 8.45%, see above) already constrained by structural properties in a point of the cortex.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Coactivation of neurogliaform cell population in L1 somatosensory cortex in vivo.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Experimental setup.

To directly measure the summation of converging inputs from superficial NGFCs, in vitro simultaneous triple recordings were performed from two presynaptic NGFCs and a target PC (n = 4, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). First, we measured the amplitude of unitary IPSPs (n = 8) elicited by single L1 NGFCs in the target L2/3 PC and found that smaller and bigger inputs in a triplet were −1.68 ± 1.51 and −2.19 ± 1.33 mV (rise time: 4.66 ± 2 ms; half-width: 19.29 ± 5.76 ms; decay time: 8.94 ± 2.91 ms), respectively. Next we activated the two L1 NGFC inputs synchronously (0.17 ± 0.05 ms) and such coactivation resulted in moderately sublinear summation of convergent IPSPs (maximal nonlinearity, −9.1 ± 4.3%) measured as the difference of calculated (−3.81 ± 2.76 mV) and experimentally determined (−3.57 ± 2.55 mV) sums of convergent single inputs (n = 4, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). These results are in line with experiments showing moderately sublinear interactions between identified, single cell evoked fast IPSPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Tamás et al., 2002</xref>). Interestingly, the time course of sublinearity followed the fast, presumably GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor-mediated part of the unitary and summated IPSPs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>) suggesting that ionotropic and metabotropic GABAergic components of the same input combinations might follow different rules of summation. To test the interaction of unitary GABA<sub>B</sub> receptor-mediated IPSPs directly, we repeated the experiments above with the application of the GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor antagonist gabazine (10 µM). Pharmacological experiments on the output of NGFCs are very challenging due to the extreme sensitivity of NGFC triggered IPSPs to presynaptic firing frequency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Capogna, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Tamás et al., 2003</xref>) forcing us to collect the data in a different set of triple recordings (n = 8, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). As expected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Tamás et al., 2003</xref>) unitary, gabazine-insensitive, slow IPSPs had onset latencies, rise times, and half-widths similar to GABA<sub>B</sub> receptor-mediated responses (49.42 ± 5.8, 86.95 ± 8.82, and 252.27 ± 36.92 ms, respectively, n = 16, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). Peak amplitudes of converging smaller and bigger slow IPSPs were −0.66±0.22 and −0.94±0.37 mV, respectively.

To investigate whether HCN1 channels contribute to mechanisms of interactions between GABA<sub>B</sub> receptor-mediated postsynaptic responses, we performed experiments on NGFC-to-PC pairs and evoked one to four APs in a single presynaptic NGFC at 100 Hz. The high stimulus frequency allows to induce GABA release with up to four APs and still remain within the time window where the presynaptic GABA<sub>B</sub> receptors are not yet activated and unable to inhibit voltage-dependent Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chen and van den Pol, 1998</xref>). This ensures that short-term plasticity does not have a presynaptic effect that could hinder the release of GABA by later APs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Karayannis et al., 2010</xref>). This experimental configuration mimics the extreme conditions when multiple presynaptic release sites converge in a tight space and creating excessive GABA<sub>B</sub> receptor-mediated inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). Triggering a single spike in the presence of gabazine (10 µM) did not saturate postsynaptic GABA<sub>B</sub> receptors since the postsynaptic response induced by two spikes was proportional to the arithmetic sum of unitary postsynaptic responses (experimental sums: −1.25 mV calculated sums: −1.26 mV; unitary IPSP rise time: 78.69 ± 27.28 ms; decay time: 56.27 ± 15.88 ms), apparently showing linear summation properties similar to triple recordings testing summation convergent inputs above. However, further increase in the number of evoked APs to 3 and 4 introduced sublinearity to summation (n = 6, 1AP: −0.63 ± 0.50 mV, 2APs: −1.25 ± 1.06 mV, 3APs: −1.53 ± 0.84 mV, 4APs: −1.61 ± 1.09 mV, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>; normalized values: 2APs: 2.00 ± 1.08, 3APs: 2.34 ± 1.16, 4APs: 3.17 ± 1.26, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>).

The number and position of NGFC presynaptic boutons around the postsynaptic dendritic segments in the model were used according to structural characteristics of GABAergic connections established by individual NGFCs (n = 4 boutons 1.2 ± 0.7 µm from the dendrite; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I,H</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>) and according to the bouton density determined for the overall output of NGFC population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). Previous work suggests that a single AP in an NGFC generates GABA concentrations of 1–60 µM lasting for 20–200 ms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Karayannis et al., 2010</xref>). In our model, the amount of released GABA was consistent from release event to release event and dropped off exponentially with distance from the synapse ([GABA]: 0.0 μm, 1 mM; 0.5 μm, 60 μM; 2.0 μm, 1 μM; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">2</xref>). The GABA exposure time was 114.87 ± 2.1 ms with decay time constants of 11.52 ± 0.14 ms. Our modeling trials show that single AP triggered GABA release can activate a total of 5.82 ± 2.43 GABA<sub>B</sub> receptors (2.81 ± 1.55 on spine, 3.01 ± 1.71 on the shaft). Furthermore, activation of GABA<sub>B</sub> receptors triggers intracellular mechanisms and the initial GDP/GTP exchange at the Gα subunit separates the G-protein heterotrimeric protein and produces Gβγ subunits (peak number of Gβγ subunits for single AP: 338.54 ± 138.75). Lateral membrane diffusion of Gβγ subunits lead to the activation of 3.66 ± 2.17 GIRK channels in total (2.47 ± 1.88 on spine, 1.17 ± 1.26 on the shaft) in response to single AP. Next, consecutive GABA releases were induced with 10 ms delays to replicate the 100 Hz stimulation protocol used in the experiments above (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). The increased GABA concentration from two sequential stimuli raised the number of active GABA<sub>B</sub> receptors to 11.29 ± 3.48 (5.57 ± 2.36 on spine, 5.72 ± 2.52 on the shaft). Three and four consecutive releases activated a total of 16.19 ± 3.88 and 20.99 ± 4.99 GABA<sub>B</sub> receptors, respectively (7.96 ± 2.74 on spine, 8.23 ± 2.97 on the shaft and 10.62 ± 3.28 on spine, 10.37 ± 3.53 on the shaft, respectively). When modeling consecutive GABA releases, massive amount of Gβγ subunits were produced together with a decline in relative production efficacy per APs, possibly due to the limited number of G-proteins serving as a substrate in the vicinity of active receptor clusters (peak number of Gβγ subunits for 2AP: 612.10 ± 171.95; 3AP: 857.78±194.14; 4AP: 1081.81 ± 229.57). Two consecutive APs resulted in the activation of 6.98 ± 3.29 GIRK channels (2.13 ± 1.63 on dendritic shaft and 4.85 ± 2.65 on spine) in the simulations. Importantly, this number of activated GIRK channels in response to two APs was close to the arithmetic sum of the number of GIRK channels activated by two single AP responses (−4.87% in total, −1.86% on spines and −9.86% on the shaft; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5A</xref>). Further increase in the GABA exposure proportional to three and four APs leads to the activation of 10.39 and 12.89 GIRK channels, respectively (7.01 ± 3.11 and 8.68 ± 3.46 on spines and 3.37 ± 2.08 and 4.21 ±2. 48 on the shaft, respectively). These numbers of GIRK channels corresponded to −5.68% and −13.58% of the arithmetic sum of GIRK channels activated by three and four single AP responses (−5.71% and 13.82% on spines and −4.15% and −11.16% on the shaft). The increased linearity of total GIRK channel activation relative to experimental results could be a result of several unknown properties of the cascade linking GABA<sub>B</sub> receptors to GIRK channels and/or due to vesicle depletion in terminals of NGFCs during multiple rapid release of GABA not incorporated into our model.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Subcellular localization of GABA<sub>B</sub> receptor-G-protein gated inward rectifier potassium (GIRK) channel complex determines summation properties.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Visualization of the complete MCell-based model in the course of GABA release.

(5) Ultrastructural observations showed the lack of clearly defined postsynaptic elements in the apposition of the NGFC boutons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Mańko et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Oláh et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Vida et al., 1998</xref>). (6) NGFCs act on astrocytes within the reach of their axonal arborization through nonsynaptic coupling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Rózsa et al., 2017</xref>). The distance of effective operation through NGFC-driven volume transmission, however, is not clear. Here, we used functional and structural characterization of NGFC-PC inhibitory connections and suggest that GABA released from NGFC axonal terminals activates GABA receptors up to about ~1.8 µm, a result remarkably similar to previous estimations for the range of extrasynaptic action of synaptically released GABA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Farrant and Nusser, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Overstreet-Wadiche and McBain, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Overstreet et al., 2000</xref>). Given that our distance estimates are not based on ultrastructural evidence and we cannot exclude that fraction of anatomically defined boutons were not functional, the accuracy of our prediction for the range of volume transmission is limited. Our experiments also shed light to some quantal properties of NGFC’s GABA release. These experiments are constrained by the robust use-dependent depression mediated by NGFCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Karayannis et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Tamás et al., 2003</xref>), therefore implementation of multiple probability fluctuation analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Silver, 2003</xref>), the gold standard for quantal analysis, was not feasible and BQA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bhumbra and Beato, 2013</xref>) was needed as an alternative. The revealed linear correlation between BQA-derived Nfrs and the number of NGFC boutons putatively involved in transmission is compatible with the release of a single docked vesicle from individual NGFC boutons. However, our light microscopic methods applied in this study are insufficient for definitive claims concerning single or multivesicular release from neurogliaform boutons, especially in the light of studies highlighting the inaccuracy of comparing the Nfrs with the anatomical synaptic contacts detected by light microscopy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Oláh et al., 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Molnár et al., 2016</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Holler et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>The functional distance of volume transmission is particularly important for the characterization of interactions between NGFCs and for understanding the population output of NGFCs. Realistic representation of an entire subpopulation of neurons is considered essential for the interpretation of network functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Karnani et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Markram et al., 2015</xref>) and pioneering full-scale data-driven models were effective in deciphering emerging functions of interneuron populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bezaire et al., 2016</xref>). However, network diagrams addressing the function of NGFCs exclusively based on synaptic connectivity underestimate the spread of output without incorporating volume transmission by an order of magnitude (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Oláh et al., 2009</xref>). Although the concept of blanket inhibition has been suggested for networks of interneuron populations having overlapping axonal arborizations and dense synaptic output (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Karnani et al., 2014</xref>), our spatial model based on high-resolution reconstructions of labeled NGFCs takes the concept to its extremes and reveals an unprecedented density of release sites for a population of cortical neuron and shows that the overwhelming majority of the superficial cortical space is effectively covered by at least one NGFC. At the same time, the redundancy of the NGFC population is limited and a single cortical spatial voxel is reached by GABA released from a limited number of individual NGFCs, ~83% of space is covered by one or two NGFCs. Our relatively simple in vivo approach to gauge potential synchronous action of NGFCs gave positive results. This is in line with earlier observations suggesting widespread action of putative NGFCs in terminating persistent activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Craig et al., 2013</xref>), or powerfully suppressing dendritic Ca<sup>2+</sup> dynamics in L2/3 and L5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Palmer et al., 2012a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Wozny and Williams, 2011</xref>). Strong cholinergic neuromodulation of NGFCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Poorthuis et al., 2018</xref>) and frequent gap junctional coupling between NGFCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Simon et al., 2005</xref>) further facilitate concerted action and are likely to play a major role in synchronizing the NGFC network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Yao et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>When studying simultaneous action of NGFCs, our direct measurements of two converging NGFC inputs on L2/3 PC from simultaneous triple whole-cell patch clamp recordings revealed sublinear summation properties for ionotropic GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor-mediated responses. These results support classic theories on synaptic input interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Jadi et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Koch et al., 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">London and Häusser, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Qian and Sejnowski, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Silver, 2010</xref>) and are in line with earlier experiments measuring interactions of anatomically identified inputs converging to neighboring areas of the dendritic tree of the same postsynaptic cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hao et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Tamás et al., 2002</xref>). Mechanisms of interaction between convergent inputs from NGFCs might be similar to those suggested for short-term synaptic depression of GABA<sub>A</sub> responses such as local drops in Cl<sup>−</sup> driving force and membrane conductance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Huguenard and Alger, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">McCarren and Alger, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Staley and Proctor, 1999</xref>). To our knowledge, the simultaneous triple recordings of two presynaptic NGFCs targeting the same postsynaptic PC represent the first direct experimental attempt addressing the summation of metabotropic receptor-mediated postsynaptic interactions. To date, scarce computational model studies were aimed to explore the integration properties of GABA<sub>B</sub> receptor-mediated responses and suggested a highly supralinear interaction through the amplification effect of G-protein cooperativity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Destexhe and Sejnowski, 1995</xref>). Our experimental approach indicates linear interactions between GABA<sub>B</sub> receptor-mediated responses in case the number of converging presynaptic cells corresponds to the number of NGFCs cooperating during in vivo network operations. This suggests that converging afferents that act on inhibitory metabotropic receptors in the same postsynaptic voxel show linear or slightly sublinear summation, conserving the impact of individual inputs. However, we cannot exclude the possibility that widespread synchronization across various interneuron populations might shift the summation arithmetic in a nonlinear fashion.</p><p>Intrinsic properties of postsynaptic PCs might also contribute to the regulation of summation. HCN1 channels are known to be enriched in the distal dendrites of PCs and mediate K<sup>+</sup> cationic current activated by membrane hyperpolarization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kalmbach et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Lörincz et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Robinson and Siegelbaum, 2003</xref>). Our experiments presented above show that summation properties in response to synchronized inputs from NGFCs are not significantly affected by HCN1 channels, presumably due to the relatively moderate local hyperpolarization arriving from NGFCs; again, further studies are needed to test the influence of additional interneuron classes coactivated together with NGFCs. We predict that further GABAergic activity is unlikely to change summation arithmetics based on our negative results when blocking the high-affinity plasma membrane GABA transporters concentrated in the perisynaptic and extrasynaptic areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Melone et al., 2015</xref>) effective in modulating GABA-mediated inhibition through extrasynaptic GABA spillover (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Barbour and Häusser, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hamann et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Scanziani, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Szabadics et al., 2007</xref>). Despite having similar summation arithmetics of two consecutive APs to the triple-recording configuration, it remains undefined as to what extent multiple presynaptic APs resemble synchronous activation of individual release sites. Presynaptic GABA<sub>B</sub> receptor-mediated decrease in Ca<sup>2+</sup> is unlikely (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Karayannis et al., 2010</xref>); however, depletion of the readily releasable pool of vesicles leading to synaptic depression cannot be ruled out – this may contribute to the apparent inconsistency between the simulation and the experimental data concerning summation during more than three repetitive APs, since our model does not incorporate short-term synaptic depression. As suggested by pioneering simulations on the summation of GABA<sub>B</sub> receptor-mediated signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Destexhe and Sejnowski, 1995</xref>), a crucial intrinsic factor in the postsynaptic cells is the molecular cascade linking GABA<sub>B</sub> receptors to the GIRK channels through G-proteins. Our experimental evidence for close to linear or slightly sublinear summation of GABA<sub>B</sub> receptor-mediated responses suggests that even if amplification through G-proteins plays a role, it is unable to overturn local membrane or K<sup>+</sup> concentration-dependent factors promoting sublinearity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dascal, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Inanobe and Kurachi, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Stanfield et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Wickman and Clapham, 1995</xref>). Amplification of GIRK current by G-proteins could be hampered by the need of cooperative action of up to four G-protein βγ subunits to be effective in opening GIRK channels. In addition, hyperpolarization and the accompanying relatively low [Na<sup>+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> might also limit GIRK channel activation knowing that high [Na<sup>+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> promotes GIRK channel opening in depolarized cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Wang et al., 2016</xref>). The latter scenario might promote a brain state-dependent summation of metabotropic inhibitory signals in active neuronal networks, which remains to be tested in future experiments. On the other hand, our ultrastructural model corroborates pioneering suggestions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Kulik et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Qian and Sejnowski, 1990</xref>) that the effect of GABA<sub>B</sub> receptors is more prominent on dendritic spines compared to dendritic shafts, having approximately twice the number of activated GIRK channels per GABA<sub>B</sub> receptor on spines versus shafts. Admittedly, our simulations could not cover the extensive intracellular signaling pathways known to be influenced by GABA<sub>B</sub> receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gassmann and Bettler, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Padgett and Slesinger, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Terunuma, 2018</xref>) and future availability of comprehensive transporter and extracellular space distributions of layer 1 would enrich the model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hrabetova et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Korogod et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Pallotto et al., 2015</xref>). Nevertheless, our experiments and simulations suggest that nonsynaptic GABAergic volume transmission providing relatively homogeneous and sufficient concentrations of GABA combined with increased clustering of GABA<sub>B</sub> receptors and on spines compared to shafts governs compartment-dependent efficacy.</p><p>Taken together, our experimental results and modeling analysis suggest that a randomly chosen location in the neuropil of layer 1 is targeted by a moderate number (usually one or two) presynaptic NGFCs. In turn, there is no apparent gap in the neurogliaform coverage of layer 1, that is, most elements of the neuropil including classic postsynaptic compartments, presynaptic terminals, or non-neuronal cells are located sufficiently close to terminals of at least one NGFC and receive GABA nonsynaptically. Interestingly, when two NGFCs which share target territory are coactivated or a single NGFC has a limited number of consecutive spikes, linear arithmetics accompany GABA<sub>B</sub> receptor summation. This supports the hypothesis that the density and distribution of neocortical NGFCs and their axonal terminals combined with the effective range of GABAergic volume transmission appear optimized for a spatially ubiquitous and predominantly linear metabotropic GABA<sub>B</sub> receptor summation.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Slice preparation</title><p>Experiments were conducted to the guidelines of University of Szeged Animal Care and Use Committee (ref. no.

Animals were anesthetized by inhalation of halothane, and following decapitation, 320-µm-thick coronal slices were prepared from the somatosensory cortex with a vibration blade microtome (Microm HM 650 V; Microm International GmbH, Walldorf, Germany).

In experiments, where two presynaptic NGFCs were stimulated simultaneously, the interval was increased &gt;300 s. The stimulation sequence in which one or the other or both presynaptic NGFCs were stimulated was constantly altered, therefore the potential rundown effect or long-term potentiation would affect all three stimulation conditions equally. In the case of 100 Hz presynaptic burst stimulation, the interval was increased &gt;300 s. During stimulation protocol, the order of triggering a set of one to four APs on the NGFC was randomized. The postsynaptic responses were normalized to the single AP in each individual set. During postsynaptic current-clamp recording, −50 mV holding current was set. The experiments were stopped if the series resistance (Rs) exceeded 35 MΩ or changed more than 20%. During postsynaptic voltage-clamp recordings, Rs and whole-cell capacitance were monitored continuously. The experiment was discarded if the compensated Rs change reached 20% during recording.</p><p>Pharmacological experiments were carried out on NGFC-PC pairs using ACSF with the following drugs: 10 µM SR 95531 hydrobromide (Tocris), 10 µM D-(-)−2-amino-5-phosphonopentanoic acid (D-AP5) (Tocris), 10 µM 2,3-dioxo-6-nitro-1,2,3,4-tetrahydrobenzo[<italic>f</italic>]quinoxaline-7-sulfonamide (NBQX) (Tocris), 10 µM 4-(<italic>N</italic>-ethyl-<italic>N</italic>-phenylamino)-1,2 dimethyl-6-(methylamino)pyrimidinium chloride (ZD7288) (Sigma-Aldrich), 10 µM 1-[2-[[(diphenylmethylene)imino]oxy]ethyl]-1,2,5,6-tetrahydro-3-pyridinecarboxylic acid hydrochloride hydrochloride (NO711) (Sigma-Aldrich).</p><p>We performed BQA by altering the extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> and Mg<sup>2+</sup> in two different conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bhumbra and Beato, 2013</xref>). One of the conditions was to provide consistently a high release probability, in which the ACSF contained (in mM): 3 Ca<sup>2+</sup>/1.5 Mg<sup>2+</sup>. For the reduced release probability, we tested two different compositions (in mM): either 2 Ca<sup>2+</sup>/2 Mg<sup>2+</sup> or 1.5 Ca<sup>2+</sup>/ 3 Mg<sup>2+</sup>. During BQA experiments, the ACSF solution contained the following substances: 10 µM D-AP5 (Tocris), 10 µM NBQX (Tocris). Each epoch of the BQA experiment contains a stable segment of 28 up to 42 unitary IPSCs (mean 32.75 ± 4.15). BQA experiments required at least 60 min of recording time (up to 90 min). We tested all epochs for possible long-term plasticity effect by measuring the linear correlation between IPSCs amplitude and elapsed time during the experiment, and we found no or negligible correlation (Pearson’s r values from all of the experiments [n = 8] were between −0.39 and 0.46, mean −0.01 ± 0.29).</p><p>The rise time of evoked IPSCs-Ps was determined as the time interval between the points corresponding to 10% and 90% of the peak amplitude, respectively. The peak current/voltage was determined as the maximum within a window of 2 ms duration after the presynaptic AP. The decay time constant of IPSCs/Ps were measured at 67.3%. For measuring the linearity, we measured the difference of calculated and experimentally recorded IPIS peak amplitudes from converging inputs.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Immunohistochemistry and anatomical analysis</title><p>After electrophysiological recordings, slices were fixed in a fixative containing 4% paraformaldehyde, 15% picric acid, and 1.25% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 M phosphate buffer (PB; pH = 7.4) at 4°C for at least 12 hr.

Young adult (22–28 days of age, (P) 24.75 ± 2.75) male Wistar rats were initially anesthetized with halothane before urethane anesthesia (1.4 g/kg of body weight) was administrated intraperitoneally. Body temperature was maintained at 37°C with a heating pad (Supertech Instruments, Pécs, Hungary). Before surgery, dexamethasone sodium phosphate (2 mg/kg of body weight) was administrated subcutaneously, and carprofen (5 mg/kg of body weight) was administrated intraperitoneally. Anesthetized animals’ head were stabilized in a stereotaxic frame and headbars were attached to the skull with dental cement (Sun Medical, Mariyama, Japan). Circular craniotomy (3 mm diameter) was made above the primary somatosensory cortex, centered at 1.5 mm posterior and 2.2 mm lateral from the bregma with a high-speed dental drill (Jinme Dental, Foshan, China). Dura mater was carefully removed surgically. Finally, the craniotomy was filled with 1.5% agarose and covered with a coverslip to limit motion artifacts. The craniotomy was then submerged with HEPES buffered ACSF recording solution containing (in mM) 125 NaCl, 3.5 KCl, 10 HEPES, 1 MgSO<sub>4</sub>, 1 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 0.5 D(+)-glucose, pH = 7.4.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Two-photon calcium imaging in L1</title><p>Before covering the craniotomy with the coverslip calcium indicator, Oregon Green 488 BAPTA-1 AM (10 mM) (OGB-1 AM, Thermo Fisher Scientific) and astrocytic marker sulforhodamine 101 (1 µM) (SR101, Thermo Fisher Scientific) were pressure-injected with a glass pipette (1–2 MΩ) in L1 cortical region under the visual guide of Zeiss Axio Examiner LSM7 (Carl Zeiss AG, Oberkochen, Germany) two-photon microscope using 40× water-immersion objective (W-Plan, Carl Zeiss, Germany). Subsequently, the craniotomy was filled with agarose and covered with a coverslip. Imaging experiments were performed 1 hr after preparation. The activity of L1 interneurons was monitored during ipsilateral hindlimb electrical stimulation (Digimeter, Hertfordshire, UK, 200 mA, 10 ms). OGB-1 AM was excited at 800 nm wavelength with a femtosecond pulsing Ti:sapphire laser (Mai Tai DeepSee [Spectra-Physics, Santa Clara, CA]). In the somatosensory hindlimb region, Z-stack image series (volume size 304 × 304 × 104 µm<sup>3</sup>) were acquired. Calcium signals from interneurons were obtained within this volume in full-frame mode (256 × 100 pixel), acquired at a frequency of ~20 Hz.

The R(t) denotes the relative change of fluorescence signal, F(t) denotes the mean fluorescence of a region of interest at a certain time point, F<sub>0</sub>(t) denotes the time-dependent baseline. Cells were considered responsive if there was a measurable ΔF/F change (×3 of the standard deviation of the noise) in the averaged trace of 10 trials to ipsilateral hindlimb stimulus.

The established array of cubic compartments creates an extracellular space that provides a volume fraction and tortuosity identical to the cortical brain tissue (volume fraction = 0.2 and tortuosity = 1.6). The overall dimensions of the modeled space surrounding the ultrastructurally reconstructed dendrite were 13.28 × 13.28 × 6.592 µm<sup>3</sup> and the total volume was 1162.55 µm<sup>3</sup>.</p><p>Simulation of GABA<sub>B</sub> receptor-GIRK channel interaction was carried out with MCell v3.4 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.mcell.org">http://www.mcell.org</ext-link>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kerr et al., 2008</xref>). Custom Matlab scripts created the MDL (Model Description Language) file that required for MCell simulation. MCell simulated the release and diffusion of GABA, GABA<sub>B</sub> receptors, and GIRK channel interaction. First, to manage a biological like distribution for the receptors and channels, a reaction cascade was used (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>). This cascade was constructed and tested in a simple simulation environment first, containing only a plane surface. At the beginning of every iteration, primary seed particles were placed on the dendritic membrane. Primary seed particles subdivided into secondary seed particles, that which then produce GABA<sub>B</sub> receptor or GIRK channel clusters. Those secondary seed particles that produce the GIRK channel clusters – which contain one to four channels – were immobile in the membrane. Meanwhile, the secondary seed particles that produce GABA<sub>B</sub> receptor clusters – which contain one to eight receptors – can diffuse laterally in the membrane. At the end, the distance was defined between the center of receptor and channel clusters by calculating the distance between each receptor and channel cluster in the 2D plane surface. Delay and the forward rate of the reaction was set to allow secondary seeds, that generate GABA<sub>B</sub> receptor clusters to diffuse to specified distance, resulting in the required GABA<sub>B</sub> receptor-GIRK channel cluster distribution as seen from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Kulik et al., 2006</xref>.

Optimal values of delay and the forward rate of the reaction were set to allow secondary seeds, that generate GABA<sub>B</sub> receptor clusters to diffuse to specified distance, resulting in the required GABA<sub>B</sub> receptor-GIRK channel cluster distribution as seen in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Kulik et al., 2006</xref>.</p><p>Since we were interested in the interaction between the GABA<sub>B</sub> receptors and GIRK channels, our model does not include GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors and GABA amino transporters.

Three parameters were used to create model cells randomly. Total axonal length was taken from previously reconstructed cells, we used an average and SD value to determine the model NGFC’s axonal length. From reconstructions, the number of branching points was the other parameter that was used as an average and SD. Finally, the orientation of the axonal segments was set, we optimized the polar angle and azimuthal angle values of the generated axonal segments in the spherical coordinate system where the origin was the soma. In each run, a Sholl analysis was done on the completed model NGFC cell, and it was compared with the experimental values of axonal distribution.

The data offer original insights into the logic of volume transmission and the subcellular distribution of postsynaptic GABA-B receptors. Therefore, this paper provides novel and important information on the role of the GABAergic system within cortical microcircuits.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Linear summation of metabotropic postsynaptic potentials follows coactivation of neurogliaform interneurons&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers including Marco Capogna as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by John Huguenard as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Mark P Beenhakker (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>I recommend the Authors to provide a point to point reply to each comments raised by all the Reviewers. It will be essential to provide significant improvements to the following major critical point:</p><p>1) The Authors should provide convincing evidence that volume transmission satisfies the assumptions required for quantal analysis.</p><p>2) The revised version should provide a more convincing explanation of the subcellular localization of postsynaptic GABA-B receptor-GIRK channels and possibly a mechanism underlying the linear summation observed. The Authors should also consider the possibility of including GABA transporters in their model.</p><p>3) The Authors should re-work and/or re-explain the conflicting results of linear versus non-linear GABA-B responses observed after one-two or three-more action potentials, respectively.</p><p>4) The Authors should further provide further controls to confirm that for strong use-dependent depression of GABA release from NGFCs, shunting inhibition and/or activation of intrinsic postsynaptic membrane channels do not significantly alter the GABA-B receptor-mediated IPSPs summation from the activation of converging inputs.</p><p>5) The Author should improve the analysis of NGFCs activation after hindlimb stimulation in vivo, as explained in details below.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>I have the following specific comments.</p><p>1) The modeling data suggest that the subcellular localization of GABA-B receptor-GIRK channels determines linear summation of GABA-B receptor responses. The recruitment of GIRK channels was found to be more effective on spines compared to shafts when the responses were evoked by two action potentials, whereas a similar summation at the dendrite spines and shafts occurred when three or four action potentials were evoked. It is not completely clear the proposed mechanism underlying this difference (results observed with two versus three-four action potentials). This aspect should be further explored with simulations or at least it should be clarified and better discussed. How these data align with the conclusion that spines represent the preferred site of action of GABA-B receptors?</p><p>2) The authors evoked unitary synaptic responses by one presynaptic NGFC with low frequency of stimulation (&gt;60s interval), but when two presynaptic NGFCs were stimulated simultaneously then this interval was increased &gt;300s. Why did the authors increase the interval of stimulation for this latter protocol? Was the synaptic depression stronger when two independent presynaptic cells were stimulated, suggesting a likely postsynaptic mechanism? I think it would be interesting to know more about their results here, because NGFCs-mediated synaptic depression remains a phenomenon that is repetitively observed but still requires some more mechanistic insights (Karayannis et al., 2010 suggested receptor desensitization but this is probably only one aspect of the phenomenon). Did the authors attempt to evoke presynaptic action potentials by using the cell-attached configuration of recording postsynaptic IPSPs by using whole cell perforated patch clamp or by using sharp microelectrode recordings in order to ascertain whether these alternative recording conditions would affect NGFC-mediated synaptic depression?</p><p>3) The HCN channel blocker ZD7288 did not alter GABA-B receptor-mediated summation. This interesting negative result should be complemented by some new experiments, if coronavirus emergency situation will allow to perform experiments at Szeged University, in the next weeks, a positive control result showing that ZD7288 affects the excitability of the recorded neurons.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The authors present a compelling study that aims to resolve the extent to which synaptic responses mediated by metabotropic GABA receptors (i.e. GABA-B receptors) summate. While response summation mediated by ionotropic receptors is well described, metabotropic response summation is not, thereby making the authors' exploration of the phenomenon novel and impactful. By carrying out a series of elegant and challenging experiments that are coupled with computational analyses, the authors conclude that summation of synaptic GABA-B responses is linear, unlike the sublinear summation observed with ionotropic, GABA-A receptor-mediated responses.</p><p>The manuscript is generally straightforward, even if presentation is often dense and challenging to read. Three primary issues worth considering include (1) the rather strong conclusion that GABA-B responses linearly summate, despite evidence to the contrary presented in Figure 5C, (2) additional quantification of data presented in Figure 3 to support the contention that NGFCs co-activate, and (3) how the MCell model informs the mechanisms contributing to linear response summation. These and other issues are further described below. Despite these comments, this reviewer is generally enthusiastic about the study. Through a set of very challenging experiments and sophisticated modeling approaches, the authors provide important observations on both (1) NGFC-PC interactions, and (2) GABA-B receptor mediated synaptic response dynamics.</p><p>1) The use of BQA is justified as the authors could only record a limited number of synaptic responses. On line 98, the authors indicate that BQA estimates were in good agreement with the distribution of IPSC amplitudes (Figure 1E). The authors should provide some indication why the two are in agreement (presumably because the average synaptic current aligns with the BQA-derived estimates of p, q and n?). Also, there is no description of what the q and Nfrs in Figure 1E refer to (presumably the BQA-derived values for that particular experiment?). These are fairly minor points, but asking the reader to make assumptions about the authors' intentions makes readability perhaps more challenging than necessary.</p><p>2) In Figure 2, the authors generate model NGFC axons with axonal boutons. Are the interbouton distances uniformly set at 3.35um in the model axons? If so, is doing so consistent with bouton distribution observed in real NGFCs (i.e. Figure S1)? That is, are distal boutons dispersed more closely than proximal boutons (or vice versa)? And would such spatially-dependent dispersion alter the conclusion shown in Figure 2F (bottom)?</p><p>3) Presumably, the motivation for Figure 3 is that it provides physiological context for when NGFCs might be coactive, thereby providing the context for when downstream, PC responses might summate. This is a nice addition. However, it seems that a relevant quantification/evaluation is missing from the figure. That is, the authors nicely show that hind limb stimulation evokes responses in the majority of NGFCs. But how many of these neurons are co-active, and what are their spatial relationships? Figure 3D appears to begin to address this point, but it is not clear if this plot comes from a single animal, or multiple? Also, it seems that such a plot would be most relevant for the study if it only showed α-actin 2-positive cells. In short, can one conclude that nearby, presumptive NGFCs co-activate, and is this conclusion derived from multiple animals?</p><p>4) Regarding Figure 3, what are the criteria for responsive versus non-responsive cells. In Figure 3C, are cells 1 through ~20 responsive?</p><p>5) The analysis presented in Figure 3H shows the &quot;number of presynaptic boutons located within increasing radial distances measured from postsynaptic dendrites&quot; (line 102). If a dendrite is long cellular compartment that winds continuously through the extracellular space (i.e. not spatially discrete), then how exactly is this measurement made? As this analysis identifies a 1.5um NGFC-PC distance as most reasonable, and this distance is used as justification in later figures, it seems that a clear description of this metric is warranted. Perhaps including a schematic describing how this measurement is made would be helpful. Moreover, isn't the distance between GABA-B receptors and release sites the more relevant measure? Are GABA-B receptors expressed uniformly on PC dendrites?</p><p>6) What is the rationale for performing the PC recordings in Figure 4 in current clamp? It seems that voltage-clamp would be more appropriate to evaluate summation?</p><p>7) The authors should provide an explanation for how linearity is calculated; presumably it's simply the difference between the observed response and the linear summation. Also, the differences between the sublinear, ionotropic responses and the linear, metabotropic responses are small. Understandably, these experiments are difficult – indeed, a real tour de force – from which the authors are attempting to derive meaningful observations. Therefore, asking for more triple recordings seems unreasonable. That said, the authors may want to consider showing all control and gabazine recordings corresponding to these experiments in a supplemental figure.</p><p>8) Why are sublinear GABA-B responses observed when driven by three or more action potentials (Figure 5C)? It is not clear why the authors do not address this observation considering that it is inconsistent with the study's overall message.</p><p>9) Line 248: The authors imply that under physiological conditions, PCs will receive, at most, two co-active NGFC inputs. That is, linear summation is the rule under physiological conditions. Is this reasonable?</p><p>10) Line 257: Can the authors please expand on the hypothesis they are testing with their MCell model? It is not immediately obvious to this reviewer why locally constrained GABA-B receptor-GIRK channel interactions would lead to linear summation of synaptic responses.</p><p>11) Line 273: The text here does not seem to best capture what is going on with the GABA concentration as a function of distance (Supp. Figure 4). It seems reasonable that the concentration of GABA within the synapse (i.e. point 0.0) is close to 1mM, and that it rapidly drops off with distance. It seems that the authors want to convey that [GABA] is 60uM at 0.5um and 1uM at 2.0um. Currently, the text seems to imply that NGFC-associated GABA transients can vary considerably from 1uM to 60uM, when in reality it seems that they want to say that the amount of released GABA is fairly consistent from release event to release event, but that it drops off exponentially with distance.</p><p>12) Line 283-312: The description of GABA-B receptor/GIRK channel activation is quantitative, a strength of the passage. However, a general summary of the observations would be helpful. Moreover, relating the simulation results back to the original motivation for the MCell model would be very helpful (i.e. the authors asked whether &quot;linear summation was potentially a result of the locally constrained GABAB receptor – GIRK channel interaction when several presynaptic inputs converge&quot;). It seems as if performing &quot;experiments&quot; on the model wherein local constraints are manipulated would begin to address this question. Why not use the model to provide some data – albeit theoretical – that begins to address their question?</p><p>13) Line 291-299: It seems that total GIRK channel activation follows a nearly linear summation from 1-4 action potentials. Is this modeling result inconsistent with the experimental result shown in Figure 5C?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1. The authors should explicitly state whether there is a significant statistical difference in the linearity of the GABAA and GABAB responses (this seems likely). Most importantly, using the same approach to experimentally address underlying mechanisms of linear GABAB summation would enhance the significance of the work. As acknowledged in the discussion, there are several alternatives that have not been ruled out and the mechanism supported by the simulation seems quite speculative.</p><p>2. The authors make a point to apply a method of quantal analysis that allows estimation of synaptic parameters with smaller datasets than conventional quantal analysis, yet the BQA method still requires more observations than is provided in the current dataset (60 observations in each of 2 data set). This is a minor concern mitigated by the fact that quantal analysis is often undertaken without the prerequisite large data sets.</p><p>More importantly, the approach of Figure 1 would more convincing if the authors validated it with another QA method, or by showing that the proposed quantal size is reasonable. One option could be recording unitary IPSCs under low Pr conditions where failures dominate and thus successes are likely quantal (optimization of the recordings would likely be required). Alternatively, the authors could address whether BQA applied to volume transmission yields the expected changes in parameters following experimental manipulations of quantal size (gabazine) or release probability.</p><p>4. It is also essential to assess GABA release during repetitive stimulation (Figure 5) in order to constrain the subsequent simulation in Figure 6 which assumes the same amount of GABA is released with each action potential (this is highly unlikely due to use-dependent depression of NGFCs). The contribution of HCN channels to summation needs additional analysis.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Predominantly linear summation of metabotropic postsynaptic potentials follows coactivation of neurogliaform interneurons&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been evaluated by John Huguenard (Senior Editor) and a Reviewing Editor.</p><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed, as outlined below:</p><p>All the three Reviewers found that the revised manuscript is significantly improved and successfully addresses most of their criticism. Overall, all the Reviewers are convinced that this study provides an important contribution to the understanding of cortical neurogliaform cell signaling and integration of postsynaptic GABAB receptor-mediated responses.</p><p>However, the approach of applying quantal analysis to volume transmission still needs some clarification and improvement. There are still some concerns. First, the new data quantifying the amplitude of quantal events can be problematic, as the failures and successes are difficult to distinguish given the noise level. Second, the current analysis relies heavily on assuming that anatomically-detected axonal boutons are in fact functional release sites, and recent work highlights the inaccuracy of this method at least for mouse cortical synapses (Holler et al., Nature 2021).</p><p>The Authors should better describe the limitation of their model and to make less clear-cut conclusions throughout the manuscript. For example, they should remove the quantification of the distance of volume transmission from the releasing sites from the abstract. It would be also useful to include some predictions, such as the range of volume transmission if a reasonable fraction of anatomically-defined boutons were not functional.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.65634.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>I have the following specific comments.</p><p>1) The modeling data suggest that the subcellular localization of GABA-B receptor-GIRK channels determines linear summation of GABA-B receptor responses.

GABAB receptor and GIRK channel clusters localize considerably closer on membrane surface of the spines than on the shaft (Kulik et al., 2006). The distance on spines vs. shafts could lead to a distinct outcome of GABAB signaling. We admit that our model of GABAB signaling is a rather simplified reaction model that does not incorporate the many pathways of GABAB signaling: ”Admittedly, our simulations could not cover the extensive intracellular signaling pathways known to be influenced by GABAB receptors (Gassmann and Bettler, 2012; Padgett and Slesinger, 2010; Terunuma, 2018) and future availability of comprehensive transporter and extracellular space distributions of layer 1 would enrich the model (Hrabetova et al., 2018; Korogod et al., 2015; Pallotto et al., 2015).” The main aim of this model was to investigate what are the possible consequences of the domain specific localization of the receptor and channel complexes. We performed additional experiments concerning the results observed with two versus three-four action potentials, see below.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The authors evoked unitary synaptic responses by one presynaptic NGFC with low frequency of stimulation (&gt;60s interval), but when two presynaptic NGFCs were stimulated simultaneously then this interval was increased &gt;300s.

However, in this study, mechanisms potentially leading to use-dependent NGFC output were not addressed and the experiments were designed to avoid/minimize factors potentially leading to use-dependent output of interacting NGFCs. In triple recordings, one should consider the effect of GABA released from both presynaptic NGFCs acting not only on their own presynaptic terminals when activated alone, but also acting on terminals of the other NGFC in the vicinity through volume transmission (Oláh et al. 2009). In the triple recording experiments, we used to test convergent NGFC effects, blockade of GABAB receptors was not an option (we tested the summation of postsynaptic GABAB effects), thus we opted to increase the stimulus interval in order to minimize the effect of homosynaptic and heterosynaptic use dependent depression.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The HCN channel blocker ZD7288 did not alter GABA-B receptor-mediated summation.

Our main conclusion, i.e. predominantly linear summation of GABAB responses triggered by NGFCs is based not only on summation experiments shown on Figure 5, it is conjointly supported by the overall anatomical arrangement of the compound axonal structure of the population of NGFCs in the upper layers of the cortex: interaction of NGFC boutons is dominated by one or two cells with linear summation, three or more NGFCs have a relatively minor chance for potentially sublinear interaction. We emphasize this by softening the title of the manuscript (“Predominantly linear summation…”) and in additional text in the results section: “Combination of the datasets derived from the structural analyisis of GABAergic connections established by the population of layer 1 NGFCs above and the in vivo mapping of coactivated putative NGFCs suggests that summation of NGFC output is feasible and, at the same time, is dominated by GABA released from boutons of a one or two NGFCs: having approximately two-thirds of NGFCs simultaneously active further suppresses the potentially synchronous contribution of three or more NGFCs (8.5% and 8.45%, see above) already constrained by structural properties in a point of the cortex.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1) The use of BQA is justified as the authors could only record a limited number of synaptic responses. On line 98, the authors indicate that BQA estimates were in good agreement with the distribution of IPSC amplitudes (Figure 1E). The authors should provide some indication why the two are in agreement (presumably because the average synaptic current aligns with the BQA-derived estimates of p, q and n?). Also, there is no description of what the q and Nfrs in Figure 1E refer to (presumably the BQA-derived values for that particular experiment?). These are fairly minor points, but asking the reader to make assumptions about the authors' intentions makes readability perhaps more challenging than necessary.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that the most likely reason behind the apparent agreement between BQA estimates and the distribution of IPSC amplitudes is the alignment between average synaptic current and the BQA-derived estimates of p, q and n. This is accentuated by additional experiments we performed according to suggestion 2 of reviewer #3. Briefly, we made an effort to validate that the quantal feature is present in the neurogliaform output by measuring single vesicle release responses. We performed four experiments in which the use of low extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> reduced release probability to a level at which postsynaptic uniqantal events appeared in response to neurogliaform cell activation. We found that quantal amplitude among these experiments was 4.46±0.83 pA (n=4) which is statistically not different (P=0.8, Mann-Whitney Test) from quantal amplitude measured with BQA (Figure 1—figure supplement 1). The revised text is modified accordingly.</p><p>The BQA method models the amplitude distributions to estimate the quantal parameters, and in Figure 1E shows that the modeled amplitude distribution by BQA (blue distribution histogram) is nicely in line with the experimentally collected limited amount of IPSP peak amplitudes (grey bars) in a single experiment. The q and Nfrs in Figure 1E refer to the quantal size and number of functional release sites in that particular experiment. We modified the figure legend.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) In Figure 2, the authors generate model NGFC axons with axonal boutons. Are the interbouton distances uniformly set at 3.35um in the model axons? If so, is doing so consistent with bouton distribution observed in real NGFCs (i.e. Figure S1)? That is, are distal boutons dispersed more closely than proximal boutons (or vice versa)? And would such spatially-dependent dispersion alter the conclusion shown in Figure 2F (bottom)?</p></disp-quote><p>In Figure 2, the interbouton distances were set uniformly for simplicity. We did not find any correlation between interbouton intervals versus their distances from the soma. Therefore, we did not investigate how distance-dependent distribution of the NGFC boutons could alter the results.</p><fig id="sa2fig2"><label>Author response image 2.</label><caption><title>Interbouton distances along the NGFC axons.</title><p>(A) Interbouton distances versus their distances from the soma along the axonal processes.

This is a nice addition. However, it seems that a relevant quantification/evaluation is missing from the figure. That is, the authors nicely show that hind limb stimulation evokes responses in the majority of NGFCs. But how many of these neurons are co-active, and what are their spatial relationships? Figure 3D appears to begin to address this point, but it is not clear if this plot comes from a single animal, or multiple? Also, it seems that such a plot would be most relevant for the study if it only showed α-actin 2-positive cells. In short, can one conclude that nearby, presumptive NGFCs co-activate, and is this conclusion derived from multiple animals?</p></disp-quote><p>The aim of Figure 3D was to indicate that the active presumed NGFCs are located close to each other. The figure shows data from a single animal. To address the point raised by the reviewer, we revised Figure 3D and provide information about the molecular profile of the active/inactive cells. In addition, we further analyzed our in vivo dataset concerning the spatial localization of monitored interneurons (see Sup. Figure 2). The results were recorded from 4 different animals, in these experiments numerous L1 interneurons are active during the sensory stimulus as shown in the scatter plot. We calculated the shortest distances between all active cells and all ɑ-actinin2+ that were active in experiments. The data suggest that in the case of identified active ɑ-actinin2+ cells, the interneuron somats were on average 216.09 ± 77.93 µm distance from each other. Data from Figure 3 - figure supplement 1 indicates that the average axonal arborization of the NGFCs is reaching ~200-250 µm away. Taken these two datasets together, the spatial localization allows summation of outputs of neighboring NGFCs.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Regarding Figure 3, what are the criteria for responsive versus non-responsive cells. In Figure 3C, are cells 1 through ~20 responsive?</p></disp-quote><p>During the in vivo 2p Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging the monitored cells were considered responsive if there was a measurable ΔF/F fluorescent change (x3 of the standard deviation of the noise) in the averaged trace of 10 trials to ipsilateral hindlimb stimulus. We added the text to the methods section for clarity. In Figure 3C cells from 1 to 20 are considered to be responsive based on these criteria.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The analysis presented in Figure 3H shows the &quot;number of presynaptic boutons located within increasing radial distances measured from postsynaptic dendrites&quot; (line 102). If a dendrite is long cellular compartment that winds continuously through the extracellular space (i.e. not spatially discrete), then how exactly is this measurement made? As this analysis identifies a 1.5um NGFC-PC distance as most reasonable, and this distance is used as justification in later figures, it seems that a clear description of this metric is warranted. Perhaps including a schematic describing how this measurement is made would be helpful. Moreover, isn't the distance between GABA-B receptors and release sites the more relevant measure? Are GABA-B receptors expressed uniformly on PC dendrites?</p></disp-quote><p>The line 102 sentence refers to Figure 1H. The functionally connected NGFC-PC pairs from the BQA experiments were three dimensionally reconstructed using Neurolucida software and 100x objective. The NGFC boutons as possible release sites of GABA were manually marked in the proximity of the postsynaptic dendrite. In the three-dimensional space distance between the marked presynaptic release sites and the closest postsynaptic dendritic points were calculated and collected. These distances were analysed in Figure 1H and Figure 1I.</p><p>In general, in the neocortex the distal dendritic/infragranular layers show strong labeling intensities for GABAB receptors, while deeper/subgranular layers show weaker immunostaining (Fritschy et al., 1999). Similar patterns of expression can be observed along the somatodendritic axis in the CA areas of the hippocampus (Degro et al., 2015). At the subcellular level, SDS-digest freeze-fracture replica immunoelectron microscopy data on CA1 pyramidal cells show that GABA<sub>B</sub> receptors are most abundant at the perisynaptic region and extrasynaptic plasma membrane of dendritic shaft and spines (Kulik et al., 2003, Kulik et al., 2006, Degro et al., 2015). To our knowledge, there is no comprehensive study about GABA<sub>B</sub> receptor distribution on dendrites of superficial pyramidal cells in the neocortex. However, based on hippocampal data we cannot rule out the non-uniform distribution of GABA<sub>B</sub> receptors along the somatodendritic axis. We agree with the reviewer that the distance of postsynaptic GABA<sub>B</sub> receptors and presynaptic release sites would be more relevant, however, we believe that an admittedly limited model based on measurements is more useful and reproducible compared to a detailed model which is based on assumptions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) What is the rationale for performing the PC recordings in Figure 4 in current clamp? It seems that voltage-clamp would be more appropriate to evaluate summation?</p></disp-quote><p>We have chosen current clamp recordings on purpose for the summation of GABA<sub>A</sub> (Figure 4A-C) and GABA<sub>B</sub> (Figure 4D-F) responses to ensure to maintain the closest to physiological conditions knowing that driving force may alter summation of inputs (Tamas 2004). In addition, we performed new experiments of simultaneous NGFC-to-PC dual recordings with one, two, three and four spike initiation in the presynaptic NGFC (Figure 5) while holding the postsynaptic PC in voltage clamp mode. Our new results show that spike duplet activation of GABA<sub>B</sub> response measured both in current and voltage clamp measurements resulted linear summation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig3">Author response image 3</xref>).</p><fig id="sa2fig3"><label>Author response image 3.</label><caption><title>Integration of GABA<sub>B</sub> receptor-mediated synaptic currents.</title><p>(A) Representative recording of a neurogliaform synaptic inhibition on a voltage clamped pyramidal cell.

Also, the differences between the sublinear, ionotropic responses and the linear, metabotropic responses are small. Understandably, these experiments are difficult – indeed, a real tour de force – from which the authors are attempting to derive meaningful observations. Therefore, asking for more triple recordings seems unreasonable. That said, the authors may want to consider showing all control and gabazine recordings corresponding to these experiments in a supplemental figure.</p></disp-quote><p>The result section only briefly describes how we calculated the linearity; we measured the difference of calculated and experimentally recorded IPSP peak amplitudes from converging inputs. This information was added to the methods section as well to increase clarity. Following the Reviewer’s suggestion, we added two author response images that show the average IPSPs in different experiments during control condition and in the presence of gabazine (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig4">Author response image 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig5">5</xref>).</p><fig id="sa2fig4"><label>Author response image 4.</label><caption><title>Summation of convergent GABA<sub>A</sub> and GABA<sub>B</sub> receptor mediated IPSPs elicited by NGFCs.</title><p>IPSPs recorded from the postsynaptic PC under control conditions from individually (light and dark blue) and synchronously (light green) activated NGFCs.

It is not clear why the authors do not address this observation considering that it is inconsistent with the study's overall message.</p></disp-quote><p>As addressed in the general section above, our main conclusion, i.e. predominantly linear summation of GABA<sub>B</sub> responses triggered by NGFCs is based not only on summation experiments shown on Figure 5, it is conjointly supported by the overall anatomical arrangement of the compound axonal structure of the population of NGFCs in the upper layers of the cortex: interaction of NGFC boutons is dominated by one or two cells with linear summation, three or more NGFCs have a relatively minor chance for potentially sublinear interaction. Thus, the in vivo relevance of the observation shown on Figure 5C is questionable and so we stand by our conclusion. We explicitly state in the discussion that “Our experimental approach indicates linear interactions between GABAB receptor mediated responses in case the number of converging presynaptic cells corresponds to the number of NGFCs cooperating during in vivo network operations.” However, we believe it is informative to show the readers that interaction of NGFCs at the extremes of the range shows saturation. In addition, the observed differences between the experimental and modeling data in the summation inhibitory signals during 3 and 4 APs may be due to the depletion of the readily releasable pool of vesicles as we already briefly covered in the discussion. Moreover, our simulations could not cover the extensive and complex intracellular signaling pathways, which would likely have an effect on the GIRK channel activation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) Line 248: The authors imply that under physiological conditions, PCs will receive, at most, two co-active NGFC inputs. That is, linear summation is the rule under physiological conditions. Is this reasonable?</p></disp-quote><p>Yes, this is one of the major conclusions of the manuscript as discussed in our response to point 8 above.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10) Line 257: Can the authors please expand on the hypothesis they are testing with their MCell model? It is not immediately obvious to this reviewer why locally constrained GABA-B receptor-GIRK channel interactions would lead to linear summation of synaptic responses.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that the sentence can be better formulated. We changed the text to “Theoretical studies suggest that the distance between the receptor and effector limits the recruitment of effector molecules to the vicinity of receptors (Brinkerhoff et al., 2008; Kulik et al., 2006), thus we asked if summation properties were influenced by the relative location of GABA<sub>B</sub> receptors and GIRK channels when several presynaptic inputs converge.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>11) Line 273: The text here does not seem to best capture what is going on with the GABA concentration as a function of distance (Supp. Figure 4). It seems reasonable that the concentration of GABA within the synapse (i.e. point 0.0) is close to 1mM, and that it rapidly drops off with distance. It seems that the authors want to convey that [GABA] is 60uM at 0.5um and 1uM at 2.0um. Currently, the text seems to imply that NGFC-associated GABA transients can vary considerably from 1uM to 60uM, when in reality it seems that they want to say that the amount of released GABA is fairly consistent from release event to release event, but that it drops off exponentially with distance.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the suggestion and clarification. Text in the Results section was modified based on the Reviewer’s suggestion: “In our model, the amount of released GABA was consistent from release event to release event and dropped off exponentially with distance from the synapse ([GABA]: 0.0 μm, 1 mM; 0.5 μm, 60 μM; 2.0 μm, 1 μM; Supplementary Figure 6). “</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>12) Line 283-312: The description of GABA-B receptor/GIRK channel activation is quantitative, a strength of the passage. However, a general summary of the observations would be helpful. Moreover, relating the simulation results back to the original motivation for the MCell model would be very helpful (i.e. the authors asked whether &quot;linear summation was potentially a result of the locally constrained GABAB receptor – GIRK channel interaction when several presynaptic inputs converge&quot;). It seems as if performing &quot;experiments&quot; on the model wherein local constraints are manipulated would begin to address this question. Why not use the model to provide some data – albeit theoretical – that begins to address their question?</p></disp-quote><p>We re-formulated the problem to be addressed in this Results section as described in our response to point 10 above. We admit that our model has several limitations in the Discussion and, consequently, we restricted it's application to a limited set of quantitative comparisons paired to our experimental dataset or directly related to pioneering studies on GABAB efficacy on spines vs shafts. We believe that a proper answer to the reviewer’s suggestion would be worth a separate and dedicated study with an extended set of parameters and an elaborated model.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>13) Line 291-299: It seems that total GIRK channel activation follows a nearly linear summation from 1-4 action potentials. Is this modeling result inconsistent with the experimental result shown in Figure 5C?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree and added a sentence to the end of the relevant paragraph: “The increased linearity of total GIRK channel activation relative to experimental results could be a result of several unknown properties of the cascade linking GABAB receptors to GIRK channels and/or due to vesicle depletion in terminals of NGFCs during multiple rapid release of GABA not incorporated into our model.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>1. The authors should explicitly state whether there is a significant statistical difference in the linearity of the GABAA and GABAB responses (this seems likely). Most importantly, using the same approach to experimentally address underlying mechanisms of linear GABAB summation would enhance the significance of the work. As acknowledged in the discussion, there are several alternatives that have not been ruled out and the mechanism supported by the simulation seems quite speculative.</p></disp-quote><p>We statistically compared the linearity of GABAA and GABAB responses and the signals were statistically different at the level of p = 0.021, two sided MW U test. We added to the text:</p><p>“Taken together, our triple recordings in gabazine versus control conditions suggest significantly different (p = 0.021, two sided MW U test) linear interactions between slow, GABA<sub>B</sub> IPSPs as opposed to sublinearly summating fast, GABA<sub>A</sub> IPSPs elicited by the same presynaptic interneuron population.“</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. The authors make a point to apply a method of quantal analysis that allows estimation of synaptic parameters with smaller datasets than conventional quantal analysis, yet the BQA method still requires more observations than is provided in the current dataset (60 observations in each of 2 data set). This is a minor concern mitigated by the fact that quantal analysis is often undertaken without the prerequisite large data sets.</p></disp-quote><p>In the Bhumbra and Beato 2013 paper, the authors evaluated the accuracy of the BQA method with different sizes of datasets. Although the authors recommend using 60 observations in each of 2 data sets, the performance of BQA analysis, as they show in the paper, is still reasonable while only using only a limited 30 observations in each of 2 data sets.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>More importantly, the approach of Figure 1 would more convincing if the authors validated it with another QA method, or by showing that the proposed quantal size is reasonable. One option could be recording unitary IPSCs under low Pr conditions where failures dominate and thus successes are likely quantal (optimization of the recordings would likely be required). Alternatively, the authors could address whether BQA applied to volume transmission yields the expected changes in parameters following experimental manipulations of quantal size (gabazine) or release probability.</p></disp-quote><p>To follow the reviewer’s suggestion, we made an effort to validate that the quantal feature is present in neurogliaform output by measuring single vesicle release responses. We had two experiments among the BQA experiments in which using low extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> the release probability was reduced to a level at which postsynaptic uniqantal events appeared following neurogliaform cell activation. We performed two additional experiments and measured the amplitudes of the uniquantal events (Figure 1 -figure supplement 1.). We found that quantal amplitude among these experiments was 4.46±0.83 pA (n=4) which is statistically not different (P=0.8, Mann-Whitney Test) from quantal amplitude measured with BQA.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. It is also essential to assess GABA release during repetitive stimulation (Figure 5) in order to constrain the subsequent simulation in Figure 6 which assumes the same amount of GABA is released with each action potential (this is highly unlikely due to use-dependent depression of NGFCs). The contribution of HCN channels to summation needs additional analysis.</p></disp-quote><p>We briefly covered the disparity in the original discussion:</p><p>“Despite having similar summation arithmetics of two consecutive APs to the triple-recording configuration, it remains undefined as to what extent multiple presynaptic APs resemble synchronous activation of individual release sites. Presynaptic GABAB receptor-mediated decrease in ca<sup>2+</sup> is unlikely (Karayannis et al., 2010), however, depletion of the readily releasable pool of vesicles leading to synaptic depression cannot be ruled out.”</p><p>We added the following sentence to assess the differences in the simulation:</p><p>“- this may contribute to the apparent inconsistency between the simulation and the experimental data concerning summation during more than three repetitive APs, since our model does not incorporate short-term synaptic depression.”</p><p>Additional analysis concerning HCN1 channels was also requested by Reviewer#1 (major point 3), please see our answer above.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed, as outlined below:</p><p>All the three Reviewers found that the revised manuscript is significantly improved and successfully addresses most of their criticism. Overall, all the Reviewers are convinced that this study provides an important contribution to the understanding of cortical neurogliaform cell signaling and integration of postsynaptic GABAB receptor-mediated responses.</p><p>However, the approach of applying quantal analysis to volume transmission still needs some clarification and improvement. There are still some concerns.</p><p>First, the new data quantifying the amplitude of quantal events can be problematic, as the failures and successes are difficult to distinguish given the noise level.</p></disp-quote><p>We re-evaluated our uniquantal event detection dataset by measuring multiple parameters of each event. We measured the slope of fitted line on the initial phase of events/failures, amplitude (averaged maximum) and the area of events. Using K-means cluster analysis on the three parameters, we managed to separate the events into 3 groups having failures, uniquantal and multiquantal responses as separate groups. Having separated uniquantal events this way, we found that averaged quantal amplitude was 4.59±0.73 pA (n=4) which is statistically not different (P=0.68, Mann-Whitney Test) from quantal amplitude measured with BQA.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Second, the current analysis relies heavily on assuming that anatomically-detected axonal boutons are in fact functional release sites, and recent work highlights the inaccuracy of this method at least for mouse cortical synapses (Holler et al., Nature 2021).</p></disp-quote><p>Using EM tomography and serial sectioning combined with paired recordings, we concluded that rat and especially human neocortical layer 2/3 pyramidal cells use multivesicular release in their output (Molnar et al. <italic>eLife</italic> 2016). This was corroborated by Holler et al. (Nature 2021) recently and, importantly, both studies confirm that presynaptic boutons and vesicles in the readily releasable pool are essential for quantal transmission. Accordingly, we are not aware of evidence contradicting our assumption that the sites of presynaptic release are anatomically detected axonal boutons. We actually applied procedures similar to Holler et al. 2021 (paired recordings and serial EM on the recorded synapses) when studying the output of neurogliaform cells (Oláh et al. Nature 2009) and concluded that indeed, light microscopic predictions for ultrastructural synaptic contacts are inaccurate. This was crucial in putting forward the idea of single cell driven volume transmission (Oláh et al. Nature 2009).</p><p>We clarify our limitations for single or multivesicular release in the modified discussion: “However, our light microscopic methods applied in this study are insufficient for definitive claims concerning single or multivesicular release from neurogliaform boutons, especially in the light of studies highlighting the inaccuracy of comparing the number of functional release sites with the anatomical synaptic contacts detected by light microscopy (Oláh et al. Nature 2009, Molnár et al. 2016, Holler et al., 2021)”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The Authors should better describe the limitation of their model and to make less clear-cut conclusions throughout the manuscript. For example, they should remove the quantification of the distance of volume transmission from the releasing sites from the abstract. It would be also useful to include some predictions, such as the range of volume transmission if a reasonable fraction of anatomically-defined boutons were not functional.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the editors and clearly stated in the Discussion that “The distance of effective operation through NGFC driven volume transmission, however, is not clear.” We changed the abstract and in addition, we further emphasize in the revised Discussion that “Given that our distance estimates are not based on ultrastructural evidence and we cannot exclude that fraction of anatomically-defined boutons were not functional, the accuracy of our prediction for the range of volume transmission is limited.” We do not wish to speculate about the maximal range of volume transmission without supporting dataset.</p></body></sub-article></article>
