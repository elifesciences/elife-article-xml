There is growing evidence that dysbiosis of the intestinal microbiota and disruption of microbiota-host interactions contribute to the pathology of NAFLD. We previously demonstrated that gut microbiota-derived tryptophan metabolite indole-3-acetate (I3A) was decreased in both cecum and liver of high-fat diet-fed mice and attenuated the expression of inflammatory cytokines in macrophages and <italic>Tnfa</italic> and fatty acid-induced inflammatory responses in an aryl-hydrocarbon receptor (AhR)-dependent manner in hepatocytes. In this study, we investigated the effect of orally administered I3A in a mouse model of diet-induced NAFLD. Western diet (WD)-fed mice given sugar water (SW) with I3A showed dramatically decreased serum ALT, hepatic triglycerides (TG), liver steatosis, hepatocyte ballooning, lobular inflammation, and hepatic production of inflammatory cytokines, compared to WD-fed mice given only SW. Metagenomic analysis show that I3A administration did not significantly modify the intestinal microbiome, suggesting that I3A’s beneficial effects likely reflect the metabolite’s direct actions on the liver. Administration of I3A partially reversed WD-induced alterations of liver metabolome and proteome, notably, decreasing expression of several enzymes in hepatic lipogenesis and β-oxidation. Mechanistically, we also show that AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) mediates the anti-inflammatory effects of I3A in macrophages. The potency of I3A in alleviating liver steatosis and inflammation clearly demonstrates its potential as a therapeutic modality for preventing the progression of steatosis to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH).</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>liver</kwd><kwd>indole-3-acetic acid</kwd><kwd>microbiota</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100007904</institution-id><institution>Texas A and M University</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Ray B.

It is a multi-stage disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Day, 2011</xref>) that can progress from liver steatosis (characterized by macrovesicular fat deposition), which is benign and reversible (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Day, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Tiniakos et al., 2010</xref>), to more severe forms of the disease such as non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and fibrosis. Approximately 25% of individuals having liver steatosis develop NASH, which is characterized by liver inflammation, dysregulated lipid metabolism, and cell damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Tiniakos et al., 2010</xref>). A subset of NASH patients develops cirrhosis and even hepatocellular carcinoma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Calzadilla Bertot and Adams, 2016</xref>). Although significant progress has been made in understanding the pathogenesis of NAFLD, factors leading to the progression from steatosis to NASH remain poorly understood, and there are currently no pharmacological treatments available for NASH.</p><p>There is growing evidence that dysbiosis of the intestinal microbiota and disruption of microbiota-host interactions contribute to the pathology of NASH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brandl and Schnabl, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Boursier et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Loomba et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aron-Wisnewsky et al., 2020</xref>). Certain shifts in the intestinal microbiota community composition, e.g., expansion of the phyla Verrucomicrobia and Proteobacteria, correlate with NASH in both human and animal studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hoyles et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Le Roy et al., 2013</xref>). One potential mechanism linking intestinal microbiota dysbiosis and NASH is compromised intestinal barrier integrity, which promotes the translocation of bacterial products from the lumen to circulation. This can contribute directly and indirectly (through intestinal inflammation) to liver inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Saltzman et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bibbò et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Ding et al., 2019</xref>). Additionally, microbial dysbiosis alters the balance of bioactive metabolites produced by gut bacteria such as bile acids, short chain fatty acids, and aromatic amino acid derivatives, which have been shown to impact liver metabolism and inflammation in NAFLD through host receptor-mediated pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Ding et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>In our previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Krishnan et al., 2018</xref>), we demonstrated that gut microbiota-derived tryptophan metabolites indole-3-acetate (I3A) and tryptamine (TA) were decreased in both cecum and liver of high-fat diet (HFD)-fed mice compared to low-fat diet (LFD)-fed control mice (CN). In vitro, both I3A and TA attenuated the expression of inflammatory cytokines (<italic>Tnfa</italic>, <italic>Il1b,</italic> and <italic>Ccl2</italic>) in macrophages exposed to palmitate and LPS. In hepatocytes, I3A significantly attenuated <italic>Tnfa</italic> and fatty acid-induced inflammatory responses in an aryl-hydrocarbon receptor (AhR)-dependent manner. Based on these findings, we hypothesized that I3A could protect against NAFLD progression in vivo. We show that supplementation of I3A in drinking water alleviates liver steatosis and inflammation even when mice are continued on the NAFLD-inducing diet, and that these effects correlate with a decrease in both lipogenesis and β-oxidation in the liver. We also demonstrate that the anti-inflammatory effects of I3A in macrophages can be mediated by AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK).</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Oral administration of I3A alleviates diet-induced hepatic steatosis and inflammation</title><p>We utilized a mouse model of diet-induced fatty liver disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Asgharpour et al., 2016</xref>) to investigate the effect of I3A administration through drinking water (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>) on liver steatosis and inflammation. Similar to our previous finding in HFD-fed mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Krishnan et al., 2018</xref>), the levels of I3A were significantly reduced in fecal material (50% and 64% decrease at weeks 8 and 16, respectively) and the liver (70% decrease at week 16) of Western diet (WD)-fed mice compared to CN fed an LFD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>).

Next, we sought to determine if the I3A administration impacted WD-induced features of NAFLD. Compared to CN, WD-fed mice had elevated serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels, indicating liver injury. Treatment of WD-fed mice with the high dose of I3A (WD-100) significantly reduced serum ALT levels 2 weeks after beginning the I3A treatment (week 10, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>) and beyond. Additionally, I3A treatment reduced liver triglycerides (TG) in a dose-dependent manner at week 16 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Scoring of hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E)-stained liver sections indicated that the I3A treatment improved liver steatosis, hepatocyte ballooning, and lobular inflammation in a dose-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F and G</xref>).

Previously, we found that the ratio of chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) to cholic acid (CD) greatly decreased when HepG12 and AML12 cells were treated with I3A, indicating that I3A can directly alter host cell bile acid metabolism in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Krishnan et al., 2018</xref>). In the present study, mice in the WD group showed reduced liver total bile acids and CDCA-derived bile acids compared to CN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Treatment with I3A led to a further decrease in the CDCA-derived bile acids, consistent with our previous observation of I3A’s effect on hepatocytes in vitro. We also measured the concentrations of nine major free fatty acids (FFAs; Lauric acid, Myristic acid, Palmitic acid, Palmitoleic acid, Stearic acid, Oleic acid, Linoleic acid, Linolenic acid and Arachidonic acid). In the liver, WD significantly increased the total concentration of these FFAs by 2.7-fold compared to CN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Treatment with I3A had no significant effect, although the total FFA concentration trended lower in the WD-100 group (36% reduction, p=0.11, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>). The total FFA concentrations in serum were similar across all four groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>I3A administration does not significantly alter the fecal microbial community as well as fecal metabolome</title><p>Next, we investigated whether the hepatoprotective effects of I3A were due to a modification of the gut microbiome. The fecal microbial communities at week 8 of WD (prior to I3A treatment) and week 16 (at termination) were analyzed using 16S rRNA sequencing. Fecal microbiome of WD-fed mice showed reduced α-diversity compared to CN, which was not further altered upon I3A treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Similarity analysis using the Bray-Curtis dissimilarity metric showed that the microbiome compositions of CN and WD-fed mice were significantly different (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>). The fecal microbiome compositions of WD-fed mice did not change significantly upon I3A treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Analysis of fecal microbiota taxonomic profiles at the phylum and genus level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C, D</xref>) showed major shifts in bacterial abundance of fecal microbiota from WD-fed mice relative to CN. At week 16, the relative abundance of phylum Verrucomicrobia increased, whereas Bacteroidetes decreased. Linear discriminant analysis effect size (LEfSe) detected 18 taxa showing significant differences in relative abundance between the WD group and CN, including an expansion of the genus <italic>Akkermansia</italic> and reduction of family Muribaculaceae. In contrast, only three genera showed significant shifts in WD-fed mice upon I3A treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1E</xref>).</p><p>We also investigated whether administration of I3A altered the metabolic profile of the gut microbiota. Principal component analysis (PCA) of untargeted LC-MS data showed that the fecal metabolome of WD-fed mice was significantly different from CN, whereas the metabolomes of WD-100 and WD groups largely overlapped (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2A</xref>). Although permutational multivariate analysis of variance (PERMANOVA) suggested a modest difference in the variance of metabolite levels between WD-50 and WD groups, Hotelling’s T<sup>2</sup> test found that the means (centroids) were not significantly different.

Using a mouse model of WD-induced NAFLD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Asgharpour et al., 2016</xref>), we show that oral administration of I3A protects against liver injury in a dose-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>), attenuates liver triglyceride (TG) accumulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>), and reduces steatosis, hepatocyte ballooning, and lobular inflammation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F and G</xref>), suggesting that administration of I3A altered both metabolic and inflammation pathways in the liver. As expected, WD induced significant additional weight gain.

Consistent with the lobular inflammation score, there was a significant increase in the expression of inflammatory cytokines in livers of the WD group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Remarkably, treatment of WD-fed mice with I3A dose-dependently reduced the expression of every cytokine in the 13-member panel, including IL-10. The downregulation of IL-10 in I3A-treated mice could be a result of reduced hepatic inflammation (i.e. feedback regulation of IL-10 production). Whether the decrease in inflammatory cytokine production is due to I3A’s anti-inflammatory effects in liver immune cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Krishnan et al., 2018</xref>) or due to modulation of lipid metabolism in hepatocytes warrants further investigation.</p><p>Studies have shown that the alteration of bile acid metabolism could be a biomarker for NAFLD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">De Juan and Segura, 2021</xref>). Mice in the WD group had a lower total concentration of liver bile acids and higher proportion of primary bile acids compared to CN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). The latter trend is consistent with previous studies comparing bile acid profiles between NASH patients and healthy controls (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Puri et al., 2018</xref>). Compared to our previous in vitro results, the effect of I3A treatment on liver bile acids was modest, possibly due to regulatory mechanisms present in vivo. Moreover, CDCA is metabolized into muricholic acids in mice which are absent in humans and have different affinities for bile acid receptors compared to CDCA and lithocholic acid, a CDCA-derived secondary bile acid. Knockout mouse models that lack the bile acid metabolizing enzymes Cyp2c70/Cyp2a12 have bile acid pools closer to humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">de Boer et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Ueda et al., 2022</xref>). Future studies utilizing these models could help elucidate the physiological impact of I3A on liver bile acids and their role in fatty liver disease.</p><p>The observation that the fecal microbial community composition was not significantly altered by I3A administration suggests that the hepatoprotective effects of I3A are likely due to the metabolite’s direct action on the host, rather than the gut microbiota composition. One caveat to this interpretation is the shallow resolution of 16S rRNA sequencing. It is possible that I3A administration altered the microbiota composition at the species level. It is also possible that I3A could affect the metabolism of the microbiota without altering its composition. A recent study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lobel et al., 2020</xref>) showed that a diet containing high levels of methionine and cysteine protected mice against chronic kidney disease by reducing uremic toxins through post-translational modification of gut bacterial enzymes. To test the possibility that I3A administration altered the intestinal metabolome, we performed untargeted metabolomics experiments on fecal samples. The results showed no significant impact of I3A on the fecal metabolomes of WD mice. While further studies are warranted to fully elucidate the impact of I3A administration on the microbiome and microbial gene expression in the intestine, these results suggest that the partial reversal of WD-induced changes in liver metabolome and proteome by I3A treatment is due to the metabolite’s direct action on the liver.</p><p>Analysis of enzymes in lipid transport, synthesis, and mobilization showed that WD and I3A impacted different facets of lipid metabolism. Targeted proteomics detected a sixfold increase in fatty acid translocase CD36 in the WD group compared to CN, suggesting that the elevation of liver FFAs in the WD group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>) could be due to increased uptake. I3A did not affect CD36 abundance, but significantly decreased Fasn by 86%, the rate limiting enzyme in de novo lipogenesis. This suggests that the significant decrease in liver TG in the WD-100 group could reflect a downregulation of de novo lipid synthesis in the liver.</p><p>Liver fatty acid oxidation (FAO) enzymes also showed different responses to WD and I3A. Acab is a mitochondrial regulatory enzyme that produces malonyl-CoA, which inhibits carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1 (CPT1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abu-Elheiga et al., 2000</xref>). Downregulation of Acab in the WD group compared to CN suggests increased CPT1 activity and hence elevated long-chain FA (LCFA) transport into the mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Reddy and Hashimoto, 2001</xref>). This interpretation is also supported by the observation that long-chain 3-hydoxy-acyl carnitines were elevated in the WD group compared to CN, which is consistent with a recent study reporting elevated serum C14 hydroxy-acylcarnitine in NAFLD patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Enooku et al., 2019</xref>). Other mitochondrial FAO enzymes also showed a trend toward upregulation in the WD group compared to CN. Upregulation of FAO by WD was significant in the peroxisomes, the initial site of very LCFA oxidation. The literature is conflicted on FAO in human subjects with NAFLD or NASH. Depending on the study, enhanced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Sunny et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dasarathy et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Miele et al., 2003</xref>), unchanged (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Petersen et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kotronen et al., 2009</xref>), or decreased (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Croci et al., 2013</xref>) FAO has been reported. The different results may reflect varying severity of the disease (degree of steatosis or steatosis vs. NASH) and variations in FAO capacity across individual subjects. One study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">von Loeffelholz et al., 2017</xref>) showed that the expression of genes in peroxisomal and mitochondria β-oxidation was higher in patients with more severe steatosis compared to patients with less sever steatosis or healthy control. Administration of I3A significantly reduced the abundance of both mitochondrial and peroxisomal FAO enzymes. Increased FAO and concomitant ROS generation can overwhelm cellular antioxidant defenses, inducing oxidative stress. Although there is a lack of consensus regarding FAO, studies consistently report elevated markers of oxidative stress in human subjects with steatosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Palmieri et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Del Ben et al., 2014a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Del Ben et al., 2014b</xref>). In this regard, I3A may protect from oxidative stress by reducing FAO. This is consistent with our observations that I3A administration reversed the WD-induced accumulation of long-chain 3-hydroxy-acylcarnitines and that the changes in abundance of FAO enzymes were upstream of 3-hydroxy-acyl-CoAs. Oxidative stress-induced enzymes CAT and GPx were upregulated in the WD group compared to CN and downregulated in the WD-100 group compared to the WD group. It should be noted that all the biochemical parameters related to lipid metabolism were assessed at termination of the mouse experiments. It is possible that the downregulation of FAO enzymes in I3A-treated mice reflects a response to reduced lipid accumulation. Further longitudinal studies are warranted to determine the (likely) dynamic effects of I3A on the liver lipid metabolism.</p><p>Recent studies have demonstrated that tryptophan-derived gut bacterial metabolites, including I3A, are AhR agonists in intestinal epithelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Jin et al., 2014</xref>), hepatocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Krishnan et al., 2018</xref>), and immune cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">De Juan and Segura, 2021</xref>). In our previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Krishnan et al., 2018</xref>), we observed that I3A decreased the expression of Fasn and its transcriptional regulator SREBP-1c in hepatocytes in an AhR-dependent manner. In the current study, we again found that Fasn was downregulated by I3A treatment. Additionally, we observed a dose-dependent upregulation of hepcidin in mice treated with I3A. Previously, tryptophan-derived metabolites indoxyl sulfate and kynurenine have been shown to induce hepcidin expression in HepG2 cells in an AhR-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hamano et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Eleftheriadis et al., 2016</xref>). Hamp is a master regulator of systemic iron homeostasis that binds to ferroportin and inhibits the absorption of dietary iron and efflux of iron from liver resident macrophages. Iron overload is common among NAFLD patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Datz et al., 2017</xref>), and the excess iron along with inflammation can induce hepcidin in these patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Vela, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Zhou and Qiu, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Senates et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Mitsuyoshi et al., 2009</xref>). However, hepcidin gene expression decreases when NAFLD progresses to NASH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Mitsuyoshi et al., 2009</xref>), suggesting that disease progression is linked to impaired regulation of iron metabolism. Hepcidin knockout in a mouse model of NAFLD ameliorated steatosis while exacerbating fibrosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lu et al., 2016</xref>). In contrast, hepcidin overexpression decreased choline-deficient diet-induced steatosis, inflammation, and fibrosis in a mouse model of NASH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chen et al., 2022</xref>). Whether I3A induction of hepcidin ameliorates iron overload and how this could contribute to I3A’s protective role needs to be investigated.</p><p>Another set of WD-induced metabolic alterations that were reversed by I3A treatment and likely mediated through the AhR are restorations of tryptophan metabolite levels. Studies in hepatocytes have shown that AhR knockdown downregulates tryptophan 2,3-dioxygenase, kynurenine 3-monooxygenase, and kynureninase, enzymes that direct flux into the kynurenine branch of tryptophan metabolism. Another study reported that kynurenine activation of the AhR upregulated expression of indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 2 in dendritic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Li et al., 2016</xref>). In the present study, I3A treatment of WD-fed mice directed flux of tryptophan into kynurenic, anthranilic, and xanthurenic acids, reducing flux toward niacin and nicotinamide. Given that kynurenine, kynurenic acid, anthranilic acid, and xanthurenic acid are all AhR agonists, this could have further enhanced AhR activation by I3A treatment.</p><p>In macrophages, however, I3A’s effects were independent of AhR activity, as addition of the AhR inhibitor did not alter the effects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). Studies in HFD-fed mice showed dysregulation of liver AMPK activity and its association with increased lipid accumulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Muse et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Sag et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Wu et al., 2007</xref>). In vitro, LPS-activated macrophage showed upregulation of heme oxygenase-1, an AMPK-regulated protein, upon I3A exposure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Ji et al., 2020</xref>). Based on these reports, we investigated if AMPK was involved in mediating the response to I3A. We show that both liver AMPK expression and phosphorylation were reduced in WD-fed mice relative to CN, and that administration of I3A rescued both AMPK expression and phosphorylation in a dose-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Using an in vitro model, we demonstrate a similar AMPK dependence of I3A’s anti-inflammatory effect in murine macrophages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Whether AMPK signaling plays a role in mediating I3A’s effects in hepatocytes in vivo and whether this is important relative to I3A’s activation of the AhR warrants further investigation.</p><p>In summary, we have shown that oral administration of a microbiota-derived tryptophan metabolite, I3A, in WD-fed mice alleviates diet-induced liver steatosis and inflammation, even when the mice were continued on WD. These hepatoprotective effects occurred without significant alterations in the gut microbiome composition and metabolome profiles, suggesting that I3A acted directly on host cells. Untargeted LC-MS experiments showed activation of several AhR-regulated pathways, suggesting that I3A’s effects are partially mediated through this nuclear receptor. Additionally, in vivo results show a correlation between AMPK phosphorylation and the efficacy of I3A, while our in vitro studies with RAW macrophages show that AMPK mediates I3A’s attenuation of pro-inflammatory cytokine expression. While our results do not rule out the involvement of additional signaling pathways in both hepatocytes and macrophages, or interactions between the liver and other tissues (e.g. adipose tissue), the data nevertheless strongly point to I3A directly modulating lipid metabolism and inflammatory cytokine production in the liver.</p><p>Recently, several other studies reported on the protective effects of I3A in various mouse models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Zhang et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Ji et al., 2019</xref>). However, there are significant differences between the other studies and our work. The prior studies modeled steatosis using short-term (&lt;4 weeks) HFD exposure, whereas we modeled the later stages of NAFLD (i.e. with steatosis and inflammation) utilizing long-term (16 weeks) exposure to WD and SW. Moreover, in contrast to the other studies, I3A was administered concurrently with WD and SW for the last 8 weeks of the study. Despite the differences in the study design, the common conclusion from the above studies and our work is that I3A administration decreases hepatic TG. In addition, our study shows that administration of I3A significantly decreases hepatic inflammation and lipid metabolism with minimal modulation of the gut microbiome composition and metabolic function. Mechanistically, we also show that I3A’s anti-inflammatory effects in RAW 264.7 macrophages are mediated through activation of AMPK, whereas its effects in hepatocytes are mediated through the AhR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Krishnan et al., 2018</xref>). Thus, demonstrating that I3A elicits protective effects in NAFLD through two signaling pathways in different cell types is a novel and significant finding from our study.</p><p>Based on our data, we propose a model describing I3A’s effects in the liver (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3</xref>). While additional studies are warranted to investigate the above-mentioned possibilities, the remarkable potency of I3A in alleviating steatosis and inflammation in a therapeutic model clearly demonstrates the potential for developing I3A as an inherently safe treatment option for NAFLD. To this end, preclinical studies should be conducted to evaluate delivery options such as botanical extracts and probiotics, while human subject studies should be performed to determine safety, tolerability, and side effects of I3A. Prospectively, other tryptophan-derived microbiota metabolites as well as diets that result in enhanced production of these metabolites in the GI tract could also be investigated for protection against WD-induced hepatic steatosis and inflammation.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Study design</title><p>The overall objective of the study was to investigate if I3A can alleviate diet-induced liver steatosis and inflammation in vivo.

Samples were centrifuged at 20,000 × <italic>g</italic> for 15 min at 4°C. The lipid layer was removed by pipetting and the supernatant was transferred into a new tube. The centrifugation and lipid removal steps were repeated three times. The supernatant was transferred into a new tube and the total protein concentration was measured with the BCA protein assay (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). A panel of 13 cytokines was quantified with a bead-based ELISA kit (BioLegend, San Diego, CA, USA) following the manufacturer’s protocol. Cytokine concentrations (pg/ml) were normalized to the corresponding sample total protein concentration (mg protein/mg tissue).</p></sec><sec id="s4-16"><title>RAW 264.7 macrophage culture</title><p>RAW 264.7 murine macrophages were cultured in a humidified incubator at 37°C and 5% CO<sub>2</sub> using DMEM supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated FBS, penicillin (200 U/ml), and streptomycin (200 μg/ml). Cells were passaged every 2–3 days and used within 10 passages after thawing. For the two-hit model experiment, RAW 264.7 cells were seeded into 24-well plates at a density of 2×10<sup>5</sup> cells/ml and then treated with 1 mM I3A, followed by palmitate and LPS as reported before (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Krishnan et al., 2018</xref>). For the p-AMPK activation experiment, RAW 264.7 cells were treated with 1 mM AICAR for 4 hr, followed by addition of 300 µM palmitate complexed with BSA. Following an 18 hr incubation, the cells were treated with 10 ng/ml LPS for another 6 hr.</p></sec><sec id="s4-17"><title>RNA extraction and qRT-PCR</title><p>Total RNA was extracted from RAW 264.7 cell pellets using the EZNA Total RNA Kit (Omega Bio-Tek, Norcross, GA, USA).

Fold-change values were calculated using the 2<sup>-ΔΔCt</sup> method, with β-actin as the housekeeping gene.

The protein concentration was determined using the BCA Protein Assay Kit (Pierce). Protein samples were denatured with SDS and ~10 μg of protein was separated on a 10% SDS-PAGE gel. Proteins were transferred to a PVDF membrane (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) by wet-transfer electrophoresis. Non-fat milk (5%) in TBST solution was used to block non-specific binding. The blots were probed with appropriate primary antibodies (p-AMPK: 2535, total AMPK: 2603, β-actin: 12620, Cell Signaling Technology) and secondary antibody (anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody, 7074, Cell Signaling Technology). Proteins bound by both primary and secondary antibodies were visualized by chemiluminescence after incubating the blot with Clarity Max Western ECL Blotting Substrate (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA). Blot images were acquired on a ChemiDoc gel imaging system (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA). Proteins were quantified by normalizing the intensity of the protein band of interest to the intensity of the β-actin band in the same lane using the Image Lab software (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA).</p></sec><sec id="s4-19"><title>Small interfering RNA transfection</title><p>Raw 264.7 cells were seeded into 6-well or 24-well plates at ~30% confluence and cultured for 24 hr prior to transfection.

After 24 hr, the medium was replaced with siRNA-free growth medium and incubated for an additional 24–72 hr. The transfection efficiency was determined by monitoring the AMPK mRNA and protein levels using qRT-PCR and western blot, respectively.</p></sec><sec id="s4-20"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Determination of significant difference in the level of a metabolite between two experimental groups used the Student’s t-test with FDR correction. KEGG pathway enrichment analysis of metabolomics data was performed using MetaboAnalyst 5.0 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Pang et al., 2022</xref>). PCA and PLS-DA of the metabolomics and proteomics data were conducted using the mixOmics R package (v6.10.9). Ellipses drawn to represent 95% confidence regions assumed Gaussian distribution of latent variables (for PLS-DA) or scores (for PCA). Significance of separation between treatment groups was determined by calculating a standardized Euclidean distance matrix on the coordinates of latent variables or scores and performing a pairwise PERMANOVA with 999 permutations on the distance matrix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Anderson, 2017</xref>) and Hotelling’s T<sup>2</sup> tests. A p-value of 0.05 was set as the significance threshold for all statistical comparisons. Heatmaps for liver metabolome (only significantly changed features), fecal metabolome, and liver proteome were generated with auto-scaled data. The features were clustered using the k-means method with Pearson correlation as the similarity metric. For protein analysis, a VIP score was calculated for each protein based on the PLS-DA result, and proteins with a VIP score &lt;1.2 were excluded from the clustering analysis to avoid overfitting. KEGG pathway enrichment analysis of proteomics data was performed using clusterProfiler R package (v3.14.3).</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Conceptualization, Formal analysis, Investigation, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Formal analysis, Writing – original draft</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Investigation, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Investigation, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Formal analysis</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Formal analysis, Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con8"><p>Formal analysis, Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con9"><p>Conceptualization, Supervision, Visualization, Writing – original draft, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con10"><p>Conceptualization, Supervision, Visualization, Writing – original draft, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>All procedures were performed in accordance with Texas A&amp;M University Health Sciences Center Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee guidelines under an approved animal use protocol (AUP #2017-0145).</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s6"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="supp1"><label>Supplementary file 1.</label><caption><title>Chromatography gradient method for untargeted LC-MS metabolomics.</title><p>Solvent A was formic acid solution in water (0.1% vol/vol).

Utilization of known AhR ligands as controls will strengthen the interpretation of the conclusions.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that AhR ligands could be used as controls for delineating structure-activity relationships and cell context-specific effects. However, such studies are beyond the scope of the current manuscript. The AhR has many endogenous ligands, including several tryptophan derived metabolites, that have been shown to elicit different responses depending on the dose and cell type. Our unpublished data show that the expression of AhR target genes such as Cyp1a1, Cyyp2e1, and Tiparp were not modulated by I3A in RAW cells, which suggests that the observed effects may occur independent of the AhR.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2:</bold></p><p>Specific comments:</p><p>1. The title is misleading &quot;Microbially-derived indole-3-actate&quot; suggests that this article is about the production of I3A by the gut microbiota, in fact this is a dietary supplementation article. The title needs to reflect this fact.</p></disp-quote><p>Our title reflects the natural source of I3A in mice. We used oral supplementation to study the effects of this metabolite. Per suggestion by the reviewer, we changed the title as follows:</p><p>“Oral supplementation of gut microbial metabolite indole-3-acetate alleviates diet-induced steatosis and inflammation in mice”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2). The description of the amount of I3A in the drinking water is not properly described. The actual concentration in the drinking water should be given.</p></disp-quote><p>The concentration of I3A in drinking water was as follows: WD50 = 0.5mg/ml and WD100 = 1mg/ml. We added this information in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. The serum concentration data of I3A is critical data and should be moved in Figure 1.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now included serum levels of I3A as part of Figure 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. The authors should have determined the actual concentration of indole-3-actetate in serum by running a standard curve of I3A during the LC-MS analysis. Also, recovery and matrix effects should be determined. Without this information their data will be difficult to compare to other studies.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that quantification of I3A in serum would be useful. However, we are unable to do so due to limited sample available as well as concerns with sample integrity after long-term storage.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. In the data in Figure S1C, there appears to be only 2-3 mice out of nine that exhibit a difference in serum indole-3-acetate levels between the WD-50 and WD-100. Do the authors have an explanation for this small difference compared to the other endpoints assessed?</p></disp-quote><p>The serum I3A measurements at week 16 are a snapshot that may not reflect tissue levels due to differences in water intake, I3A metabolism in the body, and/or elimination of I3A. The other phenotypic assays are physiological measurements that reflect the result of sustained administration of I3A.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. Since the Ah receptor may play a role in the results obtained CYP1A1 mRNA levels in the liver and intestinal tract should have been measured.</p></disp-quote><p>We measured alterations in Cyp1a1 mRNA in the liver and no significant change was observed in the WD50 and WD100 groups relative to controls. Also, see response to reviewer 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. The main mechanistic experiment performed is shown in Figure 6 and the figure legend states that they are examining macrophages, but these are cell lines, they are macrophages models, and this should be clearly stated. The first two panels are liver data, so the title of the figure legend needs to reflect that fact.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree and have changed the title of Figure 6 to “I3A modulates AMPK phosphorylation and suppresses RAW 264.7 macrophage cell inflammation in an AMPK dependent manner”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. In Figure 6, 1 mM I3A is added to the cells, how is this very high concentration relevant to the concentrations observed in vivo? Does adding 1 mM acetate to the cell culture media lower the pH of the media and could this influence the results obtained? Would acetic acid yield the same results? Could treatment with an acid even explain in vivo results?</p></disp-quote><p>It is difficult to match the concentration of I3A in the in vitro experiments to liver tissue concentrations. Addition of 1 mM I3A did not lower the pH of cell culture media or reduce the viability of cultured RAW 264.7 macrophages. As I3A is not known to degrade into acetic acid and indole, we do not expect acetic acid to recapitulate the effects elicited by I3A.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #3:</bold></p><p>My primary concern with the manuscript is the organization and interpretation of the data. It appears that little effort was given by the authors on interpreting the data and digesting it for the reader into a coherent package. Rather, the authors have collected a vast amount of data and organized it without much thought about what the reader would take away from it. Furthermore, it seems the authors have taken this as an opportunity to overload this manuscript with data that are superfluous to the conclusions the authors draw at the end. Based on this, I think the authors need to invest more time into distilled their complex biological data into a unifying scientific interpretation for the readers that advances our understanding of I3A. My suggestions for the authors are described below.</p><p>1. The data lack a rationale behind how they are organized within the manuscript. For example, the authors will combine disparate biological pathways and lump data together without logic as in Figure 2. Why are inflammatory pathways and bile acid synthesis combined in a figure? What was the rationale?</p></disp-quote><p>We respectfully disagree that the data are presented without rationale. Both inflammation and bile acid dysregulation are commonly observed with NAFLD and thus are presented in two separate panels of Figure 2 (A, inflammatory cytokines, and B bile acids).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. The authors give very little effort to performing integrative omics analysis even though multi-omics is provided. Example given, the authors provide proteomic data on the fatty acid metabolism pathway, however, no mention of this pathway within the metabolomic dataset. Vice versa, the authors provide in depth investigation in the metabolic changes within the tryptophan pathway, however, no investigation into the proteomic changes that may underlie this phenomenon. It would be recommended that the authors invest more energy into performing more in-depth analysis of their multi-omics data presented.</p></disp-quote><p>We attempted to co-analyze the proteomic and metabolomic data, but this analysis was not informative. Protein and metabolite abundances do not necessarily correlate, and the two types of omics data carry different observation biases. For example, label-free, untargeted proteomics data favor abundant proteins, whereas untargeted metabolomics data are influenced by concentration and ionization efficiency, among other factors. Therefore, we opted to analyze the two datasets independently, and then linked the findings from the two analyses using biological pathways as guides. For example, we describe changes in acyl-carnitine and discuss how this observation is consistent with changes in abundance of fatty acid metabolism enzymes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. Figures 1&amp;2 shows that low dose treatment reduces inflammation but does not alter hepatic TG levels. This is in direct disagreement with the graphical model provided by the authors (Supp. Fig 9). In the author's model, I3A is directing hepatic lipid metabolism through modulation of macrophage inflammation. This interpretation is erroneous and needs to be reevaluated by the authors. Furthermore, the tryptophan pathway and bile acid pathways are not even represented in the model, which begs the question of why that data are included in the manuscript to begin with.</p></disp-quote><p>We would like to respectfully point out that Figure 1D does show a statistically significant (p &lt; 0.05) difference in liver TG between the WD and WD100 groups. Supp. Figure S9 is meant to be a summary of the main biochemical changes elicited by I3A that we have shown in the current study (e.g., the involvement of AMPK) rather an atlas of all the changes detected in the metabolomics and proteomic data. Specifically, we have not included the tryptophan or bile acid pathways as we do not have mechanistic information on how these changes are mediated by I3A.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. The authors switch from hepatocytes to macrophages without giving any rationale, The authors need to invest more time into describing a logical flow of thought when assembling the manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>We mention the rationale for investigating the effect of I3A on macrophages in the introduction (last paragraph of the section): “In vitro, both I3A and TA attenuated the expression of inflammatory cytokines (Tnfα, Il-1β and Mcp-1) in macrophages exposed to palmitate and LPS.”. We also explain why we used an in vitro model, RAW cells, at the beginning of the corresponding Results section: “Since our previous study found that the metabolic effects of I3A in hepatocytes depend on the AhR, we tested if this was also the case in macrophages.” Moreover, the strong effects of I3A on liver inflammatory cytokines also motivates the macrophage experiments.</p></body></sub-article></article>
