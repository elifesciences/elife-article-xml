Subsequent migration of cerebellar neurons is disrupted, associated with disordered radial glial morphology. In vitro, SDF1α, a direct Foxc1 target also expressed in the head mesenchyme, acts as a cerebellar radial glial mitogen and a chemoattractant for nascent Purkinje cells.

In a relatively common neurological disorder called Dandy-Walker malformation, part of the cerebellum doesn't develop and the posterior fossa is abnormally large.</p><p>One contributing factor to Dandy-Walker malformation is the loss of a protein called Foxc1. This protein is a so-called transcription factor, meaning it activates other genes, and so it has various important roles in helping an embryo to develop. In mouse embryos<italic>,</italic> the gene that produces Foxc1 is not activated in the developing cerebellum itself, but rather in the adjacent mesenchyme, a primitive embryonic tissue that will develop into the membranes that cover the brain and the skull bones that define the posterior fossa. This led Haldipur et al. to propose that the mesenchyme and the cerebellum communicate with each other as they develop.</p><p>To investigate this idea, Haldipur et al. carefully analysed how the development of the mouse cerebellum goes awry when Foxc1 is absent. This revealed that Foxc1-deficient mice have lower numbers of a type of cell called radial glial cells in their cerebellum. These are ‘progenitor’ cells that develop into the various types of cell found in the cerebellum, and also act as a scaffold for other neurons to migrate across. Therefore, the loss of radial glial cells in Foxc1-deficient mice substantially disrupts how the cerebellum develops, and how the neurons in the cerebellum work.</p><p>One gene activated by the Foxc1 protein encodes another protein called SDF1-alpha. This protein is released from the tissue that will develop into the posterior fossa, and binds to a receptor protein that is present on radial glial cells in the cerebellum. When this binding occurs, the radial glial cells grow and divide, and so the embryo's cerebellum also grows. Haldipur et al. found that mouse embryos specifically missing this receptor develop many of the abnormalities seen in Foxc1-deficient mice and further, when SDF1-alpha was provided back into Foxc1-deficient cerebella, the defects were rescued. This suggests that the cerebellar defects caused by the loss of Foxc1 stem from disrupting the signalling pathways that are triggered by the interaction between SDF1-alpha and its receptor.</p><p>These studies highlight that the brain does not develop in isolation. It is strongly dependent on the signals it receives from the embryonic mesenchyme that surrounds it. Identifying these signals and understanding how they can be disrupted by both genetic and non-genetic causes, such as inflammation, may be key to understanding this important class of brain birth defects.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.03962.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.03962.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>neurodevelopmental disorder</kwd><kwd>radial glia</kwd><kwd>cerebellum</kwd><kwd>Cxcl12</kwd><kwd>foxc1</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health (NIH)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01NS072441</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Millen</surname><given-names>Kathleen J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health (NIH)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01NS080390</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Millen</surname><given-names>Kathleen J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The mesenchyme surrounding the developing brain plays a significant role in controlling the fundamental growth and patterning of the cerebellum, and misregulation of this signalling can lead to important neurodevelopmental disorders.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Dandy-Walker malformation, the most common congenital human cerebellar malformation, is defined by cerebellar vermis hypoplasia, an enlarged fourth ventricle and an enlarged posterior fossa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Parisi and Dobyns, 2003</xref>). Heterozygous loss of the <italic>Foxc1</italic> gene contributes to DWM. Although loss of this transcription factor causes significant developmental cerebellar pathology in humans and mice, in mice, its expression is limited to vascular pericytes within the developing cerebellum. In contrast, <italic>Foxc1</italic> is widely expressed in the posterior fossa mesenchyme surrounding the cerebellar anlage beginning after e12.5 in mice. We therefore hypothesized that disrupted <italic>Foxc1</italic>-dependent signalling from the posterior fossa head mesenchyme to the adjacent developing cerebellum is key to the DWM phenotype. We previously reported reduced mesenchymal expression of several secreted factors in the mouse Foxc1 e12.5 mutant posterior fossa including Bmp 2, 4 and SDF1α (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aldinger et al., 2009</xref>). However, <italic>Foxc1</italic> mutant cerebellar developmental abnormalities were not fully investigated and the relevance of these mesenchymal expression changes remained unexplored.</p><p>The cerebellar anlage derived from dorsal rhombomere 1 is initially established by Fgf8 and other signalling molecules originating from the isthmic organizer, a transient embryonic mid/hindbrain junction at neural tube closure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Nakamura et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Basson and Wingate, 2013</xref>). Initial neurogenesis in the cerebellar anlage occurs in two distinct germinal zones. The cerebellar ventricular zone gives rise to waves of GABAergic neurons including cerebellar Purkinje cells which migrate radially away from the ventricular zone into the developing cerebellar cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Seto et al., 2014</xref>). The cerebellar rhombic lip gives rise to cerebellar glutamatergic neurons including cerebellar granule neuron progenitors (GNPs), which migrate tangentially over the developing anlage to form the external granule layer (EGL). From the EGL, newly born granule cells migrate inward radially to form the mature internal granule layer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Millen and Gleeson, 2008</xref>). Extrinsic signalling has previously been implicated in some aspects of mouse cerebellar development. Transventricular Shh from the choroid plexus regulates cerebellar ventricular zone proliferation from e14.5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Huang et al., 2010</xref>). Mesenchymal Bmp signals induce the cerebellar rhombic lip around e10.5 in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alder et al., 1996</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fernandes et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Tong and Kwan, 2013</xref>). Additionally, meningeal SDF1α has a chemoattractive role in both the tangential migration of GNPs away from the rhombic lip to form the EGL from e12.5, as well as a later role in maintaining their proliferative niche adjacent at the pial surface within the EGL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hartmann et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Ma et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Zou et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Klein et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Reiss et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Zhu et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Vilz et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Tiveron and Cremer, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Yu et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>To investigate which events of cerebellar development are disrupted by loss of <italic>Foxc1</italic>–dependent secreted factors, we first undertook an extensive phenotypic analysis of <italic>Foxc1−/−</italic> embryonic cerebellar development. This analysis uncovered a dramatic deficit in cerebellar ventricular zone radial glial cell proliferation and differentiation during early cerebellar anlage development. Using a combination of in vitro and in vivo assays, we next determined that SDF1α, a direct transcriptional target of Foxc1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Zarbalis et al., 2012</xref>) is a major effector of Foxc1 cerebellar pathogenesis. SDF1α secreted by the posterior fossa mesenchyme acts through Cxcr4 in cerebellar radial glial cells to drive their proliferation and hence embryonic cerebellar anlage growth. We also show that SDF1α−Cxcr4 signalling is required to maintain the radial glial scaffold for ventricular zone derived neuronal migration. These studies dramatically expand the known roles of SDF1α-Cxcr4 signalling to encompass almost every major developmental program of cerebellar development.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Loss of mesenchymal <italic>Foxc1</italic> reduces proliferation and increases differentiation in the embryonic cerebellar ventricular zone</title><p><italic>Foxc1</italic> expression is initiated in the head mesenchyme adjacent to the developing cerebellum at e12.5.

The VZ was identified as a layer of cells directly lining the fourth ventricle. Ki67 staining confirmed the boundary of the VZ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). In wild-type animals, proliferation is normally downregulated across these time points as the ventricular zone becomes depleted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Sudarov et al., 2011</xref>) (Compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref> to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1K</xref>). Dramatically, at e13.5, <italic>Foxc1</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> mutants demonstrated a twofold reduction of ventricular zone proliferation, compared to e13.5 wild-type animals. At e15.5, ventricular zone proliferation was also significantly lower in <italic>Foxc1</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> mutants compared to control animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I–M</xref>).</p><p>Reduced proliferation in <italic>Foxc1</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> mutants was accompanied by a concomitant substantial increase in differentiation as visualized by β-III Tubulin expression, an early marker of differentiating neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brazelton et al., 2000</xref>). This was readily apparent in <italic>Foxc1</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> mutants at e13.5 with extensive differentiating neurons distributed throughout the mutant anlage at this early stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1O</xref>). In contrast, wild-type animals at a comparable stage exhibited β-III Tubulin antibody staining almost entirely restricted to the nuclear transitory zone containing differentiating RL derived neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1N</xref>, NTZ). In e15.5 wild-type animals, the β-III Tubulin positive cells were widely distributed within the developing anlage, however a β-III Tubulin negative region consisting of two to three layers of cells defined the ventricular zone at this stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1P,P′</xref>). In striking contrast, the mutant ventricular zone was occupied by numerous β-III Tubulin–positive cells in e15.5 <italic>Foxc1</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> mutant animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1Q,Q′</xref>). Together, these data demonstrate that loss of Foxc1 does not just disrupt the cerebellar rhombic lip which is adjacent to the head mesenchyme where Foxc1 is normally expressed. Rather, loss of Foxc1 profoundly disrupts all early cerebellar progenitor zones.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Abnormal Purkinje cell migration in <italic>Foxc1</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> mutant embryonic cerebellum</title><p>Cerebellar Purkinje cells are generated between e10.5 and e13.5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Sudarov et al., 2011</xref>) and migrate out of the ventricular zone beginning at e14.5.

Since we observed Purkinje cell migration deficits in <italic>Foxc1</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> mutants, we assessed if SDF1α has yet another role, acting as a pial surface chemoattractant to differentiating ventricular zone derived cells. Indeed, SDF1α significantly increased the number of e13.5 dissociated cerebellar cells that migrated through a membrane in a standard transwell migration assay. Further, addition of AMD 3100 to cells in the upper chamber significantly reduced the number of migrating cells. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G,H</xref>). To confirm that the cells that were responsive to SDF1α responsive cells were indeed cells arising from the ventricular zone and not just the rhombic lip, we performed a matrigel migration assay using explanted e13.5 cerebellar anlage where ventricular zone derived cells were lineally labelled by a Td-tomato reporter (Ptf1a cre/+; Ai14) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4I</xref>).

Concurrently, there was an extensive increase in numbers of differentiated β-III tubulin positive cells at e13.5 and e15.5.

(<bold>I</bold>) Schematic of a sagittal section of the embryonic mouse cerebellum. In the WT cerebellum, mesenchymal Foxc1 controls the expression of several secreted factors such as SDF1α and Bmp2,4. SDF1α binds to its receptor Cxcr4 which is widely expressed in the RL, ventricular zone and EGL. SDF1α induces proliferation in the cerebellar ventricular zone. Not only is it required to maintain radial glia and their processes, it also functions as a chemoattractant to neurons migrating away from the ventricular zone. In the RL, Bmps maintain the progenitor pool, and SDF1α acts to attract the GC progenitors from the RL to form the EGL, thereby maintaining these progenitors at the pial surface. (<bold>J</bold>) In the <italic>Foxc1</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> cerebellum, deletion of <italic>Foxc1</italic> leads to a significant downregulation of SDF1α and Bmps. A reduction in SDF1α expression causes reduced ventricular zone proliferation, increased differentiation and abnormal migration. Increased cell death and dysmorphic radial glial fibers are also observed. GCs migrating out of the RL into the EGL follow abnormal paths away from the pial surface into the interior of the cerebellar anlage. Absence of this chemoattractant leads to a buildup of cells along the ventricular zone and RL.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.03962.011">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.03962.011</ext-link></p></caption><graphic xlink:href="elife-03962-fig7-v2.tif"/></fig></p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Loss of <italic>Foxc1</italic> is associated with Dandy-Walker malformation, the most common congenital malformation of the human cerebellum. Although extensive cerebellar pathology results from the loss of <italic>Foxc1</italic>, in the mouse, <italic>Foxc1</italic> is not highly expressed in the cerebellar anlage, but rather is expressed in the posterior fossa mesenchyme overlying the developing cerebellar anlage beginning at e12.5. This finding leads to the hypothesis that disrupted mesenchyme to brain signalling caused the <italic>Foxc1</italic> mutant cerebellar phenotype. We previously reported disorganization of the cerebellar RL and nascent EGL located directly adjacent to the mesenchyme by e14.5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aldinger et al., 2009</xref>). We now find that the cerebellar ventricular zone is not insulated from loss of <italic>Foxc1</italic> despite its distance from the posterior fossa mesenchyme. Indeed, <italic>Foxc1</italic> null mutants have an early and devastating reduction in ventricular zone radial glial cell proliferation, increased cell death and increased differentiation at e13.5, 1 day after failure of normal initiation of expression of <italic>Foxc1</italic> in the posterior fossa mesenchyme. At later stages, residual ventricular zone derived Purkinje cells in the mutant display migratory deficits which correlate with loss of radial glial fibers which normally serve as a scaffold for neuronal migration. Using in vitro and in vivo assays, we demonstrated that SDF1α, a direct target of Foxc1 in head mesenchyme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Zarbalis et al., 2012</xref>), via its receptor, Cxcr4 is a major effector of Foxc1-dependent mesenchymal signalling. Cxcr4 is expressed in ventricular zone progenitors, including the radial glial fibers and their endfeet which associate with the developing pia. Loss of cerebellar Cxcr4 largely phenocopies the <italic>Foxc1</italic> null phenotype and the <italic>Foxc1</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> phenotype can be rescued by the addition of SDF1α. Together, our data demonstrates SDF1α-Cxcr4 signalling is a major downstream effector of mesenchymal Foxc1 function and is required to maintain both radial glial proliferative and scaffolding functions in the early cerebellar anlage.</p><p>Head mesenchyme is a mixture of head mesoderm and head neural crest cells which surrounds the developing brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Yoshida et al., 2008</xref>). It differentiates to form all structures between the brain and the epidermis, including the meninges which secretes the pial basement membrane the skull and the skin dermis. Signalling from the head mesenchyme and its derivatives to the developing brain has been implicated in a number of important developmental processes from brain regionalization during early neural plate and neural tube stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">LaMantia et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Le Douarin et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Andoniadou and Martinez-Barbera, 2013</xref>) through the regulation of tangential migration of Cajal Retzius cells and cortical interneurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kwon et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Zarbalis et al., 2012</xref>). Physical interactions between the pial surface and the end-feet of radial glial cells are also known to be required for radial glial survival, proliferation as well as maintenance of radial fiber morphology to direct the radial migration of neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Radakovits et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Siegenthaler and Pleasure, 2011</xref>). The molecular identities of these mesenchymally-derived signals are beginning to be elucidated. For example, Bmp, Fgf and Wnts are coordinately required to induce and then caudalize the neural plate and neural tube (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Andoniadou and Martinez-Barbera, 2013</xref>). SDF1α, a chemokine has been shown to regulate tangential migration of cortical neurons. Intact integrins and laminins are required in the pial basement maintain contact with radial glial endfeet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Radakovits et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>To begin to elucidate the nature of Foxc1-dependent posterior fossa head mesenchymal signalling to the developing cerebellum, we previously reported downregulation of a number of genes encoding secreted molecules in Foxc1 null posterior mesenchyme at e12.5 including Bmps 2 and 4 and SDF1α (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aldinger et al., 2009</xref>). SDF1α is a direct target of Foxc1 in head mesenchyme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Zarbalis et al., 2012</xref>). We have now demonstrated that in vitro, SDF1α could induce cerebellar progenitor proliferation and the migration of neurons; an effect which could be blocked by AMD3100, an antagonist of the Cxcr4 receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Rosenkilde et al., 2004</xref>). In vivo, published in situ data together with new protein expression analysis demonstrated the presence of Cxcr4 in the cerebellar ventricular zone throughout embryogenesis. In contrast, extensive in situ analysis failed to detect expression of any Bmp receptor activity in the cerebellar ventricular zone at relevant stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Machold et al., 2007</xref>) (data not shown). Further, Bmp2 and 4 could not alter migration of ventricular zone derived neurons in in vitro assays at e13.5. Thus, SDF1α became a high priority candidate for further analysis.</p><p>Notably, SDF1α and Cxcr4 have previously been implicated in cerebellar granule cell development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Ma et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Zou et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Klein et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Reiss et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Zhu et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Vilz et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Yu et al., 2010</xref>). SDF1α expressed in the meninges functions as chemoattractant to direct granule neuron progenitors away from the RL to the surface of the anlage to form the EGL. In the early postnatal cerebellum, SDF1α also exerts an influence on GNPs of the outer EGL which lie directly underneath the pial surface. Loss of SDF1α or Cxcr4 in the cerebellum causes GNPs to prematurely leave their EGL proliferative niche, resulting in ectopic proliferation and dramatic disruptions of the laminar structure of the resultant cerebellum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Ma et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Zou et al., 1998</xref>). Our results now considerably expand the role of SDF1α-Cxcr4 signalling in the developing cerebellum to include almost all aspects of radial glial function including proliferation, survival and maintenance of radial morphology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>).</p><p>Although the focus of previous studies of SDF1α-Cxcr4 signalling has been on neuronal migration, our new analysis now demonstrates a more fundamental role for this signalling pathway. Loss of either <italic>Foxc1</italic> or Cxcr4 causes dramatic 25% and 30% respective reductions in ventricular zone proliferation by e13.5 which rapidly depletes the early cerebellar progenitor pool. This difference may reflect the residual SDF1α-Cxcr4 signalling in the Foxc1 mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aldinger et al., 2009</xref>), vs complete loss in the Cxcr4 CKO. Taken together with other published studies, we conclude that embryonic cerebellar anlage size is regulated by a number of extra-cerebellar signalling systems. Wnt signals derived from both the isthmic organizer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Sato et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Sato and Joyner, 2009</xref>) and the early dorsal roof plate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chizhikov et al., 2006</xref>) determine the initial size of the anlage from ∼e9.0. We have now demonstrated that mesenchymal SDF1α signalling is a major driver of early anlage growth from ∼e12.5. Late embryonic anlage ventricular zone proliferation is influenced by Shh derived from the differentiating choroid plexus from e14.5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Huang et al., 2010</xref>). An outstanding issue remains how each of these signalling systems are coordinately regulated and integrated across embryogenesis to orchestrate normal anlage development.</p><p>In addition to serving as neuronal and glial progenitors in the ventricular zone, radial glial cells extend fibers that act as migratory scaffolds for neurons migrating out of the ventricular zone. We observed aberrant migration of Purkinje cells in both Foxc1 null and Cxcr4; nestin-cre mutants, in addition to dysmorphic radial glial fibers. Abnormal migration of cells out of the ventricular zone could be due to the absence or downregulation of SDF1α chemoattraction from the mesenchyme and derived meninges. This is buttressed by the fact that blockage of SDF1α led to a significant reduction in migration of single cells in the in vitro transwell migration assay. Also, in the matrigel assay, when embryonic cerebellar slices were placed in close proximity with SDF1α coated acrylic beads, explant cells and fibers migrated in the direction of the SDF1α source. However, our protein expression data using Cxcr4 antibodies, in addition to Cxcr4-GFP transgenic mice indicate that Cxcr4 is also strongly expressed in radial glial fibers themselves. As early as e13.5 and more prominently by e15.5, radial glial fibers were discontinuous and did not extend all the way to the basement membrane of the pia. We conclude that SDF1α secreted by the mesenchyme binds to the receptor on the radial fibers to relay signals that are directly required to maintain these radial fibers as a substrate for migration. Indeed in the spinal cord, SDF1α protein is detectable in radial end feet and transcytosis across the radial glial length is also observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Mithal et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Radial glial cells in the cerebellum can differentiate into Bergmann glial cells (also known as Golgi Epithelial cells) in the cerebellar cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Li et al., 2014</xref>). In both <italic>Foxc1</italic><sup>−/−</sup> and Cxcr4 CKO mutants, Bergmann glial cells were ectopically placed in the EGL and ML, while in wild-type animals Bergman glial nestin+ and BLBP+ cells extended processes from the EGL to the presumptive IGL and were found overlapping with the PL. Studies have also shown that the association of BG with PCs greatly contributes to their structural and functional maintenance. Sonic hedgehog secretion by PCs also helps maintain BG in the cerebellum. It is hence plausible that the BG phenotype may be secondary to abnormal RG and PCs. Fate mapping studies have shown that Bergmann glial cells are normally born between e13.5 and e14.5 in the mouse cerebellum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Sudarov et al., 2011</xref>). It is also possible that continued SDF1α-Cxcr4 signalling is actively required for the differentiation of BG from RG. Further analysis is required to distinguish these two possibilities. Regardless, it is certain that a lack of normal Bergmann glial fibers further contributes to the abnormal lamination in neonatal SDF1α and Cxcr4 mutant animals as these fibers are normally required for the inward migration of EGL cells to form the internal granule layer.</p><p>Our analysis indicates that radial glial cells in the developing cerebellum are more sensitive to loss of SDF1α signalling compared to other regions of the CNS. In the cerebellum, loss of SDF1α signalling causes immediate and catastrophic cell cycle exit of radial glial cells and corresponding increased neuronal differentiation. Rapid loss of radial glial fiber morphology is also observed. Loss of SDF1α signalling in the forebrain has not been reported to cause microcephaly in mice, and we have shown here that midbrain radial glial cells are relatively unaffected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6N</xref>). A recent study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Mithal et al., 2013</xref>) reported that loss of radial glial Cxcr4 in spinal cord radial glial cells causes disruption of radial glial morphology and reduced mitosis in the ventral ventricular zone by e14.5. However, in the spinal cord by this stage a large number of spinal cord neuronal populations have already been generated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Tanabe and Jessell, 1996</xref>). Although late born populations such as oligodendrocyte lineages are altered, there are not dramatic morphological consequences. The disproportionate mouse cerebellar phenotypes we report here with loss of Foxc1 and Cxcr4 beautifully model the CNS phenotype of Dandy-Walker malformation patients, where the cerebellum is disproportionately diminished in size and altered in morphology relative to other CNS structures. The reasons for the region-specific sensitivities to loss of the SDF1α-Cxcr4 signalling remain unknown and may simply reflect regional differences in the timing of proliferative epochs relative to the onset of SDF1α and Cxcr4 expression. Alternatively, these differences may more fundamentally reflect region specific mesenchymal signalling mechanisms that further analyses will define.</p><p>Our data contribute to a growing body of evidence that the final form and function of the brain is a product of both intrinsic and extrinsic signalling mechanisms. Here we have demonstrated that the pathogenesis underlying <italic>Foxc1</italic>-dependent Dandy-Walker malformation, a major human neurodevelopmental disorder, is caused by loss of SDF1α-Cxcr4 mediated cerebellar radial glial proliferative and migrational scaffold function. These functions represent a previously unrecognized role for this major signalling pathway. Thus, SDF1α function is central to almost every major developmental program of the cerebellum. Notably, SDF1α is also a chemokine, central to the body's inflammatory response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dotan et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Werner et al., 2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">2013</xref>). Maternal infection has long been recognized as a risk factor for neurodevelopmental disorders, including autism which has been associated with cerebellar hypoplasia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Fatemi et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Buehler, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Burd et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Garbett et al., 2012</xref>). It is intriguing to speculate that neuroinflammation, including misregulated SDF1α signalling during early fetal development may underlie cases of human cerebellar hypoplasia for which genetic mechanisms have been difficult to assign (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Sajan et al., 2010</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Mice</title><p>All animal experimentation done in this study was done in accordance with the guidelines laid down by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC), of Seattle Children's Research Institute, Seattle, WA, USA. <italic>Foxc1</italic><sup><italic>lacZ/+</italic></sup> mice were generated by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kume et al.

The present experiments have the potential to provide new insights into mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of Dandy-Walker Syndrome. Therefore, this is a potentially interesting study worthy of consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>, but in its current form, the data do not unambiguously support their model. A number of changes and additional data are needed to address concerns and conclusions to present a coherent and compelling case. The specific comments as follows:</p><p>1) The authors suggest that there is a significant reduction in cell proliferation in the cerebellar ventricular zone in <italic>FoxC1-KO and Cxcr4-CKO</italic> mutants. However, BrdU staining apparently did not work properly on the mutant sample. For example, BrdU+ cells are almost completely absent from the posterior midbrain of the <italic>FoxC1-KO</italic> embryo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1J, L</xref>). It is also unclear how do the authors define a ventricular zone and count BrdU+ cells within it. The authors need to provide new data of high quality of BrdU staining. A molecular marker, such as Sox2 or Ki67, should be used to demarcate the progenitor cells in the ventricular zone.</p><p>2) Cell proliferation and cell differentiation in the ventricular zone of the cerebellar anlage differ greatly along the mediolateral axis. The sections in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1N and O</xref> appear from very different mediolateral positions. New data with comparable sections should be provided to support their conclusion.</p><p>3) Purkinje cells are generated between E10.5 and E13.5. If neurogenesis is accelerated at E13.5 as suggested by the authors, it is unexpected that there is such a dramatic reduction in the number of Purkinje cells in <italic>FoxC1</italic> and <italic>Cxcr4</italic> mutant embryos at E15.5 (we may actually expect more Purkinje cells). It is also hard to image that lack of SDF1a-<italic>Cxcr4</italic> signaling would cause cell death of postmitotic Purkinje cells as <italic>Cxcr4</italic> is only expressed by radial glia. Furthermore, the two published studies on <italic>Cxcr4</italic>-deficient mice show abnormal arrangement of Purkinje cells, but no indication of reduction of Purkinje cells. In fact, the paper by the Springer group shows plentiful Calbindin+ cells in the cerebellar cortex in <italic>Cxcr4-KO</italic> mice. The authors should provide a satisfying explanation for the apparent loss of Purkinje cells in <italic>FoxC1</italic> and <italic>Cxcr4</italic> mutant mice, and the discrepancy from the previous reports.</p><p>4) The conclusion on the loss of Bergmann glial cells in <italic>FoxC1-KO</italic> is not convincing. Additional data using markers, such as BLBP and Sox9, should be provided to argument this conclusion. It is worth to note that the Littman group has shown that Bergmann glial cells are formed in the <italic>Cxcr4</italic>-KO cerebellum. The authors should also provide data on Bergmann glial cells in the <italic>Cxcr4</italic>-CKO mutants. The authors state that <italic>Cxcr4</italic> is absent from developing Bergmann glia (where is the data?). Is it possible that <italic>FoxC1</italic> regulates Bergmann glial cells through a <italic>Cxcr4</italic>-independent pathway?</p><p>5) The authors convincingly showed that cerebellar VZ development in <italic>FoxC1a</italic> and <italic>Cxcr4</italic> mutants are grossly abnormal, with reduced number of proliferating cells and disorganized radial glial fibers. While this observation supports the model, it does not necessarily prove that the <italic>FoxC1</italic> VZ phenotype is caused by demised Sdf1a expression in the meninges. One complication is that <italic>FoxC1</italic> is required for development of meninges in the forebrain where it regulates production of RA for proper radial glial cell development (Cell, 139: 597, 2009). If development of cerebellar meninges is similarly disrupted, then the authors need to consider the possibility that VZ phenotype in <italic>FoxC1</italic> mutants is caused by other factors in the meninges that are independent of Sdf1a.</p><p>6) In the <italic>Cxcr4</italic> mutants, an interesting possibility is that Sdf1a secreted from other sources including the choroid plexus may activate <italic>Cxcr4</italic> in the VZ. Therefore, the authors need to discuss this possibility and carefully examine the development of meninges and expression of Sdf1a in meninges of <italic>FoxC1</italic> mutants. If meningeal development is compromised as in the forebrain, the authors need to perform <italic>FoxC1</italic> rescue experiment (using exogenously supplied Sdf1a) to clearly support their model.</p><p>[Editors’ note: the revised article was rejected after discussions between the reviewers, but a further resubmission was accepted after an appeal against the decision.]</p><p>Thank you for choosing to send your work entitled “<italic>FoxC1</italic> dependent mesenchymal signalling drives embryonic cerebellar growth” for consideration at <italic>eLife.</italic> Your full submission of the revised manuscript has been evaluated by a Senior editor and 2 peer reviewers, plus a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the decision was reached after discussions between the reviewers. Based on our discussions, we regret to inform you that your work will not be considered further for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>The reviewers feel that the revisions you have made have in part improved the manuscript. One reviewer was previously concerned about whether <italic>FoxC1-KO</italic> and <italic>Cxcr4-KO</italic> mutants have the same phenotype, including cell proliferation, Bergmann glia and Purkinje cell formation. The new data provided in the revision has partially addressed this concern. However both of the reviewers and the BRE feel that data relating to the meninges is lacking and severely reduces enthusiasm for the study. Although it is formally possible that <italic>FoxC1-KO</italic> disrupts other signaling molecules in the meninges, RA is an unlikely candidate. In the forebrain, loss of RA signaling due to <italic>FoxC1-KO</italic> blocks neurogenesis, which is very different from what is found in the cerebellum. As raised in the initial review, it is important to show normal formation of the meninges and the new data does not address this issue. This would require analysis with meninges markers. The reviewers are not convinced that the <italic>FoxC1</italic> phenotype is caused by Sdf1 and whether Sdf1 expression is indeed regulated by <italic>FoxC1</italic>. There is no data confirming that Sdf1 expression is abolished in <italic>FoxC1</italic> meninges. The cerebellum phenotype in <italic>Cxcr4</italic> mutants seems to be similar to that of <italic>FoxC1</italic> mutants. However, the <italic>FoxC1</italic> mutant cerebellum is much more severe, with the basement membrane clearly detached from the pial surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>), which would invariably disrupt Bergmann glial end feet attachment, likely causing their mis-localization. In summary, there is concern over major conclusions without a clear indication that meninges development is not compromised. In the absence of this evidence, the study cannot rule out the involvement of other factors derived from the meninges; hence the recommendation to reject the study at this stage.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.03962.013</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>1) The authors suggest that there is a significant reduction in cell proliferation in the cerebellar ventricular zone in FoxC1-KO and Cxcr4-CKO mutants. However, BrdU staining apparently did not work properly on the mutant sample. For example, BrdU+ cells are almost completely absent from the posterior midbrain of the FoxC1-KO embryo (</italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1"><italic>Figure 1J, L</italic></xref><italic>). It is also unclear how do the authors define a ventricular zone and count BrdU+ cells within it. The authors need to provide new data of high quality of BrdU staining. A molecular marker, such as Sox2 or Ki67, should be used to demarcate the progenitor cells in the ventricular zone</italic>.</p><p>We have replaced images 1J and 1L with higher quality images. We report an overall reduction in BrdU incorporation in the VZ of <italic>FoxC1</italic> mutants. The VZ was identified as a layer of cells directly lining the 4<sup>th</sup> ventricle. Ki67 staining was done to better define and demarcate the VZ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1–figure supplement 1A-F</xref>).</p><p><italic>2) Cell proliferation and cell differentiation in the ventricular zone of the cerebellar anlage differ greatly along the mediolateral axis. The sections in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1"><italic>Figure 1N</italic></xref> <italic>and O appear from very different mediolateral positions. New data with comparable sections should be provided to support their conclusion</italic>.</p><p>The orientation of the WT section was such that the isthmus and aqueduct were not visible in the original image. The sections have been reimaged confirming they are at comparable levels along the mediolateral axis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1N</xref>). Note that the mutant does have a different morphology from WT.</p><p><italic>3) Purkinje cells are generated between E10.5 and E13.5. If neurogenesis is accelerated at E13.5 as suggested by the authors, it is unexpected that there is such a dramatic reduction in the number of Purkinje cells in</italic> FoxC1 <italic>and</italic> Cxcr4 <italic>mutant embryos at E15.5 (we may actually expect more Purkinje cells). It is also hard to image that lack of SDF1a-</italic>Cxcr4 <italic>signaling would cause cell death of postmitotic Purkinje cells as</italic> Cxcr4 <italic>is only expressed by radial glia. Furthermore, the two published studies on</italic> Cxcr4<italic>-deficient mice show abnormal arrangement of Purkinje cells, but no indication of reduction of Purkinje cells. In fact, the paper by the Springer group shows plentiful Calbindin+ cells in the cerebellar cortex in</italic> Cxcr4<italic>-KO mice. The authors should provide a satisfying explanation for the apparent loss of Purkinje cells in</italic> FoxC1 <italic>and</italic> Cxcr4 <italic>mutant mice, and the discrepancy from the previous reports</italic>.</p><p>There is no discrepancy between our observations and previously reported data. The only study to have reported the arrangement of PCs in the embryonic <italic>Cxcr4</italic> mutant brain is from the Springer group (Ma et al., PNAS, 1998). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref> in their paper shows the presence of PCs in the cerebellum. Although they have not quantified their data, the number of PCs is clearly reduced and they are also abnormally distributed, similar to what we have reported in the <italic>FoxC1</italic> and <italic>Cxcr4</italic> mutants. We do not state that neurogenesis is accelerated at e13.5. Our preferred explanation is that there is a depleted progenitor pool because of early differentiation onset.</p><p><italic>4) The conclusion on the loss of Bergmann glial cells in</italic> FoxC1-<italic>KO is not convincing. Additional data using markers, such as BLBP and Sox9, should be provided to argument this conclusion. It is worth to note that the Littman group has shown that Bergmann glial cells are formed in the</italic> Cxcr4-<italic>KO cerebellum.

The authors state that</italic> Cxcr4 <italic>is absent from developing Bergmann glia (where is the data?).

We show that Bergmann glia are present with abnormal morphology as seen in the paper published by the Littman group (Zou et al., Nature, 1998, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G, H</xref>). The BG phenotype may be secondary to abnormal RG which express <italic>Cxcr4</italic>. While it may be possible that BG development is independent of <italic>Cxcr4</italic>, we see a similar phenotype in both <italic>FoxC1</italic><sup><italic>–/–</italic></sup> and <italic>Cxcr4</italic> CKOs. However, it is true that in the cerebellum the development of different cell types are dependent on one another. For example, Purkinje cells are closely associated with BG and PCs are required for BG function and survival. Hence disrupting one or more cell types could in turn affect other cell types, and therefore the effect could be indirect.</p><p><italic>5) The authors convincingly showed that cerebellar VZ development in</italic> FoxC1a <italic>and</italic> Cxcr4 <italic>mutants are grossly abnormal, with reduced number of proliferating cells and disorganized radial glial fibers. While this observation supports the model, it does not necessarily prove that the</italic> FoxC1 <italic>VZ phenotype is caused by demised Sdf1a expression in the meninges.

We also observe the same phenotype in both <italic>FoxC1</italic><sup><italic>–/–</italic></sup> and <italic>Cxcr4</italic> CKOs. While other factors may contribute to both phenotypes, the major effector of <italic>FoxC1</italic> dependent signalling by the mesenchyme is SDF1α.</p><p><italic>6) In the</italic> Cxcr4 <italic>mutants, an interesting possibility is that Sdf1a secreted from other sources including the choroid plexus may activate</italic> Cxcr4 <italic>in the VZ.

We have previously reported a significant down regulation of SDF1α in the mesenchyme of <italic>FoxC1</italic> mutants. We did not conduct a rescue experiment since, unlike the forebrain, the meninges are structurally normal in <italic>FoxC1</italic> mutants at this stage, as evinced by Laminin staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1–figure supplement 1G-L</xref>).</p><p>[Editors’ note: the revised article was rejected after discussions between the reviewers, but a further resubmission was accepted after an appeal against the decision.]</p><p><italic>The reviewers feel that the revisions you have made have in part improved the manuscript.

We previously reported that Sdf1a is significantly downregulated at e12.5 in <italic>FoxC1</italic><sup><italic>–/–</italic></sup> posterior fossa mesenchyme compared to wild-type controls.

We cited this reference and data multiple times throughout the manuscript. There may have been some confusion, since in the 2009 paper, Sdf1a was referred to as <italic>Cxcl12</italic>.
