While rapid genetic adaptation following the removal of conserved genes has been observed, we often lack a mechanistic understanding of how adaptation happens. We used the budding yeast, <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>, to investigate the evolutionary plasticity of chromosome metabolism, a network of evolutionary conserved modules. We experimentally evolved cells constitutively experiencing DNA replication stress caused by the absence of Ctf4, a protein that coordinates the enzymatic activities at replication forks. Parallel populations adapted to replication stress, over 1000 generations, by acquiring multiple, concerted mutations. These mutations altered conserved features of two chromosome metabolism modules, DNA replication and sister chromatid cohesion, and inactivated a third, the DNA damage checkpoint. The selected mutations define a functionally reproducible evolutionary trajectory. We suggest that the evolutionary plasticity of chromosome metabolism has implications for genome evolution in natural populations and cancer.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>All plants, animals and fungi share a common ancestor, and though they have evolved to become very distinct over billions of years, they all share the essential machinery needed for cells to grow and divide. At the heart of this is the complex interaction of proteins involved in DNA replication, the process of duplicating the genetic material every time a cell divides. DNA replication needs to be done with great care, with error rates as small as one mistake in a billion. Otherwise, mutations can accumulate in the genome, causing problems for long-term survival. Despite the overall principles of DNA replication remaining the same, the underlying mechanisms vary across different organisms. Given the precision and complexity of replicating DNA, it was not clear how the process had evolved mechanistic differences.</p><p>Fumasoni and Murray set out to answer this by forcing a strain of budding yeast to evolve by removing the gene for an important, but not essential, component of DNA replication. The cells were still able to reproduce, but they were hampered by this mutation.</p><p>Fumasoni and Murray studied the yeast after it had reproduced for a thousand generations, giving it enough time to acquire new mutations that would allow it to compensate for the initial defects. In eight separate samples, the yeast had made many of the same changes in order to overcome the original mutation. These mutations altered conserved features of DNA replication and the segregation of genetic material and inactivated a third feature that would normally protect the cell against the accumulation of damaged DNA.</p><p>These findings show how reproducible the evolutionary pathways can be in a controlled, laboratory environment and that cells can evolve quickly after conserved processes in the cell are damaged. The behavior of the mutated yeast mimicked that of cancer cells, which are often struggling to adapt to mutations in their replication machinery. Studying the rapid evolution that follows genetic perturbations could help researchers to better deal with challenges in cancer treatment and the development of antibiotic resistance in bacteria, as well as leading to a deeper understanding of both evolution and cell biology.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>genome evolution</kwd><kwd>experimental evolution</kwd><kwd>DNA replication</kwd><kwd>chromosome segregation</kwd><kwd>cell cycle checkpoints</kwd><kwd>evolvability</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000854</institution-id><institution>Human Frontier Science Program</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>LT000786/2016-L</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Fumasoni</surname><given-names>Marco</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004410</institution-id><institution>European Molecular Biology Organization</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ALTF 485-2015</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Fumasoni</surname><given-names>Marco</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100005010</institution-id><institution>Associazione Italiana per la Ricerca sul Cancro</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>iCARE 17957</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Fumasoni</surname><given-names>Marco</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RO1-GM43987</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Murray</surname><given-names>Andrew W</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>#1764269</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Murray</surname><given-names>Andrew W</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000893</institution-id><institution>Simons Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>#594596</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Murray</surname><given-names>Andrew W</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Evolutionary adaptation to a constitutive perturbation of DNA replication reveals that adaptive mutations in three conserved pathways interact to restore faithful chromosome replication and segregation.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The central features of many fundamental biological processes have been conserved since the last common ancestor of all extant organisms. Many of the proteins involved in these processes are essential, and the complex molecular interactions between them have been argued to constrain the evolution of both the processes and the proteins that carry them out (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hirsh and Fraser, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Jordan et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Wilson et al., 1977</xref>). The strength of these constraints has been questioned by studies that demonstrated that organisms can evolutionary adapt to the removal of important, and sometimes essential cellular genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Liu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Rancati et al., 2008</xref>). Although the mutations that cause some adaptations have been identified, we lack a mechanistic understanding of how they repair the initial defect. Furthermore, in systematic studies, defects in some processes, such as intracellular trafficking, were more easily repaired, by single genetic events, than others, such as ribosome biogenesis, mRNA synthesis and DNA replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Liu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">van Leeuwen et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Replication requires multiple enzymes that catalyze individual reactions such as unwinding the double helix, priming replication, and synthesizing new DNA strands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">O'Donnell et al., 2013</xref>). A common feature of replication is the organization of these enzymatic activities in multi-molecular complexes called replisomes, whose function is to coordinate the simultaneous synthesis of DNA from the two anti-parallel template strands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Yao and O'Donnell, 2016</xref>).</p><p>The temporal and physical interactions amongst the enzymatic machines that performs the different steps of DNA replication are remarkably conserved. Nevertheless, differences in many features of DNA replication have been reported: the number of replisome subunits is higher in eukaryotes than in bacteria, possibly to account for the higher complexity of eukaryotic genomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">McGeoch and Bell, 2008</xref>). Some subunits are only found in some eukaryotic species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Aves et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Liu et al., 2009</xref>). Notably, there are also biochemical variations in important features, such as the helicase, which encircles the leading strand in eukaryotes and the lagging strand in prokaryotes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">McGeoch and Bell, 2008</xref>), or differences in the regulation of DNA replication by the machinery that drives the cell cycle progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Cross et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Parker et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Siddiqui et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>These differences reveal that although the DNA replication module performs biochemically conserved reactions, its features can change during evolution. This observation poses an apparent paradox: how can such an important process change during evolution without killing cells? One hypothesis is that the overall organization of DNA replication can change as a consequence of accumulating several mutations, each perturbing a single aspect of replication, in response to a severe initial perturbation.</p><p>To test this hypothesis, we followed the evolutionary response to a genetic perturbation of DNA replication. Characterizing evolutionary responses to genetic perturbations has informed studies of functional modules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Filteau et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Harcombe et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Rojas Echenique et al., 2019</xref>), challenged the notion that particular genes are essential (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Liu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Rancati et al., 2018</xref>), and revealed that initial genotypes can determine evolutionary trajectories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Lind et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Rojas Echenique et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Szamecz et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>We followed the evolutionary response of <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> to DNA replication stress, an overall perturbation of DNA replication that interferes with chromosome metabolism, reduces cell viability, and induces genetic instability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Muñoz and Méndez, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib112">Zeman and Cimprich, 2014</xref>). DNA replication stress has been implicated in both cancer progression and aging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Burhans and Weinberger, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gaillard et al., 2015</xref>) but despite studies investigating the direct effect of replication stress on cell physiology, its evolutionary consequences are unknown.</p><p>We imposed constitutive replication stress by removing Ctf4, a component of the replisome and evolved eight populations for 1000 generations. We exploited the ability of experimental evolution to identify, analyze, and compare the mutations that create parallel evolutionary trajectories to increase fitness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Barrick and Lenski, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Van den Bergh et al., 2018</xref>). We found that populations can recover from the fitness defect induced by DNA replication stress. Genetic analysis revealed that their adaptation is driven by mutations that damage, alter, and improve conserved features of three modules involved in chromosome metabolism: DNA replication, the DNA damage checkpoint, and sister chromatid cohesion. These mutations arise sequentially and collectively allow cells to approach the fitness of their wild-type ancestors within 1000 generations of evolution. The molecular basis of these adaptive strategies and their epistatic interactions produce a mechanistic model of the evolutionary adaptation to replication stress. Our results reveal the short-term evolutionary plasticity of chromosome metabolism. We discuss the consequences of this plasticity for the evolution of species in the wild and cancer progression.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Adaptation to DNA replication stress is driven by mutations in chromosome metabolism</title><p>Replication stress refers to the combination of the defects in DNA metabolism and the cellular response to these defects in cells whose replication has been substantially perturbed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Macheret and Halazonetis, 2015</xref>). Problems in replication can arise at the sites of naturally occurring or experimentally induced lesions and can cause genetic instability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Muñoz and Méndez, 2017</xref>). We asked how cells evolve to adapt to constitutive DNA replication stress.</p><p>Previous work has induced replication stress by using chemical treatments or genetic perturbations affecting factors involved in DNA replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Mazouzi et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Tkach et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib113">Zheng et al., 2016</xref>). To avoid evolving resistance to drugs or the reversion of point mutations that induce replication stress, we chose instead to remove <italic>CTF4</italic>, a gene encoding an important, but non-essential, component of the DNA replication machinery. Ctf4 is a homo-trimer, that serves as a structural hub within the replisome and coordinates different aspects of DNA replication by binding the replicative helicase, the primase, and other factors recruited to the replication fork (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gambus et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Samora et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Simon et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Tanaka et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Yuan et al., 2019</xref>). In the absence of Ctf4, cells experience several problems in fork progression leading to the accumulation of defects commonly associated with DNA replication stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Muñoz and Méndez, 2017</xref>), such as single-stranded DNA gaps and altered replication forks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abe et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Fumasoni et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kouprina et al., 1992</xref>).

During experimental evolution, asexual populations accumulate two types of mutations: adaptive mutations that increase their fitness and neutral or possibly mildly deleterious mutations that hitchhike with the adaptive mutations (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). To distinguish between these mutations, we used a combination of statistical and experimental approaches. First, we inferred that mutations in a gene were adaptive if the gene was mutated more frequently than expected by chance across our parallel and independent populations (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). Second, we performed bulk segregant analysis on selected evolved clones. This technique takes advantage of sexual reproduction, followed by selection, to separate causal and hitchhiking mutations. In this case, mutations that segregate strongly with the evolved phenotype are assumed to be adaptive (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). We combined these two lists of mutated genes and looked for enriched gene ontology (GO) terms. This analysis revealed an enrichment of genes implicated in several aspect of chromosome metabolism (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>). Among the genes associated with these terms, many are involved in four functional modules: DNA replication, chromosome segregation (including genes involved in sister chromatid linkage and spindle function), cell cycle checkpoint and chromatin remodeling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>).

One approach to this question is to compare processes in related organisms and use classical and molecular genetics to find the genetic variants responsible for inter-species differences. This strategy has the disadvantage that many of the mechanistic changes happened so long ago that it is difficult to exchange components between their current-day descendants. We therefore used the alternative approach of applying a physiological stress that reduced the fitness of an organism and using experimental evolution to accumulate, identify, and study the mutations that increase fitness and adapt the organism to the stress. Using this approach allowed us to ask several questions about the evolution of conserved processes: i) how rapidly and how completely does fitness increase after a severe perturbation, ii) how reproducible are the evolutionary trajectories of replicate populations, iii) what genes are mutated, and which function modules do they affect, iv) what are the molecular mechanisms of adaptation, v) how do distinct mechanisms interact with each other, and vi) what do the mechanistic changes reveal about the evolutionary plasticity of the perturbed process.</p><p>To investigate the evolution of conserved cellular processes, we studied the evolutionary adaptation of cells experiencing constitutive DNA replication stress induced by the lack of a protein, Ctf4, that plays an important role in DNA replication. We tested whether significant changes in DNA replication could be acquired as a consequence of constitutive DNA replication stress. We found that over 1000 generations, populations increased from 75% to 90% of the fitness of their wild-type ancestors by sequentially accumulating mutations that individually affect three different functions that contribute to chromosome metabolism: DNA replication, chromosome segregation and the DNA damage checkpoint.</p><p>Our experiment reveals the short-term evolutionary plasticity of chromosome metabolism. A single genetic perturbation and a thousand generations are enough to select for significant changes in three functional modules affecting chromosome metabolism. By the end of the experiment, evolved lineages had sequentially modified chromosome cohesion, changed the dynamics of DNA replication, and lost an important cell-cycle response to DNA damage. These changes combine to produce the evolved phenotype and allow cells to approach wild type fitness despite the presence of continued DNA replication stress. This result suggests that despite their conservation, these modules and the connections between them are evolutionarily plastic and can accommodate short-term responses to strong perturbations, helping to explain differences that have accumulated over hundreds to billions of years of evolution.</p><p>Previous studies have argued that perturbations in DNA replication are less likely to be repaired by single compensatory mutations than other processes, such as intracellular trafficking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Liu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">van Leeuwen et al., 2016</xref>). We believe that the explanation for the difference between these studies and our own lies in the different nature of the mutations that are selected. Suppressor screens rely on single mutations that can either rescue lethality or whose fitness effect is greater than the noise in systematic analyses of genetic interactions. In contrast, experimental evolution following non-lethal perturbations allows for the sequential acquisitions of small-effect mutations that collectively rescue the perturbed process. Our experiment suggests that although the single mutations that can fully repair genetic damage to DNA replication are rare, the existence of combination of small-effect mutations that can repair perturbations make it evolutionarily plastic.</p><p>We argue that coupling a genetic dissection of the mutations that increase fitness to a cell biological understanding of their mechanism is essential to reaching a comprehensive understanding of evolutionary change. We discuss the molecular mechanisms of adaptation, then consider how they interact to produce the final evolved phenotype, and close by commenting on the implications of our results for natural populations and cancer.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Molecular insights into evolutionary adaptation</title><p>Cells lacking Ctf4 show an increased frequency of chromosome mis-segregation due to premature sister chromatid separation, but the mechanism underlying this defect is still unclear. Seven of our eight populations amplified <italic>SCC2</italic>, which encodes for one of the subunits of the cohesin loader complex. The simplest explanation for this result is that, the absence of Ctf4 restricts the productive loading of cohesin molecules that establish the linkage between sister chromatids. We propose that amplifying the genes for the cohesin loader would increase its expression, increase the productive cohesin loading and improve the linkage between sister chromatids. Improving sister chromatid cohesion allows the evolved cells to segregate their chromosomes more accurately at mitosis, avoiding mitotic delays due to the spindle checkpoint, decreasing cell death and increasing fitness (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>).</p><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Mechanistic models of adaptation.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Amplification of the cohesin loader subunit <italic>SCC2</italic> increases cohesin loading and sister chromatid cohesion leading to accurate chromosome segregation (<bold>B</bold>) Mutations of the replicative helicase (<italic>sld5</italic>) or in <italic>ixr1</italic> stabilize replication forks and ensure the completion of chromosome replication before anaphase. (<bold>C</bold>) Mutations in <italic>rad9</italic> abolish the DNA damage checkpoint response triggered by stretches of single strand DNA (ssDNA) and allow faster cell division.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-51963-fig6-v2.tif"/></fig><p>Persistent, cohesin-independent linkages between sister chromatids are an alternative source of segregation errors. These links include unreplicated regions of DNA or un-resolved recombination structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ait Saada et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chan et al., 2007</xref>). If they persist after the removal of cohesin, they become lingering physical links (anaphase bridges) between sister chromatids that can lead to chromosome breakage or mis-segregation during anaphase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chan et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gisselsson et al., 2000</xref>). Avoiding these problems requires that replication origins fire efficiently and replication forks move continuously. Our analysis of the dynamics of DNA replication argues that a combination of frequent fork stalling and slower origin firing causes under-replication of certain chromosomal regions in the ancestral <italic>ctf4∆</italic> cells. We found that severe fork stalling in <italic>ctf4∆</italic> cells frequently occurs near tRNA genes, Long Terminal Repeats (LTRs) and transposable elements (Ty) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref>). These chromosomal features were previously found to be associated with replication pausing sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Deshpande and Newlon, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gadaleta and Noguchi, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">Zaratiegui et al., 2011</xref>), suggesting that the absence of Ctf4 may exacerbate the problems in replicating these regions. We propose that these defects selected for mutations that stabilize the replication forks, allowing the timely completion of genome replication. We speculate that these mutations have the apparently paradoxical effect of accelerating DNA replication by slowing down the replication forks: mutations like <italic>sld5-E130K</italic> and <italic>ixr1∆</italic> may slow helicase progression, stabilizing the forks by preventing frequent fork stalling or collapse and producing a higher overall fork velocity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). This hypothesis is consistent with two observations: first, although the <italic>sld5</italic> mutation is beneficial in ancestor cells, it decreases the fitness of WT cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4A</xref>), a result we would expect from a slower replicative helicase. Second, reduced dNTPs concentrations reduce fork speed by slowing polymerase incorporation rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Koren et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Pai and Kearsey, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Poli et al., 2012</xref>) and inactivating Ixr1 reduces dNTP concentrations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Tsaponina et al., 2011</xref>). We tested this prediction by using an experimental system to manipulate dNTP concentrations: decreasing dNTP concentrations increased the fitness of <italic>ctf4∆</italic> cells, while inducing higher dNTP production reduced fitness (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4B</xref>).</p><p>Our evolved populations also accumulated mutations that inactivated the DNA damage checkpoint (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B–D</xref>). The benefit of these mutations arises from the loss of the DNA damage checkpoint’s ability to delay the start of anaphase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>). The absence of Ctf4 induces aberrant DNA structures and ssDNA that induce moderate activation of the checkpoint (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Poli et al., 2012</xref>), which delays the start of anaphase, increasing doubling time and thus decreasing fitness (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D–E</xref>). Inactivating Rad9 eliminates the delay, shortening the time required for mitosis and increasing fitness (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>).</p><p>This solution seems counter-intuitive, as the loss of a safeguard mechanism such as the DNA damage checkpoint should cause genetic instability in cells suffering from replication stress. The resolution of this paradox may lie in the overlapping action of the replication, DNA damage, and spindle checkpoints. We propose that the replication and the spindle checkpoints delay the cell cycle in response to defects that would kill the ancestral <italic>ctf4∆</italic> cells, such as excessive replication fork collapses and pairs of sister chromatids attached to the same spindle pole, whereas the damage checkpoint responds to defects, like regions of single-stranded DNA, that can be repaired after cell division.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Epistatic interactions between adaptive mechanisms</title><p>We asked how the mutants we identified and analyzed interacted with each other and whether they could explain the fitness of our evolved populations. Measuring allele frequencies over time and engineering all possible combinations of adaptive mutations allowed us to propose a detailed model for the evolutionary trajectories of our population 5 (EVO5). Segmental amplifications form at a higher frequency than other types of mutation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Lynch et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Sharp et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Yona et al., 2015</xref>); although most are detrimental, the amplification of specific genes can be advantageous and cause rapid adaptation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Adamo et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Gresham et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Hughes et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Payen et al., 2014</xref>). Thus, the first event in EVO5 is the spread of a segmental amplification of chromosome IV containing <italic>SCC2</italic>, which improves fitness by reducing cohesion defects. In this lineage, mutations in the replicative helicase, <italic>sld5-E130K</italic>, and <italic>ixr1-Q332*</italic> were then detected almost simultaneously but in different clones. Above, we suggest that both mutations slow replication forks. If there is an optimal fork speed in <italic>ctf4∆</italic> cells, the presence of a second mutation of this class might be ineffective or even detrimental if the forks move too slowly, explaining the negative epistasis we observed. Because the <italic>ixr1</italic> and <italic>sld5</italic> mutations improve DNA replication to a similar extent, the two lineages have comparable fitness, explaining the clonal interference that persists for the rest of the experiment. The last mutation in EVO5 is an identical frameshift mutation in the two lineages that inactivates Rad9. Interestingly, loss of function mutations in <italic>RAD9</italic>, despite the large target size of this gene, only appear relatively late during the experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>). Furthermore, they happen after other mutations have reduced some of the problems imposed by replication stress. This order suggests that a sustainable fitness advantage of mutations of the DNA damage checkpoint may depend on previous changes in the replication forks stability.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Implications for natural evolution</title><p>Despite being conserved across much of evolution, some of the modules that collectively perform chromosome metabolism and maintain genomes show major important differences between clades, even within the eukaryotic kingdom (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Akiyoshi and Gull, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Gourguechon et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Liu et al., 2009</xref>). For instance, a recent study found species in the yeast genus <italic>Hanseniaspora</italic> that lack several important genes implicated in cell cycle progress and DNA repair, including checkpoint factors such as <italic>RAD9</italic> and <italic>MAD2</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Steenwyk et al., 2019</xref>). Trying to explain these differences is puzzling, especially if <italic>ad-hoc</italic> selectionist hypotheses are invoked for each different feature. For instance, what could select for a lack of an important safeguard such as the DNA damage checkpoint? Interestingly, the same lineage of <italic>Hanseniaspora</italic> also lacks <italic>CDC13</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Steenwyk et al., 2019</xref>), an essential gene in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, implicated in telomere replication. Studies have shown how the lethality of <italic>cdc13Δ</italic> mutants, is suppressed by simultaneous mutations in checkpoint factors, including <italic>RAD9</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Ngo and Lydall, 2010</xref>). The evolutionary plasticity of chromosome metabolism that we reveal in this work may help to explain differences like these: mutations in ancestral cells, such as the loss of <italic>CDC13</italic>, could initiate an evolutionary trajectory that progressively modifies modules that are functionally linked and ultimately leads to increased fitness.</p><p>But what are the initial perturbations that trigger such changes in fundamental aspects of cell biology? The <italic>ctf4∆</italic> cells that we evolved have a 25% fitness difference relative to their wild type ancestors, meaning that they would rapidly be eliminated from any population of reasonable size. Given the evolutionary rarity of major rearrangements in cell biology we can invoke events that are improbable including passing through very small populations bottlenecks or being attacked by selfish genetic elements whose molecular biology targets an important protein in an essential process. If the processes that were damaged during these events, were part of chromosome metabolism, the consequent evolutionary adaptation could lead to changes in the rates at which the structures of genomes evolve. An increase in these rates, in turn, could potentially accelerating speciation by making it easier for populations to acquire meiotically incompatible chromosome configurations.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Implications for cancer evolution</title><p>Remarkably, our experiment recapitulates several phenomena observed during cancer development. Replication stress is thought to be a ubiquitous feature of cancer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Macheret and Halazonetis, 2015</xref>) with oncogene activation leading to replication stress and genetic instability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bartkova et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Di Micco et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Neelsen et al., 2013</xref>).

Furthermore, simply by propagating cells, we generated evolved lines that mimic many features seen in tumors: (a) individual final populations contain genetically heterogeneous clones, often with different karyotypes characterized by aneuploidies and chromosomal rearrangements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Davoli et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Laughney et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Lengauer et al., 1998</xref>), (b) evolved lineages display altered DNA replication profiles compared both to WT cells and their mutant ancestors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Amiel et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Donley and Thayer, 2013</xref>), (c) several lines have inactivated the DNA damage checkpoint (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Hollstein et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Schultz et al., 2000</xref>), and d) improved sister chromatid cohesion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Rhodes et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Sarogni et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Xu et al., 2011</xref>). All these features are adaptive in our populations, suggesting that similar changes in cancer cells may be the result of selection and contribute to the accumulation of other cancer hallmarks during cancer evolution. The similarities between tumorigenesis and our experiment lead us to speculate that a major selective force in the early stages of tumor evolution is the need to counteract the fitness costs of replication stress. Understanding the evolutionary mechanisms and dynamics of the adaptation to replication stress could therefore shed light on the early stage of tumor development.</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Perspective</title><p>In this work, we identified the main adaptive strategies that cells use to adapt to DNA replication stress induced by the absence of Ctf4. Our results reveal that defects in one function can be compensated for by two types of mutations: those in the original function and those in functions that are biologically coupled to it. Focusing on less common adaptive strategies, apparently unlinked to chromosome metabolism, could therefore potentially identify novel players that affect genome stability. It would also be interesting to induce DNA replication stress by other means, such as de-regulating replication initiation or by inducing re-replication. Analyzing the response to these challenges will reveal whether the DNA replication module has a common or diverse set of evolutionary strategies to different perturbations. Finally, this approach could be extended to many other types of cellular stress, potentially revealing other molecular adaption aspects that could collectively help understanding cellular evolution.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type (species) <break/>or resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Strain, strain background (<italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>)</td><td>W303</td><td>Murray lab</td><td>W1588</td><td>The complete list of derived strains is available in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp5">Supplementary file 5</xref></td></tr><tr><td>Commercial assay or kit</td><td>Nextera DNA Library Prep (24 Samples)</td><td>Illumina</td><td>15028212</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Commercial assay or kit</td><td>Nextera Index kit (96 Indices)</td><td>Illumina</td><td>15028216</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Commercial assay or kit</td><td>High Sensitivity D1000 ScreenTape</td><td>Agilent</td><td>5067–5584</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Software, algorithm</td><td>Python</td><td><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.python.org">www.python.org</ext-link></td><td>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_008394">SCR_008394</ext-link></td><td>Custom pipelines available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/marcofumasoni/Fumasoni_and_Murray_2019">github.com/marcofumasoni/Fumasoni_and_Murray_2019</ext-link></td></tr><tr><td>Software, algorithm</td><td>Fiji</td><td><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://fiji.sc/">fiji.sc</ext-link></td><td>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_002285">SCR_002285</ext-link></td><td/></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec id="s4-1"><title>Strains</title><p>All strains were derivatives of a modified version (Rad5<sup>+</sup>) of <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> strain W303 (<italic>leu2-3,112 trp1-1 can1-100 ura3-1 ade2-1 his3-11,15, RAD5<sup>+</sup>)</italic>. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp5">Supplementary file 5</xref> lists each strain’s genotype.

Briefly, a clone is selected from the population and then backcrossed to a derivative of the WT ancestor. The resulting diploid is sporulated, allowing the mutant alleles accumulated during 1000 generations to randomly segregate among the haploid progeny. The haploid progeny is then selected for growth (and for <italic>ctf4Δ</italic>) for 50–80 generations in rich media. This regime, as in the experimental evolution, selects for cells with higher fitness. The cells with causal alleles therefore quickly increase their frequency within the selected population. Non-causal alleles segregate randomly and, since they don’t contribute to fitness, they are expected to be present in half of the cells at the end of the progeny selection. Deep sequencing of the genomic DNA extracted from the selected progeny population reveal the alleles frequencies and allows the identification of the ones that segregate with the evolved phenotype (frequency &gt;70% in our case). Bulk segregant analysis was adapted from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Koschwanez et al. (2013)</xref>. One clone per population was selected for further analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). In these clones, the original <italic>ctf4Δ</italic> genetic marker <italic>ble</italic> was substituted with a <italic>KanMX6</italic> cassette by homologous recombination, to allow for a more efficient selection. <italic>ura3-1</italic> evolved clones were mated with either a <italic>MAT<bold>a</bold></italic> or <italic>MAT</italic>α, <italic>ura3::NatMX4-pSTE2-URA3</italic> derivative of the WT ancestor. In this strain, the endogenous <italic>URA3</italic> promoter is replaced with the <italic>STE2</italic> promoter, which is only induced in <italic>MAT<bold>a</bold></italic> cells, making it possible to select for <italic>MAT<bold>a</bold></italic> spores after meiosis. Mating was performed by mixing cells from the two strains together on a YPD plate with a toothpick and growing overnight at 30°C. The mating mixtures were then plated on double selective media, and a diploid strain from each cross was selected from a colony on the plate. To sporulate the diploid strains, cultures were grown to saturation in YPD, and then diluted 1:100 into YP 2% acetate. The cells were grown in acetate for 12 hr., pelleted and resuspended in 2% acetate. After 5 days of incubation on a roller drum at 25°C, sporulation was verified by observing the formation of tetrads under the microscope. To digest ascii, 10 ml of the sporulated culture was pelleted and resuspended in 500 µl with 250 units of Zymolyase for 1 hr. at 30°C. 4000 µl of water and 500 µl of 10% Triton X-100 were added, and the digested spores were then sonicated for 1 min to separate the tetrads. The spores were spun down slowly (6000 rpm) and resuspended in 50 ml of -URA +G418 medium. This medium selects for <italic>ctf4Δ</italic> haploid <italic>MAT<bold>a</bold></italic> cells: neither haploid <italic>MAT</italic>α nor diploid <italic>MAT<bold>a</bold></italic>/<italic>MAT</italic>α cells can express <italic>URA3</italic> from the <italic>STE2</italic> promoter. Each culture was then diluted 1:100 in fresh -URA + G418 medium for 10 consecutive passages, allowing for ≈66 generations to occur.

Cell cycle profiles were analyzed and visualized in FlowJo (RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_008520">SCR_008520</ext-link>, BD Bioscience). The percentage of genome replicated at 30 min was calculated based on the cell cycle profile as follow <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf3"><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>G</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>p</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>D</mml:mi><mml:mi>N</mml:mi><mml:mi>A</mml:mi> <mml:mi/><mml:mi>c</mml:mi><mml:mi>o</mml:mi><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mi>t</mml:mi> <mml:mi/><mml:mi>m</mml:mi><mml:mi>o</mml:mi><mml:mi>d</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mo>/</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mfenced separators="|"><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn><mml:mi>C</mml:mi><mml:mo>-</mml:mo><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mi>C</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mfenced><mml:mi>*</mml:mi><mml:mn>100</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>. The height of the 1C and 2C peaks was obtained as the max cells count reached by the respective peak. For both the percentage of genome replicated at 30 min and the 1C/2C ratio, the mean was calculated from values obtained with three independent biological replicates. Error bars represent standard deviations. The P-values reported are the result of <italic>t</italic>-tests assuming unequal variances.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Copy number variations (CNVs) detection by sequencing</title><p>Whole genome sequencing and read mapping was done as previously described. The read-depths for every unique 100 bp region in the genome were then obtained by using the VarScan copynumber tool. A custom pipeline written in python was used to visualize the genome-wide CNVs. First, the read-depths of individual 100 bp windows were normalized to the genome-wide median read-depth to control for differences in sequencing depths between samples. The coverage of the ancestor strains was then subtracted from the one of the evolved lines to reduce the noise in read depth visualization due to the repeated sequences across the genome. The resulting CNVs were smoothed across five 100 bp windows for a simpler visualization. Final CNVs were then plotted relative to their genomic coordinate at the center of the smoothed window. Since the WT CNVs were subtracted from the evolved CNVs, the y axis refers to the copy number change occurred during evolution (i.e. +1 means that one an extra copy of a chromosome fragment has been gained). The custom pipeline used for the data analysis is available on GitHub: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/marcofumasoni/Fumasoni_and_Murray_2019">https://github.com/marcofumasoni/Fumasoni_and_Murray_2019.</ext-link></p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Premature sister chromatid separation assay</title><p>Logarithmically growing cells were arrested in metaphase as previously described. Samples were then collected and fixed in 4% formaldehyde for 5 min at room temperature. Cells were washed In SK buffer (1M sorbitol, 0.05 M K<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>) and sonicated for 8 s prior to microscope analysis. Images were acquired with a Nikon eclipse Ti spinning-disk confocal microscope using a 100X oil immersion lens. Fluorescence was visualized with a conventional FITC excitation filter and a long pass emission filter. Images were analyzed using Fiji (RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_002285">SCR_002285</ext-link>, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://fiji.sc/">https://fiji.sc/</ext-link>). At least 100 cells were analyzed to calculate the percentage of premature chromatid Separation for each strain. The mean value was calculated from measurements obtained with three independent biological replicates. Error bars represent standard deviations. The P-values reported are the result of <italic>t</italic>-tests assuming unequal variances.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>DNA replication profiles</title><p>DNA replication profiling was adapted from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Müller et al. (2014)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Saayman et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bar-Ziv et al. (2016)</xref>. Genomic DNA and library preparation were performed independently on all the collected samples as previously described. Repeated sequences (such as telomeres, rDNA and Ty elements) were excluded from the CNV analysis as non-uniquely mapped reads can alter local read-depth and generate artefacts. A custom python script was used to analyze the CNVs from multiple time points from the same strain to produce DNA replication profiles. Read-depths of individual 100 bp windows were normalized to the genome-wide median read-depth to control for differences in sequencing depths between consecutive samples. To allow for intra-strain comparison, coverage was then scaled according to the sample DNA content measured as the median of the cell-cycle profile obtained by flow cytometry. The resulting coverage was then averaged across multiple 100 bp windows and a polynomial data smoothing filter (Savitsky-Golay) was applied to the individual coverage profiles to filter out noise. Replication timing t<sub>rep</sub> is defined as the time at which 50% of the cells in the population replicated a given region of the genome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>), which is equivalent to an overall relative coverage of 1.5x, since 1x corresponds to an unreplicated region and 2x to a fully replicated one. The replication timing t<sub>rep</sub> was calculated by linearly interpolating the two time points with coverage lower and higher than 1.5x and using such interpolation to compute the time corresponding to 1.5x coverage. Final t<sub>rep</sub> were then plotted relative to their window genomic coordinates. Unreplicated regions at 45 min were calculated as the sum of all regions with t<sub>rep</sub> &gt;45 min. To find DNA replication origins, the t<sub>rep</sub> profiles along the genome were filtered using a Fourier low-pass filter to remove local minima and then used to find local peaks. Only origins giving rise to long replicons were used to measure fork velocity. Fork velocity was calculated by dividing the distance between the origin and the closest termination site by the time required to replicate the region. Duplicate replication profiles were obtained from two experiments performed on biological replicates. Reproducibility was confirmed with qualitatively and quantitatively comparable results across duplicates. The data obtained from the first duplicate are reported. The reliability of the pipeline was assessed by qualitatively and quantitatively comparing our WT results with previously reported measurements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Müller et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Raghuraman et al., 2001</xref>).

The fork position at 45 min was considered the center of the fork-stall zones, while 5 kb upstream and downstream the fork site were included in the analysis to account for features in the proximity of the fork that could have interfered with its progression. We then examined the sequences within these windows to determine whether various chromosomal features were over- or underrepresented. We considered features that previous studies have found to be associated with hotspots for lesions and sources of genetic instability. We first counted how many times a given feature fell in a fork-stall zone. Then we calculated the expected number of features in these zones based on the total number of features in the genome and the percentage of the genome represented by fork-stall zones. We compared these numbers by χ2 analysis and reported the associated p-values (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref>). The number of tRNA genes, transposable elements, LTRs, ARS elements, snRNA and snoRNA genes and centromeres in the genome were determined using YeastMine (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://yeastmine.yeastgenome.org/">https://yeastmine.yeastgenome.org/</ext-link>).

The tandemly repeated sequences, with a minimal repeat tract of twenty-four bases, were obtained from the tandem-repeat-database (TRDB; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://tandem.bu.edu/cgi-bin/trdb/trdb.exe">https://tandem.bu.edu/cgi-bin/trdb/trdb.exe</ext-link>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Analysis of allele frequency by sanger sequencing</title><p>Allele frequencies within populations were estimated as in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Wildenberg and Murray (2014)</xref>. In brief, chromatograms obtained by sanger sequencing were used to estimate the fraction of mutant alleles in a population at different time points during the evolution. The fraction of mutant alleles in the population was assumed to be the height of the mutant allele peak divided by the height of the mutant allele peak plus the ancestor allele peak. The values from two independent sanger sequencing reactions, obtained by primers lying upstream and downstream the mutations, were averaged to obtain the final ratios. Error bar edges represent the ratios obtained by the two independent sequencing reactions. Values below the approximate background level were assumed to be zero, and values above 95% were assumed to be 100%.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Segmental amplification detection by digital PCR</title><p>Droplet digital PCR was used to detect the amplifications of the fragment containing <italic>SCC2</italic> at different time points during evolution.

A Bio-Rad QX200 Droplet Generator was used to generate droplets containing genomic DNA and probes. The droplet PCR was performed in a Bio-Rad thermocycler and analyzed with a Bio-Rad QX200 Droplet Reader. At least 10,000 droplets were acquired for each strain. Analysis was performed on biological duplicates with comparable results. Data obtained with the first duplicate are shown. Droplet analysis was performed with QuantaSoft software (Bio-Rad). SCC2/Centromere ratios were then used to quantify SCC2 copy numbers. Error bars represent Poisson 95% confidence intervals. To estimate the percent of cells carrying the SCC2 amplification within a population we assumed that the allele spreading in the population was a duplication of SCC2 (as indicated by the EVO5 copy number analysis). Values above 95% were assumed to be 100%.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Stephen Elledge and Philip Zegerman for sharing yeast strains; Andrea Giometto, Mayra Garcia and John Koschwanez for assistance in data analysis; Stephen Bell, Michael Desai, Michael Laub, Bodo Stern, Angelika Amon, Sriram Srikant, Thomas LaBar, Miguel Coelho and Yi Chen for critical reading of the manuscript; Claire Hartman and Zachary Niziolek from the Harvard Bauer Core Facility for technical assistance.

responses.</p></boxed-text><p><bold>Acceptance summary:</bold></p><p>Your paper is a beautiful example of how the fitness effects due to perturbation of a conserved gene can be surprisingly easily, at least in lab conditions, mitigated by compensatory mutations, and how these suppressor mutations are unpredictable and in turn provide new insight into the function of the originally perturbed gene.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;The evolutionary plasticity of chromosome metabolism allows adaptation to DNA replication stress&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>Your article has now been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Jessica Tyler as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Anna Selmecki (Reviewer #2); Conrad Nieduszynski (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>All reviewers agree that the paper is interesting, constitutes a large body of work and is exceptionally well-written. On the other hand, the reviewers also struggled a bit to answer the question why this study belongs in <italic>eLife</italic>. After discussion of this, it became clear that part of the problem might be in the fact that the paper falls a bit between a study on evolutionary mechanisms and a study on replication stress. This is of course not a problem in itself and could in fact be a strong point. However, in this case, it proved more difficult to grasp the central question, the main conclusions, and their novelty.</p><p>Encouragingly, the cover letter separates both aspects quite well, and seems to highlight the evolutionary angle as the key message. It is known that (isolated) lineages can overcome severe fitness defects related to gene deletion; including deletion of highly conserved genes that are marked as &quot;essential&quot;. However, as you point out in the cover letter, it is true that your study does a remarkable job in revealing the actual suppressor mutations and their interactions, but to the reviewers, this message is lost a bit in the paper, possibly because the Introduction starts more from the angle of chromosome biology.</p><p>On the other hand, the reviewers felt that results are perhaps less conclusive when it comes to yielding insight into the process of replication. While the results show how different compensatory mutations in cohesion loading, cell cycle checkpoints and replication for progression can mitigate the loss of Ctf4, the reviewers agree that these aspects have perhaps not been studied in sufficient detail to be sure about the underlying mechanism and the role of Ctf4, and that they could therefore perhaps be more critically discussed and grouped in a separate paragraph in the Discussion section.</p><p>In addition, we would ask you to take the other main comments of the reviewers into account. Specifically, both reviewer 1 and 2 ask to better highlight previous studies that have examined the evolutionary routes that compensate gene loss, and explain better how this paper goes beyond these previous studies.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>This paper investigates the evolutionary routes that mitigate the effect of inactivation of Ctf4, a protein that coordinates replication fork activity in the model yeast <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>. The results show that after 1000 generations, different lines find distinct mutational paths to compensate for the loss of Ctf4, but while the exact driver mutations differ, each path combines changes in DNA replication, DNA damage checkpoint and chromatid cohesion.</p><p>This is a solid and beautifully written study that provides new insight into evolutionary response to mutations in crucial and highly conserved parts of the DNA replication machinery. Specifically, it is interesting to see how parallel evolution hints at the interplay between different aspects of DNA replication (replication fork progression, DNA damage checkpoints, chromosome alignment and cohesion). Perhaps equally importantly, the authors also show some similarities to the mutational trajectories of some tumors in higher eukaryotes.</p><p>The most important question is what truly novel insight this study brings. The conclusions touch upon different fields (evolution, DNA replication and cancer), but it is unclear if the results really provide sufficient novel and general insight into any of these to merit publication in <italic>eLife</italic>. Several studies have evolved lines in which an important (or even &quot;essential&quot;) gene was inactivated, and it has already been shown that cells can often evolve suppressor mutations. Moreover, the mutational paths found in this study seem highly unlikely in natural populations because the Ctf4 deletion strain suffers such a high fitness defect. While there are some striking parallels with tumor progression, it is also unclear whether the deletion of Ctf4 really provides a solid model for replication stress and the mutational path in tumors.

The SLD5 and IXR1 mutations are proposed to give reduced fork velocity, but this isn't demonstrated. Loss of RAD9 is suggested to allow post-mitotic completion of DNA replication, but again this isn't demonstrated (e.g. RPA foci number increased). I think firming up these inferred mechanisms is probably beyond the scope of this study, but I'm still slightly disappointed that the authors weren't able to make more progress on this given how clearly they present these models in Figure 6.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;The evolutionary plasticity of chromosome metabolism allows adaptation to constitutive DNA replication stress&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>.

On the other hand, the reviewers also struggled a bit to answer the question why this study belongs in eLife. After discussion of this, it became clear that part of the problem might be in the fact that the paper falls a bit between a study on evolutionary mechanisms and a study on replication stress. This is of course not a problem in itself and could in fact be a strong point. However, in this case, it proved more difficult to grasp the central question, the main conclusions, and their novelty.</p><p>Encouragingly, the cover letter separates both aspects quite well, and seems to highlight the evolutionary angle as the key message. It is known that (isolated) lineages can overcome severe fitness defects related to gene deletion; including deletion of highly conserved genes that are marked as &quot;essential&quot;. However, as you point out in the cover letter, it is true that your study does a remarkable job in revealing the actual suppressor mutations and their interactions, but to the reviewers, this message is lost a bit in the paper, possibly because the Introduction starts more from the angle of chromosome biology.</p><p>On the other hand, the reviewers felt that results are perhaps less conclusive when it comes to yielding insight into the process of replication. While the results show how different compensatory mutations in cohesion loading, cell cycle checkpoints and replication for progression can mitigate the loss of Ctf4, the reviewers agree that these aspects have perhaps not been studied in sufficient detail to be sure about the underlying mechanism and the role of Ctf4, and that they could therefore perhaps be more critically discussed and grouped in a separate paragraph in the Discussion section.</p><p>In addition, we would ask you to take the other main comments of the reviewers into account. Specifically, both reviewer 1 and 2 ask to better highlight previous studies that have examined the evolutionary routes that compensate gene loss, and explain better how this paper goes beyond these previous studies.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the careful and through reviews our article. We are very pleased to hear that the reviewers found our work solid, interesting and well written. We are especially grateful to the reviewers for pointing out that the narrative structure of the manuscript generated some confusion regarding the motivation and the key findings of our work.</p><p>We have edited the paper to try to better communicate a series of points, which we summarize below:</p><p>The main motivation of our work is to investigate a central question in evolutionary biology: How can conserved cellular processes, which are essential for life, undergo significant, mechanistic changes during evolution without destroying the overall process.</p><p>To answer this question, we focused on DNA replication for three reasons. First, because DNA replication is one of the most conserved processes in life, and investigating its evolutionary plasticity has far-reaching implications in several fields of biology. Second, because previous systematic studies that identified defects that could rapidly be repaired by adaptive evolution reported that defects in DNA replication were harder to repair than those in other essential processes. Third, by focusing on a single process, we could reach a detailed, mechanistic understanding that would complement larger-scale, but less detailed studies.</p><p>Our goal was to investigate the cellular response to a long-term perturbation in DNA replication rather than to perform a detailed study of the mechanism of DNA replication. Thus, we deleted <italic>CTF4</italic> not to investigate its role in DNA replication, but rather as an experimental tool to induce constitutive replication stress. This allowed us to answer the following questions: i) how rapidly and how completely does fitness increase after a severe perturbation, ii) how reproducible are the evolutionary trajectories of replicate populations, iii) what genes are mutated, and which function modules do they affect, iv) what are the molecular mechanisms of adaptation, v) how do distinct mechanisms interact with each other, and vi) what do the mechanistic changes reveal about the evolutionary plasticity of the perturbed process.</p><p>We have successfully answered all these questions. By doing so, we have provided a uniquely detailed account of the molecular mechanisms that produce adaptive evolution. We argue that coupling the genetic dissection of the mutations that increase fitness to a cell biological understanding of their mechanism is essential to fully understand evolutionary mechanisms. We agree that if we were going to investigate each individual adaptive mutation in depth, other experiments could have been performed to reach the level of a paper whose primary focus was the role of individual proteins in the process of chromosome metabolism. Our goal, however, was to provide a comprehensive account of mutations interact with each other to explain the overall process of evolutionary adaptation. We believe that dissecting the effect of each mutation, in greater detail, would have made it difficult for readers to grasp the central point of our paper.</p><p>We have now modified the manuscript in several sections with the aim of effectively communicating the scope, conclusions and novelty of our article.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>This paper investigates the evolutionary routes that mitigate the effect of inactivation of Ctf4, a protein that coordinates replication fork activity in the model yeast <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>. The results show that after 1000 generations, different lines find distinct mutational paths to compensate for the loss of Ctf4, but while the exact driver mutations differ, each path combines changes in DNA replication, DNA damage checkpoint and chromatid cohesion.</p><p>This is a solid and beautifully written study that provides new insight into evolutionary response to mutations in crucial and highly conserved parts of the DNA replication machinery. Specifically, it is interesting to see how parallel evolution hints at the interplay between different aspects of DNA replication (replication fork progression, DNA damage checkpoints, chromosome alignment and cohesion). Perhaps equally importantly, the authors also show some similarities to the mutational trajectories of some tumors in higher eukaryotes.</p><p>The most important question is what truly novel insight this study brings. The conclusions touch upon different fields (evolution, DNA replication and cancer), but it is unclear if the results really provide sufficient novel and general insight into any of these to merit publication in eLife. Several studies have evolved lines in which an important (or even &quot;essential&quot;) gene was inactivated, and it has already been shown that cells can often evolve suppressor mutations. Moreover, the mutational paths found in this study seem highly unlikely in natural populations because the Ctf4 deletion strain suffers such a high fitness defect. While there are some striking parallels with tumor progression, it is also unclear whether the deletion of Ctf4 really provides a solid model for replication stress and the mutational path in tumors. Lastly, whereas the compensatory mutations provide some clues into the function of Ctf4 (productive loading of cohesin?), these would need to be verified.</p><p>So, in a way, while the paper touches upon several very interesting basic questions and important phenomena, none of these are followed through in detail.

For suppressor screens (Liu et al., 2015), single mutations must be capable of overcoming lethality and for the large scale, systematic studies of genetic interactions (van Leeuwen et al., 2016), the mutations must have effects larger than the noise in the fitness measurements. In contrast, the only requirement in our work is that the cumulative effect of multiple mutations is sufficient to substantially increase reproductive fitness. We have added the following paragraph to make this point.</p><p>“Previous studies have argued that perturbations in DNA replication are less likely to be repaired by single compensatory mutations than other processes, such as intracellular trafficking. We believe that the explanation for this difference between these studies and our own lies in the different nature of the mutations that are selected. Suppressor screens rely on single mutations that can either rescue lethality or whose fitness effect is greater than the noise in systematic analyses of genetic interactions. In contrast, experimental evolution following non-lethal perturbations allows for the sequential acquisitions of small-effect mutations that collectively rescue the perturbed process. Our experiment suggests that although the single mutations that can fully repair genetic damage to DNA replication are rare, the existence of combination of small-effect mutations that can repair perturbations make it evolutionarily plastic.”</p></body></sub-article></article>
