development of adult psychopathology. Common across multiple rodent models of early adversity is increased signaling via forebrain Gq-coupled neurotransmitter receptors. We addressed whether enhanced Gq-mediated signaling in forebrain excitatory neurons during postnatal life can evoke persistent mood-related behavioral changes. Excitatory hM3Dq DREADD-mediated chemogenetic activation of forebrain excitatory neurons during postnatal life (P2–14), but not in juvenile or adult windows, increased anxiety-, despair-, and schizophrenia-like behavior in adulthood. This was accompanied by an enhanced metabolic rate of cortical and hippocampal glutamatergic and GABAergic neurons. Furthermore, we observed reduced activity and plasticity-associated marker expression, and perturbed excitatory/inhibitory currents in the hippocampus. These results indicate that Gq-signaling-mediated activation of forebrain excitatory neurons during the critical postnatal window is sufficient to program altered mood-related behavior, as well as functional changes in forebrain glutamate and GABA systems, recapitulating aspects of the consequences of early adversity.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Stress and adversity in early childhood can have long-lasting effects, predisposing people to mental illness and mood disorders in adult life. The weeks immediately before and after birth are critical for establishing key networks of neurons in the brain. Therefore, any disruption to these neural circuits during this time can be detrimental to emotional development. However, it is still unclear which cellular mechanisms cause these lasting changes in behavior.</p><p>Studies in animals suggest that these long-term effects could result from abnormalities in a few signaling pathways in the brain. For example, it has been proposed that overstimulating the cells that activate circuits in the forebrain – also known as excitatory neurons – may contribute to the behavioral changes that persist into adulthood.</p><p>To test this theory, Pati et al. used genetic engineering to modulate a signaling pathway in male mice, which is known to stimulate excitatory neurons in the forebrain. The experiments showed that prolonged activation of excitatory neurons in the first two weeks after birth resulted in anxious and despair-like behaviors as the animals aged. The mice also displayed discrepancies in how they responded to certain external sensory information, which is a hallmark of schizophrenia-like behavior. However, engineering the same changes in adolescent and adult mice had no effect on their mood-related behaviors.</p><p>This animal study reinforces just how critical the first few weeks of life are for optimal brain development. It provides an insight into a possible mechanism of how disruption during this time could alter emotional behavior. The findings are also relevant to psychiatrists interested in the underlying causes of mental illness after early childhood adversity.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>DREADD</kwd><kwd>anxiety</kwd><kwd>despair</kwd><kwd>schizophrenia</kwd><kwd>early stress</kwd><kwd>mouse</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001405</institution-id><institution>Tata Institute of Fundamental Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RTI4003</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Vaidya</surname><given-names>Vidita A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Enhanced Gq-signaling-mediated activation of forebrain excitatory neurons in postnatal life programs enhanced anxiety-, despair- and schizophrenia-like behavior, recapitulating key aspects of the behavioral consequences of early life adversity.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Early-life experience plays a crucial role in the maturation and fine-tuning of neurocircuitry that drives emotional behavior in adulthood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Hensch, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Hensch, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bale et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Berardi et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Carr et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Kessler et al., 2010</xref>).

The emergence of aberrant emotional behavior in these animal models has been suggested to involve a key role for both excitatory Gq-coupled and inhibitory Gi-coupled GPCRs, in particular an appropriate balance of signaling between the Gq-coupled 5-HT<sub>2A</sub> receptor and the Gi-coupled 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> receptor in the forebrain has been hypothesized to be a critical determinant of the establishment of emotional behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib114">Sarkar et al., 2014b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib112">Sargin et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Lambe et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib128">Vinkers et al., 2010</xref>). Enhanced signaling via the cortical 5-HT<sub>2A</sub> receptor is thought to be one of the common features noted across distinct models of early-life perturbations, including maternal separation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Benekareddy et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Benekareddy et al., 2011</xref>), postnatal fluoxetine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib114">Sarkar et al., 2014b</xref>) and maternal immune activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Malkova et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Moreno et al., 2011</xref>). Interestingly, a systemic blockade of the Gq-coupled 5-HT<sub>2A</sub> receptor overlapping with early stress or postnatal fluoxetine treatment can prevent the emergence of adult anxiety and depressive behavior, and associated molecular and cellular correlates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Benekareddy et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib114">Sarkar et al., 2014b</xref>). Furthermore, pharmacological stimulation of the 5-HT<sub>2A</sub> receptor during the postnatal critical window is sufficient to evoke a persistent increase in anxiety in adulthood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib114">Sarkar et al., 2014b</xref>). Collectively, these observations motivate the key question of whether perturbed Gq-coupled signaling within the forebrain in the critical postnatal window plays an important role in the establishment of persistent changes in mood-related behaviors.</p><p>Here, we have tested the hypothesis that enhanced Gq-mediated signaling in forebrain excitatory neurons during the postnatal critical window may be sufficient to program persistent alterations in mood-related behavior in adulthood. To address this central question we expressed the excitatory Designer Receptors Exclusively Activated by Designer Drugs (DREADD) in CamKIIα-positive forebrain excitatory neurons using a bigenic mouse line (CamKIIα-tTA::TetO hM3Dq) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alexander et al., 2009</xref>), and chemogenetically activated Gq signaling through oral administration of the DREADD agonist clozapine-N-oxide (CNO; 1 mg/kg) from postnatal Day 2 to 14 prior to behavioral analysis in adulthood. Our findings demonstrate that chemogenetic activation of Gq signaling in CamKIIα-positive forebrain excitatory neurons by chronic postnatal CNO (PNCNO) treatment enhances anxiety- and despair-like behavior, accompanied by impaired sensorimotor gating in adulthood. These long-lasting behavioral changes evoked by PNCNO treatment are associated with a persistent dysregulation of cortical and hippocampal glutamate/GABA metabolism, and perturbed hippocampal excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmission. The criticality of the postnatal time window is highlighted by our observation that the same perturbation performed in the juvenile window or in adulthood has no effect on mood-related behavior. Our findings provide evidence in support of the hypothesis that enhanced Gq signaling within forebrain excitatory neurons during the critical postnatal window is sufficient to evoke perturbed mood-related behavior in adulthood, recapitulating the enhanced vulnerability to psychopathology associated with early adversity.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Selective expression and activation of hM3Dq DREADD in CamKIIα-positive forebrain excitatory neurons in CamKIIα-tTA::TetO-hM3Dq bigenic mice during the postnatal window</title><p>To examine the persistent behavioral, metabolic, molecular and electrophysiological consequences of postnatal chemogenetic hM3Dq DREADD activation of forebrain excitatory neurons, CamKIIα-tTA::TetO-hM3Dq bigenic mice were generated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).

Western blotting and immunofluorescence analysis confirmed the presence of the HA-tagged hM3Dq DREADD in both the hippocampus and cortex of bigenic mouse pups (P7) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C,D</xref>). Expression of the HA-tagged hM3Dq DREADD was not observed in either the hippocampal subfields or cortex of single-positive, genotype-control mouse pups (P7) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Further, in order to delineate cell type specificity for the expression of the HA-tagged hM3Dq DREADD, we performed double immunofluorescence staining for the HA-tag with the excitatory neuron marker, CamKIIα, the inhibitory neuron marker, GABA and the astrocyte marker, glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).

A caveat to note is that our experiments with adult CamKIIα-tTA::TetO hM3Dq males and females with a history of PNCNO treatment were performed on distinct cohorts at different times. This prevented us from performing a two-way ANOVA analysis to examine sexually dimorphic behavioral effects of excitatory DREADD-mediated chemogenetic activation of forebrain excitatory neurons during postnatal life. Henceforth, all our studies to assess the behavioral, metabolic, molecular and electrophysiological influence of chronic CNO-mediated hM3Dq DREADD activation of forebrain excitatory neurons during the early postnatal window have been restricted to male mice.</p><p>We next sought to determine the influence of chronic CNO-mediated hM3Dq DREADD activation of CamKIIα-positive forebrain excitatory neurons during the early postnatal window on stereotypic behavior.

In addition, we did not observe any change in anxiety-like behavior in the LD avoidance test (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5">Figure 2—figure supplement 5L–N</xref>) as a consequence of PNCNO treatment in genotype-control mice. Despair-like behavior was also unchanged across treatment groups, indicating that CNO treatment in genotype-control mice during the postnatal window does not alter behavior on the FST (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5">Figure 2—figure supplement 5O,P</xref>).</p><p>The second control experiment to rule out potential off-target effects of chronic postnatal CNO treatment was performed in the background strain (C57BL/6J).

In contrast, chronic chemogenetic activation of CamKIIα-positive forebrain excitatory neurons in either the juvenile or adult temporal window did not result in any persistent changes in mood-related behavior. Chronic chemogenetic activation of forebrain excitatory neurons in postnatal life also resulted in persistent changes in glutamate/GABA metabolism in the hippocampus and cortex, accompanied by a long-lasting decline in hippocampal activity and plasticity-associated gene expression, and altered hippocampal spontaneous excitatory and inhibitory currents. Given prior reports that several models of early adversity exhibit enhanced signaling via Gq-coupled neurotransmitter receptors in the forebrain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Benekareddy et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Benekareddy et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Malkova et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Proulx et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib114">Sarkar et al., 2014b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Moreno et al., 2011</xref>), our findings posit that enhanced Gq-signaling-mediated activation of forebrain excitatory neurons in the critical temporal window of postnatal life may serve as a putative mechanism to program enhanced risk for adult psychopathology, a hallmark feature of models of early adversity.</p><p>Results from multiple rodent models including maternal separation (MS), maternal neglect, and postnatal fluoxetine (PNFlx) indicate that the first two weeks of postnatal life are critical to the long-lasting programming of anxiety- and despair-like behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Rebello et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib122">Suri and Vaidya, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Roque et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Freund et al., 2013</xref>). Evidence from several of these rodent models suggests enhanced functionality of Gq-coupled neurotransmitter receptors in the forebrain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Benekareddy et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Benekareddy et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Malkova et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Proulx et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib114">Sarkar et al., 2014b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Moreno et al., 2011</xref>). Furthermore, pharmacological studies indicate that stimulation of the Gq-coupled 5-HT<sub>2A</sub> receptor during the early postnatal window can program persistent mood-related behavioral changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib114">Sarkar et al., 2014b</xref>), and that 5-HT<sub>2A</sub> receptor blockade overlapping with MS or PNFLx can prevent the emergence of adult anxiety- and despair-like behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Benekareddy et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib114">Sarkar et al., 2014b</xref>). Our study directly tests the role of enhanced Gq-signaling-mediated activation of forebrain excitatory neurons in the early postnatal window in programming mood-related behavioral changes, and demonstrates that this perturbation when performed in the critical postnatal window, but not in juvenile or adult life, is sufficient to program the emergence of anxiety-, despair- and schizophrenia-like behaviors in adulthood.</p><p>Adult male mice with a history PNCNO treatment showed both enhanced anxiety- and despair-like behavior, whereas adult female mice exhibited enhanced anxiety-, but not despair-like behavioral changes. Sexually dimorphic effects of early adversity have been previously reported, with females suggested to be resistant to some of the behavioral consequences of early adversity, in particular the programming of despair-like behavioral changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Leussis et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Roman et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Dimatelis et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Lundberg et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Desgent et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">de Melo et al., 2018</xref>). Our results raise the possibility of sexually dimorphic behavioral consequences of early postnatal chemogenetic activation of forebrain excitatory neurons. A caveat of our study is that the neurometabolic, electrophysiological and molecular experiments were performed only in adult male mice, with a limited battery of behavioral analysis carried out in adult females, in part due to the large numbers of bigenic mice required to be maintained for these experiments. This precluded the possibility of careful analysis of sexual dimorphism in the consequences of enhanced Gq- signaling-driven within forebrain excitatory neurons in postnatal life, which will require detailed further experimentation.</p><p>Given that thus far very few studies have used chemogenetic strategies during developmental time windows (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib125">Teissier et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib139">Wong et al., 2018</xref>), we characterized the consequences of hM3Dq DREADD activation of forebrain excitatory neurons in the postnatal window using both electrophysiological and biochemical approaches. Our observation of hM3Dq DREADD-mediated induction of robust spiking activity in postnatal slices parallels observations made in adulthood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alexander et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Pati et al., 2019</xref>). Chronic chemogenetic hM3Dq DREADD activation during postnatal life enhanced neuronal activity marker expression in the hippocampus and cortex, as well as increased network activity, enhanced spontaneous excitatory events, and reduced spontaneous inhibitory events in CA1 pyramidal neurons in PNCNO-treated mouse pups. Our studies also indicated that chronic chemogenetic hM3Dq DREADD activation of forebrain excitatory neurons during postnatal life does not impact normal physical growth, developmental milestones such as eye opening or ontogeny of reflex development. We also addressed the possibility that off-target effects of CNO (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Gomez et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">MacLaren et al., 2016</xref>) may impact our interpretations by extensively addressing effects of postnatal CNO treatment to genotype-control or background strain mouse pups, and noted no change in the emergence of anxiety- or despair-like behaviors in adulthood. These controls are particularly relevant given that very few reports have used chemogenetic perturbations during these early postnatal windows (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib125">Teissier et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib139">Wong et al., 2018</xref>). Our results do not allow us to completely rule out potential off-target effects of PNCNO treatment on locomotion in the OFT in adulthood. In this regard, our studies using an alternate DREADD agonist C21 to chemogenetically activate forebrain excitatory neurons during the postnatal window resulted in robust increases in anxiety-like behavior in adulthood, with no effects noted on total locomotion. This highlights the importance of using multiple DREADD ligands, especially when considering potential off-target effects of specific DREADD agonists on behavioral tasks.</p><p>We next addressed whether chronic chemogenetic activation of CamKIIα-positive forebrain excitatory neurons in postnatal life recapitulates the effects of early adversity in programming changes in schizophrenia-like behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Girardi et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Ellenbroek et al., 1998</xref>), and repetitive behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Malkova et al., 2012</xref>). We noted a significant impairment in sensorimotor gating indicated by PPI deficits, but no change in stereotypic behavior, in adult mice with a history of PNCNO treatment. Deficient PPI is considered to be a behavioral deficit associated with schizophrenia-like behavior in both genetic or environmental perturbation based animal models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Ellenbroek et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Khan and Powell, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Mena et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Geyer et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Belforte et al., 2010</xref>). Preclinical genetic models targeting signaling pathways downstream to Gq (PLC-β1<sup>-/-</sup> mice) exhibit enhanced schizophrenia-like behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">McOmish et al., 2008</xref>). Further, loss of function of the Gq-coupled mGluR5 receptor in parvalbumin-positive interneurons increased both compulsive behavior and aberrant sensorimotor gating (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Barnes et al., 2015</xref>). It is important to note that PPI deficits are also common across various other neuropsychiatric conditions, in addition to schizophrenia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Powell et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Nestler and Hyman, 2010</xref>). Several reports indicate that early adversity during the perinatal window results in PPI impairments in adulthood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Ellenbroek et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Ko et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib119">Smith et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Fabricius et al., 2008</xref>). However, both the intensity and timing of the early stressor could program differing outcomes on PPI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Ellenbroek et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Fabricius et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Ellenbroek and Cools, 2002</xref>). For example, severe maternal deprivation evokes robust PPI deficits, whereas short duration maternal separation has no effect on PPI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Ellenbroek et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Ellenbroek and Cools, 2002</xref>). In this regard, our findings that chemogenetic activation of forebrain excitatory neurons produces an entire spectrum of mood-related behavioral changes, namely enhanced anxiety-, despair- and schizophrenia-like behaviors is suggestive of behavioral endophenotypes noted with the more severe of early stress models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Nestler and Hyman, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Bolton et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib130">Walker et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Our results that the timing of the chronic chemogenetic activation of forebrain excitatory neurons is central to determining consequent changes in mood-related behavior underscores the key importance of ‘critical’ periods for programming emotionality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Bock et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Leonardo and Hen, 2008</xref>). We observed no change in anxiety-, despair- and schizophrenia-like behaviors in either the juvenile or adult chronic CNO paradigms. Our treatment involved administration of the DREADD agonist CNO orally to pups/juveniles, and intraperitoneally to adult mice. Although we cannot assume that the effects observed across lifespan involved equivalent pharmacodynamics of CNO, it is noteworthy that there is no effect on anxiety-like behavior following chronic administration of CNO in both juvenile and adult CamKIIα-hM3Dq bigenic mice. This suggests that the chemogenetic activation of Gq signaling in forebrain excitatory neurons needs to be performed in the postnatal window (P2–14) to program persistent mood-related behavioral changes. While our studies do not allow us to parcellate out the exact duration of this critical window, it likely encompasses the first two weeks of life. In this regard, both the MS and PNFLx models have critical periods spanning from P2 to 14 and P2–11, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Rebello et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Roque et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Freund et al., 2013</xref>). These temporal windows overlap with distinct critical periods including the stress hyporesponsive period (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib115">Schmidt et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Levine, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib121">Suchecki, 2018</xref>), a neurodevelopmental window for the refinement of multiple cortical circuits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Hensch, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Hensch, 2005</xref>), including the maturation of serotonergic afferents to the cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib124">Teissier et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib129">Vitalis and Verney, 2017</xref>), and the tuning of excitation-inhibition balance across cortical microcircuits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib120">Sohal and Rubenstein, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib123">Tatti et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib142">Xue et al., 2014</xref>). The first two weeks of postnatal life also constitutes a window in which apoptotic cell death plays a key role in the shaping of neocortical microcircuitry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib140">Wong and Marín, 2019</xref>). Activity within cortical pyramidal neurons can directly shape interneuron survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib139">Wong et al., 2018</xref>), thus influencing the manner in which the optimal balance between excitatory and inhibitory neurons in cortical microcircuits is established. A recent report indicates that hM3Dq DREADD activation of the medial prefrontal cortex during postnatal life can abrogate the influence of maternal separation on oligodendrogenesis and despair-like behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib125">Teissier et al., 2020</xref>). However, the use of a pan-neuronal human synapsin promoter to drive the hM3Dq DREADD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib125">Teissier et al., 2020</xref>), and the absence of a non-maternal separation cohort makes it difficult to directly compare with our results. Our observations support the view that chemogenetic activation of forebrain excitatory neurons from P2 to 14 could impinge on several key neurodevelopmental processes, thus establishing a substrate for the emergence of perturbed mood-related behaviors in adulthood.</p><p>Associated with the long-lasting behavioral changes programmed by chronic DREADD activation of CamKIIα-positive forebrain excitatory neurons, we noted persistent dysregulation of glutamate and GABA neurotransmitter metabolism, a decline in the expression of neuronal activity- and plasticity-related markers, as well as alterations in hippocampal spontaneous excitatory and inhibitory currents. The dysregulation of both glutamate and GABA systems is amongst the key factors in the pathophysiology of several psychiatric disorders including anxiety, depression, and schizophrenia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">Sanacora et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Kendell et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Duman et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Brambilla et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Bergink et al., 2004</xref>). Neuroimaging studies on human subjects with mood disorders and schizophrenia demonstrate altered volume and resting-state functional activity in several forebrain regions, including hippocampus, sensory and frontal cortices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Koike et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib138">Wolf et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Kühn and Gallinat, 2013</xref>). A major endophenotype that reflects persistent alterations in neuronal activity in mood-related disorders is the levels and neurometabolic activity of glutamate and GABA, the major excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmitters, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">Sanacora et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Kendell et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Duman et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib127">Veeraiah et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib116">Sekar et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Godfrey et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Hasler and Northoff, 2011</xref>). Although <sup>1</sup>H-MRS has been widely used to examine the levels of these neurotransmitters in both human patients and rodents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib144">Zieminska et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Dyke et al., 2017</xref>), there has been a scarcity of studies to investigate neurometabolic activity, which represent a functional readout of metabolic dynamics in these neurocircuits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Patel et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">de Graaf et al., 2003</xref>). We employed <sup>1</sup>H-[<sup>13</sup>C]-NMR spectroscopy to measure the metabolic rate of excitatory and inhibitory neurons in conjunction with infusion of [1,6-<sup>13</sup>C<sub>2</sub>]glucose (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Patel et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib126">Tiwari et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Patel et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">de Graaf et al., 2003</xref>). The glutamate hypothesis of mood disorders is based on observations of elevated glutamate levels, associated with changes in glutamate receptors, biosynthetic and regulatory pathways both in human patients and rodent models of anxiety/despair-like behavior and schizophrenia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">Sanacora et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Duman et al., 2019</xref>). Consistent with this hypothesis, we observed an increase in glucose oxidation in the TCA cycle of glutamatergic neurons in the hippocampus and cortex of adult mice with a history of PNCNO treatment. The rate of neuronal glucose oxidation and neurotransmitter cycle are stoichiometrically coupled during the entire range of brain activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Patel et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Hyder et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib118">Sibson et al., 1998</xref>). Hence, increased neuronal glucose oxidation in PNCNO-treated mice suggests enhanced excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmission. Furthermore, we observed an increase in metabolic rate of hippocampal GABAergic neurons, and a trend toward an increase in this measure in the cortex. It is important to note that though we see an increase in metabolic rate of both glutamatergic and GABAergic neurons, a history of PNCNO treatment does not influence the neurotransmitter pool of glutamate or GABA either in the hippocampus or cortex. While our observations for enhanced glutamatergic metabolic rate in PNCNO-treated animals are consistent with clinical and preclinical reports of enhanced glutamate function in mood disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">Sanacora et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Duman et al., 2019</xref>), our observations with GABA differ from the reports of reduced GABA levels observed in human subjects and several adult-onset stress based rodent models of mood-related behavioral changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Duman et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Pilc and Nowak, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Kalueff and Nutt, 2007</xref>). Thus far, neurometabolic studies on preclinical models of early-life stress, or in patients with a life history of early adversity have not been carried out, making it difficult to directly compare our observations. Collectively, our results suggest that driving enhanced Gq-signaling-based activation of forebrain excitatory neurons in the postnatal window can evoke persistent dysregulation of amino acid neurotransmitter system metabolism, which may contribute to the long-lasting behavioral changes.</p><p>We focused our gene expression and electrophysiological studies on the hippocampus, which has been strongly implicated in mood-related disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib111">Santos et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Campbell and Macqueen, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Femenía et al., 2012</xref>). Early stress influences both hippocampal neuronal morphology and plasticity, features that contribute to the behavioral sequelae of early trauma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Kim et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Fenoglio et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Maccari et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">McEwen et al., 2016</xref>). We noted a decreased expression of several activity- and plasticity-related markers within the hippocampus, observed months post the cessation of PNCNO treatment, indicative of persistent molecular changes that ensue from the transient postnatal perturbation. These markers included transcription/translation factors, scaffolding proteins, cell adhesion molecules, and ion channels previously implicated in the regulation of excitation-inhibition balance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Gatto and Broadie, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Loebrich and Nedivi, 2009</xref>). These results are suggestive of the programming of an altered excitation/inhibition within the hippocampus, which is supported by our electrophysiological observations. Several studies in the past have investigated neurophysiological consequences of early adversity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ali et al., 2011</xref>). Previous results indicate persistent dysregulation of signaling via Gq-coupled neurotransmitter receptors (M1 and 5-HT<sub>2A</sub>) in the neocortex of maternally separated animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Benekareddy et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Proulx et al., 2014</xref>).

Further, in vivo electrophysiological recordings in a model of neonatal isolation indicate a decline in hippocampal outputs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bartesaghi, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bartesaghi et al., 2006</xref>). Our observations of reduced expression of the activity marker c-Fos in all hippocampal subfields, concomitant with an increase in cumulative probabilities of sIPSC amplitude and a reduction of sIPSC interevent intervals, is indicative of decreased activity in hippocampal networks in keeping with observations in early stress models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ali et al., 2011</xref>). Our results support an overall increase in inhibitory neurotransmission within the hippocampi of adult mice with a history of PNCNO treatment. The increase in GABA flux, enhanced metabolic rate of GABAergic neurons, and the shift toward increased inhibition noted in hippocampi of PNCNO-treated mice could arise as an adaptive compensation to increased DREADD-mediated excitation during the postnatal window. The effect on hippocampal excitatory neurotransmission on the other hand appears more complex, with an increase in low amplitude and a decline in larger amplitude spontaneous events, along with an increase in the frequency of sEPSC events. This was concomitant with an increase in the cumulative probability of mEPSC amplitude, and a decline in high amplitude mIPSC events. This suggests that the overall decline in inhibition is unlikely to be cell-autonomous, and probably emerges as a consequence of an alteration in the excitatory-inhibitory recurrent network of the hippocampus. Our results do not allow us to distinguish whether the dysfunctional glutamate/GABA metabolism and neurotransmission observed in PNCNO-treated mice serve as instructive/permissive to the development of psychopathology, or simply arise as compensatory adaptations due to increased neuronal activation of forebrain excitatory neurons in the postnatal window. This motivates future experiments to address the influence of driving Gq-signaling-mediated activation of forebrain excitatory neurons in the postnatal window on excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmission in both cortical and hippocampal networks, as well as the emergence of excitation-inhibition balance within these neurocircuits. A complementary set of studies involving the perturbation of inhibitory Gi signaling within forebrain excitatory neurons in early postnatal life, both baseline and within the background of early adversity, would also provide valuable insights into the cortical microcircuitry and signaling pathways that contribute to the programming of long-lasting behavioral changes in emotionality.</p><p>In conclusion, we show that chemogenetic activation of forebrain excitatory neurons during postnatal life evokes a long-lasting increase in anxiety-, despair-, and schizophrenia-like behavior. These behavioral changes are accompanied by a dysregulation of glutamate/GABA metabolism in the cortex and hippocampus, as well as perturbed inhibitory and excitatory neurotransmission within the hippocampus in adulthood. Our perturbation evokes several of pathophysiological features associated with preclinical and clinical studies of early adversity. These findings suggest the intriguing possibility that early adversity could program specific aspects of long-lasting behavioral, molecular, metabolic and functional changes via a modulation of Gq-signaling-mediated neuronal activation of forebrain excitatory neurons within the critical temporal window of postnatal life.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals</title><p>The CamKIIα-tTA transgenic mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Mayford et al., 1996</xref>) were gifted by Dr. Christopher Pittenger, Department of Psychiatry, Yale School of Medicine.

One-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov test was performed to confirm normality. All graphs were plotted using GraphPad Prism (Graphpad Software Inc, USA). Data are expressed as mean ± standard error of the mean (S.E.M) and statistical significance was set at p&lt;0.05. To account for type I errors, the qPCR data were further subjected to the two-stage linear step-up procedure of Benjamini, Krieger and Yekutieli method to calculate false discovery rate (FDR) at 5%. Vehicle and PNCNO-treatment groups were subjected to linear regression followed by ANCOVA in order to compare input-output curves and statistical significance was set at p&lt;0.05. For the analysis of spontaneous current data, amplitudes and interevent intervals of events recorded from vehicle or PNCNO-treatment groups were converted to corresponding cumulative probability distributions and then subjected to Kolmogorov-Smirnov two-sample comparison. Statistical significance was set at p&lt;0.001.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We are grateful to Prof. Rishikesh Narayan (Molecular Biophysics Unit, Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore) for his valuable inputs on the manuscript.

consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Kate Wassum as the Senior Editor The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Jessica Bolton (Reviewer #1); Amelia J Eisch (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>We would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). Specifically, we are asking editors to accept without delay manuscripts, like yours, that they judge can stand as <italic>eLife</italic> papers without additional data, even if they feel that they would make the manuscript stronger. Thus the revisions requested below only address clarity and presentation.</p><p>This manuscript represents an interesting and thorough exploration of whether chronic postnatal chemogenetic activation of forebrain excitatory neurons can &quot;phenocopy&quot; the effects of early-life adversity and provoke long-term changes in emotional function. The authors demonstrate that chronic Gq activation in the forebrain can cause long-term changes in anxiety-like behavior, depressive-like behavior, and pre-pulse inhibition. We noted considerable rigor in the experimental design.</p><p>The reviewers and editors agree that your paper is potentially suitable for <italic>eLife</italic>. However, they noted several concerns that should be addressed.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) It is not sufficient to just confirm that forebrain and hippocampus express the Gq-DREADD; controls where you expect no expression need to be included along with cell type-specificity; e.g., is it expressed in CamKIIα+ neurons specifically and not in interneurons and glia?</p><p>2) A 2-way ANOVA with sex as a factor needs to be performed to determine whether the males and females are different from each other in how they respond to Gq activation (an interaction with sex will uncover a lack of a sex difference). In addition, the justification for only using males is weak, and needs to be strengthened in the Discussion. Please include males and females in the same figure (Figure 2) for ease of comparison.</p><p>3) The decrease in distance traveled in the OFT provides a caveat to the other measures in the OFT, especially since the % time in center is not different. Please discuss the possibility that this could be an effect on locomotion, not on anxiety.</p><p>4) Object-discrimination memory does not depend on the hippocampus; why was a hippocampus-dependent task not used since this region is a focus of the report? Animals with early-life adversity are more likely to be hindered on the object-location memory task, which is more challenging and relies on the hippocampus (see Molet et al., 2016, Hippocampus). Please comment on this limitation of your experiments in the Discussion. More importantly, please do not state that you have seen no changes in &quot;cognition&quot;, which is far too broad of a category to claim based on the limited behavioral tasks that were tested.</p><p>5) The decrease in total distance traveled in the OFT after PNCNO is similar to what is seen the OFT of bigenic mice with PNCNO, so this effect is likely to be due to CNO itself, rather than Gq-DREADD activation. This result needs to be mentioned as an experimental caveat in the Discussion.</p><p>6) For more direct translational implications, an obvious extension would be to suggest using Gi-DREADDs in the context of an early-adversity model in order to prevent changes.</p><p>7) How exactly was the CNO orally administered from P2-14? Gavage? Did the pups lick the CNO? Please give a strong rationale for the ways that were utilized to ensure that each pup received the exact same dose. Was the CNO dissolved first in DMSO, as is typically done because it is not very water-soluble?</p><p>8) The way the task was setup lends itself to a pronounced ceiling effects – it sounds too easy. It is no wonder you didn't see any difference, because everyone is probably at ceiling. Why did mice explore the familiar objects again for 5 minutes on the 5th day, and then why was one familiar object replaced with the novel object? And how can a novel object be inserted in the middle of the test without fully disturbing the mice, and clearly indicating which was the novel object? Typically, the 5th day would be one familiar object and one novel object, in order to assess long-term (24-hour) memory of the familiar object. Please clarify and discuss this.</p><p>9) The authors' conclusion of a lack of off-target CNO effects is not definitive without direct comparison of behavioral results among at least three groups (CNO-hM3Dq, CNO-control, and Veh-hM3Dq). If this is not possible due to their breeding strategy, testing an alternative designer drug without back metabolism (C21 or J compound) is needed. If this is not possible, the conclusions should be modified appropriately and the caveats clearly listed.</p><p>10) The authors state chemogenetic stimulation of forebrain excitatory neurons during postnatal life (P2-14), but not during the juvenile or adult periods, increases anxiety-, despair-, and schizophrenia-like behavior in adulthood. However, this statement emerges from comparing groups that received CNO (1 mg/kg) via oral administration and i.p. administration. As the level of CNO into the brain varies by drug delivery route, the comparison of different ages should be made among group of mice that received the same route of administration and dose of CNO. If this is not possible, the conclusions should be modified appropriately and the caveats noted.</p><p>11) While acute CNO injection in early postnatal life led to an immediate increase in cellular activity, repeated CNO injection in early life (P2-14) led to decreased cellular activity in adulthood, as well as anxiety- and depressive-like behavior. The authors interpret this as early life chemogenetic forebrain stimulation has negative consequences in adulthood. What about the possibility that the early adverse event (stimulation) and its long-lasting negative effect on mood related behaviors are due to seizures or seizure-related brain activity? Prior work from the Roth and McNamara groups shows forebrain chemogenetic mouse models can have a range of behaviorally-relevant symptoms with various CNO doses (and some effects even in the absence of CNO), including seizures. Please discuss. Furthermore, what evidence do the authors have that the early life chemogenetic forebrain stimulation does not increase cell death in adulthood? If no evidence is available, this is a reasonable discussion point.</p><p>12) Please ensure that your Materials and methods includes information on mice/cage in all cases.</p><p>13) Please ensure that you include full statistical reporting, including F and t values, degrees of freedom etc. for each statistical result.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Chronic postnatal chemogenetic activation of forebrain excitatory neurons evokes persistent changes in mood behavior&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>.

This data has now been included as a new supplementary figure (Figure 1—figure supplement 1), and we have modified our Materials and methods and Results section to reflect these new data. Our immunofluorescence experiments indicate that the HA-tagged hM3Dq-DREADD selectively co-localizes with CamKIIα-positive excitatory neurons in the forebrain, with high expression noted in hippocampal subfields and the neocortex (Figure 1—figure supplement 1B). High magnification images indicate that expression of the HA-tagged hM3Dq-DREADD is likely to be present on the membrane of CamKIIα-positive excitatory neurons (Figure 1—figure supplement 1B). In contrast, we did not observe any HA-tagged hM3Dq-DREADD immunofluorescence staining on either GABAergic inhibitory neurons or on GFAP-positive astrocytes (Figure 1—figure supplement 1C). In addition, we also noted the absence of HA-tagged hM3Dq-DREADD expression in subcortical regions, including the hypothalamus, pallidum, and periaqueductal gray (Figure 1—figure supplement 1D). This is consistent with prior reports from the Roth lab (Alexander et al., 2009) using the bigenic CamKIIα-tTA::TetO hM3Dq mouse line.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) A 2-way ANOVA with sex as a factor needs to be performed to determine whether the males and females are different from each other in how they respond to Gq activation (an interaction with sex will uncover a lack of a sex difference).

However, we ran these experiments in adult CamKIIα-tTA::TetO-hM3Dq males and females with a history of PNCNO treatment in distinct cohorts of animals, and at different times. Thus, given the behavioral battery was run for the males and females separately, we cannot now combine the data into one figure, and perform 2-way ANOVA on the combined dataset. We agree that this is a caveat to consider while interpreting the results of our study, and further experiments are required to carefully address the possibility of sexually dimorphic effects on mood-related behavior following excitatory DREADD-mediated chemogenetic activation of forebrain excitatory neurons during postnatal life. We have stated this caveat in our Results and Discussion section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The decrease in distance traveled in the OFT provides a caveat to the other measures in the OFT, especially since the % time in center is not different. Please discuss the possibility that this could be an effect on locomotion, not on anxiety.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that a decrease in total distance travelled in the OFT arena (Figure 1F) in PNCNO-treated adult male mice could indicate a potential impact on locomotion, in addition to effects on anxiety-like behavior. Along with a decline in total distance travelled in the center, we also noted a decrease in percent distance travelled (Figure 1C) and number of entries to the center (Figure 1E) as well, suggestive of enhanced anxiety-like behavioral responses in the PNCNO-treated group. These data along with an increased anxiety-like behavior in the EPM and LD box test, suggest that a history of PNCNO-treatment increases anxiety-like behavior in bigenic CamKIIα-hM3Dq mice. In addition, we did not observe any significant difference in total distance travelled in the EPM. However, we cannot completely rule out possible off-target effects of CNO treatment on locomotion considering the fact that our perturbation was carried out during the critical period of maturation of many forebrain circuits. When we used the alternate DREADD agonist Compound 21 (C21), we did not observe any change in total locomotion in the OFT in PNC21 treated adult male mice, but did observe significant increases in anxiety-like behavior. We have now included a point about this in the Discussion section of our manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Object-discrimination memory does not depend on the hippocampus; why was a hippocampus-dependent task not used since this region is a focus of the report? Animals with early-life adversity are more likely to be hindered on the object-location memory task, which is more challenging and relies on the hippocampus (see Molet et al., 2016, Hippocampus). Please comment on this limitation of your experiments in the Discussion. More importantly, please do not state that you have seen no changes in &quot;cognition&quot;, which is far too broad of a category to claim based on the limited behavioral tasks that were tested.</p></disp-quote><p>We are in agreement with the reviewer that assessing cognitive behavior with only the novel object recognition (NOR) test does not allow us to reach a conclusion about the effects of chronic postnatal activation of forebrain excitatory neurons on cognition. We also agree with the reviewer that the version of NOR used in our study is not a hippocampal-dependent behavioral task. Given the current limitations in our ability to conduct extensive behavioral testing for cognitive behavior in PNCNO-treated CamKIIα-tTA::TetO-hM3Dq mice, we have chosen to exclude this figure from our manuscript which is predominantly focussed on the impact of chronic postnatal activation of CamKIIα-positive forebrain excitatory neurons on mood-related behaviors. We realise that to draw a conclusion about potential effects on cognitive performance would require a detailed independent study to determine the effects of chronic postnatal activation of CamKIIα-positive forebrain excitatory neurons on a battery of cognitive behavioral tasks.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The decrease in total distance traveled in the OFT after PNCNO is similar to what is seen the OFT of bigenic mice with PNCNO, so this effect is likely to be due to CNO itself, rather than Gq-DREADD activation. This result needs to be mentioned as an experimental caveat in the Discussion.</p></disp-quote><p>We observed a small, but significant decrease in the total distance travelled in the OFT arena in the genotype control animals (Single-positive for either CamKIIα-tTA or TetO-hM3Dq) with a history of PNCNO-treatment (Figure 2—figure supplement 5F). We did not observe an effect of PNCNO-treatment on the total distance travelled in the OFT arena in the background strain (C57BL/6J). We also do not observe any alterations in total distance travelled in the EPM in either the genotype controls or the background strain with a history of PNCNO-treatment. Further, we have performed experiments with an alternate DREADD agonist, Compound 21 (C21) (now included in the manuscript as Figure 2—figure supplement 7) which when used to chemogenetically activate forebrain excitatory neurons during postnatal life (P2-14) resulted in significant increases in anxiety-like behavior in adulthood on the OFT and EPM. We did not observe any decrease in total locomotion on the OFT or EPM as a consequence of PNC21 treatment. This collectively suggests that chemogenetic activation of forebrain excitatory neurons during postnatal life does not appear to exert any robust effects on adult locomotor behavior. However, we acknowledge that the effect observed in Figure 2—figure supplement 5 does not allow us to completely rule out some off-target effects of postnatal CNO treatment on total locomotion in the OFT. We have now addressed this caveat in our Discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) For more direct translational implications, an obvious extension would be to suggest using Gi-DREADDs in the context of an early-adversity model in order to prevent changes.</p></disp-quote><p>We concur with the reviewer that postnatal activation of Gi-DREADDs in forebrain excitatory neurons would be one of the next logical questions to address. This is particularly relevant in relation to the developmental programming of mood-related behavior by the serotonergic pathway. The excitatory Gq-coupled serotonin receptor 2A (5-HT2A) and inhibitory Gi-coupled serotonin receptor 1A (5-HT1A) have been most widely studied in this regard. The developmental knockout of the 5-HT2A receptor reduces anxiety-like behavior (Weisstaub et al., 2006), whereas knocking out the 5-HT1A receptor leads to increased anxiety (Gross et al., 2002). These effects can be restored by developmentally rescuing the receptor expression only in the neocortex (Gross et al., 2002; Weisstaub et al., 2006). Past studies from our lab involving pharmacological perturbations further confirm and substantiate the hypothesis that a balance between activity mediated by these two serotonergic receptors, coupled to Gq and Gi signalling, could be crucial in long-term programming of mood-related behavior. We are currently performing experiments with Gi DREADDs to extensively examine consequences of enhanced Gi signalling in forebrain excitatory neurons during postnatal life on mood-related behaviour, the scope of which falls under a separate line of study. As suggested by the reviewer, we have included this point in our Discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) How exactly was the CNO orally administered from P2-14? Gavage? Did the pups lick the CNO? Please give a strong rationale for the ways that were utilized to ensure that each pup received the exact same dose. Was the CNO dissolved first in DMSO, as is typically done because it is not very water-soluble?</p></disp-quote><p>For the purpose of feeding, CNO (Tocris, Cat. No. 4936, UK) was directly dissolved in 5% aqueous sucrose solution. We have noted that up to 3 mg/ml CNO is readily soluble in water at room temperature and gentle vortexing. DREADD agonist compound 21 (C21; Tocris, Cat. No. 5548, UK) was dissolved in 10 μl DMSO, and then diluted in 5% aqueous sucrose solution to a 1 ml stock solution. Following this, these solutions were aliquoted and stored at -80℃ before using for oral delivery in postnatal experiments.</p><p>The pups were fed by bringing the pipette close to their mouth and dispensing the liquid on their tongue. For this purpose, a 10 μl pipette and appropriate tips were used. The pups readily licked all the solution in about two days after feeding started. Although we have not checked the brain availability of CNO, we do not see a large variance in either the levels of ERK phosphorylation or c-Fos induced following CNO-mediated hM3Dq DREADD activation in both acute (Figure 1E, F) and chronic (Figure 1—figure supplement 1) CNO-treated groups. While we are aware that gavage may ensure lesser variance in brain availability of CNO, we have deliberately avoided gavage in our feeding experiments as it could be stressful for the pups and increase handling time.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) The way the task was setup lends itself to a pronounced ceiling effects – it sounds too easy. It is no wonder you didn't see any difference, because everyone is probably at ceiling. Why did mice explore the familiar objects again for 5 minutes on the 5th day, and then why was one familiar object replaced with the novel object? And how can a novel object be inserted in the middle of the test without fully disturbing the mice, and clearly indicating which was the novel object? Typically, the 5th day would be one familiar object and one novel object, in order to assess long-term (24-hour) memory of the familiar object. Please clarify and discuss this.</p></disp-quote><p>We designed the task to assess short-term object recognition memory. We agree with the reviewer that simply using this experiment to interpret cognitive consequences of PNCNO-treatment would not be ideal. Given the current limitations in our ability to conduct extensive behavioral testing for cognitive behavior in PNCNO-treated CamKIIα-tTA::TetO hM3Dq mice, we have chosen to exclude this figure from our manuscript which is predominantly focussed on the impact of chronic postnatal activation of CamKIIα-positive forebrain excitatory neurons on mood-related behaviors. We thank the reviewers for their feedback, and agree that extensive additional experiments are required prior to drawing a conclusion on the cognitive consequences of PNCNO treatment.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) The authors' conclusion of a lack of off-target CNO effects is not definitive without direct comparison of behavioral results among at least three groups (CNO-hM3Dq, CNO-control, and Veh-hM3Dq). If this is not possible due to their breeding strategy, testing an alternative designer drug without back metabolism (C21 or J compound) is needed. If this is not possible, the conclusions should be modified appropriately and the caveats clearly listed.</p></disp-quote><p>We do agree with the reviewer that we have not performed a direct comparison between the bigenic and genotype/background control groups. This was not possible as animals used in these control experiments belonged to different cohorts and experiments were performed at different time points. We also agree that postnatal treatment with another DREADD agonist other than CNO could serve as an essential control to further rule out nonspecific off-target effects of CNO administration. As per the suggestion of the reviewer, we orally administered the DREADD agonist compound 21 (C21) to bigenic CamKIIα-hM3Dq mice during the first two weeks of postnatal life and assayed for anxiety-like behavior in adulthood on the open field test (OFT) and elevated plus maze test (EPM). This experimental paradigm was identical to the PNCNO-treatment paradigm with the only difference being the administration of C21 instead of CNO. In agreement with the anxiogenic effects observed in adulthood in mice with a history of PNCNO-treatment, we noted that chronic chemogenetic activation of CamKIIα-positive forebrain excitatory neurons using C21 during the early postnatal window results in a long-lasting increase in anxiety-like behavior in adult mice both on the OFT and EPM. We have now included these results in our manuscript (Figure 2—figure supplement 7). We thank the reviewer for their constructive input and believe this has strengthened our study. We have also added this point to our Discussion section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10) The authors state chemogenetic stimulation of forebrain excitatory neurons during postnatal life (P2-14), but not during the juvenile or adult periods, increases anxiety-, despair-, and schizophrenia-like behavior in adulthood. However, this statement emerges from comparing groups that received CNO (1 mg/kg) via oral administration and i.p. administration. As the level of CNO into the brain varies by drug delivery route, the comparison of different ages should be made among group of mice that received the same route of administration and dose of CNO. If this is not possible, the conclusions should be modified appropriately and the caveats noted.</p></disp-quote><p>We chose the drug administration route in mice based on our knowledge of what minimizes handling-associated stress at the particular age of treatment. In our experience, feeding in pups and juveniles is far less stressful than repeated intraperitoneal (i.p.) injections. In unpublished results from our lab, we have compared i.p. injections versus feeding-based drug administration and find that repeated i.p. injections in the postnatal and juvenile window are stressful. Feeding pups or juveniles via a micropipette, minimizes the duration of handling (~5 secs) and does not require restraining the animals in a tight hold. The animals were held in the left hand within the palm and the thumb, index, and middle fingers were gently placed around to stop it from moving. In contrast, we administered chronic CNO to adults through the i.p. route, as gavage would have been more stressful and would require longer restraint in adult mice. However, we do agree with the reviewer that different routes of administration may result in variable levels of brain availability of the DREADD agonist CNO. Thus, it is not possible for us to conclude that the effects observed across lifespan involved equivalent pharmacodynamics of CNO. We would like to point out that i.p. route would normally result in higher plasma levels of the drug as compared to the oral route. Thus, our working estimate is the brain availability of CNO is either equivalent or more in adult mice as compared to the effective concentration in either the pups or juvenile mice. Thus, it is noteworthy that there is no effect on anxiety-like behavior following chronic administration of CNO in adult CamKIIα-hM3Dq bigenic mice. We thank the reviewers for their suggestion to include this point in our Discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>11) While acute CNO injection in early postnatal life led to an immediate increase in cellular activity, repeated CNO injection in early life (P2-14) led to decreased cellular activity in adulthood, as well as anxiety- and depressive-like behavior. The authors interpret this as early life chemogenetic forebrain stimulation has negative consequences in adulthood. What about the possibility that the early adverse event (stimulation) and its long-lasting negative effect on mood related behaviors are due to seizures or seizure-related brain activity? Prior work from the Roth and McNamara groups shows forebrain chemogenetic mouse models can have a range of behaviorally-relevant symptoms with various CNO doses (and some effects even in the absence of CNO), including seizures. Please discuss. Furthermore, what evidence do the authors have that the early life chemogenetic forebrain stimulation does not increase cell death in adulthood? If no evidence is available, this is a reasonable discussion point.</p></disp-quote><p>The Roth and McNamara groups have reported seizure activity following intraperitoneal administration of CNO in mice expressing the hM3Dq DREADD in CamKIIα-positive forebrain excitatory neurons. However, the effect observed by them is far less penetrant at lower doses (e.g. 1 mg/kg i.p. injection induced seizure epilepticus in about 20-30% mice). In contrast to the effect observed by them, we have not noted any visible signs of seizing on the Racine scale, in either pups or adult mice following administration of CNO. We, however, cannot rule out the possibility of microseizure-like behavior and associated neurophysiological changes in bigenic CamKIIα-hM3Dq mice following oral administration of CNO during the postnatal window. Secondly, recent results from the Marin lab demonstrate that activity of pyramidal neurons can bi-directionally regulate cell-death in the neocortex (Wong et al., 2018). Apoptotic cell death also constitutes one of the key physiological phenomena during the maturation of neocortical microcircuitry, with approximately 25-35% cell death occurring during the first two weeks of postnatal life (Wong and Marin, 2019). We have not assessed the effect of chronic chemogenetic activation of CamKIIα-positive forebrain excitatory neurons during early postnatal window on cell death in the neocortex. Thus, we cannot rule out the possibility of the effect of PNCNO-treatment on cell death, and its subsequent impact on adult neurophysiology and behavior.</p><p>Modulation of cell-death could potentially serve as one of the many downstream effectors via which chronic increase in forebrain excitatory tone during postnatal life evokes long-lasting behavioral alterations and this motivates future experiments to delineate the downstream cellular/circuit mechanisms. We have now mentioned this in our Discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>12) Please ensure that your Materials and methods includes information on mice/cage in all cases.</p></disp-quote><p>For the postnatal feeding experiments, we have used a litter size of 6-8 pups/litter with one litter housed per cage, with each postnatal treatment experiment using pups derived from multiple litters to minimize any litter-related bias.
