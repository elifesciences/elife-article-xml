been held back by instability and variable expression. We have taken a pragmatic approach to improving expression and stability of NA by grafting antigenic surface loops from low-expressing NA proteins onto the scaffold of high-expressing counterparts. The resulting hybrid proteins retained the antigenic properties of the loop donor while benefiting from the high-yield expression, stability, and tetrameric structure of the loop recipient. These hybrid proteins were recognised by a broad set of human monoclonal antibodies elicited by influenza infection or vaccination, with X-ray structures validating the accurate structural conformation of the grafted loops and the enzymatic cavity. Immunisation of mice with NA hybrids induced inhibitory antibodies to the loop donor and protected against lethal influenza challenge. This pragmatic technique offers a robust solution for improving the expression and stability of influenza NA proteins for vaccine development.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>influenza virus</kwd><kwd>neuraminidase</kwd><kwd>protein expression</kwd><kwd>loop grafting</kwd><kwd>vaccine</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Viruses</kwd><kwd>Influenza</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100005150</institution-id><institution>Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2024-I2M-2-001-1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rijal</surname><given-names>Pramila</given-names></name><name><surname>Townsend</surname><given-names>Alain RM</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100020950</institution-id><institution>National Science and Technology Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>111-2628-B-002-053-</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Huang</surname><given-names>Kuan-Ying A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100020950</institution-id><institution>National Science and Technology Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>112-2314-B-002-099-MY3</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Huang</surname><given-names>Kuan-Ying A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000265</institution-id><institution>Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MR/S007555/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bowden</surname><given-names>Thomas A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010269</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id award-id-type="doi">10.35802/203141</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bowden</surname><given-names>Thomas A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100006477</institution-id><institution>National Taiwan University</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NTU-CC-113L892904</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Huang</surname><given-names>Kuan-Ying A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100006477</institution-id><institution>National Taiwan University</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NTU-CC-114L891104</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Huang</surname><given-names>Kuan-Ying A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund8"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Townsend-Jeantet Prize Charitable Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Townsend</surname><given-names>Alain RM</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection, and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.

Currently, influenza subunit vaccines focus on haemagglutinin and contain minimal amounts of NA, despite emerging evidence from multiple studies indicating NAâs importance as an independent protective antigen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kilbourne et al., 1995</xref>; reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Air, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Eichelberger et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Giurgea et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Rajendran et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Zhang and Ross, 2024</xref>). However, recombinant NA protein expression is often bedevilled by low yield and poor stability, with substantial variation in NA protein yields across different virus strains (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Ellis et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Prevato et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Ecker et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Martinet et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">van der Woude et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Subathra et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Schmidt et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Nivitchanyong et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Margine et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Liu et al., 2015</xref>). With the ExpiCHO transient expression system (Thermo Fisher), we have found that yields of the N1 subtype NA varied from undetectable (H1N1/2019) to a maximum of 380 mg/l of culture (H5N1/2021).</p><p>We have applied structural and epitope information to devise a solution to improve the expression and stability of our recombinant NAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1</xref>).

The polypeptide chain of the NA monomeric head folds into six, topologically identical, four-stranded, antiparallel Î²-sheets which are arranged like the blades of a propeller (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Varghese et al., 1983</xref>). Each of the six Î²-sheet blades, numbered B1âB6, is composed of four antiparallel Î²-strands in a W-shape numbered S1âS4. The Î²-strands in the âWâ are connected at the top and bottom by loops (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). The loop between the fourth strand of the preceding Î²-sheet and the first strand of the following sheet (L01), and the loop between the second and third strands (L23) form most of the top surface and the active site of the NA and were delineated in the first crystal structure of the N2 NA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Varghese et al., 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Colman et al., 1983</xref>) and in subsequent structures (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Air, 2012</xref>). As there are six Î²-sheets in each NA monomer, there are six L01 and six L23 loops that together form most of the top surface of each identical NA monomer with a final contribution from the C-terminal domain (CTD) of ~17 amino acids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Surface antigenic loops transfer method to design NA hybrid protein.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) NA anatomy.

The Î²-strands of the H5N1/21 protomer (mSN1, left) are coloured pale brown, with the B6L01 and B6L23 loops coloured magenta and cyan blue, respectively. The C-terminal domain (CTD) is shown in pale green, and the calcium ion is depicted as a green sphere. Eight highly conserved residues in the catalytic site (R118, D151, R152, R225, E277, R293, R368, and Y402, N1 numbering based on msN1) are shown as yellow sticks.

B6L01 and B6L23 residues grafted into the N1/09 and N1/19 hybrid proteins are shown as yellowâgreen sticks.

Local root-mean square (RMS) deviations between equivalent CÎ± pairs are mapped following the overlay of N1/09 (<italic>left</italic>) and N1/19 (<italic>right</italic>) onto the crystal structure of msN1. The b-propeller of msN1 is shown in a putty tube representation, with colour and radius reflecting the local RMS deviation values between equivalent CÎ± pairs. RMS deviations are generally below 0.5 Ã, with modestly higher values in the inherently flexible B1L23 and B6L23 loops. (<bold>c</bold>) Active site cavities. The msN1 surface is coloured brown, except for the C-terminal loop region (green). The N1/09 and N1/19 surfaces are in blue and violet, respectively. In mSN1, the rim of the cavity containing the active site is traced with a blue dashed line. The position of the active site is denoted by a sialic acid molecule (greyâblue sticks), taken from a superposed, related structure (PDB ID: 2BAT). The msN1 structure revealed differences among the protomers of the tetramer at the active site entrance. Within the same tetramer, protomers with a relatively narrow cavity (i) combine with protomers showing a wider entrance (ii). This difference is dictated by the trajectory of the B1L23 loop (<italic>150-loop</italic>; dark blue with yellow side chains). The variation in trajectory between (i) and (ii) is most pronounced at Val149 (red surface). In contrast, the N1/09 and N1/19 hybrids show no noticeable differences between the protomer cavities, all of which closely resemble the wider msN1(ii) conformation, apart from minor, local widening of the rim induced by the substitution of Y344 with an asparagine residue (shown as light-green sticks).</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-105317-fig4-v1.tif"/></fig><p>While the scaffold is structurally conserved across the three resolved structures, each possesses unique active site conformations, which are primarily influenced by the L01 and L23 loops surrounding the active site cavity.

We tested a wide range of virus-specific and cross-reactive human mAbs, and with few exceptions, the antibodies bound to the hybrid proteins. In addition, the CD6 antibody, that binds across two monomers and only to fully formed tetramers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Wan et al., 2015</xref>), bound to our hybrid proteins held together by the TB tetramerisation domain. Finally, the crystal structures of our hybrid N1 proteins confirmed that the grafted loops had retained their expected conformations. Together, these data suggested that the hybrid proteins had folded correctly and, in most pairs, combined the expression and stability characteristics of the scaffold donor with the antigenic properties of the loop donor.</p><p>Ellis et al. defined 44 residues that form contacts between N1 2009 monomers that could be involved in maintaining the stability of a tetramer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Ellis et al., 2022</xref>). In their final design of the stabilised sNAp-155 N1 2009 NA, they replaced 10 of these 44 amino acids to obtain a stable 2009 N1 tetramer supported by a VASP tetramerisation domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2âfigure supplement 2</xref>). In our hybrids, tetramerised with TB, these 10 residues are completely conserved between the scaffold and loop donors, so the source of stability for our hybrid proteins must lie elsewhere.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>The distribution of epitopes on NA</title><p>Varghese et al. described the structure of L01 and L23 loops on the top surface of N2 NA and showed that these loops contribute largely to the active site, notably including 7 of 8 conserved residues in the catalytic site and 8 of 11 conserved framework residues that support the site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Varghese et al., 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Colman et al., 1983</xref>). Also, in the L01 and L23 loops surrounding the active site, they noted multiple variable residues that vary seasonally associated with antigenic drift, and that can be selected for viral resistance by monoclonal antibodies in vitro. Resistance mutations selected for by three N2 murine mAbs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Webster et al., 1982</xref>) and N9 mAbs were within loops B3L01, B5L01, and B5L23 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Colman et al., 1983</xref>). Over the last 40 years, many similar studies have been done with murine and human monoclonal antibodies to various NAs. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1âfigure supplement 2</xref>, we have collected a set that identifies 31 sites of amino acid substitution selected by monoclonal antibodies in independent experiments. Twenty-five of these are in loops 01 and 23, with three additional sites in immediate neighbour positions to these loops (90% altogether). Three additional sites of selection can be assigned to the underside of the NA head at the interface of stalk and head (position 88), B4 loop 12 (position 285), and B4 loop 34 (position 309). In addition, a recent study of human sera identified position 386 on B5 loop 34 as responsible for an antigenic change between N1/1977 and N1/1986 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Daulagala et al., 2023</xref>).</p><p>Crystal structures of bound Fab fragments give further information on the footprints of protective antibodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1âfigure supplement 3</xref>). The majority describe binding to the L01 and L23 loops, with recent examples also confirming binding to the side (CD6, NA-22) and underside of NA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Wan et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Yasuhara et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Lederhofer et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Zhu et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hansen et al., 2023</xref>). It is important to note that loops 01 and 23 include a part of epitopes that have been described in the literature as side, lateral, or underside (see mAbs NDS.1, NDS.3, and CD6 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1âfigure supplement 3</xref>). The majority of antibodies defined by crystallography bind within the surface of a single monomer, with recent structural evidence that a few mAbs bind across two monomers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Wan et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Zhu et al., 2019</xref>). Finally, several structures of antibodies that bind within the active sites of a broad range of NAs have been described, all of which contact the L01 and L23 loops (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Jiang et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Yasuhara et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Momont et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Stadlbauer et al., 2019</xref>). From these data, we suggest that most antibodies generated by NA that are likely to be protective bind to the L01 and L23 loops, while a minority bind to epitopes on the underneath and side of the NA head that are not included within the L01 and L23 loops.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Definition of loops</title><p>To align the top surface loops in N1 proteins, we relied on loop annotations from the N2 NA structure resolved to 2.9 Ã by Varghese et al. as a reference (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Varghese et al., 1983</xref>). The loop definitions in the structure later resolved to 2.2 Ã differed slightly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Varghese and Colman, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1</xref>). We suggest that loop annotations for a grafting experiment should not be rigid and require some judgement, particularly for residues at the margins of loops, taking into consideration solvent accessibility in crystal structures, evidence for evolutionary selection, viral resistance mutations selected with mAbs in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1âfigure supplement 2</xref>), and defined crystal structures of bound antibodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1âfigure supplement 3</xref>). For instance, in our N1/19 hybrid design, residue N200S could have been considered as part of loop B2L23 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Varghese and Colman, 1991</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>). In addition, the CTD contributes to surface residues and may be suitable for grafting, since residues within this section of NA have been selected by mAbs in vitro and clearly evolve over time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Colman et al., 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1âfigure supplement 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1âfigure supplement 3</xref>). However, the CTD of N1 was conserved in all of our examples.</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Vaccination with hybrid NAs</title><p>Our NA vaccination strategy is based on our earlier evidence that linking tetrameric NAs to the mi3 vaccine-like particle (valency of 60) via a SpyTag/SpyCatcher covalent linkage results in enhanced immunogenicity and dose sparing, with doses as low as 0.1 Î¼g of NA protein able to induce NAI antibody (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Rahikainen et al., 2021</xref>). This compares well to the higher doses of pure protein used in the majority of studies of NA immunity (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Zhang and Ross, 2024</xref>). In the present experiments, we opted for two doses of 0.5 Î¼g of mi3-linked NA that gave full protection in preliminary experiments (not shown), comparable to recent results from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Pascha et al., 2024</xref>.</p><p>In our first set of grafting experiments between N1/2009 and mSN1 (H5N1 2021), we found that while protein expression was greatly improved, antisera from animals were cross-reactive for NA inhibition between the scaffold H5N1 donor, the hybrid (with 12 amino acid replacements in the L01 and L23 loops) and the 2009 loop donor. In addition, all immunised animals were protected from challenge with 2009 H1N1 virus. These results were consistent with evidence that within the N1 subtype, there is broad cross-reactivity for antibodies and that immunisation with 2009 N1 provides at least partial protection against an avian H5N1 (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Zhang and Ross, 2024</xref>). Cross-reactivity could have been for epitopes anywhere within the NA structure.</p><p>The sequence difference in the loops between 2019 N1 donor and the H5N1 recipient was greater (16 amino acids), sufficient to provide an antigenic distance that prevented cross inhibition by antisera from animals immunised with these two NAs. The NA inhibitory activity of the antisera was predominantly specific for the L01 and L23 loops. N1/19 had four significant additional amino acid substitutions compared to N1/09 in the transferred L01 and L23 loops: N222K (B3L01), N244D (B3L23), N270K (B4L01), and K432E (B6L23). All four of these residues have been selected for resistance by inhibitory mAbs in vitro (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1âfigure supplement 2</xref>), or form contacts with mAbs demonstrated in crystal structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1âfigure supplement 3</xref>), so these residues are likely to have been responsible for the loss of cross-reactivity between N1/2019 and mSN1. We do not have a challenge model for the 2019 H1N1 virus, so we could not look for in vivo protection specific to the 2019 N1 loops.</p><p>The lack of cross-inhibition between sera raised to the avian mSN1 and the seasonal N1/19 showed that cross-reactivity of antisera to the N1 NAs is not universal and reflects the results of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lu et al., 2014</xref> who found minimal cross-reactivity of rabbit sera raised to a seasonal N1 from A/Beijing/262/1995 and an avian N1 from A/Hong Kong/ 483/1997 that we note differed by seventeen amino acids in the L01 and L23 loops.</p><p>We found that the NA of mouse-virulent H1N1 virus A/PR/8/1934 (Cambridge strain) differed by 18 amino acids in the L01 and L23 loops from the mS H5N1 scaffold donor. We therefore prepared two further hybrids in which the loops were exchanged between these two NAs. The relevant hybrids induced NA inhibitory sera that were largely loop specific, and protection against a high dose challenge with A/PR/8/34 was now dependent on matched L01 and L23 loops. In this case, antibodies to the scaffold could not have been protective, and protection correlated with the NA inhibition activity induced, mirroring the evidence from human challenge and vaccination studies (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Giurgea et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Zhang and Ross, 2024</xref>).</p><p>Taken together, these results suggest caution should be exercised in designing vaccination strategies that rely on cross-protection between seasonal NAs and future pandemic NAs.</p></sec><sec id="s3-6"><title>Limitations of the study</title><p>The three assumptions listed at the start of the discussion may not always hold. Clear examples exist of protective monoclonal antibodies that bind to epitopes in the NA scaffold, including those that bind epitopes on the side (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Wan et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Yasuhara et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Zhu et al., 2019</xref>) and underneath of the head domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Lederhofer et al., 2024</xref>). If these formed the majority of the response to vaccination, our approach would fail due to the first assumption. However, we have found that at least for the N1 subtype, the transferred loops induce both NA inhibiting antibody and provide protection against viral challenge in the mouse. In addition, loops on the underside of NA could also be exchanged. The second assumption may also be sensitive to exceptions. Ellis et al. identified 44 residues that may contribute to the contacts between NA monomers, 10 of which we note are in loops L01 and L23 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Ellis et al., 2022</xref>). If the latter were variable and turned out to be critical for stability of the tetramer, our approach would fail. We note that one of the hybrids we produced (mS hybrid with PR8 scaffold) expressed at a lower level than either parent. Finally, the assumption that the tertiary structure of the loops is maintained after grafting may not completely hold as we have found occasional mAbs that alter their binding to the hybrid protein. However, the great majority of NA inhibitory and protective antibodies isolated from humans bound the four hybrid NAs we have made. In addition, crystal structures revealed that the transferred loops of 2009 and 2019 NA donors were virtually superposable on those of the H5N1 recipient.</p><p>While we acknowledge these potential shortcomings of our approach, we recommend the loop-grafting strategy as a simple and pragmatic method to improve the yield and stability of NA protein vaccine antigens. NA loop grafting can also serve as a useful starting point for analytical methods aimed at further improvement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Ellis et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Skarlupka et al., 2023</xref>). Computationally optimised sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Skarlupka et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Job et al., 2018</xref>) designed for cross-protection might also be improved by focusing attention on the variation within the L01 and L23 loops.</p></sec><sec id="s3-7"><title>Impact</title><p>Purified NA has been safely administered to humans as a vaccine candidate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kilbourne et al., 1995</xref>) and NAI antibodies to NA have been shown to be an independent correlate of protection against influenza infection (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Giurgea et al., 2020</xref>). Enhancing current vaccines with NA proteins could substantially boost their effectiveness. A major challenge has been the production of NA at optimal yields. In this study, we developed an innovative solution via loop-grafting to produce stable and immunogenic NA protein at high yields that addresses this critical issue. Moreover, this study presents an epitope-based vaccine design and protein engineering for generating protective immunity, which could potentially be applied to other antigens.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom">Reagent type (species) or resource</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Designation</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Source or reference</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Identifiers</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Antibody</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">1G01 (anti-NA human monoclonal)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chen et al., 2018</xref></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">PDB: 6Q23</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">10 Âµg/ml</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Antibody</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">NmAbs, 24-1C (anti-NA human monoclonals)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">In-house (Kuan-Ying Huang)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="left" valign="bottom">20 Âµg/ml</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Antibody</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Goat-anti-mouse immunoglobulins HRP (polyclonal)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Dako</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">P0447</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">ELISA (1:800)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Antibody</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Rabbit-anti-human IgG HRP (polyclonal)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Dako</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">P0214</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">ELISA (1:1600)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Antibody</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">AG7C (anti-NA human monoclonal)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Rijal et al., 2020</xref></td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="left" valign="bottom">20 Âµg/ml</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Antibody</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">AF9C (anti-NA human monoclonal)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Rijal et al., 2020</xref></td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="left" valign="bottom">20 Âµg/ml</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Antibody</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">CD6 (anti-NA chimeric-human monoclonal)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Wan et al., 2015</xref>;

The dilution medium was DMEM (Gibco) supplemented with 2 mM glutamine, 10 mM HEPES, 0.1% (wt/vol) BSA, 100 U/ml penicillin, and 100 Âµg/ml streptomycin. The virus or NA concentration was pre-determined by titrating to measure the lowest concentration at top plateau, ensuring at least a fivefold signal-to-noise ratio. The mixture was transferred to a Nunc Immunoassay ELISA plate (Thermo Fisher, 439454) pre-coated overnight with 25 Î¼g/ml fetuin (Sigma-Aldrich, F3385). The plate was incubated for 18â20 hr at 37Â°C with 5% (vol/vol) CO<sub>2</sub> in a tissue culture incubator. The NA enzymatic activity was detected by adding HRP (horseradish peroxidase)-conjugated peanut agglutinin (Sigma-Aldrich, L7759) at 1 Î¼g/ml after washing the plates three times with PBS and then developing with 50 Âµl TMB (3,3â²,5,5â²-tetramethylbenzidine) substrate (SeraCare).

Changes in fluorescence were measured at 460 nm (excitation 355 nm) using a CLARIOstar. The NA concentration giving fluorescence intensity of 40â60 K units (~100-fold signal from background) was used in NA inhibition assays. NA inhibition titres of anti-sera or mAbs were determined by incubation of serially diluted sera/mAbs with NA/viruses for 1 hr before the addition of MUNANA substrate.</p><p>Area under curve and EC<sub>50</sub> for NA activity were measured using GraphPad Prism. % NA activity was calculated as {(<italic>X</italic> â Min)/(Max â Min)} Ã 100 where <italic>X</italic> = measurement value, Min = buffer only, Max = NA or virus alone.

Antibody binding was detected using a secondary goat-anti human HRP antibody. The area under the curve was measured for each mAbâs titration curve and normalised as a percentage of relative binding to one of the highest binding mAb for comparison.

The work is interesting and important, but there are several points that need the author's attention.</p><p>Major points</p><p>(1) The authors overstress the importance of the epitopes covered by the loops they use and play down the importance of antibodies binding to the side, the edges, or the underside of the NA. A number of papers describing those mAbs are also not included.</p></disp-quote><p>We have discussed the distribution of epitopes on NA molecule in the Discussion section &quot;The distribution of epitopes in neuraminidase&quot; (new line number 350). In Supplementary Figures 1 and 2, we have compiled the epitopes reported by polyclonal sera and mAbs via escape virus selection or crystal structural studies. There are 45 residues examples of escape virus selection, and we found that approximately 90% of the epitopes are located within the top loops (Loops 01 and Loops 23, which include the lateral sides and edges of NA). We have also included the epitopes of underside mAbs NDS.1 and NDS.3 in Supplementary Figure 2. Some of the interactions formed by these mAbs are also within the L01 and L23 loops. All relevant references are cited in Supplementary Figures 1 and 2.</p><p>A new figure has been added [Figure 1b (ii)] to illustrate the surface mapping of epitopes on NA.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) The rationale regarding the PR8 hybrid is not well described and should be described better.</p></disp-quote><p>We described the rationale for the PR8 hybrid (new lines 247-250). For clarity, we have added the following sentence within the section &quot;Loop transfer between two distant N1 NAs:....&quot;</p><p>(new lines 255-258):</p><p>&quot;mSN1 showed sufficient cross-reactivity to N1/09 to protect mice against virus challenge. Therefore, we performed loop transfer between mSN1 and PR8N1, which differ by 18 residues within the L01 and L23 loops and show no or minimal cross-reactivity, to assess the loop-specific protection.&quot;</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) Figure 3B and 6C: This should be given as numbers (quantified), not as '+'.</p></disp-quote><p>We have included the numerical data in Supplementary Figure 6.

Judging from SDS-PAGE provided in Supplementary Figure 3B (BS3-crosslinked), many different species are present including monomers, dimers, tetramers, and degradation products of tetramers. In line 7 for example there are at least 5 bands.</p></disp-quote><p>Tetrameric conformation of soluble proteins is evidenced by the size-exclusion chromatographs shown in Figures 3a and 6b. The BS3 crosslinked SDS-PAGE are only suggestive data, indicating that the protein is a tetramer if a band appears at ~250 kDa. However, depending on the reaction conditions, lower molecular weight bands may also be observed if crosslinking is incomplete.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Recommendations for the authors:</bold></p><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p><p>Specific comments:</p><p>- Description of Figure 2 on page 3 should go before Figure 3 lines 87-105 or swap the order of the two figures.</p></disp-quote><p>We have moved lines 91-96, which refer to Figure 3, to appear after Figure 2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- Figure 3a, an EC50 should be calculated for both NA activity assay.</p></disp-quote><p>Figure 3a has been updated to include the EC50 and AUC (Area under curve) values for both NA activity assays.

Figure S7, please show IC50 instead of curves for better comparison.</p></disp-quote><p>We included IC50 for mSN1 and N1/09 as we intended to associate the loops with protection. Graphs for N1/19 have not been reported, but the IC50 titres from pooled sera are shown in Supplementary Figure 7 as a representation. Due to the limited sera sample sourced from tail vein bleed, these assays were performed using pooled sera, which represent the total response (established in numbers of experiments).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- Line 234-238, the author made a statement about the data shown in Figure 7b &quot;These results mirrored several studies in the literature which showed that immunization with the 2009 N1 could provide at least partial protection in mice and ferrets to the avian H5N1 challenge&quot;. The data did not reflect that. In Figure 5b, mSN1 protects as well as other proteins. In fact, there was no advantage of N109 and N109 hybrid over mSN1 in protection against the homologous H1N109. Although higher levels of NAI antibodies were induced with the homologous protein in Figure 5a. The protection could be contributed by non-NAI antibodies, so the authors should measure binding antibodies. The author may increase the challenge dose from 200 LD50 to 1000 LD50 to see a difference due to the strong immunogenicity of the nanoparticles vaccine plus addavax. Otherwise, it looks like loop grafting is not necessary as heterologous NA could broadly protect.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that msN1, despite its low NAI titres, was equally protective as homologous NA or its hybrid NA against H1N1/09 virus challenge at 200 LD50. There may be additional protective components, including non-NAI antibodies in homologous groups that may have contributed to the protection.</p><p>We assessed sera binding to H1N1/2009 and found that the binding antibody levels were also lower in the msN1 group. The corresponding graph has now been added in Figure S7d. It was difficult to determine the NAI titre required to confer protection in this experiment. For this reason, we later chose PR8 as the challenge virus to demonstrate loop-specific protection.</p><p>We are uncertain whether a 1000 LD50 challenge would have helped establish a correlation between protection and NAI IC50 titres, as the dose used is already lethal for DBA/2 mice.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- Why would the authors separate work with N1/09 and N1/19 from PR8 N1? To this reviewer's understanding, they are all the same strategies with increasing numbers of dissimilar residues from N1/09 (12) to N1/19 (16) and to PR8 (18). They are all characterized by the same approaches in vitro and in vivo.</p></disp-quote><p>We had two different goals for making hybrids with N1/09 and PR8 N1, therefore, we have presented these results separately.</p><p>(1) For N1/09 and N1/19, we showed that loop-grafting improved protein yield and stability. Additionally, we showed that the N1/09 hybrid can be as protective as the homologous protein.</p><p>(2) PR8 N1 is a high-yielding protein, so loop grafting did not significantly increase its yield. However, the PR8 virus challenge confirmed loop-specific protection.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- For in vivo study testing the PR8 construct, although PR8 and PR8 hybrid protect better than the heterologous mSN1, the hybrid again did not show any advantages over the PR8 original proteins.</p></disp-quote><p>That's correct - the PR8 hybrid was not advantageous over the original PR8 protein. However, the purpose of this experiment was to demonstrate loop specific protection. The PR8 hybrid (PR8 loops - mS scaffold) protected 6/6 mice, whereas mS hybrid (mS loops - PR8 scaffold) provided no protection.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- Line 243-249, lack of reference to figures.</p></disp-quote><p>References to Supplementary Figure 7b,c and Figure 2 has been added.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- What was the reason that the challenge was one by 200 LD50 for 2009 H1N1 and 1000 LD50 for PR8.</p></disp-quote><p>Viruses were titrated in the BALB/c strain for PR8 virus and the DBA/2 strain for X-179A (H1N1/2009) virus. These doses were selected based on their lethality and the time required to reach the endpoint (~20% weight loss) post-infection, which is 5-6 days. Most studies in the literature have used 10 LD50 or higher; thus the virus doses we used are relatively high.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- Line 268, there is no Figure 5C.</p></disp-quote><p>This was a mistake and has been corrected to Figure 6c.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- Line 275 what are the readers supposed to see in supplementary Figure 5a?

For example, the role of the tetramerization domain and the basis for structurally stable tetramer formation, were not the focuses of this study.</p></disp-quote><p>We felt it was important to discuss the tetramerisation domain and the basis for stable tetramer formation. A previous study by Ellis <italic>et al.</italic> used the VASP tetramerisation domain and introduced multiple NA interface mutations to achieve a more stable closed conformation.
