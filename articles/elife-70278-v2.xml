sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) and plasma membrane (PM) forms signaling complexes that regulate the membrane potential and contractility of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs). The mechanisms responsible for these membrane interactions are poorly understood. In many cells, STIM1 (stromal interaction molecule 1), a single-transmembrane-domain protein that resides in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), transiently moves to ER-PM junctions in response to depletion of ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> stores and initiates store-operated Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry (SOCE). Fully differentiated VSMCs express STIM1 but exhibit only marginal SOCE activity. We hypothesized that STIM1 is constitutively active in contractile VSMCs and maintains peripheral coupling. In support of this concept, we found that the number and size of SR-PM interacting sites were decreased, and SR-dependent Ca<sup>2+</sup>-signaling processes were disrupted in freshly isolated cerebral artery SMCs from tamoxifen-inducible, SMC-specific STIM1-knockout (<italic>Stim1-</italic>smKO) mice. VSMCs from <italic>Stim1-</italic>smKO mice also exhibited a reduction in nanoscale colocalization between Ca<sup>2+</sup>-release sites on the SR and Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated ion channels on the PM, accompanied by diminished channel activity. <italic>Stim1-</italic>smKO mice were hypotensive, and resistance arteries isolated from them displayed blunted contractility. These data suggest that STIM1 – independent of SR Ca<sup>2+</sup> store depletion – is critically important for stable peripheral coupling in contractile VSMCs.</p></abstract><kwd-group

Ca<sup>2+</sup>-signaling microdomains formed by interactions between the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) and the plasma membrane (PM) are vital for many physiological processes, including regulation of the contractility of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Nelson et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gonzales et al., 2014</xref>). Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals that occupy these compartments are typified by Ca<sup>2+</sup> sparks – large-amplitude Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients that reflect optically detected Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions released into the cytosol from the SR through clusters of type 2 ryanodine receptors (RyR2s). Ca<sup>2+</sup> sparks activate clusters of large-conductance Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated K<sup>+</sup> (BK) channels on the PM, generating transient, macroscopic outward K<sup>+</sup> currents that hyperpolarize the PM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Nelson et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Mironneau et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">ZhuGe et al., 1999</xref>). A complementary Ca<sup>2+</sup>-signaling pathway that causes VSMC membrane depolarization and elevated contractility is formed by interactions between inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors (IP<sub>3</sub>Rs) on the SR and monovalent cation-selective, Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated TRPM4 (transient receptor potential melastatin 4) channels on the PM. Ca<sup>2+</sup> released from the SR through IP<sub>3</sub>Rs activates Na<sup>+</sup> influx through TRPM4, causing depolarization of the PM and increased VSMC contractility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gonzales et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gonzales et al., 2010b</xref>). The close association of the SR and PM creates subcellular compartments where the local Ca<sup>2+</sup> ion concentration can reach the micromolar range required for activation of BK and TRPM4 channels under physiological conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Zhuge et al., 2002</xref>). In nonexcitable cells, endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-PM junctions and associated proteins have been well characterized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chang et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chen et al., 2019</xref>). In contrast, SR-PM junctional areas of VSMCs and the essential proteins that mediate these interactions remain poorly understood.</p><p>The ER-PM junctions of nonexcitable cells are highly specialized hubs for ion channel signaling cascades. These spaces are the sites of one of the most ubiquitous receptor-regulated Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry pathways in such cells, termed store-operated Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry (SOCE), which is mediated by the ER-resident Ca<sup>2+</sup>-sensing protein STIM1 (stromal interaction molecule 1) and Ca<sup>2+</sup>-selective channels of the Orai group on the PM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Michaelis et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Mercer et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kwon et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Prakriya and Lewis, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Emrich et al., 2022</xref>). STIM1 is a single-pass transmembrane ER/SR protein that possesses a low-affinity Ca<sup>2+</sup>-sensing EF-hand facing the lumen of the ER/SR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Michaelis et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abdullaev et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Berry et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chin-Smith et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Correll et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jones et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Klejman et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Koh et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">López et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lu et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lu et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lyfenko and Dirksen, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Numaga-Tomita and Putney, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Nurbaeva et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Onodera et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Peel et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Takahashi et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Wissenbach et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Zhang et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Zhou et al., 2015</xref>). Following Ca<sup>2+</sup> store depletion by IP<sub>3</sub>-producing receptor agonists, STIM1 acquires an extended conformation and migrates to ER-PM junctions, exposing a cytosolic STIM-Orai-activating region that physically traps and activates Orai channels on the PM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Michaelis et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Mercer et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abdullaev et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Koh et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lyfenko and Dirksen, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Nurbaeva et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Peel et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Zhang et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Zhou et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Perni et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Soboloff et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Spassova et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Stathopulos et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Zhou et al., 2013</xref>). The other STIM protein family member, STIM2, is structurally similar to STIM1. Fully differentiated VSMCs from systemic arteries express STIM1 but not STIM2 and do not exhibit detectable SOCE or its biophysical manifestation, the Ca<sup>2+</sup> release-activated Ca<sup>2+</sup> (CRAC) current (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bisaillon et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Potier et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Fernandez et al., 2015</xref>). Many species express IP<sub>3</sub>Rs but lack STIM and Orai proteins, suggesting that receptor-evoked Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling is not always complemented by the operation of STIM and Orai mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Collins and Meyer, 2011</xref>). Evolutionary evidence indicates that Orai appeared before STIM, implying that STIM might have arisen to support the function of ER-PM junctions and only subsequently co-opted an existing Orai for SOCE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Collins and Meyer, 2011</xref>). Additional accumulating evidence indicates that, in addition to its role in SOCE, mammalian STIM1 protein serves as an essential regulator of several other ion channels and signaling pathways. STIM1 both positively and negatively regulates the function of L-type voltage-gated Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels (Cav1.2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Harraz and Altier, 2014</xref>), transient receptor potential canonical (TRPC) channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Worley et al., 2007</xref>), and arachidonate-regulated Ca<sup>2+</sup> (ARC) channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Mignen et al., 2007</xref>).

The canonical function of STIM1 is to enable SOCE via Orai channels, but mounting evidence suggests that the protein has additional, SOCE-independent functions. Here, we show that STIM1 is crucial for fostering SR-PM junctions and functional coupling between SR and PM ion channels that control VSMC contractility. In support of this concept, we found that the number and sizes of SR/PM coupling sites were significantly reduced in VSMCs from <italic>Stim1-</italic>smKO mice. <italic>Stim1</italic> knockout also altered the nanoscale architecture of ion channels in Ca<sup>2+</sup>-signaling complexes, transformed the properties of Ca<sup>2+</sup> sparks, and diminished BK and TRPM4 channel activity under physiological recording conditions. BK and TRPM4 channel activity and vasoconstrictor responsiveness were not altered by selective inhibition of Orai1. Resistance arteries isolated from <italic>Stim1-</italic>smKO mice exhibited blunted responses to vasoconstrictor stimuli, and animals became hypotensive following acute knockout of <italic>Stim1</italic> in smooth muscle. These findings collectively demonstrate that in contractile VSMCs STIM1 expression is necessary for the functional coupling of Ca<sup>2+</sup> release sites on the SR and Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated ion channels on the PM in a manner independent of Orai1, Ca<sup>2+</sup> store depletion, and SOCE. Loss of functional coupling in VSMCs following <italic>Stim1</italic> knockout has profound consequences, disrupting arterial function and BP regulation.</p><p>The SR-PM signaling domains of VSMCs are less orderly compared with those in cardiac and skeletal muscle cells and remain incompletely characterized. SR-PM junctions within the transverse (T) tubules of cardiomyocytes and skeletal muscle cells have regular, repeating structures that are formed, in part, by cytoskeletal elements and proteins of the junctophilin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Beavers et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Landstrom et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Takeshima et al., 2000</xref>) and triadin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Knudson et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Marty, 2015</xref>) families. In VSMCs, which lack T-tubules, SR-PM interactions occur at peripheral coupling sites that form throughout the periphery with no apparent distribution pattern. Our research team has previously identified vital roles for microtubule networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Pritchard et al., 2017</xref>) and junctophilin 2 (JPH2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Pritchard et al., 2019</xref>) in the formation of peripheral coupling sites in VSMCs. Here, we found that knockout of <italic>Stim1</italic> in VSMCs with intact SR Ca<sup>2+</sup> stores reduced the number and sizes of SR-PM colocalization sites. Why is STIM1 active under these conditions? A simple explanation is that resting SR [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] in fully differentiated, contractile VSMCs is sufficiently low to trigger constitutive activation of STIM1. This concept is supported by a report by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Luik et al., 2008</xref>, who showed that the half-maximal concentration (K<sub>1/2</sub>) of ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> for the activation of I<sub>CRAC</sub> in Jurkat T cells is 169 μM and the K<sub>1/2</sub> for redistribution of STIM1 to the PM is 187 μM. These data are in close agreement with another study, which reported that the K<sub>1/2</sub> of ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> for redistribution of STIM1 in HeLa cells was 210 μM and that for maximum redistribution was 150 μM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Brandman et al., 2007</xref>). Few studies have reported SR [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] measurements in native, contractile VSMCs. Using the low-affinity ratiometric Ca<sup>2+</sup> indicator, mag-fura-2, one well-controlled study estimated that resting SR [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] in contractile SMCs was ~110 μM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">ZhuGe et al., 1999</xref>). Under these conditions, STIM1 is expected to be in a fully active configuration that is also supported by our data where thapsigargin failed to increase the number or size of STIM1 puncta in contractile VSMCs. It is also possible that regional SR [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] levels near active Ca<sup>2+</sup>-release sites (RyRs and IP<sub>3</sub>R) are lower than global SR [Ca<sup>2+</sup>], which could further stimulate STIM1 activity at these sites and reinforce junctional coupling. Thus, we put forward the concept that STIM1 is in an active state in quiescent contractile smooth muscle and is necessary for forming Ca<sup>2+</sup>-signaling complexes that are vital for contractile function. Our data further imply that, as VSMCs transition to a proliferative phenotype during the development of disease states associated with vascular remodeling, SR Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels increase, leading to STIM1 inactivation, loss of stable peripheral coupling, and acquisition of SOCE activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Zhang et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>It would be useful to define the molecular composition of microdomains formed by the interactions of the SR and PM in VSMCs. However, we cannot image SR and PM dyes in native cells using GSDIM because the high laser levels and long exposure times required for this technique bleach the dyes. The SIM mode of our LLS instrument is ideal for imaging the dyes (due to low bleaching) but lacks the resolution of the GSDIM system needed for the nanoscale detection of protein clusters. Consequently, we cannot simultaneously image the sites of membrane interaction and protein clusters. An examination of our superresolution maps suggests that all protein clusters are uniformly distributed – there are no apparent sights of enrichment. Therefore, it seems likely that the ion channel content of the SR:PM interacting domains does not significantly differ from regions of the PM that do not interact with the SR.</p><p>Ion channel proteins in the membranes of excitable cells form discreet clusters whose sizes are exponentially distributed, a phenomenon that has been suggested to occur through stochastic self-assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Sato et al., 2019</xref>). Here, we found that acute knockout of STIM1 in VSMCs reduced the mean sizes of BK, TRPM4, and IP<sub>3</sub>R protein clusters and slightly increased the mean size of RyR2 protein clusters. According to the stochastic model proposed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Sato et al., 2019</xref>, the steady-state size of membrane protein clusters is limited by the probability of removal from the PM through recycling or degradation processes, with larger clusters having a higher likelihood of removal. Thus, the smaller size of BK, TRPM4, and IP<sub>3</sub>R clusters following STIM1 knockout is likely a consequence of an increase in the rate of channel removal from the membrane. STIM1 knockout also caused a reduction in the SR volume as it retracts from the PM, suggesting that STIM1 is necessary for maintaining contact between the peripheral SR and PM. Accordingly, we propose that by maintaining a connection between the peripheral SR and PM, STIM1 increases the dwell time of BK, TRPM4, and IP<sub>3</sub>Rs proteins in the membrane, allowing larger clusters to form. This could be the result of direct protein-protein interactions. For example, previous studies have provided evidence of direct interactions between STIM1 and IP<sub>3</sub>Rs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Béliveau et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Sampieri et al., 2018</xref>), and our data show that STIM1 interacts with BK and TRPM4 at the nanoscale, potentially influencing cluster formation. However, our data show that the majority of BK and TRPM4 protein clusters do not colocalize with STIM1. It is more likely that the intact peripheral SR partially protects membrane proteins from endocytic and/or recycling cascades, allowing larger clusters to form before they are removed. Loss of the peripheral SR following STOM1 knockdown removes this defense, decreasing the dwell time of proteins in the PM, resulting in smaller clusters.</p><p>Knockout of <italic>Stim1</italic> in VSMCs significantly impacted Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling, ion channel activity, vascular contractility, and the regulation of BP. We purport that these outcomes result from nanoscale disruptions in cellular architecture. Ca<sup>2+</sup> sparks occur within microdomains formed by SR/PM junctional sites. An increase in the distance between the two membranes will enlarge the area of the microdomains. This likely explains the observed increase in the spatial spread of Ca<sup>2+</sup> sparks when STIM1 is knocked out. An enlargement of the microdomains also increases the distance between the source of the Ca<sup>2+</sup> spark and the SERCA and PMCA pumps and Na/Ca<sup>2+</sup> exchangers, which remove Ca<sup>2+</sup> from the cytosol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bautista and Lewis, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Blaustein and Lederer, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Shmigol et al., 1999</xref>), potentially contributing to prolonged decay and increased amplitude seen in cells from <italic>Stim1</italic>-smKO mice. Thus, the compromised structural integrity of subcellular Ca<sup>2+</sup>-signaling microdomains formed by interactions of the PM and SR likely accounts for the altered properties of Ca<sup>2+</sup> sparks associated with STIM1 knockout. Decreased nanoscale colocalization of BK with RyR2 and TRPM4 with IP<sub>3</sub>Rs manifested as diminished Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent activity of BK and TRPM4 channels (STOCs and TICCs), reflecting a loss in the functional coupling of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-release sites on the SR and ion channels on the PM. The smaller sizes of BK and TRPM4 protein clusters on the PM following <italic>Stim1</italic> knockdown may also reduce BK and TRPM4 channel currents. At the intact blood vessel level, the diminished TRPM4 and BK channel activity resulted in impaired contractility in response to physiological stimuli. This finding is interesting because our prior studies investigating the role of microtubular structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Pritchard et al., 2017</xref>) and JPH2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Pritchard et al., 2019</xref> in maintaining peripheral coupling in VSMCs showed that disruption of PM-SR interactions caused cerebral arteries to become hypercontractile. In these studies, arterial hypercontractility resulted from interruption of the BK-RyR2 signaling pathway, which hyperpolarizes the VSMC membrane and balances the depolarizing and contractile influences of the TRPM4-IP<sub>3</sub>R cascade. <italic>Stim1</italic> knockout, in contrast, affected both pathways, indicating that STIM1 influences peripheral coupling in a manner that differs from that of the microtubule network and JPH2 and further suggesting heterogeneity in the formation of junctional membrane complexes in VSMCs. Diminished arterial contractility following <italic>Stim1</italic> knockout resulted in a drop in arterial BP, probably due to decreased total peripheral resistance. This finding differs from previous reports by other groups showing that, although myogenic tone and phenylephrine-induced vasoconstriction were blunted in mesenteric arteries from a constitutive SMC-specific STIM1-knockout model, resting BP was not affected in this model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kassan et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kassan et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Pichavaram et al., 2018</xref>). This difference is likely due to elevated levels of circulating catecholamines, which increase HR and cardiac output and thereby compensate for diminished vascular resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Pichavaram et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>In summary, our data demonstrate a vital role for STIM1 in the maintenance of critical Ca<sup>2+</sup>-signaling microdomains in contractile VSMCs that is independent of SR Ca<sup>2+</sup> store depletion. Disruptions in cellular architecture at the nanoscale level associated with the loss of STIM1 resulted in arterial dysfunction and impaired BP regulation, highlighting the essential nature of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-signaling complexes formed by SR-PM interactions in cardiovascular control.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals</title><p>All animal studies were performed in accordance with guidelines of the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) of the University of Nevada, Reno.

After incubation, ER-Tracker Green was removed, and the PM stain Cell-Mask Deep Red (Thermo Fisher Scientific; diluted 1:1000 in Mg<sup>2+</sup>-PSS) was added, and cells were incubated for 5 min at 37°C. Cell-Mask Deep Red was then removed, and cells were washed with Mg<sup>2+</sup>-PSS and imaged using a lattice light-sheet microscope (LLSM; Intelligent Imaging Innovations, Inc, Denver, CO) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chen et al., 2014</xref>). Coverslips with stained cells were mounted onto a sample holder and placed in the LLSM bath, immersed in Mg<sup>2+</sup>-PSS. Imaging was performed in SR-SIM mode, set to 100 ms exposures. For each cell, 200 Z-steps were collected at a step size of 0.25 µm. Imaging was limited to no more than 30 min for each coverslip to prevent artifacts caused by internalization of the PM dye. Surface reconstruction and colocalization analyses of PM and SR were performed using Imaris v9.8 (Bitplane, Zurich, Switzerland) image analysis software. The Surface-Surface coloc plug-in was used to visualize areas of the PM and SR that colocalized to form coupling sites. PM-SR colocalization percentage was calculated by dividing the total PM-SR colocalization site volume by PM volume and multiplying by 100. Using fluorescent beads, we determined that for the SIM modality of the LLS the resolution for 642 nm wavelength (used for PM labeling) is 250–335 nm and the resolution for 488 nm wavelength (used for SR labeling) is 225–295 nm.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>GSDIM superresolution microscopy</title><p>GSDIM was performed as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Pritchard et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Thakore, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Pritchard et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Griffin et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Pritchard et al., 2018</xref>). For epifluorescence imaging, freshly isolated cerebral pial artery SMCs were allowed to adhere onto poly-L-lysine-coated glass coverslips for 30 min. For TIRF imaging, the coverslips were first cleaned by sonicating in 5 N NaOH for 45 min and then sonicated for another 45 min in deionized water before adding freshly isolated cerebral pial artery SMCs. The cells were then fixed for 20 min with 2% paraformaldehyde, quenched with 0.4 mg/mL NaBH<sub>4</sub>, and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100. Cells were then blocked with 50% SEABLOCK blocking buffer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) for 2 hr and incubated overnight at 4°C with primary antibody (anti-STIM1- [4916], Cell Signaling Technologies, Danvers, MA; anti-STIM1 [610954], BD Biosciences, Franklin Lakes, NJ; anti-BKα1- [APC-021], Alomone Labs, Jerusalem, Israel; anti-RyR2- [MA3-916], Thermo Fisher Scientific; anti-TRPM4- (ABIN572220); <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://antibodies-online.com">https://antibodies-online.com</ext-link>, Limerick, PA; anti-IP<sub>3</sub>R- (ab5804), Abcam, Cambridge, UK) diluted in PBS containing 20% SEABLOCK, 1% BSA, and 0.05% Triton X-100. Cells were washed three times with 1× PBS after each step. After overnight incubation, unbound primary antibody was removed by washing four times with 20% SEABLOCK, after which cells were incubated with secondary antibodies (Alexa Fluor 647- or Alexa Fluor 568-conjugated goat anti-rabbit, goat anti-mouse, donkey anti-goat, or donkey anti-rabbit as appropriate) at room temperature for 2 hr in the dark. After washing with 1× PBS, coverslip-plated cells were mounted onto glass depression slides in a thiol-based photo-switching imaging buffer consisting of 50 mM Tris/10 mM NaCl (pH 8), 10% glucose, 10 mM mercaptoethylamine, 0.48 mg/mL glucose oxidase, and 58 μg/mL catalase. Coverslips were sealed to depression slides with Twinsil dental glue (Picodent, Wipperfurth, Germany) to exclude oxygen and prevent rapid oxidation of the imaging buffer. Superresolution images were acquired in epifluorescence or TIRF mode using a GSDIM imaging system (Leica, Wetzlar, Germany) equipped with an oil-immersion 160× HCX Plan-Apochromat (NA 1.47) objective, an electron-multiplying charge-coupled device camera (EMCCD; iXon3 897; Andor Technology, Belfast, UK), and 500 mW, 532- and 642 nm laser lines. Localization maps were constructed from images acquired at 100 Hz for 25,000 frames using Leica LAX software. Post-acquisition image analyses of cluster size distribution were performed using binary masks of images in NIH ImageJ software. OBA was used to establish colocalization of proteins of interest in superresolution localization maps.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Object-based colocalization analysis</title><p>OBA was used to establish the colocalization of BK channels with RyR2 and TRPM4 channels with IP<sub>3</sub>R in superresolution localization maps. We used NIH ImageJ software with the JACoP colocalization analysis plug-in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bolte and Cordelières, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lachmanovich et al., 2003</xref>). The JACoP plug-in was used to split the two channels representing fluorophores detected by Alexa Fluor 568 or Alexa Fluor 647. Contiguous objects in both channels were identified by systematically inspecting the neighboring eight pixels (in 2D) of a reference pixel. All adjacent pixels with intensities above a user-defined threshold limit were considered part of the same structure as the reference pixel and were segmented as individual objects. The superresolution localization maps were previously thresholded by the detection algorithm incorporated into the LAX software used for image acquisition. Therefore, the threshold level in JACoP was set to 1 (nearly the minimum) for all images. After thresholding, centroids (defined as the single-pixel geometric centers of the specified objects) were determined for each object. Clusters in the other wavelength within 20 nm (resolution limit of our GSDIM system) of the centroid were considered ‘colocalized.’ The percentage of colocalizing clusters was calculated as the number of colocalizing clusters as a percentage divided by the total number of clusters detected. This method of colocalization analysis can overcome artifacts caused due to uneven fluorescence intensities and is appropriate to use when the analyzed objects in question are small and punctate like the protein clusters in our images (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lachmanovich et al., 2003</xref>). For comparison, new maps were generated from each original superresolution map using JACoP that replicated the density and cluster size distribution, but the location of each protein cluster was assigned to a random site. We then performed OBA for the simulated random distribution and compared the colocalization frequency of the original maps with the colocalization frequency of their randomized counterparts.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Patch-clamp electrophysiology</title><p>Freshly isolated cerebral artery SMCs were transferred to the recording chamber and allowed to adhere to glass coverslips at room temperature for 20 min. Recording electrodes (3–4 MΩ) were pulled on a model P-87 micropipette puller (Sutter Instruments, Novado, CA) and polished using a MF-830 MicroForge (Narishige Scientific Instruments Laboratories, Long Island, NY). STOCs and TICCs were recorded in Ca<sup>2+</sup>-containing PSS (134 mM NaCl, 6 mM KCl, 1 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 2 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 10 mM HEPES, and 10 mM glucose; pH 7.4, adjusted with NaOH). The patch pipette solution contained 110 mM K-aspartate, 1 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 30 mM KCl, 10 mM NaCl, 10 mM HEPES, and 5 μM EGTA (pH 7.2, adjusted with NaOH). Amphotericin B (200 µM), prepared on the day of the experiment, was included in the pipette solution to perforate the membrane. Currents were recorded using an Axopatch 200B amplifier equipped with an Axon CV 203BU headstage (Molecular Devices) for all experiments. Currents were filtered at 1 kHz, digitized at 40 kHz, and stored for subsequent analysis. Clampex and Clampfit (version 10.2; Molecular Devices) were used for data acquisition and analysis, respectively. For STOCs, cells were clamped at a membrane potential manually spanning a range from –60 mV to 0 mV. STOCs were defined as events &gt;10 pA, and their frequency was calculated by dividing the number of events by the time between the first and last event. The potential contribution of Orai1 channels to STOCs was assessed by applying Synta66 (10 µM) to the bath solution, while STOCs were recorded at a physiological membrane potential (–40 mV). Whole-cell K<sup>+</sup> currents were recorded using a step protocol (−100 to +100 mV in 20 mV steps for 500 ms) from a holding potential of −80 mV. Whole-cell BK currents were calculated by current subtraction following administration of the selective BK channel blocker paxilline (1 μM). Current-voltage (I–V) plots were generated using currents averaged over the last 50 ms of each voltage step. The bathing solution contained 134 mM NaCl, 6 mM KCl, 10 mM HEPES, 10 mM glucose, 2 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, and 1 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>; pH 7.4 (NaOH).

The contribution of Orai1 channels to TICCs activity was assessed by applying Synta66 (10 µM) in the bath solution after activating TICCs through membrane stretch. Conventional whole-cell TRPM4 currents were recorded using ramp protocol consisting of a 400 ms increasing ramp from –100 to +100 mV ending with 300 ms step at +100 mV from a holding potential of –60 mV. A new ramp was applied every 2 s. TRPM4 whole-cell currents were recorded in a bath solution consisting of (in mM) 156 NaCl, 1.5 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 10 glucose, 10 HEPES, and 10 TEA-Cl; pH 7.4 (NaOH).

Each artery was then cannulated and mounted in an arteriography chamber and superfused with oxygenated (21% O<sub>2</sub>/6% CO<sub>2</sub>/73% N<sub>2</sub>) Ca<sup>2+</sup>-PSS (119 mM NaCl<sub>2</sub>, 4.7 mM KCl, 21 mM NaCO<sub>3</sub>, 1.18 mM KH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 1.17 mM MgSO<sub>4</sub>, 0.026 mM EDTA, 1.8 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, and 4 mM glucose) at 37°C and allowed to stabilize for 15 min. Each artery was then pressurized to 110 mmHg using a pressure servo controller (Living Systems Instruments, St. Albans City, VT). Any kinks or bends were gently straightened out, the pressure was reduced to 5 mmHg, and the artery was allowed to stabilize for 15 min. The viability of each artery was assessed by measuring the response to high extracellular [K<sup>+</sup>] PSS (made isotonic by adjusting the [NaCl], 60 mM KCl, 63.7 mM NaCl). Arteries that contracted less than 10% were excluded from further investigation.</p><p>Myogenic tone was assessed by raising the intraluminal pressure from 5 mmHg to 140 mmHg in 20 mmHg increments, with the artery maintained at each pressure increment for 5 min (active response). The artery was then superfused for 15 min at 5 mmHg intraluminal pressure with Ca<sup>2+</sup>-free PSS supplemented with EGTA (2 mM) and the voltage-dependent Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel blocker diltiazem (10 μM), followed by application of pressure increments from 5 mmHg to 140 mmHg (passive response). The artery lumen diameter was recorded using edge-detection software (IonOptix, Westwood, MA). Myogenic reactivity at each intraluminal pressure was calculated as [1 – (Active diameter/Passive Diameter)] × 100. The contribution of Orai1 channels to myogenic tone was assessed by treating vessels with Synta66 (10 µM) in the superfusing bath. The effects of BK and TRPM4 channel inhibition on myogenic tone were assessed in vessels pressurized to 60 mmHg. Tone was allowed to develop before administering paxilline (1 µM) in the superfusing bath to inhibit BK channels or 9-phenanthrol (30 µM) to inhibit TRPM4 channels.</p><p>In separate arteries, the contractile response to the thromboxane A<sub>2</sub> receptor agonist U46619 and α<sub>1</sub>-adrenergic receptor agonist phenylephrine was assessed in cerebral and mesenteric arteries, respectively. Arteries were pressurized to 20 mmHg to prevent the development of myogenic tone. Cumulative concentration-response curves were produced by adding U46619 (0.01–1000 nM) or phenylephrine (0.001–100 µM) to the superfusing bath solution. Arteries were maintained at each concentration for 5 min or until a steady-state diameter was reached before adding the next concentration. Following the addition of the final concentration, arteries were bathed in Ca<sup>2+</sup>-free PSS to obtain the passive diameter.

Contractility of Vascular Smooth Muscle Cells&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Kenton Swartz as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>All three reviewers expressed considerable interest in the work. However, they identified important essential revisions that will be needed to support the main conclusions. These revisions could be addressed via a combination of a moderate number of new experiments and text changes:</p><p>1. Where is STIM1 clustered relative to other channels? Are the channel clusters measured located at SR-PM junctions. And how does the channel cluster intensity of affected by the STIM1 KO? This very important question can be addressed using imaging approaches already employed in the study.</p><p>2. Examine STOCs and TICCs and vasoconstriction using pharmacological tools for BK, TRPM4, Ry2R2 and/or IP3Rs to determine if reduced vasoconstriction in STIM1 knockout arteries is due to modified activity of the same ion channels identified by patch-clamp. This will help link the myography data to the observed changes in channel clusters.</p><p>3. How are changes in spark properties linked to alterations in STOCs and TICCs? This is more ambitious but can be addressed by localizing and the quantifying the abundance of CaV, SERCA, PMCA, NCX and by monitoring sparks evoked by depolarization. This would help connect changes in spark generation to the altered currents that are observed.</p><p>4. Is the role of STIM1 really independent of Orai and SOCE? Test for effects of CRAC channel blockers (BTP2, CM4620) on sparks, STOCs, TICCs, muscle tone in vitro. Also examine if the localization of STIM1 changes with store depletion.</p><p>In addition, there are a numbers of text revisions and clarifications which should be addressed, as described below in the individual reviewer comments.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>Krishnan and colleagues investigate the role of STIM1 in regulating several aspects of differentiated smooth muscle cell (SMC) function and cell biology relating to the SR-PM junctions and the role of SR-mediated calcium and contractile events. Using isolated smooth muscle cells from the cerebral arteries of control and STIM1 sm-KO mice, the study finds that several key aspects of the anatomy of the plasma membrane-SR contact sites are altered with functional consequences. STIM1 KO SMCs have decreased density and area of PM-SR contact sites, and co-localization of BK channels-RyR2 clusters, TRPM4-IP3R1 protein clusters, and diminished Ca<sup>2+</sup> spark and STOCs. These defects are manifested in impaired vasoconstriction when challenged with the agonist, U46619, especially following a train of stimulation pulses. The findings on first glance seem to be consistent with a model wherein STIM1 does not necessarily regulate the beat-to-beat contraction of smooth muscle, but instead its role is more apparent in responses to a train of stimulation pulses that requires refilling of ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> stores and which could be impaired in the absence of STIM1.</p><p>Strengths of the manuscript:</p><p>The manuscript makes several novel and physiologically relevant observations: the number and size of SR/PM coupling sites is significantly reduced in VSMCs from Stim1-smKO mice, loss of STIM1 alters the microarchitecture of ion channels contained within Ca<sup>2+</sup>-signaling complexes including BK-RyR2 and TRPM4-IP3R complexes, and these changes together alter the properties of Ca<sup>2+</sup> sparks and reduce BK and TRPM4 channel activity under physiological recording conditions. Consistent with these changes in cell physiology, measurements of contractility reveal that the smooth muscle lacking STIM1 shows impaired contractility and low blood pressure. All together, these are interesting, novel, and physiologically relevant results with potential clinical relevance.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>The main weakness of the study relates to two conclusions that don't seem to be supported by any compelling data in the study: (i) that STIM1 functions independently of SR Ca<sup>2+</sup> stores, and (ii) that STIM1 is constitutively active. The authors use these contentions to advance the idea that STIM1 regulates smooth muscle physiology via a mechanism distinct from its role in regulating the well-established SOCE, but this conclusion is needlessly speculative.</p><p>– It is really unclear why the authors conclude that the function of STIM1 is independent of its role in regulating SOCE and, moreover, is independent of the SR calcium concentration. These parameters were not measured directly in the present study. In order to support this claim, the study should directly measure the ER Ca to determine whether or not stores are not constitutively depleted. Otherwise, this speculation should be removed.</p><p>– The finding that store release is comparable between STIM1-smKO and WT SMCs in response to a single challenge of caffeine (Figure 5I) is insufficient evidence that stores are unaffected by ablating STIM1 expression. What happens to SR calcium stores under conditions of more physiological, repetitive stimulation, for example during a pulse train with caffeine or even U46619? The role of STIM1 may not be apparent following stimulation with a single stimulus, but may become more apparent with challenged with a repetitive pulses that may activate SOCE in order to sustain smooth muscle function during pulsatile contractions.</p><p>– The authors put forth the concept that STIM1 is STIM1 is constitutively active. This concept needs further testing, for example by assessing whether STIM1 localization changes following direct store depletion.</p><p>Comments for the authors:</p><p>1) Examine SOCE in the STIM1 KO cells generated within the study. This is a simple and essential control necessary to assess SOCE levels in differentiated SMCs, and if detected, confirm that the STIM1 KO mice generated in the current study lose SOCE.</p><p>2) Assess SR calcium levels in response to repetitive challenges with a GPCR agonist that will causes repetitive SR Ca<sup>2+</sup> release mimicking Ca<sup>2+</sup> release events during pulsatile arterial smooth muscle contractions. Is SR Ca<sup>2+</sup> store content maintained in the STIM1 KO SMCs under these conditions?</p><p>3) Assess the stability of STIM1 clusters in resting and store depleted (thapsigargin) treated cells to determine if STIM1 localization is altered by store depletion as seen in non-excitable cells. The relationship of the STIM1 clusters shown in Figure 1 should also be compared to BK and RyR2 clusters found in Figure 2.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>Fully differentiated, contractile smooth muscle cells express STIM1, but exhibit only minimal store-operated calcium entry (SOCE), a process that is known to be activated by STIM1. The authors aim to identify physiological functions of STIM1 that are independent of SOCE has been achieved in this manuscript.</p><p>The Methods used are broad, integrated and include innovative approaches, such as super-resolution microscopy and inducible, conditional knockout mice. The authors have achieved their aim and the conclusions are, in general, supported by the results. This manuscript will have an impact in the field and should stimulate new research in the fields of calcium signaling and vascular biology.</p><p>1. The terminology used for the mice should be modified. According to the text on page 5, &quot;SMC-specific Stim1-knockout (Stim1-smKO) mice&quot; are mice that have not yet received tamoxifen. Mice that have not yet received tamoxifen are Cre-positive Stim1fl/fl mice, not Stim1 knockouts. The same paragraph also denotes Stim1-smKO mice injected with sunflower oil as controls. These mice should not be referred to as Stim1-smKO mice as the Stim1 gene would not have been modified by sunflower oil.</p><p>2. Mice used for experimentation are young, at between 6 and 8 weeks of age. What is the reason juvenile mice were used for this study, rather than adults?</p><p>3. Figure 1A and Supplementary Figure 1. The mean data show that residual STIM1 is present in tissues of the tamoxifen-injected Cre-positive mice, but no bands can be seen on the Western blots. Can the images be improved so that protein bands can be seen in all knockout lanes? The STIM1 blot from brain looks different in the control and STIM1 knockout and may not be representative. The legend for Supplementary Figure 1A indicates that the corresponding Western blots are total protein. What probe or marker was used to label all proteins? The Methods do not appear to provide this information. Please add a molecular weight marker on Figure 1A. Maybe I am missing something, but it is not clear how STIM1 protein can be between 0.1 and 0.9 of total protein if data are normalized to total protein on a scale of 0 to 1.0. This suggests that STIM1 is up to 90 % of total protein and in some cases, individual data points are more than 1.0 of total protein.</p><p>4. How does the size of the fluorescent clusters in the Stim1-smKO cells compare to those in the control cells? Are they similar or different?</p><p>5. It would be useful to state what percentage of BK clusters overlap with RyR2 clusters and vice versa in control and Stim1-smKO cells. The same question applies to IP3R and TRPM4 clusters. Please provide these data.</p><p>6. If epifluorescence was used to measure cluster colocalization, how do you know if two proteins are colocalized at, or nearby, the surface? Could both proteins be located intracellularly? Please include a discussion of why you think the density of RyR2 clusters and the size of BK, TRPM4 and IP3R clusters are lower, whereas the size of RyR2 clusters is larger in the Stim1-smKO cells. Why would a change in the distance between the SR and plasma membranes in response to STIM1 knockout alter cluster properties in this manner?</p><p>7. In Figure 2, why was volume used to calculate PM and SR membranes, rather than surface area? How were PM and SR volumes calculated? What criteria were used to establish that the plasma and SR membranes colocalized? Why are the colocalization sites spherical? Wouldn't you expect that the close apposition of two membranes appear as sheets?</p><p>8. It is unusual that the mean amplitude of calcium sparks, when expressed as F/F0, is less than 1 (Figure 5D). If F0 is 1, calcium spark amplitudes should be higher than 1. Figure 5 would benefit from traces showing individual or average traces of calcium sparks that illustrate the amplitude and kinetic differences described in control and Stim1-smKO cells.</p><p>9. The authors (page 13) state that the effect of STIM1 knockout on BK and TRPM4 channel activity would produce opposing effects on arterial contractility. Myography is performed to address this question, leading to the observation that STIM1 knockout attenuates vasoconstriction. However, no link to altered BK and TRPM4 channel activity is investigated, which would close the loop introduced by the authors here. For example, experiments could be performed to examine if reduced vasoconstriction in STIM1 knockout arteries is due to attenuated IP3R and TRPM4 activity.</p><p>10. What is the resolution of the lightsheet imaging system used for the PM-SR colocalization experiments?</p><p>11. Please provide references where it was shown that SERCA, the PMCA and Na+/Ca<sup>2+</sup> exchangers alter Ca<sup>2+</sup> spark spread and decay in smooth muscle cells as you write in the Discussion on page 18.</p><p>12. Effects of STIM1 knockout are studied, but the cellular location and mechanism of STIM1 in control smooth muscle cells is not shown. The authors could provide evidence, or at least discuss in more detail, where STIM1 is located and how they consider STIM1 maintains close spatial proximity of the plasma and sarcoplasmic reticulum membranes. Is STIM1 located where the two membranes are closely opposed? Is STIM1 nearby RyR, IP3R, BK or TRPM4 channels? Does STIM bind to another PM-located protein? Could that be L-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels, TRP channels or other proteins previously shown to be regulated by STIM1?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>In this paper, Krishnan et al. examine the functional effects of a targeted knock out of STIM1 in vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs). Unlike most cells, differentiated VSMCs express very little store-operated calcium entry (SOCE), but the authors demonstrate that knocking out STIM1, the ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensor for SOCE, has a significant impact on the generation of Ca<sup>2+</sup> sparks and local BK and TRPM4 channel activation, leading to a loss of myogenic tone and hypotension in intact animals. These results are ascribed to a reduction in the number and size of sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR)- plasma membrane (PM) junctions rather than a loss of SOCE. Thus, this study reveals important functions of STIM1 in VSMCs that may be independent of coupling to Orai1 and activation of SOCE. These results add to a growing list of STIM1 functions beyond SOCE that includes regulation of voltage-gated Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels, Ca<sup>2+</sup> ATPases, and adenylate cyclase.</p><p>On the whole, the experiments were very carefully done and well presented, and the results are clear and convincing. The breadth of the study is also impressive, ranging from super-resolution imaging of junctions, channel localization and co-clustering in single VSMCs, to single-cell measurements of Ca<sup>2+</sup> sparks and the transient currents they produce, to measurements of the myogenic response in isolated cerebral and mesenteric arteries, and culminating in hypotension in intact animals. The effects on transient currents through BK (STOCs) and TRPM4 channels (TICCs) could explain the effects on myogenic tone and blood pressure, in line with the current understanding of how local coupling between RyR2 and BK channels, and IP3R and TRPM4 channels control VSMC contractile behavior. These results will be of interest to researchers studying calcium signaling mechanisms and cardiovascular physiology.</p><p>The main uncertainty in the paper is mechanistically how knockout of STIM1 causes the observed effects on SR-PM junctions, Ca<sup>2+</sup> sparks and local activation of BK and TRPM4 channels leading to reduced myogenic response and hypotension. Does STIM1 play a direct role in forming junctions, e.g., through binding of its polybasic domain to negatively charged phospholipids in the PM, or a supporting role where STIM1 binds to microtubules that extend SR tubules towards the PM? It is also unclear whether the observed reduction of coupling sites can explain the altered Ca<sup>2+</sup> spark characteristics and downstream effects on STOCs and TICCs as proposed by the authors. Changes in channel clustering after STIM1 knockout were not entirely consistent with changes in coupling site density, and it is also possible that STIM1 helps channels to accumulate at junctions. Finally, the possibility that STIM1 may signal through activation of Orai1 and SOCE should be considered. Although differentiated VSMCs express very little STIM1 and Orai1, this study demonstrates that the amount of STIM1 is nevertheless functionally important, and local activation of Orai1 may be able to influence SR Ca<sup>2+</sup> content or BK or TRPM4 channel activity.</p><p>Comments for the authors:</p><p>1. The title of the paper states &quot;Peripheral Coupling Sites Formed by STIM1 Govern the Contractility of Vascular Smooth Muscle Cells,&quot; but there is no evidence that STIM1 actually forms the sites. How is STIM1 involved? Does STIM1 play a direct role; e.g., a tethering function due to interaction of its polybasic domain with PIP2 in the PM or by promoting SR extension towards the PM by binding to EB1 on the tips of microtubules? Or is it indirect – perhaps reducing the overall amount of SR (Figure 2) reduces the density of SR-PM contacts as a simple mass-action effect. In the absence of any experimental evidence for a direct role, the title and conclusions should be toned down, and these possibilities should be discussed.</p><p>2. The effects of STIM1 KO on spark characteristics, BK and TRPM4 activation (STOCs and TICCs), myogenic tone, and blood pressure are clear and convincing. The major question is, how does the loss of STIM1 lead to these effects? The authors propose that the effects arise from a loss of peripheral coupling sites, but the data are not entirely consistent on this point. For example, changes in junction number and size do not always go hand in hand with channel cluster numbers and size. Despite significant reduction of SR-PM coupling site density (Figure 2), there is no change in BK, TRPM4, or IP3R cluster density (Figure 3B, 4B, 4C). Similarly, there is no change in RyR2 cluster size (Figure 3C) even though junctions are smaller. These results do not fit neatly with the idea that changes in junction density and size are responsible for the functional effects on VSMC contractility.</p><p>3. STIM1 KO significantly alters spark characteristics, but it is hard to imagine that the increased amplitude, duration, and decay time constant all result simply from a modest decline in the number and volume of SR-PM contacts. Why are they bigger and spread further after STIM1 KO? Also, are the altered spark characteristics consistent with STOC and TICC characteristics? One might expect a lengthening of STOC/TICC events given the increased duration of the sparks.</p><p>4. One possibility that should be considered is that some of the effects of STIM1 result from opening Orai1 channels at SR-PM junctions. A small amount of STIM1 and Orai1 were detected in VSMCs by Potier et al. (ref 37). Such activity might be detectable locally but not at a global level, yet could affect local SR Ca<sup>2+</sup> content or activity of BK or TRPM4 channels. This could be tested by measuring the effects of Orai1 inhibitors on constitutive Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx, sparks, and STOCs and TICCs.</p><p>5. Another possibility is that STIM1 influences the accumulation of channels at SR-PM junctions. Do clusters of STIM1 colocalize with clusters of BK and TRPM4? Does STIM1 KO affect the number of channels at junctions? This will contribute to the size of the local STOC and TICC signals.</p><p>6. It is unclear what proportion of the detected channel clusters are actually located at junctions. GSDIM was performed in epifluorescence mode, which implies that signals were collected throughout the cell thickness, not necessarily near the PM. Cluster densities for the channels differ: BK (15/µm<sup>2</sup>), RyR2 (4-6/µm<sup>2</sup>), TRPM4 (40/µm<sup>2</sup>), and IP3R clusters (30/µm<sup>2</sup>) and are much higher than the density of colocalized clusters (BK-RyR2 are 0.3/µm<sup>2</sup>, and IP3R-TRPM4 are 3/µm<sup>2</sup>). It seems likely that most of these clusters are actually not associated with junctions. If the clusters are not at junctions, then the quantification of cluster density cannot be related to the frequency of STOCs or TICCs.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Peripheral Coupling Sites Formed by STIM1 Govern the Contractility of Vascular Smooth Muscle Cells&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Kenton Swartz as the Senior Editor, and a Reviewing Editor.</p><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed, as outlined below:</p><p>(1) The manuscript does not actually show that STIM1 is present at the SR-PM junctions that are the focus of the paper. Rather, the data in Figure 2 only shows that there is an overall decrease in the number of SR-PM junctions in the STIM1 KO. In the absence of direct proof that STIM1 is located at the junctions, the idea that STIM1 drives the formation of the SR-PM contacts is speculative. Therefore, the title and the discussion of the paper should reflect this point as indicated by reviewers 1 and 3.</p><p>(2) This point was previously raised. The fraction of BK (and TRPM4 channels) that are actually co-localized with STIM1 is really quite small to begin with. This is readily apparent in the co-localization images of Figure 5 – most BK and TRPM4 channels don't cluster with STIM1. Authors must explain explicitly the relationship between channel clusters and coupling sites in the text. See also comments by reviewers 1 and 3 on this issue.</p><p>(3) Figure 2 clearly shows that the volume of the SR is strongly diminished in the STIM1 KO. It seems natural to expect then that as the volume of the SR declines and it pulls away from the membrane, SR-PM contacts will also go down. This issue was raised in the previous review. Does this decrease in SR volume alone not account for the observed decline in SR-PM contacts? This question needs to be explicitly addressed in the manuscript with a well-rounded discussion of what the data actually show.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>Reviewers have addressed my previous comments well and the paper is much improved.</p><p>I do have two further points that would need addressing:</p><p>– First, nowhere in the paper is there data showing that STIM1 is actually present at the peripheral ER-PM sites. I agree that the data showing that STIM1 KO decreases interactions between the PM and SR are in VSMCs is strong and convincing. But the paper strongly implies that STIM1 forms (&quot;fosters&quot;) these contacts. Can the authors show that STIM1 labelling is present at the SR-PM contact sites? In the absence of this data, the conclusion that STIM1 is crucial for &quot;fostering SR-PM coupling&quot; is indirect and in the worst case, could be entirely incidental.</p><p>– Figure 5: The co-localization of STIM1 with BK (and TRPM4) is actually pretty hard to see and less than compelling. Arrows should be used on the BK and TRPM4 panels to precisely denote which BK clusters are co-localized with which STIM1 clusters. I also don't understand the statements indicating that &quot;BK and TRPM4 colocalize with STIM1 more frequently than would be predicted if the proteins are randomly distributed&quot;. How was the random distribution modelled? How many channels? What is the area of the membrane? How was cluster formation modelled/induced in the random distribution model? With sufficient numbers of BK and STIM1 proteins, one would expect that random distribution may even cause co-localization of the observed numbers of BK and STIM1 proteins. These important details that are crucial to understanding whether co-localization is mechanistically driven are missing.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>The manuscript has been significantly improved.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>The authors have done a good job of addressing the comments and the manuscript has been improved. There are only a few remaining concerns that I would like the authors to address.</p><p>1. As for the question of whether channel clusters are present at SR-PM junctions, the authors should explain more clearly in the text what fraction of the clusters are likely to reside at these sites. See my comment on point #2, below.</p><p>4. Good – looks like there really isn't any contribution from SOCE. In Figure 1—figure supplement 3E, please state how the comparative SOCE response was measured – peak 340/380 ratio, or the slopes from the data in D?</p><p>My review:</p><p>1. My comment on the title did not dispute the effect of STIM1 KO on the number of peripheral coupling sites. The problem is that the wording suggests that STIM1 plays a direct role in forming these sites, and that is still to my knowledge an unanswered question in the field. Elsewhere in the paper the authors state that STIM1 maintains coupling, or is important for stable coupling, which is accurate. However, the title implies STIM1 acts in the formation of junctions, and without more mechanistic studies this is still an open question. I would suggest rewording the title to make it more accurate – perhaps referring to these sites as STIM1-dependent rather than STIM1-formed.</p><p>2. My comment relates to the lack of correspondence between channel clusters and coupling sites. As I stated, STIM1 KO greatly reduces coupling site density, but does not change BK, TRPM4 or IP3R cluster density. In addition, coupling sites are 0.17/µm2 in WT, but clusters are much more prevalent: 16/µm2 for BK, 40/µm2 for TRPM4, 32 for IP3R. This 100x difference indicates that many of the channel clusters are not associated with an identified coupling site, and probably for this reason the number is not grossly affected by loss of coupling sites. This conclusion is supported by the data of Figure 5, where only a small fraction of BK and TRPM4 channels colocalize with STIM1 puncta (indicating SR-PM junctions). It would be helpful to explain explicitly the relationship between channel clusters and coupling sites in the text. I may be missing something, but I do not understand how stochastic self-assembly in the rebuttal explains how loss of STIM1 affects cluster size. It is hard for me to imagine that given the very small fraction of channel clusters associated with SR-PM junctions (~5%) in WT cells, how the observed reduction in SR-PM coupling sites could lead to a measurable cell-wide decrease in the size of clusters as the authors suggest.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.70278.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>All three reviewers expressed considerable interest in the work. However, they identified important essential revisions that will be needed to support the main conclusions. These revisions could be addressed via a combination of a moderate number of new experiments and text changes:</p><p>1. Where is STIM1 clustered relative to other channels? Are the channel clusters measured located at SR-PM junctions. And how does the channel cluster intensity of affected by the STIM1 KO? This very important question can be addressed using imaging approaches already employed in the study.</p></disp-quote><p>We performed several new experiments to address this set of concerns. We utilized the TIRF modality of our GSDIM system to image STIM1 protein clusters in VSMCs. This method detects protein clusters at or near the plasma membrane, to a depth of ~ 150 nm. These data show that STIM1 protein clusters are present at the plasma membrane, and that these clusters were significantly reduced in size and density in VSMCs from <italic>Stim1-</italic>smKO mice (Figure 1—figure supplement 2). We also imaged VSMCs coimmunolabeled with BK and STIM1 or TRPM4 and STIM1 using TIRF-mode GSDIM, and analyzed the data using object-based analysis (OBA) (Figure 5). These data show that BK and TRPM4 colocalize with STIM1 more frequently than would be predicted if the proteins are randomly distributed, providing evidence that the channels form nanoscale complexes with STIM1 at or near the plasma membrane.</p><p>Our data also show that STIM1 knockout does not change the density of BK and TRPM4 channel clusters (Figures 3B and 4B). However, STIM1 knockout is associated with reduced size of BK and TRPM4 channel clusters (Figures 3B and 4B), suggesting that STIM1 may be involved with the formation of protein clusters on the plasma membrane. Stochastic self-assembly is a currently accepted model of protein cluster formation at the plasma membrane (1). Briefly, data from this paper show that protein clusters within the plasma membrane grow in size over time, and the probability of removal of protein clusters from the membrane also increases over time. The net result is an exponential distribution of protein cluster sizes, matching the findings reported by multiple laboratories. In this context, a reasonable interpretation of our data is that when STIM1 is present, the removal of BK and TRPM4 channel clusters from the membrane is slower, allowing them to grow to larger sizes. Knockout of STIM1 removes this protective effect and BK and TRPM4 channels are removed more quickly, at a smaller size. We envision that coupling between the SR and plasma membrane slows the removal of protein clusters from the membrane.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. Examine STOCs and TICCs and vasoconstriction using pharmacological tools for BK, TRPM4, Ry2R2 and/or IP3Rs to determine if reduced vasoconstriction in STIM1 knockout arteries is due to modified activity of the same ion channels identified by patch-clamp. This will help link the myography data to the observed changes in channel clusters.</p></disp-quote><p>We performed the suggested experiments and have added new data showing the effects of the BK channel inhibitor paxilline and the TRPM4 channel inhibitor 9-phenanthrol on vasoconstriction of cerebral arteries isolated from control and <italic>Stim1-</italic>smKO mice (Figure 8—figure supplement 1). As expected, we observed that myogenic tone increased in response to paxilline treatment in cerebral arteries isolated from control mice. Cerebral arteries from <italic>Stim1-</italic>smKO mice have little basal myogenic tone and showed only very slight increase in myogenic tone with paxilline treatment, indicating that these vessels have very little BK channel activity. As we have previously reported (2), 9-phenathrol treatment resulted in the loss of myogenic tone of cerebral arteries from control mice (Figure 8—figure supplement 1). Cerebral arteries from <italic>Stim1-</italic>smKO mice have very little basal tone and exhibited only a slight dilation in response to 9-phenathrol treatment, suggesting that these vessels have very little TRPM4 activity. Together, these data link the patch-clamp and pressure myography data.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. How are changes in spark properties linked to alterations in STOCs and TICCs ? This is more ambitious but can be addressed by localizing and the quantifying the abundance of CaV, SERCA, PMCA, NCX and by monitoring sparks evoked by depolarization. This would help connect changes in spark generation to the altered currents that are observed.</p></disp-quote><p>The experiments proposed by the reviewers to localize and quantify the abundance of CaV, SERCA, PMCA, NCX in control and STIM1 knockout mice are fascinating, but would require a massive effort over several months and greatly increase the length of this already robust manuscript. We plan to investigate these questions in a follow-up study.</p><p>The changes in Ca<sup>2+</sup> spark properties associated with STIM1 knockout are not the primary cause of the loss of STOC and TICC frequency. Our model indicates that STOC and TICC activity is diminished by the knockout of STIM1 because the functional coupling of BK and TRPM4 channels on the plasma membrane and RyR2s and IP<sub>3</sub>Rs on the SR is lost. Functional coupling is lost because peripheral coupling between the membranes is disrupted.</p><p>We propose that disruption of peripheral coupling between the SR and PM is also responsible for altering the properties of Ca<sup>2+</sup> sparks. Ca<sup>2+</sup> sparks are produced within microdomains that are formed by the close association of the SR and plasma membrane. Separation of the two membranes enlarges the area of these Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling microdomains, leading to the observed increase in spatial spread. Enlargement of the microdomains also increases the distance between the source of the Ca<sup>2+</sup> spark and the SERCA and PMCA pumps and Na/Ca<sup>2+</sup> exchangers which remove Ca<sup>2+</sup> from the cytosol (3-5), leading to prolonged decay and increased amplitude. We have attempted to clarify these concepts in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. Is the role of STIM1 really independent of Orai and SOCE?

Briefly, data from this paper show that protein clusters within the plasma membrane grow in size over time, and the probability of removal of protein clusters from the membrane also increases over time. The net result is an exponential distribution of protein cluster sizes, matching the findings reported by multiple laboratories. In this context, a reasonable interpretation of our data is that when STIM1 is present, the removal of BK and TRPM4 channel clusters from the membrane is slower, allowing them to grow to larger sizes. Knockout of STIM1 removes this protective effect and BK and TRPM4 channels are removed more quickly, at a smaller size. We envision that coupling between the SR and plasma membrane slows the removal of protein clusters from the membrane. As for IP<sub>3</sub>R and RyR2 clusters, very little is known about protein cluster formation in the SR membrane. We expect that a conceptual framework for this process will emerge in the near future.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7.

Co-localization was defined as areas where SR and PM voxels (i.e., pixels in 3D) exist in the same space at the resolution limit of our system. The lateral resolution limit for these experiments is on the order of 300 nm and the smallest volume of interaction that can be resolved under these conditions is approximately 300 x 300 x 300 nm or 0.027 μm<sup>3</sup>. We are not aware of any other study that has investigated the shape of SR/PM interactions in 3D throughout entire native SMCs cells at this level of resolution and we did not know what to expect. The data show that SR/PM colocalizing sites formed well-defined 3D structures that were either irregular ellipsoid or roughly spherical. We therefore reported the volume of these 3D structures. We agree that in 2D representations, the two membranes would appear as sheets (as is the case for TEM experiments) and interactions would properly be quantified as area rather than volume.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8.

The authors (page 13) state that the effect of STIM1 knockout on BK and TRPM4 channel activity would produce opposing effects on arterial contractility. Myography is performed to address this question, leading to the observation that STIM1 knockout attenuates vasoconstriction. However, no link to altered BK and TRPM4 channel activity is investigated, which would close the loop introduced by the authors here. For example, experiments could be performed to examine if reduced vasoconstriction in STIM1 knockout arteries is due to attenuated IP3R and TRPM4 activity.</p></disp-quote><p>To address the reviewer's question, we investigated the effect of pharmacological inhibitors of BK and TRPM4 on contractility of arteries isolated from <italic>Stim1</italic>-smKO mice.

Is STIM1 located where the two membranes are closely opposed? Is STIM1 nearby RyR, IP3R, BK or TRPM4 channels? Does STIM bind to another PM-located protein? Could that be L-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels, TRP channels or other proteins previously shown to be regulated by STIM1?</p></disp-quote><p>New data were added to the revised manuscript to address these questions. Using the TIRF modality of our GSDIM system, we detected STIM1 clusters at or near the cell membrane (penetration ~150 nm) in in VSMCs from control animals (Figure 1—figure supplement 2). We also used GSDIM-TIRF to show that STIM1 colocalizes with BK and TRPM4 protein clusters at or near the plasma membrane in cells from control mice (Figure 5). Previous studies have also shown that STIM1 interacts with RyR2 (15), IP<sub>3</sub>R (16) and directly with the plasma membrane via cholesterol binding domains (17). Thus, STIM1 likely interacts with multiple proteins found at peripheral coupling sites, and directly with the plasma membrane. Future studies will explore these mechanisms in detail.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:[…] Comments for the authors:</p><p>1. The title of the paper states &quot;Peripheral Coupling Sites Formed by STIM1 Govern the Contractility of Vascular Smooth Muscle Cells,&quot; but there is no evidence that STIM1 actually forms the sites. How is STIM1 involved? Does STIM1 play a direct role; e.g., a tethering function due to interaction of its polybasic domain with PIP2 in the PM or by promoting SR extension towards the PM by binding to EB1 on the tips of microtubules? Or is it indirect – perhaps reducing the overall amount of SR (Figure 2) reduces the density of SR-PM contacts as a simple mass-action effect. In the absence of any experimental evidence for a direct role, the title and conclusions should be toned down, and these possibilities should be discussed.</p></disp-quote><p>The canonical function of STIM1 is the formation of peripheral coupling sites during store depletion, and a wealth of evidence supports this concept. Our data clearly show that knocking out STIM1 in SMCs reduces the area of interactions between the SR and PM (Figure 2). We define such interactions as &quot;peripheral coupling sites&quot;. Therefore, our data show that STIM1 expression is needed to maintain normal levels of peripheral coupling in native contractile SMCs. Further, our data also show that knockout of STIM1 reduces the contractility of isolated cerebral arteries. In other words, our data show a direct link between STIM1 expression, peripheral coupling, and SMC contractility. Accordingly, while we agree with the reviewer that additional studies are required to determine exactly how STIM1 regulates these coupling sites, we contend that our title accurately describes the major findings and conclusions of the manuscript. The detailed biochemical and molecular dissection of STIM1 function suggested by the reviewer is a very exciting approach but is likely not feasible using native (non-cultured) VSMCs and would greatly expand the scope of the current study. We hope to pursue these questions in the future.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. The effects of STIM1 KO on spark characteristics, BK and TRPM4 activation (STOCs and TICCs), myogenic tone, and blood pressure are clear and convincing. The major question is, how does the loss of STIM1 lead to these effects? The authors propose that the effects arise from a loss of peripheral coupling sites, but the data are not entirely consistent on this point. For example, changes in junction number and size do not always go hand in hand with channel cluster numbers and size. Despite significant reduction of SR-PM coupling site density (Figure 2), there is no change in BK, TRPM4, or IP3R cluster density (Figure 3B, 4B, 4C). Similarly, there is no change in RyR2 cluster size (Figure 3C) even though junctions are smaller. These results do not fit neatly with the idea that changes in junction density and size are responsible for the functional effects on VSMC contractility.</p></disp-quote><p>Our data show that STIM1 knockout reduces the size of BK and TRPM4 protein cluster size at the plasma membrane.

STIM1 KO significantly alters spark characteristics, but it is hard to imagine that the increased amplitude, duration, and decay time constant all result simply from a modest decline in the number and volume of SR-PM contacts. Why are they bigger and spread further after STIM1 KO? Also, are the altered spark characteristics consistent with STOC and TICC characteristics? One might expect a lengthening of STOC/TICC events given the increased duration of the sparks.</p></disp-quote><p>Our interpretation of these data is that disruption of peripheral coupling between the SR and PM enlarges the area of Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling microdomains, leading to the observed increase in spatial spread. Enlargement of the microdomains increases the distance between source of the Ca<sup>2+</sup> spark and SERCA, PMCA, and Na<sup>+</sup>/Ca<sup>2+</sup> exchangers which remove Ca<sup>2+</sup> from the cytosol (3-5), leading to prolonged decay. We observed a reduction in STOC frequency as well as amplitude despite the increase in Ca<sup>2+</sup> spark amplitude, duration and decay time which further supports our idea that there is a loss of functional coupling between RyR2 and BK channels in the absence of STIM1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. One possibility that should be considered is that some of the effects of STIM1 result from opening Orai1 channels at SR-PM junctions. A small amount of STIM1 and Orai1 were detected in VSMCs by Potier et al. (ref 37). Such activity might be detectable locally but not at a global level, yet could affect local SR Ca<sup>2+</sup> content or activity of BK or TRPM4 channels. This could be tested by measuring the effects of Orai1 inhibitors on constitutive Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx, sparks, and STOCs and TICCs.</p></disp-quote><p>We investigated the effects of Synta66, a more selective and potent Orai1 inhibitor compared with BTP2, on STOCs and TICCs in VSMCs (Figure 7—figure supplements 1 and 2) and myogenic reactivity in isolated cerebral arteries (Figure 8—figure supplement 1). We did not observe any effect of Synta66 on STOCs, TICCs, or vasoconstriction, indicating that these are independent of Orai1 activity.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. Another possibility is that STIM1 influences the accumulation of channels at SR-PM junctions. Do clusters of STIM1 colocalize with clusters of BK and TRPM4? Does STIM1 KO affect the number of channels at junctions? This will contribute to the size of the local STOC and TICC signals.</p></disp-quote><p>Using the TIRF modality of our GSDIM system, we found that STIM1 colocalized with both BK and TRPM4 at or near the plasma membrane (Figures 5). We did not observe any differences in BK or TRPM4 channel density in VSMCs from <italic>Stim1-</italic>smKO mice compared to controls (Figures 3B and 4B). In addition, we found that STIM1 knockout did not alter whole-cell BK and TRPM4 current density (Figure 7E and I), providing evidence that STIM1 deficit does not alter the amount of channel protein available for activation at the plasma membrane. We also show that STIM1 knockout did not alter mRNA levels of BKα and β subunits (Figure 7—figure supplement 1) or TRPM4 (Figure 7—figure supplement 2).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. It is unclear what proportion of the detected channel clusters are actually located at junctions. GSDIM was performed in epifluorescence mode, which implies that signals were collected throughout the cell thickness, not necessarily near the PM. Cluster densities for the channels differ: BK (15/µm<sup>2</sup>), RyR2 (4-6/µm<sup>2</sup>), TRPM4 (40/µm<sup>2</sup>), and IP3R clusters (30/µm<sup>2</sup>) and are much higher than the density of colocalized clusters (BK-RyR2 are 0.3/µm<sup>2</sup>, and IP3R-TRPM4 are 3/µm<sup>2</sup>). It seems likely that most of these clusters are actually not associated with junctions. If the clusters are not at junctions, then the quantification of cluster density cannot be related to the frequency of STOCs or TICCs.</p></disp-quote><p>Our data show that knockout of STIM1 does not alter the density of BK or TRPM4 channel clusters (Figure 3B and 4B) and we make no strong claim that changes in cluster density affect STOC or TICC currents. Instead, we claim that STOC and TICC activity is impaired by knockout of STIM1 because the microdomains that encompass the Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals necessary for the activation of these channels are compromised. Our data (Figure 2) showing that interactions between the SR and PM are disrupted support this conclusion.</p><p>References:1.

It seems natural to expect then that as the volume of the SR declines and it pulls away from the membrane, SR-PM contacts will also go down. This issue was raised in the previous review. Does this decrease in SR volume alone not account for the observed decline in SR-PM contacts? This question needs to be explicitly addressed in the manuscript with a well-rounded discussion of what the data actually show.</p></disp-quote><p>We are in complete agreement – when STIM1 is knocked out in SMC, the SR volume is reduced because the peripheral SR retracts, diminishing SR-PM coupling. These data indicate that STIM1 is involved in maintaining contact between the peripheral SR and the PM necessary for membrane coupling. We explicitly discuss this issue in the revised manuscript.

I agree that the data showing that STIM1 KO decreases interactions between the PM and SR are in VSMCs is strong and convincing. But the paper strongly implies that STIM1 forms (&quot;fosters&quot;) these contacts. Can the authors show that STIM1 labelling is present at the SR-PM contact sites? In the absence of this data, the conclusion that STIM1 is crucial for &quot;fostering SR-PM coupling&quot; is indirect and in the worst case, could be entirely incidental.</p></disp-quote><p>The proposed experiment is a great idea.

Arrows should be used on the BK and TRPM4 panels to precisely denote which BK clusters are co-localized with which STIM1 clusters. I also don't understand the statements indicating that &quot;BK and TRPM4 colocalize with STIM1 more frequently than would be predicted if the proteins are randomly distributed&quot;. How was the random distribution modelled? How many channels? What is the area of the membrane? How was cluster formation modelled/induced in the random distribution model? With sufficient numbers of BK and STIM1 proteins, one would expect that random distribution may even cause co-localization of the observed numbers of BK and STIM1 proteins. These important details that are crucial to understanding whether co-localization is mechanistically driven are missing.</p></disp-quote><p>Arrows have been added to Figure 5 to show examples of colocalized clusters.

My comment on the title did not dispute the effect of STIM1 KO on the number of peripheral coupling sites. The problem is that the wording suggests that STIM1 plays a direct role in forming these sites, and that is still to my knowledge an unanswered question in the field. Elsewhere in the paper the authors state that STIM1 maintains coupling, or is important for stable coupling, which is accurate. However, the title implies STIM1 acts in the formation of junctions, and without more mechanistic studies this is still an open question. I would suggest rewording the title to make it more accurate – perhaps referring to these sites as STIM1-dependent rather than STIM1-formed.</p></disp-quote><p>We have modified the title as suggested.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. My comment relates to the lack of correspondence between channel clusters and coupling sites. As I stated, STIM1 KO greatly reduces coupling site density, but does not change BK, TRPM4 or IP3R cluster density. In addition, coupling sites are 0.17/µm2 in WT, but clusters are much more prevalent: 16/µm2 for BK, 40/µm2 for TRPM4, 32 for IP3R. This 100x difference indicates that many of the channel clusters are not associated with an identified coupling site, and probably for this reason the number is not grossly affected by loss of coupling sites. This conclusion is supported by the data of Figure 5, where only a small fraction of BK and TRPM4 channels colocalize with STIM1 puncta (indicating SR-PM junctions). It would be helpful to explain explicitly the relationship between channel clusters and coupling sites in the text. I may be missing something, but I do not understand how stochastic self-assembly in the rebuttal explains how loss of STIM1 affects cluster size. It is hard for me to imagine that given the very small fraction of channel clusters associated with SR-PM junctions (~5%) in WT cells, how the observed reduction in SR-PM coupling sites could lead to a measurable cell-wide decrease in the size of clusters as the authors suggest.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with your comment – our data indicate that channel clusters are uniformly distributed throughout the membrane and are not enriched at coupling sites. We explicitly discuss this in the revised manuscript (Line 442).</p><p>As for how the loss of STIM1 affects protein cluster size- superresolution imaging data from many laboratories demonstrates that all (or almost all) proteins form clusters in membrane with an exponential cluster size distribution. Stochastic self-assembly is a currently accepted theoretical model that accounts for this, and it is backed by rigorous experimental evidence. When asked by the reviewers to explain why we unexpectedly saw a reduction in protein cluster sizes in STIM1 knockout mice, we utilized this model to interpret our data. We agree that loss of coupling sites alone cannot explain the effects on channel clusters distributed throughout the membrane and not present in coupling sites. However, our data show that the entire peripheral SR is no longer associated with the PM following STIM1 knockout. Based on these observations, we put forth the concept that the peripheral SR prolongs the dwell time of channel proteins in the membrane, allowing them to grow to a larger size. STIM1 knockout detaches the peripheral SR from PM, removing its protection against recycling pathways. This effect decreases membrane dwell time and reduces cluster size. The revised manuscript explicitly discusses the potential impact of the peripheral SR in membrane protein cluster size regulation (Lines 462-483).</p></body></sub-article></article>
