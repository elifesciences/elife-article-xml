Histochemical-based approaches typically treat the claustrum as a relatively narrow anatomical region that primarily projects to the neocortex, whereas circuit-based approaches can suggest a broader claustrum region containing projections to the neocortex and other regions. Here, in the mouse, we took a bottom-up and cell-type-specific approach to complement and possibly unite these seemingly disparate conclusions. Using single-cell RNA-sequencing, we found that the claustrum comprises two excitatory neuron subtypes that are differentiable from the surrounding cortex. Multicolor retrograde tracing in conjunction with 12-channel multiplexed in situ hybridization revealed a core-shell spatial arrangement of these subtypes, as well as differential downstream targets. Thus, the claustrum comprises excitatory neuron subtypes with distinct molecular and projection properties, whose spatial patterns reflect the narrower and broader claustral extents debated in previous research. This subtype-specific heterogeneity likely shapes the functional complexity of the claustrum.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Claustrum</kwd><kwd>transcriptome</kwd><kwd>cell type</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000038</institution-id><institution>Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RGPIN-2019-04507</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cembrowski</surname><given-names>Mark S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000024</institution-id><institution>Canadian Institutes of Health Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PJT-419798</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cembrowski</surname><given-names>Mark S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001805</institution-id><institution>Canada Foundation for Innovation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>John R.

To determine the mechanistic contributions of the claustrum to these putative functions, it is essential to understand both the intrinsic organization of claustrum neurons, as well as how this organization relates to connectivity and function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Edelstein and Denaro, 2004</xref>). However, such an interpretation is challenged by the fact that even the precise anatomical boundaries of the claustrum are a matter of debate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dillingham et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Smith et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Here, utilizing a multimodal cell typing approach, we sought to understand the extent of heterogeneity within the excitatory claustrum neuron population and relate this to local boundaries and long-range projections. Beginning with single-cell RNA sequencing, we identified two discrete populations of excitatory claustral neurons. To map the topography of these populations, we used multiplexed single-molecule fluorescent in situ hybridization, revealing core and shell claustral neuron subtypes that were transcriptionally distinguishable relative to surrounding cortical neurons. Combining this with multicolor retrograde tracing, we revealed a spatial organization of distinct cortical-projecting claustral populations that mapped onto the identified core and shell subtypes. This work demonstrates that the claustrum consists of heterogeneous populations of excitatory neurons that are topographically organized and project to functionally dissociable cortical regions, suggesting subtype-specific functionality of excitatory claustral neurons. To facilitate future research analyzing claustral cell-type-specific structure and function, data and analysis tools from this study are available via our interactive web portal (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://scrnaseq.janelia.org/claustrum">http://scrnaseq.janelia.org/claustrum</ext-link>).</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>scRNA-seq reveals discrete excitatory neuron subtypes within the claustrum</title><p>We began by using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to understand the transcriptomic organization of the claustrum. From claustral microdissections from four mice, we manually harvested 1112 cells based on a combination of unbiased blind selection of cells and selection of specific labeled projections (to either the lateral entorhinal cortex [LEC] or retrosplenial cortex [RSC]; see Materials and methods). After library preparation, sequencing, and filtering, we retained a total of 1011 excitatory neurons for analysis (n = 478 cells blindly selected; n = 286 and 247 cells projecting to the LEC and RSC, respectively).</p><p>We initially examined this dataset agnostic to any projection-specific information. Combining UMAP nonlinear dimensionality reduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">McInnes et al., 2018</xref>) with Louvain graph-based clustering (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Stuart et al., 2019</xref>) revealed that cells broadly conformed to three transcriptomically separated clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; also seen in t-SNE: <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). These clusters were all associated with expression of excitatory neuronal markers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) and were found across the anterior-posterior axis and across animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B,C</xref>).

Relative to the deep insular cortex, our work here shows a general lack of deep cortical markers for two distinct neuron types, as well as enrichment of genes in these types that are not typically associated with deep cortex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplements 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">4</xref>). In conjunction with both of these neuron types showing enrichment of some claustrum marker genes relative to cortical neurons (e.g., <italic>Gnb4</italic>: <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), we interpret these transcriptomic cell types as claustrum core and shell neuron subtypes. Relative to the dorsal endopiriform cortex, our scRNA-seq and smFISH validation focused on the atlas-defined spatial extent of the claustrum; thus, future work targeting the dorsal endopiriform cortex will be needed to examine the transcriptomic relationship between these two regions.</p><p>Collectively, our results will allow subtype-specific claustral function to be assayed in future experiments by leveraging either marker genes or projection pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cembrowski, 2019</xref>).

To build the projection-specific dataset, for the remaining three mice, green and red retrobeads were respectively injected into the LEC and RSC, with this labeling used for gross microdissection as well as to select a subset of projection-specific cells for RNA-seq.</p><p>In all cases, manual purification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hempel et al., 2007</xref>) was used to capture cells in capillary needles in approximately 0.1–0.5 mL ACSF cocktail, placed into 8-well strips containing 3 µL of cell collection buffer (0.1% Triton X-100, 0.2 U/µL RNAse inhibitor; Lucigen, Middleton, WI), and generally processed according to published methodology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cembrowski et al., 2018b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Schretter et al., 2020</xref>). Specifically, each strip of cells was flash frozen on dry ice, then stored at –80°C until cDNA synthesis. Cells were lysed by adding 1 µL lysis mix (50 mM Tris pH 8.0, 5 mM EDTA pH 8.0, 10 mM DTT, 1% Tween-20, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1 g/L Proteinase K [Roche], 2.5 mM dNTPs [Takara], and ERCC Mix 1 [Thermo Fisher] diluted to 1e-6) and 1 µL 10 µM barcoded RT primer (E3V6NEXT primer from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Soumillon et al., 2014</xref>, modified to add a 1 bp spacer before the barcode, extending the barcode length from 6 bp to 8 bp, and designing the 384 barcodes to tolerate one mismatch error correction). The samples were incubated for 5 min at 50°C to lyse the cells, followed by 20 min at 80°C to inactivate the Proteinase K. Reverse transcription master mix (2 µL 5 X buffer; Thermo Fisher Scientific), 2 µL 5 M betaine (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO), 0.2 µL 50 µM E5V6NEXT template switch oligo (Integrated DNA Technologies, Coralville, IA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Soumillon et al., 2014</xref>), 0.1 µL 200 U/µL Maxima H- RT (Thermo Fisher Scientific), 0.1 µL 40 U/µL RNasin (Lucigen), and 0.6 µL nuclease-free water (Thermo Fisher Scientific) were added to the approximately 5.5 µL lysis reaction and incubated at 42°C for 1.5 hr, followed by 10 min at 75°C to inactivate reverse transcriptase. PCR was performed by adding 10 µL 2X HiFi PCR mix (Kapa Biosystems) and 0.5 µl 60 µM SINGV6 primer with the following conditions: 98°C for 3 min, 20 cycles of 98°C for 20 s, 64°C for 15 s, 72°C for 4 min, with a final extension step of 5 min at 72°C. Samples were pooled across the plate to yield approximately 2 mL pooled PCR reaction. From this, 500 µL was purified with 300 µL Ampure XP beads (0.6× ratio; Beckman Coulter, Brea, CA), washed twice with 75% ethanol, and eluted in 20 µL nuclease-free water. The cDNA concentration was determined using Qubit High-Sensitivity DNA kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific).</p><p>13 plates were analyzed in total, with 600 pg cDNA from each plate of cells used in a modified Nextera XT (Illumina, San Diego, CA) library preparation with 5 µM P5NEXTPT5 primer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Soumillon et al., 2014</xref>). The resulting libraries were purified according to the Nextera XT protocol (0.6× ratio) and quantified by qPCR using Kapa Library Quantification (Kapa Biosystems). Three plates were pooled on a NextSeq 550 mid-output flowcell with 26 bases in read 1, 8 bases for the i7 index, and 125 bases in read 2, and the remaining 10 plates were pooled on a NextSeq 550 high-output flowcell with 26 bases in read 1, 8 bases for the i7 index, and 50 bases for read 2. Alignment and count-based quantification of single-cell data was performed by removing adapters, tagging transcript reads to barcodes and UMIs, and aligned to the mouse genome via STAR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dobin et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>In total, 1112 cells were manually harvested and underwent sequencing. Of these initial 1112 cells, 27 putative non-neuronal cells were excluded due to low expression of <italic>Snap25</italic> (CPM &lt; 0.001) and 74 additional cells were excluded due to low <italic>Slc17a7</italic> (CPM &lt; 1e-10). The remaining 1011 cells exhibit 5.2 ± 1.1 thousand expressed genes/cell from 142 ± 98 thousand reads/cell, mean ± SD. The relatively high abundance of excitatory neurons sampled owed both to the targeted approach for harvesting circuit-labeled cells, as well as the fact that excitatory neurons are relatively abundant relative to interneurons in the claustrum. No blinding or randomization was used for the construction or analysis of this dataset. No a priori sample size was determined for the number of animals or cells to use; note that previous methods have indicated that several hundred cells from a single animal are sufficient to resolve heterogeneity within excitatory neuronal cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cembrowski et al., 2018b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cembrowski et al., 2018c</xref>).</p><p>Computational analysis was performed in R (RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:SCR_001905">SCR_001905;</ext-link> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">R Development Core Team, 2008</xref>) using a combination of Seurat v3 (RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:SCR_007322">SCR_007322;</ext-link> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Satija et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Stuart et al., 2019</xref>) and custom scripts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cembrowski et al., 2018b</xref>). To analyze our data, a Seurat object was created via <italic>CreateSeuratObject</italic>(min.cells = 3, min.features = 200), variable features identified via <italic>FindVariableFeatures(selection.method='vst',nfeatures = 2000</italic>) and scaled via <italic>ScaleData</italic>(). Data was processed via <italic>RunPCA</italic>(), <italic>JackStraw(num.replicate = 100), RunTSNE(), FindNeighbors(), FindClusters(resolution = 0.1),</italic> and <italic>RunUMAP(reduction='pca'),</italic> with 30 dimensions used throughout the analysis. This processed Seurat object was then used for downstream analysis. Subpopulation-specific enriched genes obeying p<italic><sub>ADJ</sub> &lt;</italic> 0.05 were obtained with Seurat via <italic>FindMarkers</italic>(), where <italic>p<sub>ADJ</sub></italic> is the adjusted p-value from Seurat based on Bonferroni correction. Functionally relevant differentially expressed genes were obtained using <italic>FindMarkers</italic>(), allowing for both cluster-specific enriched and depleted genes obeying p<italic><sub>ADJ</sub> &lt;</italic> 0.05, and manually identified for functional relevance. Raw and processed scRNA-seq datasets have been deposited in the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) Gene Expression Omnibus under GEO: GSE149495.</p><p>To integrate and compare our scRNA-seq data to previously published data, we downloaded data from two previous studies that broadly sampled cortical cells in the mouse brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Saunders et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Zeisel et al., 2018</xref>). From <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Saunders et al., 2018</xref>, we downloaded frontal cortex data from F_GRCm38.81.P60Cortex_noRep5_FRONTALonly.raw.dge.txt.gz (from <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://dropviz.org">http://dropviz.org</ext-link>) and used a threshold of 16,000 transcripts/cell to extract 2877 total cells. After screening against cells that lacked <italic>Snap25</italic> and/or <italic>Slc17a7</italic> expression, 2842 putative excitatory neurons were retained for analysis (genes expressed/cell: 4.8 ± 0.6 thousand, mean ± SD; transcripts/cell: 16.5 ± 5.0 thousand, mean ± SD). We used a similar number of cells from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Zeisel et al., 2018</xref>, obtained from l6_r4_telencephalon_projecting_excitatory_neurons.loom (from <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://mousebrain.org/loomfiles_level_L6.html">http://mousebrain.org/loomfiles_level_L6.html</ext-link>): 3151 cells were obtained using a threshold for 7500 transcripts/cell, with 3141 cells retained after requiring <italic>Snap25</italic> and <italic>Slc17a7</italic> expression (genes expressed/cell: 3.7 ± 0.4 thousand, mean ± SD; transcripts/cell: 9.6 ± 2.0 thousand, mean ± SD). Integration of these published datasets with our dataset was done in Seurat v3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Stuart et al., 2019</xref>) by creating a Seurat object incorporating all datasets, and then using <italic>SplitObject</italic>() to split according to original dataset, allowing each dataset to independently undergo normalization and variable feature selection (handled identically to our data). Integration anchors were subsequently identified (via <italic>FindIntegrationAnchors</italic>()) and used for integration (via <italic>IntegrateData</italic>()), using 30 dimensions. From here, integrated data underwent scaling, dimensionality reduction, and clustering identically to the method used for our data, with clustering resolution = 2.5 to facilitate comparison between fine clusters associated with the claustrum shell. Statistical significance for adjusted p-values is denoted as follows: ns: p<sub>≥</sub>0.05; *p&lt;0.05, **p&lt;0.01, ***p&lt;0.001.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>mFISH data acquisition and analysis</title><p>Custom probes for mFISH were purchased from Advanced Cell Diagnostics and were as follows: <italic>Cdh9</italic> (443221-T1), <italic>Ctgf</italic> (314541-T2), <italic>Slc17a6</italic> (319171-T3), <italic>Lxn</italic> (585801-T4), <italic>Slc30a3</italic> (496291-T5), <italic>Gfra1</italic> (431781-T6), <italic>Spon1</italic> (492671-T7), <italic>Gnb4</italic> (460951-T8), <italic>Nnat</italic> (432631-T9), <italic>Synpr</italic> (500961-T10), <italic>Pcp4</italic> (402311-T11), and <italic>Slc17a7</italic> (416631-T12). mFISH was generally performed as previously implemented (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Sullivan et al., 2020</xref>). Briefly, mature male mice were randomly selected for mFISH and were deeply anesthetized with isoflurane and perfused with phosphate buffered saline (PBS) followed by 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in PBS. Brains were dissected and post-fixed in 4% PFA for 2–4 hr. Brain sections (20 µm) were made using a cryostat tissue slicer and mounted on glass slides. Slides were subsequently stored at –80°C until use. For use, the tissue underwent pretreatment and antigen retrieval per the User Manual for Fixed Frozen Tissue (Advanced Cell Diagnostics). All 12 probes with unique tails (T1–T12) were hybridized to the tissue, amplified, and the tissue counterstained with DAPI. Using cleavable fluorophores with unique tails (T1–T12), probes were visualized four at a time via an iterative process of imaging, decoverslipping, fluorophore cleaving, and adding the next four targeted fluorophores. mFISH performed on tissue with viral tracing was first counterstained with DAPI, coverslipped with ProLongGold antifade mounting medium, then imaged. The tissue was decoverslipped by soaking in 4× SSC. Following this, standard mFISH protocol was followed, with the antigen retrieval step quenching all endogenous viral fluorescent protein signal and DAPI signal.</p><p>mFISH images were acquired with a 63× objective on a SP8 Leica white light laser confocal microscope (Leica Microsystems, Concord, Ontario, Canada). Z-stacks were acquired with a step size of 0.45 µm for each imaging round. Final composite images are pseudocolored maximum intensity projections, including brightness adjustments applied to individual channels uniformly across the entire image, with channels opaquely overlaying one another ordered from highest to lowest expression.</p><p>Processing of mFISH images generally followed our previously published analysis pipeline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Sullivan et al., 2020</xref>) using Fiji (RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:SCR_002285">SCR_002285;</ext-link> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Schindelin et al., 2012</xref>). Briefly, the DAPI signal from each round was used to rigidly register probe signals across rounds, followed by nonlinear elastic registration via bUnwarpJ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Arganda-Carreras et al., 2010</xref>) to accommodate any nonlinear tissue warping due to decoverslipping. The individual nuclei were then segmented and dilated by a factor of 5 µm to include the surrounding cytosol. The signal from each probe was then binarized by thresholding at the last 0.2–1% of the histogram tail, and then the number of pixels within regions of interest (ROIs) selected from segmentation was summed and normalized to the pixel area of the cell and multiplied by 100. This in effect corresponded to percent area covered (PAC) of the optical space of a cell.</p><p>A total of five mature male C57BL/6 mice, each with a relatively anterior, intermediate, and posterior section, were used for mFISH. Four mice had 200 nL retrograde viral injections into the RSC, two of which had additional retrograde viral injections into the LEC. For these injections, retrograde pAAV-CAG-GFP was a gift from Edward Boyden (Addgene viral prep # 37825-AAVrg; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://n2t.net/addgene">http://n2t.net/addgene</ext-link>:37825; RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:Addgene_37825">Addgene_37825</ext-link>) and retrograde pAAV-CAG-tdTomato (codon diversified) was a gift from Edward Boyden (Addgene viral prep # 59462-AAVrg; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://n2t.net/addgene">http://n2t.net/addgene</ext-link>:59462; RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:Addgene_59462">Addgene_59462</ext-link>). The last remaining mouse had no viral injections. Across these five animals, 33,155 cells in total were imaged. To facilitate analysis of excitatory neurons specifically, a threshold of one PAC of <italic>Slc17a7</italic> was required for each cell to be included in analysis, resulting in 18,957 total putative excitatory neurons being used for subsequent analysis. <italic>Slc17a7</italic> expression levels were used only for cellular phenotyping, and thus excluded from further analysis.</p><p>For analysis, UMAP dimensionality reduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">McInnes et al., 2018</xref>) was performed on within-cell normalized PAC values using the <italic>umap</italic> package (15 nearest neighbors, all other parameters default), and cells were clustered on a per-animal level using a Leiden community detection algorithm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Levine et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Traag et al., 2019</xref>) via the <italic>Monocle</italic> package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cao et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Qiu et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Trapnell et al., 2014</xref>). In general, setting the resolution parameter to a value that produced five clusters yielded strong agreement between UMAP dimensionality reduction and cluster assignments. Marker gene expression was used to assign phenotypes to cells comprising each cluster. For correlating projection targets with mFISH results, cells labeled with fluorescent retrograde tracers were manually identified (n = 739 total across n = 4 animals), done in a blinded fashion relative to mFISH analysis. A small minority of cells that projected to both the LEC and RSC (1.9%: n = 14/739, consistent with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Marriott et al., 2020</xref>) were excluded when comparing properties of LEC- vs. RSC-projecting neurons. In general, box plots show distribution of gene expression contingent on cluster identity or projection target (hinges denote first and third quartiles, whiskers denote remaining data points up to at most 1.5 * interquartile range, outlier values beyond whiskers are not shown). Mann–Whitney U tests with a Bonferroni correction were used to identify differentially expressed genes, for either a given cluster relative to all other clusters, or in pairwise comparisons, as shown. Statistical significance for adjusted p-values is denoted as follows: ns: p<sub>≥</sub>0.05; *p&lt;0.05, **p&lt;0.01, ***p&lt;0.001.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec id="s5" sec-type="additional-information"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>none</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf2"><p>None</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology, Validation, Writing - original draft, Software</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Investigation, Methodology, Software</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Methodology, Supervision, Resources</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Formal analysis</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Investigation, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Visualization, Supervision, Conceptualization</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con8"><p>Investigation, Methodology, Resources</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con9"><p>Funding acquisition, Formal analysis, Methodology, Visualization, Resources, Writing - original draft, Software</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con10"><p>Funding acquisition, Formal analysis, Writing – review and editing, Investigation, Methodology, Visualization, Resources, Writing - original draft, Software</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>All procedures were approved by the University of British Columbia Animal Care Committee (protocol A18-0267), the University of Alberta Health Science Laboratory Animal Services Animal Care and Use Committee (protocol AUP2711), and the Janelia Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (protocol 17-159).</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec id="s6" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="supp1"><label>Supplementary file 1.</label><caption><title>List of core-enriched genes and enrichment properties.</title></caption><media mime-subtype="plain" mimetype="text" xlink:href="elife-68967-supp1-v1.txt"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="supp2"><label>Supplementary file 2.</label><caption><title>List of shell-enriched genes and enrichment properties.</title></caption><media mime-subtype="plain" mimetype="text" xlink:href="elife-68967-supp2-v1.txt"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="supp3"><label>Supplementary file 3.</label><caption><title>List of layer 6-enriched genes and enrichment properties.</title></caption><media mime-subtype="plain" mimetype="text" xlink:href="elife-68967-supp3-v1.txt"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="transrepform"><label>Transparent reporting form</label><media mime-subtype="pdf" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-68967-transrepform1-v1.pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec><sec id="s7" sec-type="data-availability"><title>Data availability</title><p>Raw and processed scRNA-seq datasets have been deposited in the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) Gene Expression Omnibus under GEO: GSE149495.</p><p>The following dataset was generated:</p><p><element-citation id="dataset1" publication-type="data" specific-use="isSupplementedBy"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Cembrowski</surname><given-names>MS</given-names></name></person-group><year iso-8601-date="2020">2020</year><data-title>Core-shell organization in the mouse claustrum</data-title><source>NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus</source><pub-id pub-id-type="accession" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE149495">GSE149495</pub-id></element-citation></p></sec><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>MSC is supported by the University of British Columbia (Department of Cellular and Physiological Sciences, Djavad Mowafaghian Centre for Brain Health, and the Faculty of Medicine Research Office), the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (RGPIN-2019-04507), the Canadian Institutes of Health Research (PJT-419798), and the Canadian Foundation for Innovation (John R Evans Leaders Fund 38369).

We view the current interpretation of the results as limited by technical issues and the depth of the analysis. Closing that gap would require softening the claims of cell type discovery along with a more much thorough informatic analyses and likely follow up experiments (based on those re-analyses). <italic>eLife</italic> policy is not to consider a revision decision if we think that substantial additional experiments or analysis would be necessary to judge the acceptability of the manuscript and/or would require more than several months to complete.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>Erwin et al. address the relationship between molecular identity and projection anatomy of neurons in the mouse claustrum using single-cell RNAseq, in situ hybridizations and retrograde labeling. Such &quot;mappings&quot; are of interest to circuit neuroscience for both practical and theoretical reasons. In what ways does a neuron's molecular makeup determine its adult connectivity?</p><p>1. The molecular identity(ies) of the &quot;Unknown&quot; yellow cluster (Figures 1 and 3) still remain unknown. The Erwin manuscript implies that these cells make up a distinct cell type of claustrum shell, but the data presented supporting this conclusion are currently weak. The authors state that the &quot;unknown&quot; population is molecularly distinct from both (1) canonical claustrum neurons (Synpr+) and (2) other cortical neuron populations.</p><p>Due to the small number of cells sampled and the restriction of that sampling to the area of the claustrum, the first claim requires only that the canonical claustral neuron type be molecularly distinct to be supported. That there is a specialized claustrum neuron type (at the level of the entire cortical mantle or most likely the whole brain) is already quite clear: previous scRNAseq studies (Zeisel et al; Tasic et al; Saunders et al.) have demonstrated such a specialized RNA expression signature, which includes highly selective gene markers that are localized to the claustrum anatomically. The Erwin et al. data also support the claustrum-specific neuronal profile (as judged by heavy overlap of the selective markers from these other studies).</p><p>Using in situs, Erwin et al. refine the location of the Synpr+ cell type to claustrum &quot;core&quot;. This is the major result of the paper.</p><p>The second claim – that the &quot;unknown&quot; cluster represents a 2nd distinct claustrum neuron type specific to the shell – is not well supported given the data at hand. The authors claim that because only 9.1% of Slc30a3+ cells are Pcp4+, the &quot;unknown&quot; cluster is not related to other excitatory cortical neuron types. However, Pcp4+ is not ubiquitously expressed in all Slc17a7+ neuron types (http://dropviz.org/?_state_id_=80467b8fc3286f0b). Moreover, quantitative variation in Pcp4 expression level could also lead to somewhat arbitrary thresholds for counting cells as positive, even with highly sensitive ACD RNA probes. By my eye, the expanded image in Figure 2D looks as if more than 10% of Slc30a3+ cells are Pcp4+ (if counting those cells with low Pcp4 expression; the authors should describe how the in situ data were quantified in the methods and if the representative images are Z-stack projections or single image planes).</p><p>More concerning is that when one considers the expression patterns of marker genes from the &quot;unknown&quot; cluster (Idb2, Mef2c, Necab1, Nnat, Nrn1, Olfm1, Spon1, Ramp1, Slc30a3, Syn2) across all of cortical cell types, those markers show very little cell-type-specific enrichment (http://dropviz.org/?_state_id_=4bb18bcc4f50d3cb). These data suggest to me that the &quot;unknown&quot; cluster could be a somewhat heterogenous collection that molecularly resemble other cortical excitatory neuron types. That their RNA profiles clustered together could be a property of their simply being dissimilar to the other more distinct cell types included in the analysis.</p><p>The authors can test their claim that &quot;…the core-shell arrangement identified here was consistent with distinct subtypes claustral neurons, rather than reflecting spatial displacement of a cortical cell type&quot; by jointly analyzing their own single cell libraries with much larger datasets describing molecular diversity of glutamatergic neurons across the cortical mantle (Zeisel et al; Tasic et al; Saunders et al). This type of analysis is not computationally prohibitive and could be performed on a decent laptop computer.</p><p>For example, if the Erwin and Saunders/Tasic/Zeisel data are co-clustered, and the authors find the cells from the &quot;unknown&quot; split into distinct excitatory clusters, that might suggest the &quot;unknown&quot; cluster is molecularly heterogenous and offer clues as to which cortical cell types functionally form the claustrum shell. Alternatively, the &quot;unknown&quot; cells might cluster together. This would allow an opportunity for cortex-wide differential expression testing to reveal selective markers for the &quot;shell&quot; subtype. (Importantly, the authors should pursue analytical methods (such as LIGER (Welch et al) or CCA (Butler et al.)) that allow their data to be integrated into other datasets without being burdened by platform/experiment specific clustering artifacts).</p><p>Non-clustering methods could also be used to attain similar insight.</p><p>To be clear, it would be an important observation and not diminish the study if the claustrum &quot;shell&quot; – a region defined anatomically by retrograde labeling – consists of a displaced cortical cell type or types.</p><p>More experiments are needed to address the issue of the molecular identity of the &quot;shell&quot; glutamatergic neurons; as it stands now, the claims in the paper are not strongly supported by the data presented.</p><p>2. Standard methods for single-cell 3' mRNA counting (e.g. Drop-seq, 10x, InDrop) routinely allow tens or hundreds of thousands of single cell RNA profiles to be sampled. It's unclear why the authors choose to pursue a more low-throughput method of whole-RNA sequencing but then not take advantage of mRNA isoform variation which their data uniquely enable? Single-cell RNAseq datasets describing the canonical claustrum neuron type (Synpr+/Nr4a2+) have been published with similar numbers of cells and transcripts/cell (Saunders et al. and Tasic et al; Tasic et al. also perform whole-RNA sequencing). Thus the Erwin et al. datasets is unlikely to reveal previously unappreciated heterogeneity with the canonical claustrum class.</p><p>3. Why were no interneurons sampled in the 274 cell dataset presented in Figure 1? If the authors were selecting particular dissociated cells by eye, they should describe by which criterion they choose individual cells. Could a claustrum excitatory neuron type with a small, irregular or interneuron like somato-dendritic morphology remain unsampled because of selection bias?</p><p>4. The authors should report more details for their molecular and sequencing methods. To identify how the single-cell RNA was processed, I had to track back through two publications (Cembrowski et al. 2018 -&gt; Cembrowski et al. 2016) to find only &quot;Total RNA was isolated from each sample, ERCC spike-in controls were added, and cDNA libraries were amplified from this material.&quot; Please provide detailed methods of library preparation.</p><p>5. The number of mice contributing to the presented experiments are sometimes very low, with some experiments n=2. The exact number of animals should be reported in the text of the results and bolstered where necessary.</p><p>The instance where I find this most concerning regards the data describing the relationship between molecular identities and LEC/RSC projection mapping; perhaps the most critical part of the manuscript.</p><p>I appreciate that the sequencing-based read out of projection anatomy is laborious and expensive. Why not simply combine two color retrograde labeling from LEC/RSC with in situs for shell/core markers? That would allow Erwin et al. to address variance in molecular identity/projection mapping across many mice. For experiments in which understanding biological variance is critical, the authors should also present their current (and any future) data, grouped by individual mouse (at least in the Supplement).</p><p>It's still very early days for circuit neuroscience to engender an understanding of how molecular and axonal anatomy of particular cell types &quot;map&quot;. Critical in making strides in this effort are datasets that allow the across-animal variance of such mappings be accurately described so as to facilitate more nuanced conversations about such mappings. Erwin et all have an opportunity to make an important contribution if animal numbers are increased.</p><p>6. In Figure 3, do the ~15% of cells in each molecular cluster which do not obey the projection pattern of the majority other co-clustered cells exhibit a unique transcriptional signature? Again, this should be evaluated both within each mouse as well as across the projection-based cell populations as a whole</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>My impression is that they may have a real finding regarding &quot;shell&quot; and &quot;core&quot; gene expression, but they don't do a convincing job showing it, especially with the FISH data. The study is kind of narrow in its scope for <italic>ELife</italic>, and should be further extended.</p><p>1. The core vs shell arrangement of gene expression is not so obvious in the FISH data provided in Figure 2D, yet this is a major claim made in the paper. In the given example, Slc30a3 appears medial to, and somewhat intermingled with Synpr, rather than forming a clear ring-like pattern as seen with the retrograde labeling example from LEC/RSC in Figure 3A. In fact, the experiment shown in Figure 3E provides another opportunity to convincingly present the core vs shell arrangement of Slc30a3 and Synpr as they relate to the projection-defined RSC population, however the provided images are cropped too closely to get a sense of the pattern. Perhaps provide an example cropped to the dimensions shown in Figure 3A.</p><p>2. The FISH signal for the CLA shell genes (Slc30a3 and Nnat) appears much weaker than that of Synpr and Pcp4 and some of the other examples provided. This hinders appreciation of the spatial arrangement of these genes around the CLA core and calls into question how reliable co-localization with other FISH probes could be identified. Perhaps potentially more robust probes or genes could be explored to strengthen the presentation of this data? For example, perhaps Spon1 (identified as a Cluster 2 gene in Figure 1F) or other unexplored genes, such as Sdk2 or Crym, that show striking shell-like patterns around the CLA might perform better in the FISH experiments? How well do they spatially colocalize with Slc30a3, which shows biased expression along the medial edge of CLA, but not as much around the lateral edge as seen with Nnat, Spon1, Sdk2, and Crym expression in Allen Institute's Mouse Brain ISH database (http://mouse.brain-map.org/)?</p><p>3. Pcp4 is used as a marker for L5/L6a/L6b cortical excitatory neurons and is claimed to be expressed ubiquitously among this population. However, it has been shown that in L6a, Pcp4 specifically labels corticothalamic-projecting neurons, but not L6 IT excitatory neurons, which are marked by a non-overlapping VGluT1<sup>+</sup>/CcK<sup>+</sup> population (see Figure 8 in Watakabe et al., 2012; doi: 10.1002/cne.23160). Pcp4 is still a very good choice in these experiments for distinguishing between L6a CT and L6b cortical neurons and claustrum-related cells in the shell and core regions, perhaps just include the citation and modify the language in the text.</p><p>4. In Figure 3E, FISH is used to examine the colocalization of Synpr or Slc30a3 with retrogradely labeled RSC-projecting neurons in the CLA, however the same experiment is not performed with LEC-projecting cells and should be presented here. Injections of retrograde tracer in LEC indeed label cell bodies largely below and around the margins of the CLA &quot;core,&quot; as shown in Figure 3A, however they may also label cortical neurons in the overlying insula, so it is unclear where the proposed boundaries of the CLA shell might be when looking at the LEC retrolabeling in Figure 3A. Demonstrating this retrograde labeling in conjunction with Slc30a3 and Pcp4 expression will help clear this up. Lastly, while difficult to address here, it will be important in the future to determine what fraction of the LEC retrolabeling shown below the CLA &quot;core&quot; in Figure 3A might actually comprise neurons belonging to the dorsal endopiriform nucleus (see Figure 8 of Watson et al., 2017; doi: 10.1002/cne.23981), which appears to also express genes for CLA &quot;core&quot; (Synpr), &quot;shell&quot; (Slc30a3, Nnat), and L6b (Ctgf) in ways that may complement or complicate the story unfolding for the CLA here. How the genes identified in this study potentially relate to the endopiriform complex (and even the dorsal aspect of CLA, thought to interact with motor cortex) may be worth mentioning in the discussion.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>The authors present a transcriptomic survey of cell type diversity in the mouse claustrum. They reveal that markers currently used to visualize cells in the core region of the claustrum may not target a second, potentially novel cell type in the claustrum shell. The authors additionally show that these two molecularly divergent cell types have distinct axonal projection targets in the cortex. While this is a potentially interesting finding, the data presented in the manuscript may not be sufficient to adequately describe the transcriptomic organization of the claustrum.</p><p>1) A large body of work, including the accompanying manuscript by the same authors, have described the claustrum as a topologically heterogeneous structure. The description of claustral cell types presented in the manuscript would be strengthened substantially if it addressed if and how gene expression and cell types vary spatially across the claustrum, as the authors have done in previous work with the subiculum, for example, and as the authors did anatomically in the related manuscript of Marriott et al. At a minimum, more detailed anatomical coordinates should be presented throughout for in situ/anatomical/sequencing data. It is unclear which parts of the claustrum are sampled and presented in the manuscript, making it difficult to discern if the results presented herein generalize across this structure or represent a snapshot of a single subregion, whose location is not specified</p><p>2) A major conclusion of the manuscript is that the claustrum contains two transcriptomically distinct cell types. However, the claustrum clearly contains other cell types that appear to be missing from scRNA-seq data. For example, 1) PV neurons are visible in the accompanying Marriott et al. and 2) PCP4+/CTGF- cells are present throughout (Figure 2, supplement 1). Presumably glia were also excluded, although there did not appear to be any mention of this. It is unclear why these types do not appear in scRNA-seq data, raising concerns about sampling biases and coverage.</p><p>3) This major finding of this study and that of Marriott et al., appear to overlap considerably – namely that the claustrum includes a 'shell' of cells with properties distinct from those in the 'core'. At the same time, the study appears to conflict in some ways with results in the accompanying Marriott et al. study. In particular, Marriott et al. show that only 'shell' neurons in the caudal aspect of the claustrum project to the EC, while this study implies that EC projections are a general feature of shell neurons, again raising questions about topology. This discrepancy makes one wonder if the rostral claustrum contains the same cell types transcriptomically.</p><p>4) A recent study (Wang, Xie, Gong, et al., bioRxiv) has described a large amount of heterogeneity in the projection patterns of Gnb4+ cells that presumably correspond to the authors' SYNPR population using single-neuron axonal reconstruction. These neurons appear to include projections to both the LEC and RSP. In addition, that study argued that the same transcriptomic population included cells both within and outside of the claustrum, further complicating the argument that a transcriptomic approach is the 'correct' method for defining its spatial borders. Those results should at least be discussed in the context of the present study.</p><p>[Editors’ note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Spatially patterned excitatory neuron subtypes and circuits within the claustrum&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>.

The reviewers and editors agree that addressing these concerns will improve the manuscript. In particular, Figure 2 is an important figure. The authors should include a better explanation of the data, including clusters displayed and the relationship with anatomical information. The delineation of 'core 'and 'shell' is the foundation of the work and Reviewer #2's concern concerning core/shell needs to be addressed. This critique also applies to Figure 3—figure supplement 2.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>Erwin et al's resubmission is improved by clarifying the methods and details of the experiments; inclusion of new, mFISH analyses with automated transcript quantification (including cells identified from retrograde labeling); and integration of their scRNA-seq datasets with those from larger, published studies. Their data make clear that there is a biased relationship between molecular identity and major axonal projection patterns for neurons in and around the claustrum which the authors describe as a &quot;core&quot; and &quot;shell&quot;.</p><p>There are number of issues that could be addressed to strengthen the experiments, analyses and presentation of the manuscript.</p><p>1. The RNA profiles which make up the &quot;unknown&quot; cluster – which the authors name then analyze as the &quot;shell&quot; – have been sampled and described in other studies and appear, transcriptionally, to be more of a quantitative specialization within a larger neuron population rather than a qualitatively distinct cell type. I draw this inference from their integrated analysis (Figure 1—figure supplement 2). Contrast this to the cells from clusters 1 (canonical claustrum) and clusters 3 (Cortex L6) which appear to be distinct and discrete populations. Yet the way the manuscript is written suggests that the &quot;shell&quot; neurons are a categorically new and different population. I would suggest the authors change their description to better match the results presented in their integrated analysis.</p><p>2. The analysis in Figure 1—supplement 3 suffers from technical limitations and appears to be somewhat forcing the case that &quot;shell&quot; neurons they describe are distinct from those RNA profiles sampled in Saunders/Zeisel. Such comparisons of highly-granularized clusters can tend to identify expression &quot;noise&quot; rather than robust biological differences in RNA expression. Moreover, because each of the three studies used different chemistries and sequencing strategies to make scRNAseq libraries – and such chemistries have different DNA sequence-based biases in amplification and, moreover, were sequenced on different Illumina instruments – it seems in appropriate to compare expression levels of normalized RNAs across datasets in this manner. (I.e. that Nnat has higher expression in the Erwin dataset may simply reflect that Nnat cDNA was more likely to be present on the after Erwin-style library vs Dropseq or 10x V2 preparations).</p><p>3. Of the markers presented for Cluster 2, Slc30a3 appears to have the most selective expression. Yet the data in Figure 2—figure supplement 2 suggest no signal. Somewhat puzzlingly, the mFISH data for the same gene in Figure 2—figure supplement 5 suggest near equivalent levels of mRNA counts in &quot;core&quot; vs &quot;shell&quot; clusters. For many &quot;shell&quot; marker genes, the mFISH data does not appear to vary in &quot;core&quot; neurons to the degree that the scRNA-seq data suggest.</p><p>4. As a more general statement from 3 above, the violin plots used throughout the paper to show expression differences are hard to interpret, especially when severely flattened. The authors should perhaps consider a different plot type (maybe boxplots?) and to give the spacing to each plot so the differences they allude to can be evaluated. Are the violin plots on a log scale?</p><p>5. I find the mFISH analysis presented in Figure 2 confusing. Shouldn't panel C (the clustering results based on the mRNA counts of the 12 genes) be presented before panel B (the locations of cells in the cluster-categories). And critically, what are we to make of the yellow and pink cells in C? Their cell bodies appear to be located within the claustrum yet do they lack a homolog in the scRNAseq data?</p><p>6. The writing of the manuscript could be tightened to more carefully reflect what the authors intend. For example, the use of &quot;circuit&quot; – which I find somewhat ambiguous – might be better replaced by the words &quot;cellular anatomy&quot; or &quot;axonal projection.&quot;</p><p>7. &quot;Claustrum&quot; is misspelled as &quot;clautrum&quot; in two instances.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>The revised manuscript of Erwin et al. has been improved though the addition of new experimental data and, as a result, my major comments have largely been addressed.

Alternatively, the &quot;unknown&quot; cells might cluster together. This would allow an opportunity for cortex-wide differential expression testing to reveal selective markers for the &quot;shell&quot; subtype. (Importantly, the authors should pursue analytical methods (such as LIGER (Welch et al) or CCA (Butler et al.)) that allow their data to be integrated into other datasets without being burdened by platform/experiment specific clustering artifacts).</p></disp-quote><p>As requested, we use Seurat v3 data integration approaches to combine our scRNA-seq data with previous published datasets.

Standard methods for single-cell 3' mRNA counting (e.g. Drop-seq, 10x, InDrop) routinely allow tens or hundreds of thousands of single cell RNA profiles to be sampled. It's unclear why the authors choose to pursue a more low-throughput method of whole-RNA sequencing but then not take advantage of mRNA isoform variation which their data uniquely enable? Single-cell RNAseq datasets describing the canonical claustrum neuron type (Synpr+/Nr4a2+) have been published with similar numbers of cells and transcripts/cell (Saunders et al. and Tasic et al; Tasic et al. also perform whole-RNA sequencing). Thus the Erwin et al. datasets is unlikely to reveal previously unappreciated heterogeneity with the canonical claustrum class.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that mRNA isoform variation is an interesting are of research in general, but in the context of our study here, mRNA isoform variation is challenging in both scRNA-seq statistical inference as well as mFISH validation of scRNA-seq predictions. As our manuscript focuses on identifying subtypes of claustral neurons, which in principle and practice can be done at the relatively well-powered gene level, we elected to not perform any isoform-level analysis. We hope the reviewer finds this gene-level scope sufficient, especially as we believe our revised manuscript provides evidence of previously unappreciated heterogeneity within the claustrum.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3.

The core vs shell arrangement of gene expression is not so obvious in the FISH data provided in Figure 2D, yet this is a major claim made in the paper. In the given example, Slc30a3 appears medial to, and somewhat intermingled with Synpr, rather than forming a clear ring-like pattern as seen with the retrograde labeling example from LEC/RSC in Figure 3A. In fact, the experiment shown in Figure 3E provides another opportunity to convincingly present the core vs shell arrangement of Slc30a3 and Synpr as they relate to the projection-defined RSC population, however the provided images are cropped too closely to get a sense of the pattern.

Pcp4 is used as a marker for L5/L6a/L6b cortical excitatory neurons and is claimed to be expressed ubiquitously among this population.

Injections of retrograde tracer in LEC indeed label cell bodies largely below and around the margins of the CLA &quot;core,&quot; as shown in Figure 3A, however they may also label cortical neurons in the overlying insula, so it is unclear where the proposed boundaries of the CLA shell might be when looking at the LEC retrolabeling in Figure 3A.

They reveal that markers currently used to visualize cells in the core region of the claustrum may not target a second, potentially novel cell type in the claustrum shell. The authors additionally show that these two molecularly divergent cell types have distinct axonal projection targets in the cortex. While this is a potentially interesting finding, the data presented in the manuscript may not be sufficient to adequately describe the transcriptomic organization of the claustrum.</p></disp-quote><p>We are glad that the reviewer found the findings of our previous manuscript potentially interesting. As described below, over the last 7 months we have dramatically expanded upon these original experiments and analysis. We hope our revised manuscript now sufficiently describes the transcriptomic organization of the claustrum.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1) A large body of work, including the accompanying manuscript by the same authors, have described the claustrum as a topologically heterogeneous structure. The description of claustral cell types presented in the manuscript would be strengthened substantially if it addressed if and how gene expression and cell types vary spatially across the claustrum, as the authors have done in previous work with the subiculum, for example, and as the authors did anatomically in the related manuscript of Marriott et al. At a minimum, more detailed anatomical coordinates should be presented throughout for in situ/anatomical/sequencing data. It is unclear which parts of the claustrum are sampled and presented in the manuscript, making it difficult to discern if the results presented herein generalize across this structure or represent a snapshot of a single subregion, whose location is not specified.</p></disp-quote><p>In our revised manuscript, we now include substantially more data and insight on location and variation in the anterior-posterior axis (e.g., scRNA-seq: new Figure 1—figure supplement 1; mFISH: new Figure 2, Figure 2—figure supplement 4, new Figure 3). This includes illustrating specific anatomical coordinates, as requested.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) A major conclusion of the manuscript is that the claustrum contains two transcriptomically distinct cell types. However, the claustrum clearly contains other cell types that appear to be missing from scRNA-seq data. For example, 1) PV neurons are visible in the accompanying Marriott et al. and 2) PCP4+/CTGF- cells are present throughout (Figure 2, supplement 1). Presumably glia were also excluded, although there did not appear to be any mention of this. It is unclear why these types do not appear in scRNA-seq data, raising concerns about sampling biases and coverage.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that our preparation methods – which select primarily for excitatory neurons due to overall abundance and further purification via circuit labeling – were poorly explained in our original submission. In our revised manuscript, we provide extended methods that explain the relative abundance of excitatory neurons observed in our dataset.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) This major finding of this study and that of Marriott et al., appear to overlap considerably – namely that the claustrum includes a 'shell' of cells with properties distinct from those in the 'core'. At the same time, the study appears to conflict in some ways with results in the accompanying Marriott et al. study. In particular, Marriott et al. show that only 'shell' neurons in the caudal aspect of the claustrum project to the EC, while this study implies that EC projections are a general feature of shell neurons, again raising questions about topology. This discrepancy makes one wonder if the rostral claustrum contains the same cell types transcriptomically.</p></disp-quote><p>This point is well-taken, and in our revised manuscript, we now have now examined whether transcriptomic identity of claustrum neurons varies across the anterior-posterior (i.e., rostralcaudal) axis. Importantly, we do not find evidence of identity changes along this axis from either scRNA-seq data (new Figure 1—figure supplement 1C) or mFISH data (new Figure 2, new Figure 2—figure supplement 4).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) A recent study (Wang, Xie, Gong, et al., bioRxiv) has described a large amount of heterogeneity in the projection patterns of Gnb4+ cells that presumably correspond to the authors' SYNPR population using single-neuron axonal reconstruction. These neurons appear to include projections to both the LEC and RSP.</p></disp-quote><p>We note that <italic>Gnb4</italic> is expressed in both core and shell subtypes in our study (e.g., Figure 1C), and thus, it is not unexpected that previous work showed projections to both LEC and RSC.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In addition, that study argued that the same transcriptomic population included cells both within and outside of the claustrum, further complicating the argument that a transcriptomic approach is the 'correct' method for defining its spatial borders. Those results should at least be discussed in the context of the present study.</p></disp-quote><p>We now cite this manuscript (Wang et al., bioRxiv 2017) along with the most recent version of this preprint (Peng et al., bioRxiv 2020) within our manuscript, and we furthermore agree that comparing our work to these preprints warrants further discussion.

The RNA profiles which make up the &quot;unknown&quot; cluster – which the authors name then analyze as the &quot;shell&quot; – have been sampled and described in other studies and appear, transcriptionally, to be more of a quantitative specialization within a larger neuron population rather than a qualitatively distinct cell type. I draw this inference from their integrated analysis (Figure 1—figure supplement 2). Contrast this to the cells from clusters 1 (canonical claustrum) and clusters 3 (Cortex L6) which appear to be distinct and discrete populations. Yet the way the manuscript is written suggests that the &quot;shell&quot; neurons are a categorically new and different population. I would suggest the authors change their description to better match the results presented in their integrated analysis.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now changed our description, emphasizing that our findings of the shell neurons are “specialized” and “distinguishable” relative to cortical neurons (revised Introduction, Discussion, and the following Results sections: “Comparison to previously published work” and “Two types of excitatory claustral neurons exist in a core-shell arrangement”).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. The analysis in Figure 1—figure supplement 3 suffers from technical limitations and appears to be somewhat forcing the case that &quot;shell&quot; neurons they describe are distinct from those RNA profiles sampled in Saunders/Zeisel. Such comparisons of highly-granularized clusters can tend to identify expression &quot;noise&quot; rather than robust biological differences in RNA expression. Moreover, because each of the three studies used different chemistries and sequencing strategies to make scRNAseq libraries – and such chemistries have different DNA sequence-based biases in amplification and, moreover, were sequenced on different Illumina instruments – it seems in appropriate to compare expression levels of normalized RNAs across datasets in this manner. (I.e. that Nnat has higher expression in the Erwin dataset may simply reflect that Nnat cDNA was more likely to be present on the after Erwin-style library vs Dropseq or 10x V2 preparations).</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the above general points raised by the reviewer, wherein different library preparation and sequencing strategies can introduce biases across scRNA-seq datasets. Nonetheless, we believe these concerns do not specifically apply to our integrated analysis examining either <italic>Nnat</italic> and <italic>Pcp4</italic>, and provide justification for this reasoning below.</p><p>For <italic>Nnat</italic>: Even though <italic>Nnat-</italic>expressing shell neurons are more abundant within our dataset, they are also found within both the Saunders and Zeisel datasets (see Figure 1—figure supplement 3B inset). Importantly, both Saunders and Zeisel datasets also contain shell neurons with higher <italic>Nnat</italic> expression than any cells within our dataset (see Figure 1—figure supplement 3D). Such results directly argue that reduction of <italic>Nnat</italic> in shell neurons reflects biological cell-type-specific differences, rather than technical differences across datasets.</p><p>For <italic>Pcp4</italic>: Shell neurons from our dataset exhibit reduced <italic>Pcp4</italic> expression relative to similar cells in Saunders and Zeisel datasets (Figure 1—figure supplement 3F), and notably our dataset was also largely absent of nearby <italic>Pcp4-</italic>expressing cells found in these previously published datasets (Figure 1—figure supplement 3B inset). Such results may be suggestive of technical differences leading to reduced <italic>Pcp4</italic> expression in our dataset, but also may reflect <italic>bona fide</italic> biological differences. To disambiguate between these two competing explanations, we leveraged the fact that <italic>Pcp4</italic> is a strong cortical marker, and thus examined <italic>Pcp4</italic> expression in our cortical cell type relative to Saunders and Zeisel datasets (cluster 3: Figure 1—figure supplement 2A). Here, we found that <italic>Pcp4</italic> was indeed similarly expressed across all datasets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref>). This result illustrates that decreased <italic>Pcp4</italic> expression is not broadly decreased across our dataset due to technical differences, but rather is decreased in a cell-type-specific fashion within our shell population.</p><p>Finally, in our revised manuscript we also now provide complementary ISH analysis that highlights why <italic>Pcp4</italic> is enriched in previous broad datasets, whereas <italic>Nnat</italic> is enriched in our targeted claustrum dataset (revised Figure 1—figure supplement 4). Specifically, <italic>Pcp4</italic> is broadly expressed across cortical layers but largely absent within the spatial extent of the claustrum, whereas <italic>Nnat</italic> is expressed around the claustrum but generally absent in other cortical regions. In combination with our expanded scRNA-seq analysis above, this work shows that our differential <italic>Nnat</italic> and <italic>Pcp4</italic> expression in our dataset emerges from our targeted approach to the claustrum, rather than reflecting technical differences across datasets.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3.

Shouldn't panel C (the clustering results based on the mRNA counts of the 12 genes) be presented before panel B (the locations of cells in the cluster-categories).</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer’s point is well-taken, and we have modified this figure accordingly.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>And critically, what are we to make of the yellow and pink cells in C? Their cell bodies appear to be located within the claustrum yet do they lack a homolog in the scRNAseq data?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for bring this point to our attention. Motivated by this suggestion, we have revised our approach to clustering since our previous manuscript. In particular, we noted that our previous hierarchical clustering approach led to some discordancy with low-dimensional organization suggested by UMAP embedding, and thus sought to identify whether a different clustering approach could yield better agreement with dimensionality reduction.</p><p>In doing so, we identified Leiden clustering produces significantly better agreement with lowdimensional embedding (revised Figure 2, 3 and associated supplemental figures). These new cluster identities furthermore better capture the core-shell organization when viewed in a spatial context, and illustrate that cells contained within the atlas-defined claustrum predominantly derive from core, shell, and layer 6 neuronal identities.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. The writing of the manuscript could be tightened to more carefully reflect what the authors intend. For example, the use of &quot;circuit&quot; – which I find somewhat ambiguous – might be better replaced by the words &quot;cellular anatomy&quot; or &quot;axonal projection.&quot;</p></disp-quote><p>Broadly, we now use “projection” to refer to this organization in our revised manuscript, including changes in the title and abstract. We now only include “circuit” sparingly and only when the context is clear.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7. &quot;Claustrum&quot; is misspelled as &quot;clautrum&quot; in two instances.</p></disp-quote><p>Fixed.</p></body></sub-article></article>
