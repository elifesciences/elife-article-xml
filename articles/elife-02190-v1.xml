conserved from bacteria to humans. Here, we report a novel DNA patrolling activity which may underlie Pif1’s diverse functions: a Pif1 monomer preferentially anchors itself to a 3′-tailed DNA junction and periodically reel in the 3′ tail with a step size of one nucleotide, extruding a loop. This periodic patrolling activity is used to unfold an intramolecular G-quadruplex (G4) structure on every encounter, and is sufficient to unwind RNA-DNA heteroduplex but not duplex DNA. Instead of leaving after G4 unwinding, allowing it to refold, or going beyond to unwind duplex DNA, Pif1 repeatedly unwinds G4 DNA, keeping it unfolded. Pif1-induced unfolding of G4 occurs in three discrete steps, one strand at a time, and is powerful enough to overcome G4-stabilizing drugs. The periodic patrolling activity may keep Pif1 at its site of in vivo action in displacing telomerase, resolving R-loops, and keeping G4 unfolded during replication, recombination and repair.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.02190.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.02190.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.02190.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Helicases are enzymes that are best known for their ability to separate the two strands of DNA that make up the famous double-helix structure. Many important processes within cells—including the expression of genes as proteins, and the replication of DNA before cell division—rely on DNA molecules being separated in this way. However, these enzymes can perform many other roles that help maintain the integrity of a cell’s DNA.</p><p>The genetic code is written using four DNA bases—called A, C, G and T—and if a stretch of DNA contains lots of G bases, then one of the strands can loop back upon itself three times to form a structure known as a ‘G-quadruplex’. These structures can prevent the expression of genes, and slow the replication of DNA. However, a helicase called Pif1 can unwind G-quadruplexes to allow these activities to continue. This helicase is found in many organisms, from bacteria to humans, and carries out multiple functions for a cell. However, the exact mechanisms underlying these activities are unknown.</p><p>Now, Zhou et al. have used biophysical techniques to reveal that individual Pif1 proteins bind to single-stranded overhangs at one end of a DNA molecule. Pif1 also binds to forks in DNA where the double helix separates into two single strands. And once Pif1 has bound to the DNA, it works to ‘reel in’ the overhang or a single strand, one base at a time. This activity can unwind a G-quadruplex, and individual Pif1 proteins will patrol DNA to keep this structures unwound without unraveling the double helix itself. Separating the two strands of DNA actually needs multiple Pif1 proteins to join and work together.</p><p>As it patrols, Pif1 also displaces other proteins from DNA and removes unusual, and potentially harmful, structures in DNA (such as RNA molecules that have displaced one of the strands of DNA double helix). The next challenge will be to address important questions that remain unanswered including: how does Pif1 recognize DNA structures and change its activity; and how does it coordinate with other proteins that target the same structures?</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.02190.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.02190.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>Pif1 family helicase</kwd><kwd>single molecule analysis</kwd><kwd>G-quadruplexes</kwd><kwd>R-loop</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM065367</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhou</surname><given-names>Ruobo</given-names></name><name><surname>Zhang</surname><given-names>Jichuan</given-names></name><name><surname>Ha</surname><given-names>Taekjip</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM26938</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zakian</surname><given-names>Virginia A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>0822613</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhou</surname><given-names>Ruobo</given-names></name><name><surname>Ha</surname><given-names>Taekjip</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000048</institution-id><institution>American Cancer Society</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PF-10-145-01-DMC</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bochman</surname><given-names>Matthew L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Analyzing single molecules reveals that Pif1 family helicases periodically patrol DNA, which may explain this enzyme's ability to suppress genome instability at G-quadruplex motifs and transcriptional RNA-DNA hybrids (R-loops).</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Approximately, 1% of eukaryotic genes encode DNA or RNA helicases. These enzymes function in nearly all aspects of nucleic acid metabolism in living organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Singleton et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lohman et al., 2008</xref>). Although helicases were originally recognized as enzymes that catalyze the strand separation of double-stranded nucleic acids, it is now evident that helicases, as defined by a series of characteristic sequence motifs, may have additional functions aside from unwinding duplexes, including protein displacement from DNA and RNA, the unwinding of G-quadruplex (G4) structures, remodelling of chromatin and ribonucleoprotein complexes, promotion of Holliday junction branch migration and the catalysis of a range of nucleic acid conformational changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Singleton et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lohman et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Pyle, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Paeschke et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>The Pif1 DNA helicase is an example of a multi-functional helicase. The Pif1 helicase family is a group of 5′→3′ directed, ATP-dependent, super-family (SF) 1B helicases that are evolutionarily conserved from bacteria to humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bochman et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Paeschke et al., 2013</xref>). The <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> Pif1 helicase (Pif1), the prototypical member of the Pif1 helicase family, plays critical roles in inhibiting telomerase activity at telomeres and double-stranded DNA breaks (DSBs), processing Okazaki fragments, promoting break-induced replication, maintaining mitochondrial DNA, and preventing replication pausing and DSBs at G-quadruplex (G4) motifs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Boule and Zakian, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bochman et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lopes et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Paeschke et al., 2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Wilson et al., 2013</xref>). However, the molecular mechanisms responsible for these diverse Pif1 functions remain elusive. For example, Pif1 is known to unwind RNA/DNA hybrids better than dsDNA but its mechanistic basis is unknown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Boule and Zakian, 2007</xref>). In addition, how Pif1 may selectively function on certain DNA structures such as stalled replication forks or G4 structures is unclear.</p><p>Here, we show that a Pif1 monomer is preferentially recruited to 3′ ss-dsDNA junctions and induces repetitive DNA looping that is tightly coupled to its translocation activity powered by its ATPase. This periodic DNA patrolling activity of a Pif1 monomer can be used to unwind RNA–DNA hybrids in its path but not DNA–DNA duplexes because DNA unwinding requires the cooperation of multiple Pif1 monomers. Furthermore, we show that a Pif1 monomer has the capacity to unwind an intramolecular G4 structure in its patrolling path with near unity yield. This novel activity would keep the enzyme at its site of in vivo action in displacing telomerase from 3′ ssDNA ends (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Boule et al., 2005</xref>), resolving biologically relevant ‘R-loops’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aguilera and Garcia-Muse, 2012</xref>), and keeping G4 DNA sequences unfolded during DNA replication, recombination and repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Paeschke et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Wilson et al., 2013</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>A Pif1 monomer scans 3′ ssDNA overhang periodically</title><p>We employed single-molecule (sm)FRET assays with total internal reflection (TIR) fluorescence microscopy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Roy et al., 2008</xref>) to study the ATP-dependent 5′ to 3′ ssDNA translocation activity of <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> Pif1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Galletto and Tomko, 2013</xref>).

When we repositioned the fluorophores near the two ends of the (dT)<sub>40</sub> region (the construct is referred to as (dT)<sub>40</sub>), smFRET-time traces showed a periodic sawtooth-shaped pattern where FRET gradually increases until it abruptly drops to a low level and repeats the process many times (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Observation of the sawtooth pattern required both Pif1 and ATP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>), and the sawtooth pattern was not observed with a 5′ overhang (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). We hypothesized that Pif1 remains anchored to the 3′ ss-dsDNA junction while translocating on and reeling in the 3′ overhang, extruding a ssDNA loop (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). To test this hypothesis, we used the fact that Cy3 gets brighter when a protein is in close proximity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fischer et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hwang et al., 2011</xref>). A sawtooth pattern was observed when Cy3 was placed at the 3′ ssDNA end but not at the ss-dsDNA junction, supporting the model that Pif1 approaches the 3′ end while remaining anchored to the junction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). To ascertain the monomeric state of Pif1, Pif1 was pulled down to the surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Jain et al., 2011</xref>) using an antibody against the Histidine<sub>6</sub>-tag (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>).

Whether a monomer or dimer of SF1/SF2 helicases is responsible for nucleic acid unwinding has been a subject of debate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Singleton et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lohman et al., 2008</xref>), so we asked if a patrolling Pif1 monomer can unwind dsDNA or RNA–DNA hybrids. We designed gapped substrates by placing an additional 31-bp DNA–DNA or RNA–DNA duplex next to the 3′ end of the (dT)<sub>40</sub> substrate (referred to as DD31 and RD31, respectively; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). If Pif1 fully unwinds the duplex during its periodic patrolling, the Cy3-labeled strand should be released from the surface, resulting in a decrease of the number of Cy3 spots over time. DD31 unwinding was not detectable under the monomer condition but was observed at 100 nM Pif1, likely due to multiple Pif1 proteins acting in concert (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). In contrast, efficient unwinding of RD31 was detected under both conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Under the monomer condition, unwinding curves for RD31 can be fit to a single exponential function, yielding the unwinding times <italic>t</italic><sub>unwind</sub> = 6.3 ± 0.9 and 1.6 ± 0.2 min at 20 μM and 1 mM ATP, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C</xref>). smFRET-time traces taken under the monomer condition showed that Pif1 performs periodic patrolling on both DD31 and RD31 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>) with an average period of τ = 2.4 ± 0.1 s at 20 μM ATP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Our data hence suggest that a Pif1 monomer takes about 200 cycles on average (= 6.3 min/2.4 s) to unwind the 31 bp RNA–DNA hybrid, whereas dsDNA unwinding requires the cooperation of multiple Pif1 monomers or protein oligomerization on DNA. At 100 nM Pif1, FRET fluctuations became irregular (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>), likely due to the binding of multiple Pif1 monomers to the gapped substrate at this Pif1 concentration.

We discovered that monomeric Pif1 is preferentially recruited to 3′-ss-dsDNA junctions and reels in ssDNA while staying at the junction, repeatedly looping out a ssDNA segment. This periodic behavior is ATP dependent and tightly coupled to Pif1’s translocase activity. Previous single-molecule studies have shown that <italic>B. stearothermophilus</italic> PcrA and <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> UvrD, two bacterial SF 1A helicases, are both preferentially recruited to 5′-ss-dsDNA junctions and exhibit similar activities with reverse translocation directionality (i.e., 3′→5′) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Park et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Tomko et al., 2010</xref>). In addition, we showed that Pif1′s patrolling activity persists in forked and gapped DNA substrates containing a 3′-ss-dsDNA junction, raising the possibility that it may happen when Pif1 binds to various types of DNA intermediates during DNA replication, repair, and recombination where a 3′-ss-dsDNA junction is present.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref> illustrates several possible biological contexts in which Pif1′s periodic patrolling activity may play important roles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). First, the patrolling activity of a Pif1 monomer can be used to unwind ‘R-loops’ (RNA-DNA hybrids) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>). Growing evidence indicates that R-loops occur much more frequently during replication and transcription than previously foreseen, and persistent R-loop formation in cells is a potential source of genome instability including mutations, recombination, chromosomal rearrangements, and chromosome loss (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aguilera and Garcia-Muse, 2012</xref>). We showed that a Pif1 monomer can utilize its patrolling activity to remove the RNA strand from 31-bp RNA–DNA hybrids through ∼200 cycles (and fewer cycles may be needed for shorter heteroduplexes). In contrast, dsDNA unwinding required the cooperation of multiple Pif1 monomers. Therefore, it is possible that Pif1’s periodic patrolling activity contributes to the cell’s ability to remove deleterious R-loops. Second, periodic patrolling may be responsible for Pif1’s telomerase removal activity from 3′ ssDNA ends found at telomeres or DSBs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Boule et al., 2005</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>). Many previous studies show that the translocation activity of monomeric helicases can help displace proteins from DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lohman et al., 2008</xref>). In fact, PcrA utilizes periodic patrolling activity to dismantle potentially deleterious RecA filaments from 5′ ssDNA ends (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Park et al., 2010</xref>). As it has been proposed that Pif1 inhibits telomerase by unwinding the RNA–DNA hybrid formed between the telomerase RNA and the telomeric DNA end (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Boule and Zakian, 2007</xref>), Pif1’s periodic patrolling activity, which is capable of unwinding RNA–DNA heteroduplexes, may be responsible for the Pif1-mediated telomerase inhibition at 3′ ssDNA ends. Third, periodic patrolling can be used to keep G4 DNA unfolded at transcription bubble (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>), at DSBs or telomeres (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>) or on the lagging and/or leading strand during replication (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D,E</xref>). We showed that periodic patrolling by a Pif1 monomer can unwind intramolecular G4 DNA structures at every patrolling cycle. Because, as shown here, an unwound G4 DNA refolds immediately (∼0.2 s), the periodic patrolling activity of Pif1 due to its anchoring at the junction is critical to ensure that G4 structures are kept resolved. In gapped DNA substrates, the patrolling activity can keep G4 sequences unfolded in the ssDNA gap while leaving the flanking dsDNA regions intact. This intrinsic property of a Pif1 monomer would suppress G4 formation until other DNA metabolic enzymes take over without causing the side effect of uncontrolled dsDNA unwinding.<fig id="fig8" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.02190.022</object-id><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Possible cellular sites for the patrolling activity of a Pif1 monomer.</title><p>The periodic patrolling activity may keep Pif1 at its site of in vivo action in resolving biologically relevant ‘R-loops’ (<bold>A</bold>), displacing telomerase from 3′ ssDNA ends at telomeres or DSBs (<bold>B</bold>), unwinding G4 structures on the 3′ ssDNA tails at telomeres or DSBs (<bold>C</bold>), and unwinding G4 structures on the lagging and/or leading strands during DNA replication (<bold>D</bold> and <bold>E</bold>).</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.02190.022">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.02190.022</ext-link></p></caption><graphic xlink:href="elife-02190-fig8-v1.tif"/></fig></p><p>Additionally, our results provide an example in which separation of helicase function can be achieved by the assembly state.

Our data suggest that the monomeric form of Pif1 is able to unwind RNA–DNA heteroduplexes and G4 structures, whereas dsDNA unwinding requires the binding of multiple Pif1 molecules per DNA substrate. As a result, DNA binding-induced enzyme oligomerization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Barranco-Medina and Galletto, 2010</xref>) and/or interactions with accessory proteins might play a role in regulating the translocation vs helicase activity of Pif1.</p><p>Thus far, more than 20 helicases have been shown to bind and/or unwind G4 structures in vitro, among which Pif1 displays the highest specificity in G4 unwinding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Paeschke et al., 2013</xref>). We have for the first time resolved the intermediates for G4 unwinding by a helicase. The three discrete steps observed are likely due to unraveling of G4 DNA one strand at a time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>), which indicates that the G4 unwinding by Pif1 is tightly coupled to its translocation activity. It has been shown that the stabilization energy of a Hoogsteen GG base pair is comparable to that of AT base pair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Mashimo and Sugiyama, 2007</xref>), and that the lifetime of G-triplex and G-hairpin could be as long as 0.1–1 s, consistent with our observations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Li et al., 2013</xref>). In addition, we also showed that a G4 stabilizing compound, BRACO19, cannot inhibit Pif1-mediated G4 unwinding.</p><p>In conclusion, our study provides the mechanistic details on how Pif1 may achieve its distinct in vivo functions at the molecular level. The periodic patrolling activity by its monomeric form may keep the enzyme at its sites of in vivo action in displacing telomerase from 3′ ssDNA ends, resolving biologically relevant ‘R-loops’, and keeping G4 DNA sequences unfolded during DNA replication, recombination and repair. The inability of a Pif1 monomer to display dsDNA unwinding activity might be important for preventing Pif1 monomers from unwinding dsDNA after the Pif1 monomer has displaced proteins, removed RNA strands or resolved G4 structures from within a ssDNA gap.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>DNA/RNA sequences and annealing procedures</title><p>Partial duplex (pd) DNA substrates with a 3′ Poly(dT) ssDNA overhang<list list-type="order"><list-item><p>5′-/Cy3/GCC TCG CTG CCG TCG CCA/biotin/-3′</p></list-item><list-item><p>5′-TGG CGA CGG CAG CGA GGC (T)<sub>15</sub>/iAmMC6T/(T)<sub>24</sub>-3′</p></list-item><list-item><p>5′-/Cy5/GCC TCG CTG CCG TCG CCA/biotin/-3′</p></list-item><list-item><p>5′-TGG CGA CGG CAG CGA GGC (T)<sub><italic>N</italic></sub>/Cy3/-3′, where <italic>N</italic> = 21, 32, 40, 56, 72</p></list-item><list-item><p>5′-GCC TCG CTG CCG TCG CCA/biotin/-3′</p></list-item><list-item><p>5′-TGG CGA CGG CAG CGA GGC (T)<sub>39</sub>/iAmMC6T/(T)<sub>31</sub>/3AmMO/-3′</p></list-item><list-item><p>5′-/Cy5/GCC TCG CTG CCG TCG CCA-3′</p></list-item></list></p><p>Forked DNA substrates<list list-type="order"><list-item><p>5′-(dT)<sub>19</sub>/iAmMC6T//GCC TCG CTG CCG TCG CCA/biotin/-3′</p></list-item><list-item><p>5′-TGG CGA CGG CAG CGA GGC (T)<sub>40</sub>/Cy3/-3′</p></list-item></list></p><p>Gapped substrates<list list-type="order"><list-item><p>5′-/Cy5/GCC TCG CTG CCG TCG CCA/biotin/-3′</p></list-item><list-item><p>5′-TGG CGA CGG CAG CGA GGC (T)<sub>40</sub> GCA CTC GGA TCA CCA TGG CGG ACT CTC TGC T-3′</p></list-item><list-item><p>5′-AGC AGA GAG TCC GCC ATG GTG ATC CGA GTG C /Cy3/-3′</p></list-item><list-item><p>5′-/Cy3/AGC AGA GAG TCC GCC ATG GTG ATC CGA GTG C-3′</p></list-item><list-item><p>5′-AGC AGA GAG UCC GCC AUG GUG AUC CGA GUG C /Cy3/-3′ (RNA)</p></list-item><list-item><p>5′-TGG CGA CGG CAG CGA GGC (T)<sub>31</sub>/iAmMC6T/(T)<sub>18</sub> CAC CAT GGC GGA CTC TCT GCT-3′</p></list-item><list-item><p>5′-AGC AGA GAG TCC GCC ATG GTG/3AmMO/-3′</p></list-item><list-item><p>5′-GCC TCG CTG CCG TCG CCA/biotin/-3′</p></list-item><list-item><p>5′-TGG CGA CGG CAG CGA GGC (T)<sub>20</sub> CAC CAT GGC GGA CTC TCT GCT-3′</p></list-item></list></p><p>Intramolecular G4 substrates (for Pif1)<list list-type="order"><list-item><p>5′-GCC TCG CTG CCG TCG CCA/biotin/-3′</p></list-item><list-item><p>5′-TGG CGA CGG CAG CGA GGC (T)<sub>39</sub>/iAmMC6T/<bold>GGG GGA GCT GGG GTA GAT GGG AAT GTG AGG G</bold>/3AmMO/-3′</p></list-item><list-item><p>5′-TGG CGA CGG CAG CGA GGC AAA <bold>GGG GGA GCT GGG GTA GAT GGG AAT GTG AGG G</bold> AAA/Cy3/-3′</p></list-item><list-item><p>5′-TGG CGA CGG CAG CGA GGC (T)<sub>39</sub>/iAmMC6T/A <underline>GGG TTA GGG TTA GGG TTA GGG</underline> TT/3AmMO/-3′</p></list-item><list-item><p>5′-TGG CGA CGG CAG CGA GGC (T)<sub>37</sub>/iAmMC6T/A <underline>GGG TTA GGG TTA GGG TTA GGG</underline> TCA CCA TGG CGG ACT CTC TGC T-3′</p></list-item><list-item><p>5′-TGG CGA CGG CAG CGA GGC/iAmMC6T/A <underline>GGG TTA GGG TTA GGG TTA GGG</underline> TCA CCA TGG CGG ACT CTC TGC T-3′</p></list-item><list-item><p>5′-AGC AGA GAG TCC GCC ATG GTG/3AmMO/-3′</p></list-item></list></p><p>pdDNA substrates with a 5′ Poly(dT) ssDNA overhang<list list-type="order"><list-item><p>5′-/biotin/TGG CGA CGG CAG CGA GGC/Cy5/-3′</p></list-item><list-item><p>5′-/Cy3/(dT)<sub>40</sub> GCC TCG CTG CCG TCG CCA-3′</p></list-item></list></p><p>Gapped substrates (for PcrA)<list list-type="order"><list-item><p>5′-/biotin/TAC TCG CGC CGT CGC TCC G/Cy5/-3′</p></list-item><list-item><p>5′-TGG CGA CGG CAG CGA GGC (T)<sub>40</sub> CGG AGC GAC GGC GCG AGT-3′</p></list-item><list-item><p>5′-/Cy3/GCC TCG CTG CCG TCG CCA-3′</p></list-item></list></p><p>Intramolecular G4 substrates (for PcrA)<list list-type="order"><list-item><p>5′-/biotin/TGG CGA CGG CAG CGA GGC/Cy5/-3′</p></list-item><list-item><p>5′-/5AmMC6/TA <underline>GGG TTA GGG TTA GGG TTA GGG</underline>/iAmMC6T/(T)<sub>39</sub> GCC TCG CTG CCG TCG CCA-3′</p></list-item></list></p><p>DNA strands were purchased from Integrated DNA Technologics, Coralville, IA.

Cy3-Cy5 labeled pdDNA substrates (50–100 pM) were immobilized on a quartz slide surface coated with polyethyleneglycol (mPEG-SC, Laysan Bio, Arab, AL) in order to eliminate nonspecific surface adsorption of proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Ha et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Roy et al., 2008</xref>). Surface immobilization was mediated by biotin–Neutravidin interactions between biotinylated DNA, Neutravidin (Thermo Scientific, Newington, NH), and biotinylated polymer (Bio-PEG-SC, Laysan Bio, Arab, AL). To ensure no more than one Pif1 monomer is loaded per DNA (i.e., under monomer conditions), 10 nM Pif1 was incubated with the surface-immobilized DNA for 2 min, and excess unbound proteins were then flushed out from the sample chamber using five chamber volumes of imaging buffer. Next, imaging buffer devoid of proteins was added with 20 μM ATP (unless specified otherwise) into the chamber. Finally, the Cy3/Cy5 fluorescence intensities from single DNA molecules were recorded with 30-ms time resolution. For some experiments, ATP was added together with proteins into the chamber for data acquisition after immobilizing the DNA substrates. In the pull-down assays, Histidine<sub>6</sub>-tagged Pif1 was pulled down to the surface using an antibody against the Histidine<sub>6</sub>-tag following the procedure described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Jain et al., 2011</xref>). To study the unwinding of dsDNA or RNA–DNA hybrids, gapped substrates were immobilized on the PEG surface, and the mean Cy3 spot count per image (imaging area = ∼2500 μm<sup>2</sup>) was then determined from images taken from 5–10 different slide regions at different times after introducing ATP.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Single-molecule data analysis</title><p>Apparent FRET efficiency was calculated from the fluorescence intensities of the donor (<italic>I</italic><sub>D</sub>) and acceptor (<italic>I</italic><sub>A</sub>) using the formula <italic>E</italic><sub>FRET</sub> = <italic>I</italic><sub>A</sub>/(<italic>I</italic><sub>A</sub> + <italic>I</italic><sub>D</sub>). The background and the cross-talk between the donor and acceptor were considered as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Roy et al., 2008</xref>). Analysis of individual FRET-time traces was performed using Origin or programs written in Matlab. Single molecule FRET histograms were generated by averaging for the time period of 0.15 s from ∼10,000 DNA molecules. The time period Pif1 takes for one cycle of looping, Δ<italic>t</italic>, was determined by visually picking the moments when <italic>E</italic><sub>FRET</sub> reaches its maximum value (i.e., the peaks) in the single molecule FRET-time traces showing periodic sawtooth or wave patterns.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by a Senior editor and 3 reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the other reviewers discussed their comments before reaching this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission. Please consider each of these points, and provide either a response with additional experimental data or a detailed reasoning that addresses the issue in question.</p><p>This manuscript describes single-molecule fluorescence experiments that visualize the activity of the Pif1 DNA helicase. The authors show that it patrols ssDNA by translocating in a 5'-3'-directed fashion away from a ds-ssDNA junction in a cyclic manner. While doing so, it is able to efficiently unwind RNA–DNA hybrids and G4 quadruplex structures. The data are very convincing and their analyses rigorous. The level of kinetic detail obtained with these experiments is remarkable. The following points raised by the reviewers should be addressed in a revised manuscript and cover letter.</p><p><italic>Reviewer 1</italic> <italic>specific comments:</italic></p><p>1) It would be nice to add a figure to illustrate how Pif1 might remove G4 structures in a cellular context. G4s are most likely to form on the lagging strand template, which is rendered temporarily single stranded during DNA replication. Pif1 might patrol from the 5' end of one Okazaki fragment towards a downstream G4 structure, thereby allowing completion of the next Okazaki fragment whose 3' end will have collided with the G4 from the other side.</p><p>2) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Supplementary figure 3B</xref> requires a no-protein control to show that when Cy3 is placed near the ssDNA-dsDNA junction, protein-induced fluorescence enhancement can be observed. Without this, the absence of periodic increases in Cy3 fluorescence cannot be interpreted as stable binding of Pif1 at the junction.</p><p>3) The experiment in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref> should be repeated with the Cy3 label placed on the 5' end of the oligo, where it is unlikely to interfere with DNA unwinding.</p><p>4) When patrolling on the DD31 and RD31 substrates, Pif1 does not seem to release abruptly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>), in contrast to the behavior on substrates presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1 fig2">Figures 1 and 2</xref>. Can the authors explain this?</p><p>5) It was not entirely clear to me how the experiment in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref> shows that the efficiency of unwinding is 100 %. How does this experiment show unwinding at all?</p><p>6). In the main text (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, bottom), the purpose of the experiment presented in Supplementary Figure 8 was not well explained.</p><p><italic>Reviewer 2</italic> <italic>specific comments:</italic></p><p>1) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1 fig1s2 fig1s3">Supplementary figure 1</xref> is confusing in terms of the presence of ATP. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Supplementary figure 1A</xref> is described in the text as a broadened FRET histogram in the presence of ATP, but the 7.2 nM derived from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1 fig1s2 fig1s3">Supplementary figure 1B</xref> (and used in main <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) is discussed in the paragraph before, suggesting that this value is obtained in the absence of ATP. The authors should be more explicit about the conditions used for the various figures.</p><p>2) The authors determine the equilibrium dissociation constant in the absence of ATP to be 7.2 nM and the dissociation rate to be less than (30 minutes)<sup>-1</sup>. These two values suggest an on-rate constant of 7x10<sup>4</sup> m<sup>-1</sup>s<sup>-1</sup>. The experiments are performed by incubating the DNA constructs for 2 minutes with 10 nM of Pif1. However, these numbers suggest that less than 10 % of the DNA substrates will be bound. This value is inconsistent with <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1 fig3">Figures 1B and 3C</xref> (and other figures), which suggest an occupancy close to 100 %. The authors should explain this issue.</p><p>3) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>, the authors show a histogram of cycle times that they fit with a gamma distribution to obtain the number of steps in each cycle. However, with such large numbers of steps, the gamma distribution becomes very narrow (as the data indeed show) and its width starts to become dominated by the error in determining the cycle time. The authors should provide a rigorous treatment of this error and show that the width of the distribution is truly dominated by the spread in cycling times.</p><p>4) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>, the authors show the cycling time in the presence of a G4 quadruplex. The authors point out that the transition to highFRET values corresponds to the refolding of the quadruplex.

For RNA/DNA Pif1 takes about 2 min at saturating ATP to unwind 31 bp and on DNA/DNA it requires very high Pif1 and much longer times. This is puzzling because Ramanagoudr-Bhojappa 2013 showed that 16 bp DNA/DNA is unwound in 0.3 s, with an overhang of 7T that would bind one Pif1 and the rates of translocation on single stranded DNA are the same as the rates of DNA/DNA unwinding abut 70 base pairs per second.

An underestimation of <italic>n</italic> would result in overestimation of the step size. In our case, the step size estimated by diving 32 nt by 26 steps is 1.2 nt per step, and considering the likelihood of overestimation due to errors, the true step size must be 1 nt.

It was found that the stabilization energy of a Hoogsteen GG base pair was less than that of a GC base pair but is comparable to that of AT base pair (Mashimo et al. 2007 Nucleic Acids Symp Ser (Oxf) (51) 239-240. 2) The lifetime of G-triplex and G-hairpin could be as long as 0.1–1 seconds, according to previous experiments. For example, previous optical tweezers experiments have identified G-triplex as a stable intermediate <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Li et al. 2013</xref> J Am Chem Soc 135(17):6423-6426: when 32 pN was applied to the two ends of a G4 sequence, the lifetimes of the fully folded state and the G-triplex state were 0.54 s and 0.52 s, respectively. Another example is the unwinding of a small DNA hairpin by a protein migrating along the DNA strand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Roy et al. 2009</xref> Nature 461(7267):1092-1097). The small hairpin only consists of 7 bp stem and 3 nt loop and an intermediate state with a lifetime of ∼0.90 sec was observed along the unwinding pathway. Given that GG base pairs have comparable stabilization energy, one would expect a comparably long lifetime for G-hairpins. We have revised the text to clarify this point.</p><p>Reviewer 3 specific comments:</p><p><italic>1) There are discrepancies with reported literature that is not properly addressed in the paper. While the DNA patrolling translocation speeds on dT tails are consistent with recently reported speeds from ensemble studies (Galletto 2013; Ramanagoudr-Bhojappa 2013), the DNA/DNA unwinding rates are in disagreement with the recent report (Ramanagoudr-Bhojappa 2013). For RNA/DNA Pif1 takes about 2 min at saturating ATP to unwind 31 bp and on DNA/DNA it requires very high Pif1 and much longer times.

The authors need to provide an explanation for this discrepancy between their slow rates and published fast rates of unwinding</italic>.</p><p>The discrepancy is most likely due to the difference in assembly state and the way the experiments were performed. In Ramanagoudr-Bhojappa et al., 200 nM Pif1 was pre-incubated with 2 nM DNA before initiating the unwinding reaction by introducing ATP. In contrast, we added 10 or 100 nM Pif1 together with ATP to the DNA-immobilized sample chamber. There are two possible reasons that may lead to the apparent discrepancy: 1) It was not clear how many Pif1 monomers were loaded per DNA molecule in Ramanagoudr-Bhojappa et al., and in fact it is quite likely that more than one Pif1 monomers were loaded per DNA molecule which would lead to efficient unwinding of DNA-DNA duplexes. Under our conditions, we know from the single molecule time traces that at 10 nM Pif1, only one Pif1 monomer is loaded (no unwinding observed) and 100 nM Pif1 results in multiple Pif1 loading per DNA (unwinding observed). 2) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, the rate-limiting step there for unwinding reaction was the second Pif1 monomer binding to DNA. As a result, 100 nM Pif1 took several minutes to unwind DNA-DNA duplexes at 1 mM ATP. However, in Ramanagoudr-Bhojappa et al., which pre-assembled the helicase on the DNA the 0.3 sec did not include the binding time of Pif1 at all. Another possibility is a limited processivity of DNA unwinding by Pif1 oligomer. It may unwind 16 bp rapidly whereas 31 bp may require multiple attempts, hence slower. We added the following sentence to the manuscript: “The dsDNA unwinding speed previously reported was much higher (∼ 0.3 second for unwinding 16 bp dsDNA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Ramanagoudr-Bhojappa et al. 2013</xref>) either because the helicase was preassembled on the DNA before introducing ATP in that study, or due to a limited processivity of dsDNA unwinding by Pif1 oligomer.”</p><p><italic>2) Is the patrolling activity simply a consequence of having a DNA end (end of dT overhang)? Such structures would not be present in the cell raising the question of its physiological relevance</italic>.</p><p>We don’t think so. Pif1’s patrolling activity was observed not only on partial DNA duplexes containing a 3’ DNA overhang but also on gapped DNA substrates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) and Y-shaped DNA substrates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>) that do not have a free ssDNA end. In addition, the partial DNA duplexes containing a 3’ DNA overhang should indeed be present in cells. For example, telomeres and double stranded DNA breaks both contain such a 3’ ssDNA end (see new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref> that we added in response to Reviewer 1). Furthermore, we showed that Pif1 uses its patrolling activity to remove RNA/DNA hybrids (i.e., R-loops) and G4 structures, two physiological relevant structures present in vivo. The presence of R-loops and G4 structures, if not resolved in a timely manner, would result in genome instability including replication pauses, mutations, recombination, chromosomal rearrangements and chromosome loss (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aguilera and Garcia-Muse 2012</xref> Mol Cell 46(2):115-124, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Paeschke et al. 2011</xref> Cell 145(5):678-691, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Paeschke et al., 2013</xref> Nature 497:458-462).</p><p><italic>3) There is a lack of discussion on how this activity obtained under the specific conditions used in this assay would be physiologically relevant.

And secondly, where would such ends be present</italic> <italic>in the genome to initiate Pif's patrolling activity</italic>?</p><p>The presence of a 3'-ss-dsDNA junction is not a prerequisite for Pif1 to start translocation along ssDNA, because Pif1 translocation was detected when such a junction is absent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Galletto and Tomko 2013</xref> Nucleic Acids Res) <sup>8</sup>. 3'-ss-dsDNA junctions are present in many DNA intermediates during replication, transcription and recombination, as well as in telomeres (see new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). Therefore, the patrolling activity we report in this manuscript could take part in many scenarios where the 3’-ss-dsDNA junctions are present.</p></body></sub-article></article>
