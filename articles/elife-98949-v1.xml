occlusion (RAO). The absence of an accurate mouse model for simulating the retinal ischemic process has hindered progress in developing neuroprotective agents for RAO. We developed a unilateral pterygopalatine ophthalmic artery occlusion (UPOAO) mouse model using silicone wire embolization combined with carotid artery ligation. The survival of retinal ganglion cells and visual function were evaluated to determine the duration of ischemia. Immunofluorescence staining, optical coherence tomography, and haematoxylin and eosin staining were utilized to assess changes in major neural cell classes and retinal structure degeneration at two reperfusion durations. Transcriptomics was employed to investigate alterations in the pathological process of UPOAO following ischemia and reperfusion, highlighting transcriptomic differences between UPOAO and other retinal ischemia-reperfusion models. The UPOAO model successfully replicated the acute interruption of retinal blood supply observed in RAO. 60 min of Ischemia led to significant loss of major retinal neural cells and visual function impairment. Notable thinning of the inner retinal layer, especially the ganglion cell layer, was evident post-UPOAO. Temporal transcriptome analysis revealed various pathophysiological processes related to immune cell migration, oxidative stress, and immune inflammation during the non-reperfusion and reperfusion periods. A pronounced increase in microglia within the retina and peripheral leukocytes accessing the retina was observed during reperfusion periods. Comparison of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between the UPOAO and high intraocular pressure models revealed specific enrichments in lipid and steroid metabolism-related genes in the UPOAO model. The UPOAO model emerges as a novel tool for screening pathogenic genes and promoting further therapeutic research in RAO.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>retinal artery occlusion</kwd><kwd>mouse model</kwd><kwd>ischemia</kwd><kwd>reperfusion injury</kwd><kwd>transcriptomics</kwd><kwd>immune cell</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Nature Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>82371079</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Xiao</surname><given-names>Xuan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100012166</institution-id><institution>National Key R&amp;D Program of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2023YFC2308404</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Xiao</surname><given-names>Xuan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100012226</institution-id><institution>Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2042023gf0013</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Xiao</surname><given-names>Xuan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Key research and development project of Hubei Province</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2022BCA009</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Xiao</surname><given-names>Xuan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The UPOAO model effectively replicates retinal ischemia in retinal artery occlusion, providing a novel platform for identifying pathogenic genes and advancing therapeutic research.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>RAO is a severe ophthalmic disease characterized by a sudden interruption of blood flow in the retinal artery, leading to retinal ischemia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Scott et al., 2020</xref>). Over 60% of RAO patients suffer from impaired vision, ranging from finger counting to complete vision loss (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hayreh and Zimmerman, 2005</xref>). Additionally, RAO patients face an increased risk of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Vestergaard et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Fallico et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chen et al., 2023</xref>). Retinal ischemia and hypoxia can lead to irreversible damage to retinal cells within 90 min (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Prasad et al., 2010</xref>). This damage is primarily due to the apoptosis of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs), which is driven by inflammation and oxidative stress. Unfortunately, conservative treatments for RAO, such as ocular massage and hyperbaric oxygen therapy, provide limited therapeutic benefits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Mac Grory et al., 2021</xref>). Although thrombolysis is effective, its application is restricted by a narrow therapeutic window (typically within 4.5 hr <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Raber et al., 2023</xref>). Furthermore, the restoration of blood flow to the ischemic area following thrombolysis can cause a sudden increase in tissue oxidative levels, resulting in ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI) in the retina (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hu et al., 2022</xref>). IRI is a common pathological condition that can induce inflammation, retinal tissue damage, and visual impairment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Wan et al., 2020</xref>). Therefore, it is crucial to develop an animal model that accurately simulates the pathological processes of RAO to thoroughly investigate the pathophysiological changes and explore potential neuroprotective treatments following retinal ischemia and reperfusion.</p><p>Various animal models have been employed to investigate the effects of retinal injury resulting from ischemia and subsequent reperfusion in RAO (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Prasad et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Shabanzadeh et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gao et al., 2020</xref>). Based on the methods used for modeling, retinal ischemia-reperfusion models can be categorized into two groups: (1) intravascular occlusion models, including photochemical-induced thrombosis model and vascular intervention model; and (2) extravascular occlusion models, including central retinal artery ligation (CRAL) model, unilateral common carotid artery occlusion (UCCAO) model, and high intraocular pressure (HIOP) model. The photochemical-induced thrombosis model and vascular intervention model have been reported to be useful tools for assessing retinal injury after ischemia and reperfusion. However, both models are limited by the need for trained interventional radiologists and the need for advanced techniques (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Morén et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Zhang et al., 2005</xref>). The CRAL model, which directly clips or ligates the central retinal artery, also presents drawbacks, such as potential optic nerve damage and difficulty in application to small animals such as mice, limiting its use in experiments with larger sample sizes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Prasad et al., 2010</xref>). The UCCAO model, which induces retinal hypoperfusion by occluding the unilateral common carotid artery (CCA), is more suitable for simulating chronic ischemic retinal disease than acute retinal ischemia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lee et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lee et al., 2022</xref>). The HIOP model is widely utilized in mice for studying ischemia-reperfusion in acute primary angle-closure glaucoma (APACG <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">van Zyl et al., 2020</xref>). However, the mechanical compression of the retina caused by saline injection in this model may also lead to retinal damage, potentially influencing IRI research. Therefore, it is critically important to develop a simple and low-skill-required mouse model that can simulate acute retinal ischemia and reperfusion injury in RAO patients.</p><p>To better simulate the retinal ischemic process and possible IRI following RAO, we developed a novel vascular-associated mouse model called the UPOAO model. In this model, we employed silicone wire embolization and carotid artery ligation to completely block the blood supply to the retina. We characterized the major classes of retinal neural cells and evaluated visual function following different durations of ischemia (30 min and 60 min) and reperfusion (3 days and 7 days) after UPOAO. Additionally, we utilized transcriptomics to investigate the transcriptional changes and elucidate the pathophysiological process of the UPOAO model after ischemia and reperfusion. Finally, we highlighted the transcriptomic differences between this model and other retinal ischemia-reperfusion models, including HIOP and UCCAO, revealing the unique pathological processes that closely resemble retinal IRI in RAO. The UPOAO model offers new insights into the mechanisms and pathways involved in ischemia and reperfusion studies of RAO, providing a foundation for studying protective strategies for ocular ischemic diseases.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Silicone wire embolus insertion interrupts retinal blood flow</title><p>To reproduce the retinal ischemic process and potential IRI in RAO, we established a mouse model of UPOAO by combining silicone wire embolization with carotid artery ligation. Model validation was conducted through a series of experiments, with detailed descriptions provided in the Materials and methods section (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–G</xref>). To confirm blood flow disruption, we performed cardiac perfusion with fluorescently labeled lectin and FFA. Rhodamine-labeled canavalin A was used during in vivo perfusion with silicone wire embolus, and both eyes were evaluated. The sham eye exhibited normal blood perfusion in the retina, while the experimental eye showed no perfusion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H, I</xref>). FFA revealed delayed and limited perfusion in the experimental lateral retina, primarily near the optic disc (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1J and K</xref>). These findings indicate that the insertion of the silicone wire embolus effectively impaired blood flow to the retina.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Modeling procedure, validation, and cervical artery anatomy.</title><p>(<bold>A1–G1</bold>) Schematic illustration of unilateral pterygopalatine ophthalmic artery occlusion (UPOAO).

Retinal structure and visual function were assessed through flat-mounted retina analysis and flash ERG.</p><p>In the 30 min ischemia group, no significant RGCs death was observed after 3 days (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A and B</xref>) or 7 days of reperfusion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C and D</xref>). However, after 60 minutes of ischemia followed by either 3 days or 7 days of reperfusion, reductions in RGCs density were evident (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E–H</xref>). ERG results showed no statistical difference in amplitudes between bilateral eyes after 3- and 7 days of 30 min reperfusion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A–C</xref>). However, the b-wave amplitude notably decreased after 60 min of ischemia and 3 days of reperfusion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). By 7 days of reperfusion, the b-wave amplitude had halved compared to that of the sham eyes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>).

RNA-seq analysis of retinas subjected to 60 min of ischemia followed by 7 days of reperfusion in the HIOP model revealed enrichment of immune-related pathways, specifically highlighting increased activity in leukocyte-mediated immunity and regulation of immune effector processes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>). This finding was consistent with the results of GO analysis, which revealed associations of the overlapping DEGs between the HIOP and UPOAO models with toll-like receptor binding, T-cell receptor binding, and immune-related functions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C and D</xref>). To further explore these DEGs, we explored the remaining DEGs in the HIOP model in addition to the overlapping genes. GO analysis revealed that the remaining DEGs in the HIOP model were also enriched in immune responses, such as the T-cell receptor complex pathway, adaptive immune response, and B-cell-mediated immunity function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8E</xref>). Remarkably, upon examining the remaining DEGs specific to the UPOAO model, GO analysis revealed DEGs distinctly related to lipid and steroid metabolic processes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8F and G</xref>). This observation indicates that the UPOAO model, which is closely related to RAO, involves not only conventional immune responses but also unique regulation of lipid and steroid metabolism.</p><fig id="fig8" position="float"><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Transcriptomic results comparison between unilateral pterygopalatine ophthalmic artery occlusion (UPOAO), high intraocular pressure (HIOP), and unilateral common carotid artery occlusion (UCCAO) models.</title><p>RNA-seq comparison between UPOAO and extravascular occlusion models: HIOP and UCCAO.

We combined silicone wire embolization with carotid artery ligation to effectively block the blood supply to the retinal artery, closely mimicking the characteristics of the acute interruption of blood supply in RAO patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Biousse et al., 2018</xref>). In the UPOAO model, a 60 min ischemia period was sufficient to simulate the injury of major retinal neural cells, such as RGCs, BCs, HCs, and cholinergic amacrine cells, resulting in visual impairment. Moreover, histologic examination demonstrated thinning of the inner layer of the retina, especially the GCL. Time course transcriptome analysis revealed various pathophysiological processes related to immune cell migration, oxidative stress, and immune inflammation during non-reperfusion and reperfusion periods. The resident microglia within the retina and peripheral leukocytes that access the retina were markedly increased during reperfusion periods. Additionally, we compared the transcriptomic signatures of the UPOAO model with those of two commonly used ischemia-reperfusion mouse models (HIOP and UCCAO), highlighting the potential relevance of the UPOAO model to ocular vascular occlusive diseases.</p><p>The UPOAO mouse model effectively simulates the characteristic features of RAO observed in patients. RAO patients often exhibit distinctive patterns in dark-adapted ERGs, where b-waves are reduced while a-waves remain stable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Block and Schwarz, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lima et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Suzuki et al., 2014</xref>). In our study, we observed almost the same phenomenon in ERG amplitude after 60 min of ischemia in the UPOAO model (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). This observation was further confirmed by immunofluorescence staining of bipolar cells and photoreceptor cells. Importantly, a previous study linked the thinning of the inner retina with alterations in ERG in patients with RAO (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Shinoda et al., 2008</xref>). Our results showed that ischemic damage predominantly affected the inner retinal layers, while the outer layer was almost unaffected (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). This distinction is attributed to the reliance of the inner layers on the retinal artery for blood supply, whereas the outer layers are supplied by the choroid. Additionally, histological examination revealed increased retinal NFL and GCL thickness and decreased IPL thickness after 3 days of reperfusion, indicating that ischemia-induced oedema had not completely subsided.</p><p>This study comprehensively explored the transcriptomic signature after ischemia and revealed that resident and peripheral immune cells may play major roles in pathological processes. In the non-reperfusion group, the transcriptional changes were primarily involved in the migration of immune cells such as leukocytes and neutrophils from blood vessels into ischemic retinal tissue. This process is closely linked to injury during ischemia and reperfusion, where leukocytes and neutrophils infiltrate neural tissue through the vascular endothelium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Szabo et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Szabo, 1992</xref>). Our results revealed an increase in CD45<sup>+</sup> leukocytes in the retina and retinal microvasculature, suggesting that these leukocytes were recruited from the bloodstream to the damaged retinal tissue following reperfusion. During leukocyte access to the retina, chemokines, chemokine receptors, adhesion molecules, and cytoskeletal components play important roles in regulating endothelial permeability and facilitating leukocyte adhesion to endothelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Johnson-Léger et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Springer, 1994</xref>). Our findings of related gene expression are consistent with this mechanism.</p><p>During the 3 days reperfusion period, we observed that an increased number of DEGs were significantly involved in the critical pathological response to oxidative stress in the context of IR tissues. The generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in mitochondria and subsequent oxidative stress are widely recognized as major causes of retinal cell damage induced by IR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Oharazawa et al., 2010</xref>). This finding suggested that mitochondrial function, which is involved in oxidative stress processes, may play an important role in the pathophysiology of IRI during the early reperfusion stage. Oxidative stress can influence the permeability of the inner blood-retina barrier (iBRB), allowing leukocytes to access retinal tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kaur et al., 2008</xref>). The infiltration and activation of immune cells are recognized as the underlying causes of many retinal diseases, including ischemic ophthalmia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kaur et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Eltzschig and Collard, 2004</xref>). In the UPOAO model, the increase in CD45<sup>+</sup> leukocytes and Iba1<sup>+</sup> microglia in the retina after 3 days of reperfusion supports this viewpoint.</p><p>In the later stage of reperfusion (7 days), the DEGs were mainly enriched in immune regulation and inflammation. With more upregulated DEGs than downregulated ones, we hypothesize that the activation of the immune inflammatory response contributes to further IRI in retinal tissue. Previous studies have shown that the retina can elicit immunological responses during ischemia-reperfusion injury and that immune inflammation is an important phenomenon in the progression of this injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Minhas et al., 2016</xref>). The excessive ROS generated by mitochondria in RGCs during the activation of inflammatory responses can damage cell structure and visual function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Sanderson et al., 2013</xref>). Microglia, considered the primary resident immune cells, contribute to inflammatory responses and consequent neural damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abcouwer et al., 2021</xref>). Infiltrating leukocytes can activate resident microglia, forming a feedback loop that exacerbates inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Au and Ma, 2022</xref>). Complex interactions between immune cells and retinal neurons after RIRI have been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Qin et al., 2022</xref>). Interestingly, in our UPOAO model, the death of major retinal neural cells, such as RGCs, BCs, and HCs, was correlated with an increase in infiltrating leukocytes and resident microglia. Therefore, we considered that the immune response and neuroinflammation observed after 7 days of reperfusion may result from the cumulative effects of acute oxidative stress and the responses of resident and peripheral immune cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). In summary, we described the pathological processes at different time points and highlighted the important role of resident and peripheral immune cell responses in the UPOAO model. This finding offers valuable insights for subsequent screening of pathogenic genes and potential immunotherapy approaches.</p><fig id="fig9" position="float"><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><title>The characteristic features of unilateral pterygopalatine ophthalmic artery occlusion (UPOAO) model during ischemia-reperfusion periods.</title></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-98949-fig9-v1.tif"/></fig><p>Compared with the HIOP and UCCAO models, the UPOAO model is a more appropriate choice for studying retinal IRI in RAO. The HIOP model, widely used for investigating the pathogenesis of APACG, exhibits retinal degeneration features similar to those of the UPOAO model during both reperfusion periods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Yao et al., 2023</xref>). In our UPOAO model, histologic and immunohistochemical analysis demonstrated that 60 min of ischemia followed by 3 days or 7 days of reperfusion can cause irreversible damage to the retinal structure and visual function. Specifically, we observed distinct alterations, such as thinning of the inner retina, substantial RGCs apoptosis, and decreased b-wave amplitude. Multiple studies on the HIOP model have reported consistent results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abcouwer et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Zeng et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Yang et al., 2020</xref>). However, some typical phenotypes in the HIOP model, such as thinning of the outer nuclear layer and the entire neuroretina and decreased a-wave amplitude, were not observed in the UPOAO model. Moreover, our transcriptome sequencing revealed a specific subset of DEGs unique to the UPOAO model, including <italic>Apoe</italic>, <italic>Abca1</italic>, <italic>Ldlr</italic>, <italic>Cyp39a1</italic>, and <italic>Bmp6</italic>. Notably, these DEGs were significantly enriched in pathways associated with lipid and steroid synthesis. Steroid and lipid metabolism homeostasis is disrupted under conditions of oxidative stress and inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Lam et al., 2016</xref>). In the UPOAO model, the observed lipid and steroid biological processes may result from the cumulative pathological responses triggered by IRI, as observed in the HIOP model. In the UCCAO model, RNA-seq revealed that DEGs were enriched in two main pathways: (1) epigenetic modification-related pathways, including nucleobase-containing compound catabolic process, RNA catabolic process, mRNA catabolic process and N6-methyladenosine (m6A) modification; and (2) cell death pathways, including regulation of autophagosome assembly, negative regulation of neuron death, and negative regulation of the neuronal apoptotic process. Epigenetic mechanisms may play a key role in the pathophysiology of ocular disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">He et al., 2013</xref>). m6A, one of the most common RNA modifications, has been reported to regulate cell death processes, including apoptosis and autophagy, in the pathological process of IRI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Wang et al., 2022</xref>). These results suggest that epigenetic mechanisms may significantly influence cell death during the 7 days reperfusion period in the UCCAO model. Lee et al. evaluated the characteristics of UCCAO without reperfusion using visual, histological, and immunohistochemical approaches. Their results revealed delayed perfusion of the ipsilateral retina, thinning of the inner retinal layer 10 weeks after surgery, and a dramatic decrease in the amplitudes of b-waves on day 14 after UCCAO (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Lee et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Lee et al., 2021</xref>). This finding suggested that UCCAO primarily represents a model of retinal hypoperfusion injury and may not effectively reflect acute ischemic-induced structural and functional damage in RAO (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). These results led us to consider the UPOAO model an effective experimental model for studying the pathological processes underlying acute ischemia and IRI.</p><p>Our research has certain limitations that should be acknowledged. First, our study focused on the changes that occurred within 60 min of ischemia and within the first 7 days of reperfusion in the UPOAO model. Further exploration is needed to understand the changes induced by longer reperfusion periods. Additionally, we proposed possible pathological mechanisms, including iBRB damage, oxidative stress, and immune inflammation, mainly based on the enrichment results of DEGs at three reperfusion time points. More molecular experimental validation is required to substantiate these proposed mechanisms.</p><p>In summary, by thoroughly exploring the injury to major retinal neural cells, visual impairment, and pathophysiological changes in the UPOAO model, we confirmed that this model can effectively simulate the acute ischemia-reperfusion processes in RAO. It serves as an ideal mouse model for investigating the underlying pathological mechanisms of ischemia and reperfusion. Furthermore, our UPOAO model holds great promise as a novel model for studies on pathogenic genes and potential therapeutic interventions for RAO.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals</title><p>Eight-week-old male C57BL/6 mice were used in the experiments.

The mouse was gently positioned in a supine posture on a heating blanket, and its neck was exposed. The preparation involved depilation of the neck area, followed by skin disinfection, and finally, a midline incision along the neck was made. After separating the neck gland using two tweezers, careful blunt dissection was employed to separate the left CCA, internal carotid artery (ICA), and external carotid artery (ECA), avoiding the compression of nearby nerves and veins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>). Then, the CCA and ICA were ligated with a 6–0 suture. A knot was secured using a 6–0 suture at the distal end of the ECA, and a slipknot was created at the proximal end (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). To preserve the reperfusion process and avoid bleeding and mortality during surgery, a silicone wire embolus was inserted through the ECA instead of through the CCA. Ophthalmic scissors were used to make a small inverted ‘V’-shaped incision between the two suture knots on the ECA. A specialized silicone wire embolus, measuring 7±0.1 mm in length and 0.21±0.1 mm in diameter, was inserted through the incision, directing it into the ECA and further into the CCA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>).

After blunt dissection, the left CCA was ligated with a 6–0 suture. After 60 min of ligation, the suture was removed, and the skin wound was subsequently closed with sutures. Mice were routinely fed during the reperfusion period, and the retinas of UCCAO mice were harvested 7 days post-surgery.</p><p>The HIOP model was generated based on previously established methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chen et al., 2003</xref>). Briefly, mice were anaesthetized by intraperitoneal injection of 1% sodium pentobarbital. Pupils were dilated using tropicamide phenylephrine eye drops (0.5% tropicamide and 0.5% deoxyadrenaline hydrochloride, Santen Pharmaceutical) applied 5 min in advance. An insulin hypodermic needle attached to a silicone elastomer tube was inserted into the anterior chamber of the unilateral experimental eye. The IOP was elevated for 60 min by raising the height of the saline solution storage bag to 162 cm, after which the needle was removed to immediately restore the IOP to baseline levels. Iris whitening and loss of retinal red-light reflexes indicated retinal ischemia. After surgery, levofloxacin hydrochloride ophthalmic gel was applied to the eyes of the mice. Retinas from HIOP mice were collected 7 days post-surgery.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Transcriptome sequence and analysis</title><p>Retinal samples from UPOAO, HIOP, and UCCAO mice were extracted and promptly frozen in liquid nitrogen within 10 min of cervical dislocation. Total RNA extraction was performed according to the protocol outlined in the TRIzol Reagent manual (Life Technologies, CA, USA). RNA integrity and concentration were assessed using an Agilent 2,100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, Inc, Santa Clara, CA, USA). The resulting RNA samples were then pooled and subjected to sequencing on the Illumina HiSeq3000 platform in a 150 bp paired-end read format. The raw RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) reads were preprocessed and quantified using the featureCounts function in the SubReads package version 1.5.3, with default parameters.</p><p>RNA-seq analysis was conducted on samples from five mice in the non-perfusion group, four mice in the 3 days perfusion group, and five mice in the 7 days perfusion group of the UPOAO model. Additionally, retinas from both the 7 days HIOP experimental eyes and bilateral UCCAO eyes were collected (n=5) for analysis.</p><p>Data normalization and subsequent processing utilized the 'limma' package in R software (version 4.2.3; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Ritchie et al., 2015</xref>).

Enrichment analysis focused on DEGs with an adjusted p&lt;0.05 and an enriched gene count &gt;5. To visualize the expression patterns of significant DEGs, a heatmap was generated using the ‘pheatmap’ package. Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) was conducted using the GSEA program (version 4.3.2) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Subramanian et al., 2005</xref>, employing the default gene set m-subset (mh.all.v2023.1.mm.symbols.gmt) to explore significant functional and pathway differences. Enriched pathways were classified based on criteria such as adjusted p-value (&lt;0.05), false discovery rate (FDR) q value (&lt;0.25), and normalized enrichment score (|NES|&gt;1). Furthermore, (PPI) analysis was performed using the Search Tool for the Retrieval of Interacting Genes (STRING) database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://string-db.org/">https://string-db.org/</ext-link>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Szklarczyk et al., 2019</xref>).

Furthermore, the authors compared transcriptomic differences between the UPOAO model and other retinal ischemic-reperfusion models, including HIOP and UCCAO, and revealed unique pathological processes.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>The UPOAO model represents a novel approach for studying retinal artery occlusion. The study is very comprehensive.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your positive feedback.

For mice retina, the thickness of the IPL is approximately 50 µm.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your meticulous review of the manuscript. We have rectified the inaccuracies in the quantification of retinal layer thickness in HE-stained sections in Figure 4, addressing the initial issue with the scale bar.</p><p>We consulted with a microscope engineer and used a microscope microscale to calibrate the scale of the fluorescence microscope (BX63; Olympus, Tokyo, Japan) at the suggestion of the engineer.</p><p>We recount the thickness of all layers of the HE-stained retinal section (line 902). The inner retina thickness in Figure 4 has been adjusted under a new scale bar, and the thickness of the outer retinal layers is now displayed in</p><p>Author response image 1. However, the IPL thickness of the sham eye in the UPOAO model is still not aligned with the common thickness of 50 µm. Therefore we review the literature within our laboratory, focusing on C57BL/6 mice from the same source, revealed that the inner retina thickness (GCC+INL) in the HE-stained sections of the sham eye in the UPOAO model (around 80 µm) is consistent with previous findings (see Author response image 2) conducted by Kaibao Ji and published in <italic>Experimental Eye Research</italic> in 2021 [1].</p><p>We captured and analyzed the average retinal thickness of each layer over a long range of 200-1100 μm from the optic nerve head (see Author response image 3, highlighted by the green line). The field region has been corrected in the revised manuscript (line 232). Considering the significant variation in retinal thickness from the optic nerve to the periphery, we consulted literature on multi-point measurements of HE-stained retinas. The average thickness of the GCC layer in the control group was approximately 57 µm at 600 µm from the optic nerve head and about 48 µm at 1200 µm from the optic nerve head in the literature [2] (see Author response image 4). The GCC layer thickness of the sham eye in the UPOAO model is around 50 µm, in alignment with existing literature. In future studies, we will pay more attention to the issue of thickness averaging.</p><p>We appreciate your thorough review and valuable feedback, which has enabled us to correct errors and enhance the accuracy of our research.</p><fig id="sa3fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Thickness of OPL, ONL, IS/OS+RPE in HE staining.</title><p>n=3; ns: no significance (p&gt;0.05).</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-98949-sa3-fig1-v1.tif"/></fig><fig id="sa3fig2" position="float"><label>Author response image 2.</label><caption><title>Cited from Ji, K., et al., Resveratrol attenuates retinal ganglion cell loss in a mouse model of retinal ischemia reperfusion injury via multiple pathways.</title><p>Experimental Eye Research, 2021. 209: p. 108683.</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-98949-sa3-fig2-v1.tif"/></fig><fig id="sa3fig3" position="float"><label>Author response image 3.</label><caption><title>Schematic diagram illustrating the selection of regions.</title><p>The figure was captured using a fluorescence microscope (BX63; Olympus, Tokyo, Japan) under a 4X objective.
