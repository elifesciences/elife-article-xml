suppress food intake, including avoidance-promoting neurons that express <italic>Cck</italic> (NTS<sup>Cck</sup> cells) and distinct <italic>Lepr</italic>- and <italic>Calcr</italic>-expressing neurons (NTS<sup>Lepr</sup> and NTS<sup>Calcr</sup> cells, respectively) that suppress food intake without promoting avoidance. To test potential synergies among these cell groups, we manipulated multiple NTS cell populations simultaneously. We found that activating multiple sets of NTS neurons (e.g. NTS<sup>Lepr</sup> plus NTS<sup>Calcr</sup> [NTS<sup>LC</sup>], or NTS<sup>LC</sup> plus NTS<sup>Cck</sup> [NTS<sup>LCK</sup>]) suppressed feeding more robustly than activating single populations. While activating groups of cells that include NTS<sup>Cck</sup> neurons promoted conditioned taste avoidance (CTA), NTS<sup>LC</sup> activation produced no CTA despite abrogating feeding. Thus, the ability to promote CTA formation represents a dominant effect but activating multiple non-aversive populations augments the suppression of food intake without provoking avoidance. Furthermore, silencing multiple NTS neuron groups augmented food intake and body weight to a greater extent than silencing single populations, consistent with the notion that each of these NTS neuron populations plays crucial and cumulative roles in the control of energy balance. We found that silencing NTS<sup>LCK</sup> neurons failed to blunt the weight-loss response to vertical sleeve gastrectomy (VSG) and that feeding activated many non-NTS<sup>LCK</sup> neurons, however, suggesting that as-yet undefined NTS cell types must make additional contributions to the restraint of feeding.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>obesity</kwd><kwd>leptin receptor</kwd><kwd>calcitonin receptor</kwd><kwd>brainstem</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000062</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P01 DK117821</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sandoval</surname><given-names>Darleen</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000062</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P30 DK020572</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Myers</surname><given-names>Martin G</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Analyses reveal that multiple NTS neuron types act cumulatively in the suppression of feeding, that the abrogation of food intake by multiple non-aversive populations fails to promote aversive responses, and that there exist additional NTS populations that modulate food intake.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The ongoing obesity pandemic represents an enormous challenge to human health and longevity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2022</xref>). Identifying new therapeutic targets to better combat obesity will require understanding the physiologic systems that modulate feeding and contribute to body weight maintenance. While hypothalamic circuits contribute to the control of feeding and play important roles in maintaining long-term energy balance, many hypothalamic circuits act via the brainstem to suppress food intake (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cheng et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Grill, 2014</xref>). Furthermore, the brainstem receives feeding-related and other information from the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, controls the rhythmic pattern generators that mediate feeding, and can overcome hypothalamically-driven hyperphagia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cheng et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cheng et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>Many of the most important food intake-controlling brainstem systems lie in the dorsal vagal complex (DVC), which includes the area postrema (AP), the <italic>nucleus tractus solitarius</italic> (NTS), and the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus (DMV; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cheng et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Grill, 2014</xref>). The AP lies outside of the blood-brain barrier and receives circulating signals relevant to feeding, including from several anorexigenic peptides. The NTS, which lies adjacent to and receives input from the AP, also receives input from GI-innervating vagal sensory neurons. Both the AP and NTS project ventrally to the DMV to control GI motility and other physiological functions, in addition to innervating more rostral brain regions to modulate food intake.</p><p>Many of these brainstem circuits express receptors for peptides that suppress food intake, including the glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (GLP1R); the calcitonin receptor (CALCR) and the related amylin receptor (AmyR- a complex of CALCR and a receptor activity modifying protein [RAMP]); and the leptin receptor (LepRb) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cheng et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Ludwig et al., 2021a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cheng et al., 2020a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Zhang et al., 2021</xref>). Thus, many of these DVC cell types may contribute to the suppression of feeding by a variety of gut peptide mimetics currently under development or in use for weight loss therapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cheng et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p>Recent work from others and us has demonstrated that the AP and NTS neuron types that suppress food intake while mediating avoidance responses associated with gut malaise are distinct from neuron types that promote the non-aversive suppression of food intake (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cheng et al., 2020a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Zhang et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Roman et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Palmiter, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Campos et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cheng et al., 2020b</xref>). Cell types that suppress food intake without causing avoidance include NTS neurons that express <italic>Lepr</italic> (NTS<sup>Lepr</sup> cells) or <italic>Calcr</italic> (NTS<sup>Calcr</sup> cells); in contrast, <italic>Cck</italic>-expressing NTS neurons (NTS<sup>Cck</sup> cells) promote avoidance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cheng et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cheng et al., 2020a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cheng et al., 2020b</xref>). Each of these cell types represent excitatory (glutamatergic) neurons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Ludwig et al., 2021a</xref>; these neurons also contain the neuropeptides glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1; NTS<sup>Lepr</sup> neurons), prolactin releasing peptide (PrRP; NTS<sup>Calcr</sup> neurons), and cholecystokinin (CCK; NTS<sup>Cck</sup> neurons) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cheng et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Ludwig et al., 2021a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Huo et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cheng et al., 2020b</xref>).</p><p>Bariatric surgeries, including vertical sleeve gastrectomy (VSG), decrease meal size and overall food intake to promote dramatic weight loss in many patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Peterli et al., 2018</xref>), as well as in animal models of VSG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Stefater et al., 2010</xref>). The irreversibility and side effects of the procedure, together with the inability to perform enough surgeries to treat the number of patients in need, prevents the use of this intervention at a population scale, however (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Altieri et al., 2021</xref>). Hence, we must understand the mechanisms by which VSG mediates its effects to help identify therapeutic targets with which to medically mimic its actions.</p><p>Hypothesizing that the effects of distinct NTS neuron types are cumulative, we simultaneously manipulated (activation or silencing) multiple NTS cell types to determine their roles in energy balance and the response to VSG.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Augmentation of food intake suppression by coordinated activation of NTS<sup>Lepr</sup> and NTS<sup>Calcr</sup> neurons</title><p>We have previously shown that NTS<sup>Lepr</sup> and NTS<sup>Calcr</sup> cells represent distinct populations of NTS neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Ludwig et al., 2021a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cheng et al., 2020a</xref>), and that the activation of either population mediates the non-aversive suppression of food intake (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cheng et al., 2020a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cheng et al., 2020b</xref>). To determine the relative ability of each of these cell types to mediate the suppression of food intake and to determine whether they might play cumulative roles in the suppression of feeding, we injected an adeno-associated virus (AAV) to cre-dependently express the activating (hM3Dq) designer receptor exclusively activated by designer drugs (DREADD; AAV<sup>FLEX-hM3Dq</sup> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Sternson and Roth, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Zhu and Roth, 2014</xref>) into the NTS of <italic>Lepr<sup>Cre</sup></italic>, <italic>Calcr<sup>Cre</sup></italic>, or dual <italic>Lepr<sup>Cre</sup>;Calcr<sup>Cre</sup></italic> mice (producing Lepr<sup>Dq</sup>, Calcr<sup>Dq</sup>, and LC<sup>Dq</sup> mice, respectively). We then examined the effects of CNO-mediated hM3Dq activation on food intake and related parameters in these mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). As expected, CNO treatment promoted FOS-immunoreactivity (-IR) in the NTS of Lepr<sup>Dq</sup>, Calcr<sup>Dq</sup> and LC<sup>Dq</sup> mice, with the LC<sup>Dq</sup> mice displaying increased FOS-IR compared to animals in which we had transduced only one population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Additive suppression of food intake with combined activation of NTS<sup>Calcr</sup> and NTS<sup>Lepr</sup> neurons.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Representative images showing mCherry-IR (hM3Dq, red) and FOS-IR (green) in the NTS (approximately Bregma –7.56 mm) of Lepr<sup>Dq</sup>, Calcr<sup>Dq</sup> and LC<sup>Dq</sup> mice following treatment with saline (Lepr<sup>Dq</sup> VEH) or CNO (Lepr<sup>Dq</sup> CNO, Calcr<sup>Dq</sup> CNO and LC<sup>Dq</sup> CNO IP, 1 mg/kg) for 2 hr before perfusion.

The same was true for mice fed high-fat diet (HFD) at the onset at the dark cycle, although the activation of NTS<sup>Lepr</sup> neurons tended to suppress feeding less than NTS<sup>Calcr</sup> and NTS<sup>LC</sup> neurons at the 4 hr time point in this assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Following an overnight fast, the activation of NTS<sup>Lepr</sup> neurons significantly decreased refeeding over 6 hr; the activation of NTS<sup>Calcr</sup> cells alone decreased refeeding further than NTS<sup>Lepr</sup> neurons, and the activation of NTS<sup>LC</sup> neurons decreased refeeding even further- by approximately 90% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>).</p><p>Similarly, activating NTS<sup>Lepr</sup> neurons decreased feeding and body weight over a two-day treatment, activating NTS<sup>Calcr</sup> neurons suppressed these parameters more effectively, and activating both cell types in LC<sup>Dq</sup> mice reduced feeding by &gt;90% for the first 24 hr and continued to reduce food intake compared to the individual cell types during the second 24 hr of the experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E and F</xref>). While we had intended to continue treatment for another day, we discontinued CNO treatment after 48 hr because of animal welfare concerns due to the amount of weight loss exhibited by the LC<sup>Dq</sup> mice. Hence, NTS<sup>Calcr</sup> neurons suppress feeding more robustly than NTS<sup>Lepr</sup> neurons, and NTS<sup>Calcr</sup> and NTS<sup>Lepr</sup> neurons suppress feeding cumulatively.</p><p>To determine whether the dramatic decrease in feeding promoted by NTS<sup>LC</sup> neuron activation provoked avoidance responses, we examined whether CNO treatment in LC<sup>Dq</sup> mice would provoke a CTA. We found that, although the gut malaise associated with LiCl injection promoted a robust CTA to either the novel exposure to HFD or saccharine in drinking water, NTS<sup>LC</sup> activation failed to provoke such a response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G and H</xref>). Thus, the coordinated activation of two non-aversive cell types (NTS<sup>Lepr</sup> and NTS<sup>Calcr</sup> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cheng et al., 2020a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cheng et al., 2020b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gaykema et al., 2017</xref>) fails to promote a CTA despite almost abolishing food intake.</p><p>We also expressed the inhibitory (hM4Di) DREADD in NTS<sup>LC</sup> cells to examine the effect of acutely inhibiting these cells on short-term food intake (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). While CNO failed to significantly increase food intake during the first four hours of the dark cycle, stimulating hM4Di in NTS<sup>LC</sup> cells increased food intake during refeeding with chow or HFD following an overnight fast.

In contrast, the activation of NTS<sup>Cck</sup> cells alone or in combination with the other cell types provoked FOS/CGRP colocalization, consistent with the avoidance response provoked by any stimulus that includes the activation of NTS<sup>Cck</sup> cells. CNO treatment in LCK<sup>Dq</sup> mice provoked increased PBN FOS-IR compared to LC<sup>Dq</sup> mice, suggesting the existence of substantial numbers of distinct PBN targets for NTS<sup>Cck</sup> compared to NTS<sup>LC</sup> neurons. The activation of DMH FOS-IR similarly increased with the stimulation of additional NTS cell types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). Together, these findings suggest that each NTS population targets at least partially distinct downstream neurons in several brain regions. Thus, the activation of additional downstream targets by the stimulation of more populations of NTS neurons likely underlies the cumulative effects of activating multiple NTS cell types.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Evidence for the presence of additional NTS cell types that may mediate additional cumulative effects on food intake</title><p>Given the dramatic effects on food intake and body weight observed upon silencing NTS<sup>LCK</sup> cells, we decided to test the requirement for the combined function of these cells for the weight loss response to VSG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>). While, as expected, HFD-fed LCK<sup>TetTox</sup> mice weighed more than HFD-fed control animals at the time of surgery, VSG promoted more body and fat mass loss in these animals than in controls. Food intake was decreased by VSG in LCK<sup>TetTox</sup> animals, although it remained higher than for control mice that had received VSG, presumably reflecting the increased food intake of these mice at baseline. Thus, VSG normalized body weight and fat mass in LCK<sup>TetTox</sup> mice and promoted similar improvements in indices of glucose homeostasis in LCK<sup>TetTox</sup> and control mice. These findings suggest that, despite the important roles for these cells in the physiologic restraint of feeding and body weight, neurons other than NTS<sup>LCK</sup> cells must mediate the response to VSG.</p><p>To determine whether additional (non-LCK) NTS neurons might contribute to the refeeding response in control animals and/or in mice subjected to VSG, we quantified the FOS response to refeeding in control or VSG animals expressing reporter fluorophores in NTS<sup>LCK</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3</xref>). This analysis revealed that NTS<sup>LCK</sup> cells represent approximately 20% of feeding-activated NTS neurons in control mice, and approximately 35% of such neurons following VSG. Thus, in addition to neurons in the AP, hypothalamus, and elsewhere, feeding stimulates non-LCK neurons in the NTS and these feeding-activated non-LCK cells presumably contribute to food intake suppression and body weight control.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Our findings reveal that distinct groups of food intake-inhibiting NTS neurons act cumulatively to suppress food intake under physiologic feeding as well as during artificial activation. We also show that the enhanced suppression of food intake mediated by the activation of multiple populations of individually non-aversive NTS neurons does not promote avoidance responses irrespective of the strength of food intake suppression, consistent with the notion that the pathways that promote the non-aversive suppression of food intake are distinct from those that promote avoidance responses. Finally, although NTS<sup>Lepr</sup>, NTS<sup>Calcr</sup>, and NTS<sup>Cck</sup> neurons individually and coordinately restrain body weight gain during HFD feeding but these cells are dispensable for weight loss in response to VSG and feeding activates additional NTS cell types, suggesting roles for additional neuron types (including within the NTS) in feeding suppression.</p><p><italic>Calcr</italic> and <italic>Lepr</italic> expression do not colocalize in the same NTS neurons and unbiased clustering methods reveal that NTS<sup>Calcr</sup> and NTS<sup>Lepr</sup> neurons map to distinct populations of NTS neurons in mice (NTS<sup>Calcr</sup> neurons map to GLU11, while NTS<sup>Lepr</sup> neurons map mainly to GLU13 and GLU2; GLU13 controls feeding) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Ludwig et al., 2021a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cheng et al., 2020a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cheng et al., 2020b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gaykema et al., 2017</xref>). Each of these populations strongly suppresses food intake but fails to promote a CTA when activated, suggesting that these NTS cells activate pathways that blunt feeding without engaging distinct avoidance pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cheng et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cheng et al., 2020a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cheng et al., 2020b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gaykema et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Tsang et al., 2020</xref>). Our finding that the combined activation of these two cell types reduces feeding by &gt;90% over the first 24 hr of treatment, but fails to promote a CTA, further reinforces the notion that brainstem pathways need not provoke aversive responses to suppress food intake.</p><p>The magnitude of the anorexia that accompanies the combined activation of NTS<sup>Calcr</sup> and NTS<sup>Lepr</sup> cells relative to the response to the activation of a single population also reveals that distinct populations of food intake-suppressing NTS neurons can act cumulatively to suppress feeding more effectively. Similarly, while the silencing of either of these populations can increase physiologic food intake and body weight in HFD-fed animals, silencing multiple populations provokes greater feeding and body weight gain. Hence, the effects of the various sets of food intake-suppressing NTS neurons must augment each other to suppress physiologic feeding, at least under HFD-fed conditions.</p><p>Examining the accumulation of FOS-IR in the AP, NTS and known projection targets of the NTS (PBN and DMH) demonstrates the cumulative activation of downstream neurons following the stimulation of multiple NTS neuron populations. Indeed, the distribution of evoked FOS-IR varies somewhat between NTS cell types; unlike NTS<sup>Calcr</sup> and NTS<sup>Cck</sup> cells, NTS<sup>Lepr</sup> neurons poorly activate AP cells, while NTS<sup>Cck</sup> cells (but not NTS<sup>Calcr</sup> and/or NTS<sup>Lepr</sup> cells) activate PBN CGRP neurons. These findings thus suggest that each NTS neuron population activates an at least partially distinct set of downstream neurons compared to the other NTS populations that we have examined in this study.</p><p>The finding that silencing NTS<sup>Calcr</sup>, NTS<sup>Lepr</sup>, and NTS<sup>Cck</sup> cells increases food intake and body weight in HFD-fed animals, but barely (if at all) alters these parameters in chow-fed animals indicates the importance of these cells for the restraint of food intake specifically during the consumption of palatable calorically dense food. This might indicate that these NTS cell types play more prominent roles in the nutrient- (rather than volume/gut stretch) based suppression of feeding; alternatively, it might indicate that NTS neurons such as these play a stronger role in limiting hedonic overeating than in the restraint of physiologic need-based feeding. Disentangling these possibilities will require a substantial amount of future work.</p><p>Despite the prominent roles that NTS<sup>Calcr</sup>, NTS<sup>Lepr</sup>, and/or NTS<sup>Cck</sup> cells plays in the suppression of food intake and body weight in HFD-fed animals, silencing these NTS neurons failed to blunt the VSG-mediated decrease in food intake and body weight. Thus, other neural systems must mediate most of the weight-loss response to VSG. While the neurons that mediate this response to VSG might lie outside of the NTS (e.g. in the AP and/or hypothalamus), the finding that feeding (and feeding in the context of VSG) activate many non-LCK NTS neurons suggests that additional NTS populations restrain food intake and may play roles in the control of feeding.</p><p>Although many sets of NTS neurons have been implicated in the suppression of feeding, only recently have single cell RNA sequencing methods been employed to define populations of NTS neurons in an unbiased manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cheng et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Ludwig et al., 2021a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dowsett et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Ludwig et al., 2021b</xref>).

Some NTS<sup>Cck</sup> neurons may map to bioinformatically defined cell populations that mediate responses other than the suppression of food intake.</p><p>Furthermore, <italic>Calcr</italic> and <italic>Lepr</italic> do not mark all neurons within their bioinformatically-defined populations (GLU11 and GLU13, respectively); the other neurons within these populations presumably mediate similar functions but are not altered by <italic>Calcr</italic>- or <italic>Lepr</italic>-directed manipulations, respectively.</p><p>Hence several sets of non-NTS<sup>LCK</sup> cells might contribute to the ongoing control of food intake in mice where the NTS<sup>LCK</sup> cells are silenced. These could include: the remaining unperturbed neurons from GLU11 and/or GLU13; the presumably aversive NTS neuron population marked by <italic>Cck</italic> expression; and other populations of NTS neurons that mediate the avoidance provoking and/or non-avoidance provoking suppression of food intake, in addition to neuron populations that lie outside of the NTS (including in the AP and/or hypothalamus). Going forward, it will be important to identify and define roles for all the NTS cells that respond to feeding and play roles in the suppression of food intake, as well as to identify neurons in the AP and elsewhere that may contribute to physiologic energy balance. Similarly, it will be important to understand potential differences in regulation and downstream targets for each population of NTS neurons that modulates food intake.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom">Reagent type (species) or resource</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Designation</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Source or reference</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Identifiers</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Strain, strain background (<italic>mus musculus</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Calcr<sup>Cre</sup>; C57BL6/J</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Jackson Lab Strain</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">#037028</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Strain, strain background (<italic>mus musculus</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Lepr<sup>Cre</sup>: C57Bl6/J</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Jackson Lab Strain</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">#17527</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Strain, strain background (<italic>mus musculus</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cck<sup>Cre</sup>; C57Bl6/J</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Jackson Lab Strain</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">#012706</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Antibody</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">anti-FOS (rabbit monoclonal)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cell Signaling Technology</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">#2250</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">IF: 1:1000</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Antibody</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">anti-GFP (chicken polyclonal)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Aves Laboratories</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">GFP1020</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">IF: 1:1000</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Antibody</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">anti-dsRed (rabbit polyclonal)</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">Takara</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">632496</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">IF: 1:1000</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">AAV<sup>FLEX-hM3Dq</sup></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">DOI: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1172/JCI46229">10.1172/JCI46229</ext-link></td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">AAV<sup>FLEX-TetTox-GFP</sup></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">DOI: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1038/nn.4574">10.1038/nn.4574</ext-link></td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">AAV<sup>FLEX-hM4Di</sup></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">DOI: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1172/JCI46229">10.1172/JCI46229</ext-link></td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">AAV<sup>Cre-GFP</sup></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">DOI: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.042678699">10.1073/pnas.042678699</ext-link></td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">AAV<sup>GFP</sup></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">DOI: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.042678699">10.1073/pnas.042678699</ext-link></td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Chemical compound, drug</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">CNO</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Tocris Bioscience</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">#4936</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals</title><p>Mice were bred in our colony in the Unit for Laboratory Animal Medicine at the University of Michigan; these mice and the procedures performed were approved by the University of Michigan Committee on the Use and Care of Animals (Protocol# 00011066) and in accordance with Association for the Assessment and Approval of Laboratory Animal Care and National Institutes of Health guidelines.

Mice were provided with food and water ad libitum (except as noted below) in temperature-controlled rooms on a 12-hour light-dark cycle. For all studies, animals were processed in the order of their ear tag number, which was randomly assigned at the time of tailing (before genotyping). ARRIVE guidelines were followed; animals were group-housed except for feeding and CTA studies. All surgery was performed under isoflurane anesthesia and every effort was made to minimize suffering.</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s6"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="mdar"><label>MDAR checklist</label><media xlink:href="elife-85640-mdarchecklist1-v3.docx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="docx"/></supplementary-material></sec><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="s7"><title>Data availability</title><p>All data generated are included in the manuscript and supplemental figures.</p></sec><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Paula Goforth, PhD, David Olson, MD, PhD, and Randy Seeley, PhD, as well as members of the Myers and Sandoval labs for helpful discussions.

Our findings reveal that each population (NTS<sup>Lepr</sup>, NTS<sup>Calcr</sup>, and NTS<sup>Cck</sup>) activates an at least partially distinct set of neurons and that only NTS<sup>Cck</sup> cells activate the known aversive PBN CGRP cells. These data suggest that the cumulative effects mediated by each of these NTS populations stem in part from their ability to activate at least partly distinct populations of downstream neurons. Unfortunately, it is outside of the scope of this manuscript (and the realm of the possible) to define the neurons that mediate the response to VSG, and we have now reorganized the manuscript to clarify that our VSG data serve to reveal that additional populations of neurons (other than NTS<sup>LCK</sup> cells) must contribute to the restraint of feeding.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Please also address other comments /concerns brought up by the two reviewers.</p></disp-quote><p>We have addressed the other comments as detailed below.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>I do have a few comments.</p><p>1) It would be interesting to know which neurotransmitters are released upon activation of the respective neuronal populations.
