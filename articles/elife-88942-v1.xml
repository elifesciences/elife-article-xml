Presently, the most common treatment for ED is phosphodiesterase 5 inhibitors; however, this is less effective in patients with severe vascular disease such as diabetic ED. Therefore, there is a need for development of new treatment, which requires a better understanding of the cavernous microenvironment and cell-cell communications under diabetic condition. Pericytes are vital in penile erection; however, their dysfunction due to diabetes remains unclear. In this study, we performed single-cell RNA sequencing to understand the cellular landscape of cavernous tissues and cell type-specific transcriptional changes in diabetic ED. We found a decreased expression of genes associated with collagen or extracellular matrix organization and angiogenesis in diabetic fibroblasts, chondrocytes, myofibroblasts, valve-related lymphatic endothelial cells, and pericytes. Moreover, the newly identified pericyte-specific marker, Limb Bud-Heart (Lbh)<italic>,</italic> in mouse and human cavernous tissues, clearly distinguishing pericytes from smooth muscle cells. Cell-cell interaction analysis revealed that pericytes are involved in angiogenesis, adhesion, and migration by communicating with other cell types in the corpus cavernosum; however, these interactions were highly reduced under diabetic conditions. Lbh expression is low in diabetic pericytes, and overexpression of LBH prevents erectile function by regulating neurovascular regeneration. Furthermore, the LBH-interacting proteins (Crystallin Alpha B and Vimentin) were identified in mouse cavernous pericytes through LC-MS/MS analysis, indicating that their interactions were critical for maintaining pericyte function. Thus, our study reveals novel targets and insights into the pathogenesis of ED in patients with diabetes.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>diabetes</kwd><kwd>erectile dysfunction</kwd><kwd>pericyte</kwd><kwd>single-cell RNA sequencing</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003725</institution-id><institution>National Research Foundation of Korea</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2021R1A2C4002133</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yin</surname><given-names>Guo Nan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003725</institution-id><institution>National Research Foundation of Korea</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2022R1A2B5B02001671</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ryu</surname><given-names>Ji-Kan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003725</institution-id><institution>National Research Foundation of Korea</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2019R1C1C1005403</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Park</surname><given-names>Jihwan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003725</institution-id><institution>National Research Foundation of Korea</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2021M3H9A2097520</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Park</surname><given-names>Jihwan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Medical research center</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2021R1A5A2031612</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ryu</surname><given-names>Ji-Kan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>GIST</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2023 GIST-MIT Research Collaboration grant</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Park</surname><given-names>Jihwan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Single-cell RNA sequencing analysis of diabetic mouse cavernous tissue revealed that LBH is a novel pericyte marker and may interact with Crystallin Alpha B and Vimentin to promote neurovascular regeneration.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Erectile dysfunction (ED) is an age-dependent vascular disease, affecting 5–35% of men aged 40–70 in varying degrees (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kubin et al., 2003</xref>). Although not fatal, 322 million men worldwide will be affected by the disease by 2025 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Ayta et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kessler et al., 2019</xref>). Moreover, it occurs in up to 75% of diabetes cases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Sáenz de Tejada et al., 2002</xref>). This causes significant physical and psychological problems for patients and their families (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bivalacqua et al., 2003</xref>). Moreover, the cavernous tissue is more prone to this disease than other blood vessels; therefore, its malfunction is considered as a biomarker in the progression of cardiovascular and vascular diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Miner, 2011</xref>). Current ED treatment involves the use of phosphodiesterase 5 (PDE5) inhibitors, but patients with severe vascular disease, such as diabetic ED, are less responsive. This is mainly because severe vascular dysfunction caused by diabetes results in insufficient bioavailable nitric oxide (NO) for PDE5 inhibitors to induce penile erection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Angulo et al., 2010</xref>). Therefore, it is necessary to identify novel therapeutic targets, which requires a comprehensive understanding of the cavernous microenvironment, including cell-cell interactions, regulatory signals, and molecular regulation. Although recent studies have proposed gene expression profiles of primary cultured cavernous cells exposed to hyperglycemic conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Anita et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Ghatak et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Yin et al., 2021</xref>), the relevant cell-specific relationships and genetic mechanisms in cavernous tissues have not been elucidated yet.</p><p>Pericytes are vital in the pathogenesis of erectile function as their interactions with endothelial cells are essential for penile erection. Pericytes interact with various cell types (especially endothelial cells) and are involved in angiogenesis, vasoconstriction, and permeability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bergers and Song, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gerhardt and Betsholtz, 2003</xref>). Diabetes causes pericyte loss or dysfunction, thereby creating an imbalance between pericytes and endothelial cells, leading to vascular diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Liu et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Warmke et al., 2016</xref>). For example, diabetic retinopathy is characterized by pericyte loss, capillary basement membrane thickening, and increased permeability, leading to retinal hypoxia and inflammation. Pericytes are particularly sensitive to glucose oxidation, which further promotes pericyte apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Warmke et al., 2016</xref>). Advanced glycation end products (AGEs) accumulate in pericytes under hyperglycemic conditions, thereby stimulating the secretion of transforming growth factor beta in peripheral nerve pericytes, leading to basement membrane thickening, neovascularization, and pericyte apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Shimizu et al., 2011</xref>). Furthermore, our previous studies showed that restoring the content and function of cavernous pericytes significantly reduced the permeability of cavernous blood vessels and enhanced neurovascular regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Yin et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Yin et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Yin et al., 2021</xref>). However, the mechanisms underlying the effect of diabetes on pericyte dysfunction in the ED remain unclear.</p><p>Smooth muscle cells (SMCs) are also a vital component of the cavernous tissues in penile erection. Diabetes mellitus (DM) leads to SMC dysfunction, such as decreased cavernosal smooth muscle relaxation, resulting in an inability to obtain or maintain satisfactory erection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Reddy et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Wei et al., 2012</xref>). Since the marker genes of pericytes and SMCs often overlap, and their expression patterns are tissue-specific, identifying suitable in vivo markers to accurately interpret transcriptional and phenotypic changes in these cell types is of utmost importance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Chasseigneaux et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kumar et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Smyth et al., 2018</xref>). Recent studies have identified pericyte-specific markers in different tissues using single-cell RNA sequencing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Baek et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Sun et al., 2022</xref>), enabling characterization of various cell types and their cell-cell communication. In this study, a single-cell transcriptome analysis was performed to examine the cellular heterogeneity in ED caused by diabetes. The goal of this study was to identify markers specific to cavernous pericytes and understand their role in ED by exploring their interactions with other cell types.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Single-cell transcriptional landscape of mouse cavernous tissue</title><p>To elucidate the cellular landscape of mouse cavernous tissue and transcriptional changes in diabetic ED at the cellular level, we conducted a single-cell transcriptome analysis, profiling 12,894 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).

We identified αB-crystallin (CRYAB) from band 1 and Vimentin (VIM) from bands 2 and 3, co-immunoprecipitated with LBH, VIM, and CRYAB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A and B</xref>). Furthermore, double IF staining indicated that LBH co-localized with CRYAB and VIM in mouse cavernous tissues and MCPs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C and D</xref>). Thus, CRYAB and VIM are novel LBH-interacting proteins in MCPs.</p><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>LBH-interacting protein identification in mouse cavernous pericytes.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) LBH was immunoprecipitated (IP) from whole-MCPs lysates, resolved on SDS-PAGE gels, and stained with Coomassie blue solution.

To identify the molecular mechanisms underlying interactions of LBH, CRYAB, and VIM, we performed gene ontology analysis using proteins from the PPI network. We found that these proteins are mainly involved in neurogenesis, neuronal development, and the nervous system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>). In addition, the proteins involved in ‘angiogenesis’ and ‘response to estradiol’ that are associated with pericyte activity were also included in this PPI network. Since the expression of LBH was decreased in the pericytes under diabetic conditions, we identified the expression level of angiogenesis and nerve system-related genes in diabetic pericytes using single-cell data. GSEA showed that gene sets related to angiogenesis and the nervous system were enriched in normal pericytes compared to diabetic pericytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G</xref>). Finally, we found that CRYAB expression significantly reduced in vitro and in vivo under diabetic conditions, whereas VIM expression significantly increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6H and I</xref>). This reveals that the expression of nervous system- and angiogenesis-related genes are downregulated as LBH decreases in pericytes under diabetic conditions, affecting the interacting molecules.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>DM is a major cause of ED, and poor long-term glycemic control can lead to nerve and blood vessel damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Desai et al., 2023</xref>). Many studies have outlined angiogenic and neurotrophic factors, such as VEGF, Comp-Ang1, dickkopf2, leucine-rich alpha-2 glycoprotein 1, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), and neurotrophin-3 that been tested as therapeutic options for ED (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bennett et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Burchardt et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hu et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Jin et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Yin et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Yin et al., 2022</xref>). However, poor efficacy, side effects such as inflammation, and complex drug-protein engineering have limited their success in clinical trials. A more detailed understanding of the intercellular signaling mechanisms and microenvironment in the penis under physiological and pathological conditions are necessary to provide more effective therapeutic targets. We therefore employed single-cell RNA sequencing to dissect the complex transcriptional changes in various cell types in ED using a diabetes-induced ED mouse model, as diabetic ED accounts for 75% of ED patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Sáenz de Tejada et al., 2002</xref>). Our findings from in vivo animal models and in vitro experiments were confirmed using human data and samples, enabling us to understand how the results from mouse models could be translated to humans and developed as novel treatment targets.</p><p>It is well known that ED is a complex neurovascular disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Leung et al., 2004</xref>), but the mechanism by which diabetes causes ED is still unclear. Many studies have shown that type 1 diabetes induces ED through different physiological processes, such as affecting penile contraction and relaxation, immune inflammatory response, neuropathy, structural and functional disturbance of cavernous SMCs, and dysfunction of endothelial cells, FBs, and pericytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Liu et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Thorve et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Yin et al., 2015</xref>). Although other major cell populations in penile tissue such as SMCs, endothelial cell, and FBs have been extensively studied, pericytes have mainly been investigated in the context of the central nervous system (CNS). For example, in the CNS, pericytes are involved in maintaining the integrity of the brain’s blood-brain barrier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Ferland-McCollough et al., 2017</xref>), regulating blood flow at capillary junctions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Gonzales et al., 2020</xref>), and promoting neuroinflammatory processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Brown et al., 2019</xref>), whose dysfunction is considered an important factor in the progression of vascular diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Winkler et al., 2014</xref>). But little is known about the role of pericytes in penile tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">De Leonardis et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">de Souza et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Yin et al., 2015</xref>). In order to explore the role of pericytes in repairing the corpus cavernosum vascular and neural tissues damaged by DM, we focused on pericytes, which are multipotent perivascular cells that contribute to the generation and repair of various tissues in response to injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Birbrair et al., 2015</xref>). Although recent studies have shown that pericytes are involved in physiological mechanisms of erection, little is known about their detailed mechanisms. Many known pericyte markers are co-expressed in other cell types; thus, identifying the specific marker genes for pericytes in vivo is the first step characterizing pericyte cell type. From the pericyte cluster in the single-cell RNA sequencing results, we found that <italic>Lbh, Ednra, Gpc3, Npy1r, Pln,</italic> and <italic>Atp1b2</italic> are specific pericyte markers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>). LBH was identified as a pericyte-positive and SMC-negative marker that was also highly expressed in human cavernous pericytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>) and was validated through IF staining in many vascular tissues and cell types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). As it is widely known, pericytes are primarily located in capillaries, where they surround endothelial cells of blood vessels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Avolio and Madeddu, 2016</xref>). In our recent studies, we observed minimal overlap in staining between LBH and α-SMA and between LBH and CD31 in penile tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>), suggesting that the cells expressing LBH were not SMCs or endothelial cells but possibly pericyte-like cells. In small vessels within the bladder, we also found that LBH-expressing cells surrounding CD31-expressing vessels had minimal overlap with α-SMA-expressing SMCs, consistent with the known characteristics of pericytes. In addition, in the triple staining of CD31, LBH, and α-SMA, we clearly found that LBH-expressing cells in the dorsal veins and dorsal artery showed LBH+/α-SMA-/CD31- staining (shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). These results also indicate that the LBH-expressing cells and endothelial cell layer are completely distinct from the SMC layer. LBH-expressing cells are mostly distributed next to and outside endothelial cells. The distribution of LBH-expressing cells was similar to that of known pericytes. Further research is needed to comprehend the differences in LBH expression and its characteristics in other vascular tissues.</p><p>Lbh, a highly conserved transcription cofactor, is known to participate in early limb and heart development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Briegel and Joyner, 2001</xref>). Moreover, LBH can directly target the Wnt signaling pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Rieger et al., 2010</xref>) and regulate neural crest cell development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Powder et al., 2014</xref>). In addition, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Jiang et al., 2019</xref> showed that LBH overexpression promotes angiogenesis via VEGF-mediated ERK signaling. In contrast, LBH inhibits cell migration and angiogenesis in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">wu et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Wu et al., 2021</xref>). These inconsistent results may be related to different histopathological environments. Thus, LBH has dual effects on the development of blood vessels and the nervous system, similar to other angioneurins such as VEGF and BDNF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Zacchigna et al., 2008</xref>). Here, we explored the role of Lbh in the penile tissues of diabetic mice. Interestingly, Lbh expression was significantly lower in cavernous pericytes in a diabetic mouse model. Therefore, we hypothesized that the restoration of Lbh expression in the penis of diabetic mice will improve erectile function. To test our hypothesis, we utilized the diabetes-induced ED mouse model, commonly employed in various studies focusing on microvascular complications associated with type 1 diabetes. We observed that the overexpression of LBH in diabetic mice led to the restoration of reduced erectile function by enhancing neurovascular regeneration. However, this study primarily demonstrated the observed phenomenon without delving into the detailed mechanisms. In addition, our findings suggest that LBH can affect the function of cavernous pericytes, although we cannot definitively conclude which specific cavernous cell types are affected by the overexpressed LBH, whether it be cavernous endothelial cells, SMCs, or others. Subsequent research will be required to conduct more comprehensive mechanistic investigations, such as in vitro studies using cavernous endothelial cells, SMCs, and FBs to address these knowledge gaps. In summary, our results support the hypothesis that LBH can restore diabetes-induced ED by facilitating neurovascular regeneration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>).</p><p>Previous studies have shown that CRYAB promotes angiogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Dimberg et al., 2008</xref>) and interacts with LBH in nasopharyngeal carcinoma cells, where it enhances cell survival by inhibiting the autoproteolytic maturation of caspase-3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Wu et al., 2021</xref>). Interestingly, our LC-MS/MS analysis of LBH following immunoprecipitation of MCPs identified VIM as a novel interaction partner and CRYAB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). In addition, we assessed the expression of CRYAB and VIM under diabetic conditions. Unexpectedly, the expression of VIM was increased, whereas that of CRYAB was downregulated in the penis of diabetic mice and MCPs under diabetic conditions. VIM is a type III intermediate filament protein expressed in mesenchymal cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Dave and Bayless, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Guo et al., 2013</xref>). It is involved in cell adhesion, migration, cellular integrity, epithelial-mesenchymal transition, and the malignant transformation and metastatic spread of cancer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Chen et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Dave and Bayless, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Liu et al., 2015</xref>). It is a multifunctional protein that interacts with several other proteins with many functions under various pathophysiological conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Danielsson et al., 2018</xref>). For example, VIM interacts with the insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor, promotes axonal extension, and serves as a double-edged sword in the nervous system by regulating axonal regeneration, myelination, apoptosis, and neuroinflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Chen et al., 2023</xref>). Furthermore, <italic>VIM</italic> knockout mice were less susceptible to bacterial infections and had a reduced inflammatory response than wild-type mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Moisan et al., 2007</xref>). Recently, <italic>VIM</italic> deficiency was shown to prevent obesity and insulin resistance in type 2 DM by reducing CD36 expression on plasma membranes and intracellular trafficking of glucose transporter type 4 in adipocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Luo et al., 2021</xref>). Therefore, the combination of LBH with CRYAB and VIM could improve neurovascular regeneration in diabetic ED by activating the angiogenic effects of CRYAB and potentially reducing the inflammatory effects of VIM. Collectively, the discovery of the LBH-CRYAB-VIM interaction opens the door to a more specific understanding of the role of pericytes in diabetic ED. However, the clinical implications of these results remain uncertain. Future research endeavors should focus on incorporating LBH-CRYAB-VIM into therapeutic strategies for diabetes and ED.</p><p>As far as our knowledge extends, this study marks the first demonstration of LBH’s efficacy in restoring erectile function in mice with diabetes-induced ED.

Erectile dysfunction (ED) is caused by dysfunction of the cavernous tissue and affects a significant proportion of men aged 40-70. The most common treatment for ED is phosphodiesterase 5 inhibitors; however, these are less effective in patients with diabetic ED. Therefore, there is an unmet need for a better understanding of the cavernous microenvironment, cell-cell communications in patients with diabetic ED, and the development of new therapeutic treatments to improve the quality of life.</p><p>Pericytes are mesenchymal-derived mural cells that directly interact with capillary endothelial cells (ECs). They play a vital role in the pathogenesis of erectile function as their interactions with ECs are essential for penile erection. Loss of pericytes has been associated with diabetic retinopathy, cancer, and Alzheimer's disease and has been investigated in relation to the permeability of cavernous blood vessels and neurovascular regeneration in the authors' previous studies. This manuscript explores the mechanisms underlying the effect of diabetes on pericyte dysfunction in ED. Additionally, the cellular landscape of cavernous tissues and cell type-specific transcriptional changes were carefully examined using both mouse and human single-cell RNA sequencing in diabetic ED. The novelty of this work lies in the identification of a newly identified pericyte (PC)-specific marker, LBH, in mouse and human cavernous tissues, which distinguishes pericytes from smooth muscle cells. LBH not only serves as a cavernous pericyte marker, but its expression level is also reduced in diabetic conditions. The LBH-interacting proteins (Cryab and Vim) were further identified in mouse cavernous pericytes, indicating that these signaling interactions are critical for maintaining normal pericyte function. Overall, this study demonstrates the novel marker of pericytes and highlights the critical role of pericytes in diabetic ED.</p><p>Comments on revised version:</p><p>Bae and colleagues substantially improved the data quality and revised their manuscript &quot;Pericytes contribute to pulmonary vascular remodeling via HIF2a signaling&quot;. While these revisions clarify some of the concerns raised, others remain. In my view, the following question must be addressed.</p><p>In my prior question on #3, I completely disagree with the statement that &quot;identified cells with pericyte-like characteristics in the walls of large blood vessels&quot;.

We first performed double staining of LBH and CD31 on dorsal artery and dorsal vein tissues. We found that LBH-expressing cells are completely different from CD31-expressing cells (Figrue 2D, indicated by arrows, and Supplementary Fig. 10A) and that expression is higher in veins than in arteries. This is consistent with previous understanding. In addition, in the double staining of LBH and α-SMA, we also found that there was no overlap between LBH-expressing cells and α-SMA-expressing smooth muscle cells in the cavernosum tissues, but there was some overlap in dorsal artery and dorsal vein (Figrue 2E, indicated by arrows). This may indicate that LBH is expressed slightly different types of blood vessels. This requires further experiments to prove in the future. In addition, to avoid confusion among other readers. We modify our previous discussion regarding the identification of cells with pericyte-like characteristics in the walls of large blood vessels. We removed the associated immunofluorescence staining in the aorta and kidneys replaced them with dorsal artery and dorsal vein (Please see revised ‘Result’ and ‘Figure 2’ and ‘Supplementary Fig. 10A’)</p></body></sub-article></article>
