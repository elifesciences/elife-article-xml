However, most expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) remain unidentified. We mapped eQTLs by transcriptome sequencing in 1012 yeast segregants. The resulting eQTLs accounted for over 70% of the heritability of mRNA levels, allowing comprehensive dissection of regulatory variation. Most genes had multiple eQTLs. Most expression variation arose from <italic>trans</italic>-acting eQTLs distant from their target genes. Nearly all <italic>trans</italic>-eQTLs clustered at 102 hotspot locations, some of which influenced the expression of thousands of genes. Fine-mapped hotspot regions were enriched for transcription factor genes. While most genes had a local eQTL, most of these had no detectable effects on the expression of other genes in <italic>trans</italic>. Hundreds of non-additive genetic interactions accounted for small fractions of expression variation. These results reveal the complexity of genetic influences on transcriptome variation in unprecedented depth and detail.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.35471.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Every individual’s genome is unique, with variations in the DNA sequence at many thousands of points.

Regions of the genome that contain regulatory variants can be identified by tests of genetic linkage or association between mRNA levels and DNA polymorphisms in large collections of individuals. Regions for which such tests show statistical significance are known as eQTLs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Albert and Kruglyak, 2015</xref>). Regulatory variation is widespread in the species for which it has been studied; indeed, in humans, the expression of nearly every gene appears to be influenced by one or more eQTL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aguet et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Battle et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>In humans, eQTLs are typically mapped by genome-wide association studies (GWAS) in unrelated individuals. To cover the genome, human GWAS must test a very large number of variants, resulting in a high multiple-testing burden and low statistical power. As a result, most human eQTL GWAS have been limited to searches for ‘local’ eQTLs that are located close to the genes they influence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">GTEx Consortium, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Lappalainen et al., 2013</xref>). The power to detect local eQTLs is higher because focused local tests reduce the multiple-testing burden, and because local eQTLs tend to have larger effect sizes. However, genome-wide estimates show that most regulatory variation does not arise from local eQTLs. Instead, it arises from ‘distant’ eQTLs, which are located far from the genes they influence, typically on different chromosomes, and which exert their effects through <italic>trans</italic>-acting factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Grundberg et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Wright et al., 2014</xref>). Although <italic>trans</italic>-acting human eQTLs have been discovered (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aguet et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Battle et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Brynedal et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Fehrmann et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Grundberg et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Heinig et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Lee et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Small et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Wright et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Yao et al., 2017</xref>), the vast majority remains unknown. As a consequence, we know relatively little about this crucial source of regulatory genetic variation.</p><p>In model organisms, eQTLs can be identified by linkage analysis in panels of offspring obtained from crosses of genetically different individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Brem et al., 2002</xref>). Whereas GWAS studies are powered to test only genetic variants found at high frequency in the population (e.g. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Kita et al., 2017</xref>]), linkage studies can assay both common and rare variants that differ between the parental strains. In addition, longer blocks of linkage reduce the number of statistical tests required to cover the genome. As a result, many local and distant eQTLs have been discovered in such studies. However, even in linkage studies, sample size limitations have to date resulted in insufficient statistical power to detect most eQTLs. This limitation has manifested itself as ‘missing heritability’: detected eQTLs tend to account for only a fraction of the measured heritable component of gene expression variation. Here, we addressed this limitation by carrying out an eQTL study in a large panel of segregants from a cross between two yeast strains. The high power of our study allowed us to identify eQTLs that account for the great majority of heritable expression variation in this cross, and to characterize the distant component of regulatory variation in unprecedented depth and detail.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Deep eQTL mapping explains most gene expression heritability</title><p>We developed an experimental pipeline for high-throughput generation of RNA-seq data in yeast and obtained high-quality expression measurements (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sdata1">Source data 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sdata2">Source data 2</xref>) for 5720 genes in 1012 segregants from a cross between a laboratory and a wine strain (hereafter, BY and RM, respectively). We obtained high-confidence genotypes at 11,530 variant sites from low-coverage whole-genome sequences of the segregants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bloom et al., 2013</xref>) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sdata3">Source data 3</xref>). We used the genotype and RNA-seq data for eQTL mapping and identified 36,498 eQTLs for 5643 genes at a false discovery rate (FDR) of 5% (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sdata4">Source data 4</xref>). Only 77 genes had no detected eQTL. Among the genes with at least one detected eQTL, the median number was 6, with a maximum of 21 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; Supplementary Discussion 1 describes the five genes with 21 eQTLs). Previous eQTL mapping in 112 segregants from this cross detected an average of less than one eQTL per gene as a consequence of much lower statistical power (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Brem et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Smith and Kruglyak, 2008</xref>). That data set was used to obtain indirect estimates of the distribution of the number of eQTLs per gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Brem and Kruglyak, 2005</xref>), and these agree closely with the distribution of directly detected eQTLs observed in the current study. For example, Brem and Kruglyak (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Brem and Kruglyak, 2005</xref>) estimated that at most 3% of genes would be influenced by a single eQTL (we observed 2.6% of such genes), and half of genes would require &gt;5 eQTLs (we observed a median of 6 eQTLs per gene). While Brem and Kruglyak estimated that one third of genes would require more than 8 eQTLs, we observed only 23% such genes. Additional eQTLs of very small effect missed by our study likely account for this discrepancy. The observed distribution of the number of loci also closely matched the distribution we reported for loci influencing 160 protein levels studied with the highly powered X-pQTL approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Albert et al., 2014b</xref>). Our results provide direct demonstration that variation in expression levels of nearly all genes has a complex genetic basis.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.35471.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>eQTL detection and transcriptome heritability.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Histogram showing the number of eQTLs per gene.

We observed a median heritability of 26%, with a maximum of 95% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Our estimates are similar to those from population-based studies of gene expression in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Grundberg et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Lloyd-Jones et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Wheeler et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Wright et al., 2014</xref>).

Across genes, heritability was positively correlated with mean expression and with expression variance, and negatively correlated with the number of protein-protein and synthetic genetic interaction partners, as well as with gene essentiality (p≤0.005) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>; Supplementary Discussion 2 and 3; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sdata6">Source data 6</xref>).</p><p>In contrast to previous eQTL studies, the detected eQTLs explained most of the estimated additive gene expression heritability (a median across genes of 71.5%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B and D</xref> 10-fold cross-validation). Low missing heritability in our data is explained by the high power of our experiment. We had greater than 90% power to detect eQTLs that explain at least 2.5% of expression variance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). The distribution of effect sizes of detected eQTLs is strongly weighted toward small effects (median 1.9% of variance explained; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), suggesting that the remaining missing heritability is explained by undetected eQTLs with even smaller effects. These results are similar to those observed for organismal traits in this cross (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bloom et al., 2013</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">2015</xref>). Thus, we have discovered most eQTLs with substantial effects that segregate in this cross, and these jointly account for the great majority of the observed genetic variation in the transcriptome.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Genetic expression variation arises primarily from <italic>trans</italic>-acting hotspots</title><p>We found that 2884 genes (50% of 5720 expressed genes) had a local eQTL (defined as an eQTL whose confidence interval includes the gene it influences) at genome-wide significance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>).

We reduced the dimensionality of the residual expression levels by singular value decomposition to capture linear combinations of traits that account for most of the variance in residual expression. We scanned the given chromosome for genetic influences on the multivariate distribution of these linear combinations, while controlling FDR via permutations.

These were all correctly localized by the algorithm, validating this fine-mapping strategy.</p><p>The 58 genes at 26 high-resolution hotspots are highly enriched for the causal genes underlying the hotspots, making it possible to systematically study the functions of hotspot regulators. These genes were less likely to be essential or to have a human homolog than other yeast genes but did not differ from other genes in their expression level or the number of physical or genetic interaction partners (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp7">Supplementary file 7</xref>). The hotspot genes had highly significant enrichments for gene ontology (GO) terms related to transcriptional regulation (e.g. GO:0006357 ‘regulation of transcription from RNA polymerase II promoter’: 19 genes among the 58; 4 expected; p=4e-9; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sdata12">Source data 12</xref>), as well as weaker enrichments for terms related to response to nutrient levels (GO:0031669; ‘cellular response to nutrient levels’: 8 genes, 1 expected, p=6e-6)</p><p>These analyses indicate that causal hotspot genes are disproportionately involved in transcriptional regulation, a signal that was not picked up in an earlier study with fewer, less-well-resolved hotspots (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Yvert et al., 2003</xref>). For example, we fine-mapped a new hotspot that affected 382 genes to a single gene, the transcription factor <italic>STB5</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). <italic>STB5</italic> is a transcriptional activator of multidrug resistance genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Kasten and Stillman, 1997</xref>). A previous analysis suggested reduced activity of the <italic>STB5</italic> BY allele compared to the RM allele (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Lee and Bussemaker, 2010</xref>). Consistent with this observation, we found that the promoters of genes whose expression was lower in the presence of the <italic>STB5</italic> BY allele were strongly enriched for <italic>STB5</italic> binding sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>).</p><p>To further examine the role of sequence variation in transcription factor genes, we focused on transcription factors with variants predicted to be damaging to protein function such as premature stop codons or frameshifts. There are eight such genes in our data. Remarkably, six of these (<italic>GAT1</italic>, <italic>HMS1</italic>, <italic>PUT3</italic>, <italic>RFX1</italic>, <italic>SRD1</italic>, <italic>TBS1</italic>) were located in a hotspot, often very close to the estimated peak location (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>). None of these expression hotspots have been reported previously, although variation at <italic>GAT1</italic> has been reported to influence traits relevant for wine production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Salinas et al., 2012</xref>), and a premature stop codon in the RM allele of <italic>RFX1</italic> has been linked to reduced activity of this transcriptional repressor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Lee and Bussemaker, 2010</xref>). The remaining two transcription factors with predicted damaging mutations did not overlap a hotspot. Of these, a predicted frameshift in <italic>YRM1</italic> is very close to the end of the coding region, while a predicted frameshift in <italic>STB4</italic> appears to be an annotation artifact: it resides in a region that is annotated as coding but that does not in fact appear to be transcribed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref>, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Albert et al., 2014a</xref>]).</p><p>Hotspot genes can also influence mRNA levels more indirectly – for instance, by shaping the cellular response to external stimuli such as nutrient availability. For example, we fine-mapped a hotspot, which influenced 645 genes, to an interval on chromosome VIII containing six genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4A</xref>). One of these is <italic>ERC1</italic>, which encodes a transmembrane transporter. BY but not RM carries a frameshift in this gene, which removes the last two out of 12 predicted transmembrane helices of the protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Fehrmann et al., 2013</xref>). This variant is known to reduce cell-to-cell variability (or ‘noise’) in the expression of a <italic>MET17</italic> gene tagged with green fluorescent protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Fehrmann et al., 2013</xref>). We found that the BY allele at this hotspot reduced the expression of genes that are highly enriched for the GO category ‘methionine biosynthetic process’ (GO:0009086, p=2e-22; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sdata8">Source data 8</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sdata10">Source data 10</xref>). Thus, in addition to reducing <italic>MET17</italic> expression noise, the <italic>ERC1</italic> frameshift variant is linked to reduced mean expression levels of multiple genes in the methionine biosynthesis pathway (the <italic>MET</italic> regulon; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4B</xref>). While the precise compounds that are imported or exported by Erc1p are not known, the <italic>ERC1</italic> BY allele reduces cellular levels of <italic>S</italic>-Adenosylmethionine (SAM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Breunig et al., 2014</xref>), a key component of methionine and cysteine amino acid metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Sadhu et al., 2014</xref>).

To our knowledge, this is the first unequivocal identification of eQTL interactions from an unbiased genome-by-genome scan.

Indeed, of the 774 markers in the 387 epistatic pairs, 558 (72%) were within 10 kb of a genome-wide significant additive eQTL influencing the same gene. An estimate based on the π<sub>1</sub> statistic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Storey and Tibshirani, 2003</xref>) showed that at least 84% of epistatic markers have additive effects. An example is <italic>SAG1</italic>, which encodes the Alpha-agglutinin of cells with the alpha mating type. In our cross, the alpha mating type was carried by the RM parent. Consequently, expression of <italic>SAG1</italic> was higher in segregants that carried the RM allele at the mating type locus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). In addition to this additive effect, the mating type locus was also involved in an interaction with the <italic>GPA1</italic> locus, replicating the finding from a targeted search that a BY-specific S469I variant in <italic>GPA1</italic> modulates <italic>SAG1</italic> expression in alpha but not <bold>a</bold> cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Brem et al., 2005</xref>).</p><p>Of the 387 interactions, 158 (41%) involved ‘<italic>cis</italic> by <italic>trans</italic>’ interactions between distant and local loci (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1A</xref>). For example, the <italic>HAP1</italic> hotspot interacted with local eQTLs for 15 genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Among these, the RM alleles of <italic>HAP1</italic> and <italic>SCM4</italic> both increased <italic>SCM4</italic> expression, and segregants with the RM genotype at both loci had higher expression levels than expected from additive effects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1B</xref>). The <italic>HAP1</italic> BY allele is less active due to a transposon insertion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Brem et al., 2002</xref>). The local <italic>SCM4</italic> eQTL may arise from variants that disrupt a <italic>HAP1</italic> binding site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Ter Linde and Steensma, 2002</xref>) in BY, and this allelic difference may result in a stronger expression difference in the presence of the more active RM Hap1p. In agreement with this model, an epistatic interaction between inferred Hap1p activity and <italic>SCM4</italic> expression has been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Parts et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>Interestingly, <italic>SCM4</italic> is the only annotated direct <italic>HAP1</italic> target among the local eQTLs that interact with <italic>HAP1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Harbison et al., 2004</xref>). Further, the effect sizes of local eQTLs that interacted with <italic>HAP1</italic> were not statistically different in segregants that carried the more active RM vs. the less active BY allele at <italic>HAP1</italic> (T-test, p=0.9). In all the cases we examined (<italic>KRE33</italic>, <italic>MKT1</italic>, <italic>GPA1</italic>, and <italic>IRA2</italic>), the local eQTLs that interacted with these hotspots did not show consistently larger or smaller effect sizes depending on the hotspot allele (all p≥0.3). This argues against a scenario in which most <italic>cis</italic> by <italic>trans</italic> interactions are due to variants in transcription factor binding sites whose effect increases with a more active <italic>trans</italic> regulator. Instead, most <italic>cis</italic> by <italic>trans</italic> interaction effects may be mediated through more indirect mechanisms.</p><p>We quantified the fraction of variation in gene expression that is contributed by epistatic interactions. Pairwise interactions typically explained about 1/10th as much expression variance as did additive loci (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2</xref>), with a median of 2.2% of expression variance per pair. Thus, genetic interactions contributed only a small minority of trait variance for gene expression levels, which is consistent with what we previously reported for organism-level traits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Bloom et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>We asked if any of the epistatic pairs identified from our unbiased search corresponded to ‘purely’ epistatic interactions without any additive effects. Of the 387 pairs, 111 (29%) were not found in the search between additive loci. Given the small effects of most interactions, this group is likely enriched for false positives from the full search as well as false negatives from the search between additive loci. We searched for specific epistatic pairs in which neither locus had an additive effect (p&gt;0.05), overlapped an additive hotspot (to avoid any potential undetected additive hotspot effects), and where the affected gene was on a different chromosome from both interacting markers (to avoid any potential undetected additive local eQTLs). Only three such pairs existed in our data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s3">Figure 7—figure supplement 3</xref>). In each case, the two genotype classes with non-parental genotype combinations (BY-RM and RM-BY) had similar expression levels that differed from those in the two parental genotype combinations (BY-BY and RM-RM), such that the marginal genotype effects canceled out. Even in these three cases, the variance resulting from the interaction was only 2.6–3.6%. We conclude that any contribution of ‘purely’ epistatic pairs to transcriptome variation must be small.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The high power of our study allowed us to identify genome-wide significant eQTLs that jointly explain over 70% of gene expression heritability. Thus, our eQTL map shows a high degree of completeness, capturing most genetic sources of transcriptome variation in this cross. In particular, our results allowed us to examine the contribution of <italic>trans</italic>-acting regulatory variation in much greater detail than previously possible in any species.</p><p>We showed that <italic>trans</italic>-acting eQTLs are the predominant source of expression variation in this cross. Specifically, <italic>trans</italic>-eQTLs contribute 2.6-fold more to gene expression variance than local eQTLs, remarkably similar to genome-wide estimates in humans of 1.8-fold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Grundberg et al., 2012</xref>) and 3.4-fold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Wright et al., 2014</xref>). While based on different experimental designs and study populations, these results from yeast and humans clearly demonstrate the importance of <italic>trans</italic>-acting variation in eukaryotic species.</p><p>The vast majority of <italic>trans</italic>-eQTLs are concentrated at a limited number of hotspot regions that harbor variants with widespread effects on the expression of other genes. The strongest of these hotspots affected the expression of most genes in the genome. The minority of <italic>trans</italic> eQTLs that fell outside the statistically defined hotspots also clustered more than expected by chance. We saw little evidence for isolated <italic>trans</italic>-acting loci that affect the expression of one or a few genes. The high density of sequence differences in this cross might have been expected to produce a more diffuse <italic>trans</italic>-regulatory architecture, with many loci each influencing one or a few genes. Instead, <italic>trans</italic>-acting regulatory variation arises primarily from several dozen specific loci.</p><p>The large number and fine resolution of our hotspots allowed us to conduct unbiased analyses of the genes located in these regions. Unlike earlier work examining fewer, less well localized hotspots (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Yvert et al., 2003</xref>), we found a strong enrichment for transcription factors, a class of genes with obvious relevance to gene regulation. Guided by this enrichment, we noticed that almost all transcription factor genes with predicted damaging variants in this cross appear to produce a <italic>trans</italic>-acting hotspot, with the exception of two genes in which the damaging variants may affect gene function only weakly if at all. This result clearly illustrates the importance of variation in transcription factors in shaping gene expression in trans. At the same time, many <italic>trans</italic>-acting hotspots are caused by variation in genes other than transcription factors. These hotspots illustrate the importance of indirect <italic>trans</italic> effects that alter cellular networks and physiology, which in turn results in gene expression change.</p><p>In an unbiased search, we revealed hundreds of non-additive genetic interactions that influence mRNA levels. Many of these eQTL-eQTL interactions were between eQTLs at two different hotspot regions, or interactions between an eQTL at a hotspot and a local eQTL. Hotspots may play such prominent roles in epistatic interactions because their wide-reaching effects effectively alter the global state of the cell. The effects of many other variants may be larger in some cellular states than others, similar to what is seen when yeast are grown in different environments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Lewis et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Smith and Kruglyak, 2008</xref>).</p><p>Previous searches for epistatic interactions on gene expression levels in this cross were targeted to genes and loci chosen based on prior additive scans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Brem et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Storey et al., 2005</xref>). Our unbiased search confirmed the validity of this strategy. The vast majority of epistatic markers we detected also had additive effects, and there was little evidence for interactions without any additive effects. Conversely, many additive eQTLs, including several major additive hotspots, were involved in few if any epistatic interactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). Thus, epistatic interactions cannot be simply assumed to exist for all additive loci, and the most fruitful strategy to detect epistasis is to test loci with additive effects for interactions with other loci.</p><p>In our cross between two yeast strains, we identified over one hundred hotspot regions, and found evidence for additional, weaker hotspots.

Human <italic>trans</italic>-eQTLs could be distributed more uniformly, such that hotspots make up a smaller fraction of all <italic>trans-</italic>eQTLs, leaving room for more gene-specific <italic>trans</italic>-eQTLs. There could also be more hotspots, each affecting fewer genes than the strongest hotspots in our cross. While it is difficult to extrapolate from the current, still underpowered human studies, it may be informative to consider that the initial eQTL searches in our yeast cross only found eight hotspots, each affecting at most dozens of genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Brem et al., 2002</xref>). The observation that hotspots are the main source of <italic>trans</italic> variation required the higher statistical power of the present dataset.

The hotspot loci we described here offer evidence that some regulatory variants can indeed have widespread effects on the transcriptome, in some cases altering the expression of the majority of genes in the genome through precisely the combination of strong direct effects on ‘core’ genes in specific pathways and weak indirect effects on other ‘peripheral’ genes envisioned in the omnigenic model. Hundreds of hotspots may exist in the human genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Brynedal et al., 2017</xref>), providing a rich substrate through which regulatory variation may influence complex traits.</p><p>On the other hand, although we detected local eQTLs for most genes in our cross, the majority of these had no detectable <italic>trans</italic> effects on the expression of other genes, within the limits of our statistical power. Given that our study had sufficient power to detect weak indirect effects of <italic>trans</italic>-eQTL hotspots, we believe that most local eQTLs indeed have no meaningful downstream consequences for gene expression. By extension, such local eQTLs may be unlikely to contribute to variation in complex traits. Consistent with this conclusion, modest expression changes for dozens of yeast genes have been found to result in minimal fitness effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Duveau et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Keren et al., 2016</xref>). These results argue against the simplest form of the omnigenic model, in which a variant that changes the expression of any one gene has meaningful effects on every other gene. Instead, we observed that <italic>trans</italic>-eQTLs effects preferentially arise from variation in certain classes of genes. Given the crucial importance of regulatory variation for many complex traits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Albert and Kruglyak, 2015</xref>), the organismal consequences of expression changes caused by different types of eQTLs remain a key area for further research.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>Unless otherwise specified, all computational analyses were performed in R.

The segregants were grouped according to their previously measured (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bloom et al., 2013</xref>) endpoint colony radius on YNB agar plates into groups of 96. The strains in each group were rearranged from existing stock plates into a total of 13 96-well plates in YNB medium, grown to saturation, and frozen as glycerol stocks for later growth. Within each group of 96, strain locations in the 96-well plate were selected at random. Culture and liquid handling was performed on a BioMek FXP instrument or with multichannel pipettes in 96-well format.</p><p>Our strategy of batching segregants according to their growth on YNB ensures that each 96-well plate contains segregants that grow at comparable rates. This facilitates growing all segregants on a plate such that they reach a similar optical density at 600 nm (OD) at the same time. Our batching strategy produces experimental batches that are correlated with growth rates. Because we statistically removed variation among experimental batches prior to eQTL mapping (see below), this design reduces our ability to compare variation in growth rates with variation in gene expression. We deemed this an acceptable trade-off because it considerably simplified handling &gt;1000 samples in a systematic fashion. We processed the batches in a randomized order with respect to their growth rate to avoid confounding processing date with faster or slower growth.</p><p>We used the rearranged stock plates to inoculate growth cultures in 1 ml YNB medium (recipe for 1 L: 6.7 g yeast nitrogen base with ammonium sulfate and without amino acids; 900 ml H<sub>2</sub>O; autoclave; add 100 mL of separately autoclaved 20% glucose solution) in 2 mL deep well plates sealed with Breathe-Easy membranes (Sigma Aldrich), and grew the cultures to saturation on Eppendorf MixMate instruments situated in a 30°C incubator and set to 1100 rounds per minute (rpm). We set the saturated cultures back to OD = 0.05 in 1 mL YNB in a fresh deep well plate and continued growth at 30°C. We monitored OD during growth by splitting out 100 µL of culture every other hour, measuring OD on a Synergy two plate reader (BioTek) and returning the 100 µL used for measuring OD to the deep-well culture plate. We increased the frequency of measurements as cultures approached OD = 0.4.</p><p>Once average OD in the plate reached 0.4, we transferred the cultures to sterile Norgen nylon filter plates (#40008) situated on a vacuum manifold. We applied vacuum to remove all growth medium, sealed with aluminum foil seals, and flash froze the entire plate in liquid N<sub>2</sub>. The frozen plates were placed on a standard 96-well plate to protect their bottom, wrapped with parafilm, and stored at −80°C until RNA extraction. Note that this procedure provided us with OD measurements up to the exact time point at which cells were harvested.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>RNA extraction</title><p>We used Dynabeads mRNA DIRECT kits (Ambion/Thermo Fisher) to directly isolate mRNA from cell lysates.

We added 700 µL lysis buffer to our frozen cell plates, pipetted up and down to resuspend the cells, and applied them to the glass beads in the Axygen plate. The Axygen plate was tightly sealed with an Axymat rubber plate seal (AM-2ML-RD-S), and ground for 10 cycles on a plate-based mini bead beater (Biospec). Each cycle consisted of 1 min beating followed by 1 min on ice.</p><p>We centrifuged the plate for 4 min at 3000 rpm to separate glass beads and cell debris from the lysate. We pipetted two aliquots of 200 µL of lysate supernatant into two 96-well PCR plates for a total of 400 µL lysate. These plates were sealed, and the RNA melted for 2 min at 65°C in a thermocycler. We implemented a BioMek-assisted procedure to perform the Dynabead protocol with two mRNA enrichment steps. We did not quantify the resulting 11 µL of mRNA and simply used the entire mRNA for reverse transcription and sequencing library preparation. While piloting this procedure, we obtained typical yields of ~30 ng / µL and excellent RNA quality as judged by visualization on 1.1% agarose gels stained with ethidium bromide. Ribosomal RNA bands were clearly visible in crude lysate, less visible after the first mRNA enrichment, and absent after the second mRNA enrichment step. After the second mRNA enrichment, mRNA was clearly visible on the gel, with no visible RNA degradation.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>RNA sequencing library construction and sequencing</title><p>We performed reverse transcription and sequencing library preparation using the Kapa Stranded mRNA-Seq Kit (KK8420/21). This kit usually begins by enriching mRNA from total RNA. Because we had already performed mRNA enrichment, we used our entire mRNA as input and began at the RNA fragmentation step by adding 11 µL of ‘KAPA fragment, prime and elute buffer’ to our 11 µL of mRNA. RNA fragmentation was performed on a thermocycler for 6 min at 94°C.</p><p>The remaining procedure was performed as specified in the Kapa kit manual. Briefly, the fragmented RNA is randomly primed and used for first strand cDNA synthesis, second strand synthesis and marking with dUTP, A-tailing of the double-stranded cDNA, adapter ligation, and PCR for 12 cycles. The dUTP marked second strand is not amplified in PCR, resulting in strand-specific libraries. We used custom designed Truseq-compatible indexing adapters (IDT) to allow multiplexing all 96 samples per batch. Prior to use, the two types of Truseq adapters were annealed (2 min at 97°C; 72 steps of 1 min at 1°C decreasing temperature; 5 min at 25°C) to generate forked adapters that can be ligated to the A-tailed cDNA.

We calculated library concentrations by comparing to a standard series obtained by diluting the standard solutions included in the Qubit quantification kit. Standards were measured in triplicate on each library plate. We pooled the libraries in each group to equal molarity and used qPCR (KAPA Biosystems #KK4854) on the pool to obtain the molarity for loading on the sequencer. Gel extraction was not necessary because the RNA fragmentation and bead clean-up that are part of the Kapa protocol resulted in library fragments of the desired size of 200–400 bp.</p><p>Sequencing was performed for 100 bp single end on Illumina HiSeq 2500 instruments at the UCLA BSRC sequencing core for two lanes per batch, for 26 total lanes.

Peaks that moved by more than 75 kb at this step were removed from the model. For all peaks with LOD &gt;200 we tested the possibility that the multivariate peak was a ‘ghost’ jQTL, that is a jQTL that appears to be localized between two or more true jQTLs that are very closely linked and that influence a similar set of genes. We fit a model where the one significant jQTL was replaced by a two-jQTLs model, with the added criterion that the two jQTLs could not be within 10 markers on either side of the original peak. Permutations for this two-locus model were performed as in ‘multitrait mapping to localize eQTL hotspots’, with the relevant test and null statistics being the difference between the fit of the best two-locus model and the best one-locus model. Single jQTL peaks were replaced with the best two-locus model if the observed LOD was more than 10 greater than the 99% quantile LOD for the permuted data.

We used gene locations expanded by 1000 bp upstream and 200 bp downstream to account for regulatory variants that may be located in the promoter or the 3’UTR. We initially classified 2969 eQTLs as local. These 2969 eQTLs affected 2884 genes. Closer inspection revealed that these multiple ‘local’ eQTLs per gene often involved one eQTL with a peak very close to the gene and other, more distant eQTLs. These more distant eQTLs probably reflect <italic>trans</italic>-eQTLs on the same chromosome as their target gene with location confidence intervals broad enough that they happened to overlap the target gene. For our ASE comparisons below, we only used the local eQTLs that were located closest to a given gene.</p></sec><sec id="s4-17"><title>Allele-specific expression analyses and comparison to local eQTLs</title><p>We used ASE data from two sources. The first source is the mRNA data from Supplementary Data S2 from (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Albert et al., 2014a</xref>). The second source is previously unpublished data generated by Dr. Noorossadat Torabi in the Kruglyak laboratory (available in SRA under accession code SRP149494). Both datasets performed mRNA sequencing on a BY/RM diploid hybrid strain. Reads from Albert et al. were ~30 bp in length to match ribosome profiling data presented in that paper, while reads from Torabi et al. were 100 bp. In contrast to (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Albert et al., 2014a</xref>), the Torabi data was not strand-specific.</p><p>We processed the Torabi data exactly as described in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Albert et al., 2014a</xref>). Briefly, reads were aligned to both the BY reference genome and the RM reference genome provided by the Broad Institute (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.broadinstitute.org/fungal-genome-initiative/saccharomyces-cerevisiae-rm11-1a-genome-project">https://www.broadinstitute.org/fungal-genome-initiative/saccharomyces-cerevisiae-rm11-1a-genome-project</ext-link>). We retained reads that mapped uniquely and without mismatch. We considered reads mapping to a set of coding SNPs carefully curated to only contain SNPs with good mapping characteristics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Albert et al., 2014a</xref>) and counted the number of reads arising from each allele. Counts for multiple SNPs per gene were summed. We performed hypergeometric downsampling to account for a small difference (0.5%) in total read counts mapping to BY vs. RM alleles. Genes with fewer than 20 reads were discarded. Significance of ASE was gauged using a binomial test, and p-values Bonferroni-corrected for multiple testing. Effect sizes are expressed as log2-transformed fold changes, which in turn are calculated as the RM allele count divided by the BY allele count for each gene.</p><p>The Torabi and Albert dataset are independent replicates of a BY/RM hybrid. We can use this fact to gain confidence in significance calls (we keep track of whether a gene was determined to have significant ASE in one or both of the datasets) and the magnitude of ASE (for each gene, we use the mean log2 fold change of the two datasets). Across the two datasets, we had ASE data available for 3340 genes.</p><p>To compare effect sizes between eQTLs and ASE, we used log2-transformed eQTL fold changes re-computed on un-scaled expression data. ASE fold changes were computed as the log2 of the ratio of RM to BY allele counts. Comparisons of effect size across genes were performed using standardized major axis (SMA) analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Warton et al., 2012</xref>). To correlate ASE and eQTL effect sizes to the number of sequence variants upstream of each gene, we defined the upstream interval as the sequence upstream of the start codon up to the neighboring gene for a maximum of 1,000 bp. We acknowledge that the length of sequence considered is therefore different for different genes but believe that this is a reasonable approximation of the regulatory upstream regions in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Lin et al., 2010</xref>).

We focused on two variables: the effect size (i.e. fold change) and the total read coverage available for the given gene. ASE data is overdispersed compared to a binomial distribution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Castel et al., 2015</xref>). To properly account for this overdispersion in our simulations, we used the available ASE data to estimate the overdispersion parameter <italic>ρ</italic> in a beta-binomial distribution using the R function ‘optim’. We provided the function with the total read count and the observed allele count for each gene and used 0.5 as the ‘true’ probability of success. We estimated ρ separately for the Torabi and the Albert data and found that the latter was somewhat more overdispersed (<italic>ρ</italic> = 0.0054) than the former (<italic>ρ</italic> = 0.0041).</p><p>We confirmed that these overdispersion estimates fit the data reasonably well by generating simulated datasets using the observed read counts from the Albert and Torabi datasets for each gene, along with the estimated ρ’s. For each gene, we used the mean of the Albert and Torabi ASE fold changes to compute the target probability of success. These simulated data are meant to represent a random instance of allelic counts across genes, using distributions that closely mimic the real data. We generated 50 such datasets using the Albert and Torabi parameters, respectively. We computed all pairwise correlations between these simulated Albert and Torabi datasets. The median correlation coefficient across genes was <italic>r</italic> = 0.42 in the simulated data, compared to <italic>r</italic> = 0.39 for the observed Albert and Torabi data. Thus, while the simulations underestimate the overdispersion in the real data by a small amount, they provide a reasonable approximation.</p><p>We used these estimates of <italic>ρ</italic> to simulate 1000 instances of allele counts for several combinations of total read count and fold change (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). We computed power as the fraction of simulations in which a binomial test yielded p&lt;0.05 or p&lt;1.5e-5, the Bonferroni-corrected threshold for 3340 tests. We also computed the fraction of simulations in which the direction of fold change agreed with the true change.</p><p>These simulations show that power increases with increasing read counts and effect sizes. Crucially, even with very high sequencing depth of 5000 allele-specific reads per gene, the power to detect ASE of a magnitude typical for the majority of local eQTLs detected here is less than 60%. Most genes in the ASE data have substantially lower coverage: the median coverage is ~1000 in the Torabi data and ~200 in the Albert data. Thus, we expect to miss the ASE effects of the majority of local eQTLs.</p><p>To explore this relationship more precisely, we conducted gene-matched power simulations. For each gene, we conducted 100 simulations using the estimated ρ and sequencing coverage for the given ASE dataset. We used the observed eQTL fold changes to compute expected probabilities of success. We conducted these simulations separately for the Albert and Torabi data.</p></sec><sec id="s4-19"><title>Genes affected by hotspots</title><p>To estimate which genes are influenced by a given hotspot irrespective of whether these associations reached genome-wide significance for the given gene, we performed a targeted forward scan for linkage at the hotspot locations. For each chromosome and for each gene, we regressed out the effects of significant eQTLs detected on other chromosomes as well as the effects of technical covariates. Then, for each gene, we repeated the procedure described above under ‘Mapping additive eQTL’. However, here <italic>X</italic> was defined to be the set of detected hotspot markers for that chromosome, as well as either the closest marker to each gene or, if a gene had a genome-wide significant local eQTL, the local eQTL peak marker for that gene. The same FDR threshold (5%) was used to identify the best model for each gene. For each gene, coefficients for the effects of all significant markers identified by this procedure were determined by multiple regression.</p><p>The regression coefficients from this model were used to count the number of genes affected by a given hotspot (i.e. all nonzero entries) and to rank genes for inclusion in gene ontology (GO) and transcription factor (TF) binding site (TFBS) enrichments, and for plotting in networks. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sdata8">Source data 8</xref> also presents the number of genes with a genome-wide significant eQTL overlapping each hotspot.</p><p>For each hotspot, TFBS and GO enrichments were calculated on the 100 genes with the strongest increases or decreases in expression from the RM allele at the hotspot, respectively.

Because expression levels will become correlated when they are linked to the same hotspot, we wanted to estimate the underlying correlation matrix in a manner that is as free as possible from correlations induced by the hotspots. We fit a sparse conditional Gaussian graphical model (sCGGM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">Zhang and Kim, 2014</xref>]) to the expression data and the genotypes at the hotspot markers. sCGGM decomposes the total correlation matrix among gene expression levels into ‘direct’ effects of the genetic markers on each gene expression level as well as a matrix <italic>θ<sub>yy</sub></italic> of ‘indirect’ effects that genes exert on each other. We fit the model on a multi-core processor using an R installation compiled using the Intel Math Kernel Library to speed up linear algebra operations, as provided by the University of Minnesota Supercomputing Institute.

Prior to fitting, effects of experimental batch and yeast culture optical density were removed using a linear model. We also removed the effect of the marker closest to each gene. This latter correction was not performed for genes that reside in the window tested by bootstrapping around each hotspot, and for genes with a local eQTL that overlaps the given hotspot. We chose to keep the local effects for these genes because local eQTLs at these genes may underlie the hotspot, and we were interested in preserving such potential ‘direct’ local effects for our visualizations.</p><p>We used the entries of <italic>θ<sub>yy</sub></italic> to generate the network plots in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp6">Supplementary file 6</xref>.

Yeast chromosome ends contain complex structural variation that segregates among isolates and influences traits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Cubillos et al., 2011</xref>). In some cases, BY and RM differ for the presence of entire subtelomeric blocks of genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bergström et al., 2014</xref>). When a hotspot arises from these regions, the identity of the causal gene cannot be determined using our present segregant panel because each segregant either carries all or none of the genes in these regions. Further, the marker map we used for mapping stops at the borders of these regions. Therefore, these hotspots often have very sharp bootstrap distributions on the first or last marker of the linkage map on the given chromosome. We excluded subtelomeric hotspots from the analyses of genes located in hotspots because the position of the final marker on a chromosome is unlikely to reflect the position of the causal gene, which may well be located distally to the marker. We excluded 13 hotspots whose peak marker is within 5 kb of the end of our linkage map. We focused the remaining analyses of hotspot genes on 26 non-subtelomeric hotspots with confidence regions that contain three or fewer genes, for a total of 58 genes.</p><p>To analyze features of genes located in hotspots, we performed multiple logistic regression. The dependent variable indicates whether or not a gene resides in one of these hotspots, and the set of gene features described above served as potential predictor variables. Significance tests were performed using likelihood ratio tests for dropping each term from a full additive model without interactions, as implemented in the R car package.</p><p>Gene ontology analysis on these genes was conducted using Fisher’s exact test in topGO (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Alexa et al., 2006</xref>). Genes in the yeast genome tend to be clustered in co-localized groups with similar functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Hurst et al., 2004</xref>). To test if this clustering influences our GO analyses of genes located in hotspots, we performed a randomization analysis. We sampled 1000 sets of 58 neighboring genes that mirror the distribution of the number of genes across the 26 hotspots. For each set, we performed the same GO enrichment analysis as for the actual 58 hotspot genes. Within each set, we counted the number of significant (at p&lt;0.05) GO terms and used the fraction of this distribution that matched or exceeded the number observed in the real set as an empirical p-value for whether the enrichment was globally significant. This test showed significantly more enriched terms than randomly expected for the GO Biological Process category (p=0.001), but only a marginal excess for Molecular Function (p=0.060) and no significant excess for Cellular Compartment (p=0.695).</p><p>This analysis is conservative because in the real data we considered GO terms at much more stringent p-value cutoffs than ≤0.05. We further explored the FDR for GO term enrichment at more stringent p-values by dividing the mean number of terms significant at a given threshold across the permutations by the number of significant terms observed in real data. We found that for Biological Process, FDR was &lt;0.05 for GO enrichments with p&lt;0.005, which includes all terms described in the paper.</p><p>Finally, we computed an empirical p-value for each GO term by asking how often its observed p-value is matched or exceeded in the permutations. This analysis controls for different sizes and compositions of the different GO terms. All terms reported to be significant in the text had p&lt;0.001 in these analyses; enrichments as strong or exceeding the observed ones were never seen in 1000 random gene sets.

We chose this effect size measure because it, like the BSA allele frequency estimates, is bounded by −1 and 1, resulting in more easily interpretable scatterplots. Using other measures of eQTL effect such as multiple regression coefficients did not change our conclusions about pQTL overlap.</p><p>For the comparison of strong eQTLs to significant pQTLs, we defined ‘strong’ eQTLs as those eQTLs that explained ≥3.5% of phenotypic variance. Our eQTL data had ≥99% power to detect such eQTLs. Under the assumption that the bulk-segregant based pQTL data had similar statistical power as the current eQTL data, these eQTLs should be easily detectable as pQTL if their effects on proteins are similarly strong. For the comparison of strong pQTLs to significant eQTLs, we defined ‘strong’ pQTLs as pQTLs with LOD ≥15. This threshold was chosen to pick a set of strong pQTLs that had similar size (218 pQTLs) to the set of strong eQTLs (238 eQTLs).</p><p>For eQTLs that did not overlap a significant pQTL or vice versa, we used the effect size point estimate at the respective peak position in the non-significant dataset for plotting in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B and D</xref> and for results presented in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp8">Supplementary files 8</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp10">10</xref>. Data underlying these analyses is available as <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sdata13">Source data 13</xref>.</p><p>To compute π<sub>1</sub> at eQTL positions in X-pQTL data, we summed counts for 21 SNPs centered on the given eQTL marker for the BY and RM allele in the high and low GFP populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Albert et al., 2014b</xref>), performed a G-test on these summed counts, and analyzed the resulting p-values using the qvalue package in R (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Storey and Tibshirani, 2003</xref>). We chose to sum counts from multiple SNPs because in X-QTL data with relatively low sequencing coverage, the counts at any one SNP are subject to counting noise. For reference, π<sub>1</sub> computed based only at the nearest SNP to each eQTL was 0.14 for the comparison using all eQTLs, compared to 0.66 using the 21 SNP window. We computed π<sub>1</sub> on 5 sets of randomly selected genome positions. These random π<sub>1</sub> values were all ≤0.52. These high random estimates reflect the high density of X-pQTLs in the genome as well as a potential upward bias due to our choice of SNP window, but are all clearly lower than the observed value.</p><p>To compute π<sub>1</sub> at pQTL positions in eQTL data, we performed t-tests comparing the normalized expression levels for segregants with the BY allele at pQTL markers to those with the RM allele. The resulting p-values were analyzed using the qvalue package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Storey and Tibshirani, 2003</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-22"><title>Genetic interactions</title><p>For each transcript with at least one significant additive eQTL, we fit a model that included the batch and growth covariates, the significant additive eQTLs, and a random effect for polygenic background. The residuals from this model were used for the detection of eQTL-eQTL interactions.</p><p>The set of markers used for the detection of eQTL-eQTL interactions was reduced to 3106 using the findCorrelation function in the R package caret (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/caret/index.html">https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/caret/index.html</ext-link>), using a cutoff of 0.99. All unique combinations of markers were tested for each transcript, with the exclusion of the 20 closest markers on the same chromosome. eQTL-eQTL peaks, including the rare case of closely linked eQTL-eQTL interactions occurring on the same chromosome pair, were identified using custom code provided in our code repository. The same procedure was repeated for five random permutations of segregant identities. A false discovery rate was calculated as the ratio of expected to observed peaks at different LOD thresholds. A false discovery rate for the marginal scan was calculated as the ratio of expected to observed peaks at different LOD thresholds for the subset of marker pairs where one of the pairs had a significant additive effect. False discovery rate was controlled at 10% for both scans.</p><p>Additionally, we tested a model of eQTL-eQTL interactions between significant additive eQTLs only. For each gene, we regressed out the effects of significant additive eQTLs, the effect of polygenic background, and the effects of technical covariates. Then, for each gene we tested only the eQTL-eQTL interaction effect between significant additive eQTL markers. This procedure involved the peak markers detected in the section on eQTL mapping without any marker downsampling. An F-statistic was calculated for each test. The same procedure was repeated 10 times with permutations of segregant identities. From the permutations, the expected number of significant eQTL-eQTL linkages was calculated at various thresholds. False discovery rate was controlled at 10% for this procedure. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sdata14">Source data 14</xref> lists all identified genetic interactions.</p><p>Circle plots were generated using the ggBio package in R (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Yin et al., 2012</xref>).

The five genes with the maximum identified number of 21 eQTLs included the gene <italic>OCH1</italic> as well as two pairs of genes that are physically located right next to each other, respectively. In each pair, the upstream gene (<italic>NIT1</italic> and <italic>AQY2</italic>, respectively) is annotated as a protein coding gene, while the downstream genes (YIL165C and YLL053C, respectively) is annotated as a ‘putative’ protein. In several yeast strains other than the reference strain (a version of which is the BY strain we use here), these gene pairs each form a single open reading frame (ORF). In BY, this ORF is interrupted by a premature stop codon, resulting in truncated ORF annotations. The fact that BY tolerates the presence of a premature stop variant in these genes suggests that these genes are under low evolutionary constraint, which may help explain why these genes are also tolerant of regulatory influences from a large number of eQTLs.</p></sec><sec id="s4-23-2"><title>Supplementary discussion 2 – Comparison of heritability to various gene features</title><p>We asked whether the heritability for each gene was correlated with various gene characteristics. Heritability was positively correlated with expression level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). This result may in part be caused by higher power in more highly expressed genes. Therefore, we controlled for expression level in a multivariate analysis that tested the correlation of various gene features with heritability while controlling for all other features, including gene expression level.</p><p>Genes with higher heritability were less likely to be essential and had fewer protein-protein interaction and synthetic genetic interaction partners (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). This suggests that highly connected ‘hub’ genes with many interaction partners may be less tolerant of regulatory variation. The amino acid sequence of genes with higher heritability evolved more slowly, perhaps reflecting higher sequence conservation.</p><p>Genes with higher heritability were enriched (T-test of heritability of genes in GO group vs. genes not in GO group as implemented in topGO (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Alexa et al., 2006</xref>) for biological processes involved in mitochondrial function and cellular respiration (e.g. GO:0055114 ‘oxidation-reduction process’: p&lt;1e-30; GO:0045333 ‘cellular respiration’: p=5e-8). In yeast, respiration is an optional and highly regulated means of energy production, and it is conceivable that the respiratory machinery provides a disproportionally large target for regulatory genetic variation.</p><p>Genes with lower heritability were enriched for processes involved in general biogenesis (e.g. GO:0042254 ‘ribosome biogenesis’ p&lt;1e-30, GO:0010467 ‘gene expression’ p=2e-25, and GO:0000278 ‘mitotic cell cycle’ p&lt;1e-30), suggesting that these cellular processes may be less tolerant of regulatory variation.</p><p>The 28 genes with the highest heritability of at least 0.9 were strongly enriched for genes involved in yeast mating. For example, they included five out of seven genes annotated as ‘regulation of mating-type specific transcription, DNA-templated’ (GO:0007532, p=4e-11). The yeast mating type pathway involves the <bold>a</bold> and alpha mating types that are determined by alternative alleles at the mating type locus. Each mating type expresses a set of highly abundant genes that are almost completely shut off in the other mating type. Our mapping population includes both mating types at equal frequency. Genes involved in mating are thus expected to fall into two genetically determined groups in which their expression is either very high or nearly absent, resulting in high heritability across the segregant population.</p></sec><sec id="s4-23-3"><title>Supplementary discussion 3 – Relationship of eQTL number and heritability</title><p>The number of eQTLs that influenced a given gene was correlated with heritability (r = 0.56, p&lt;2.2e-16, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B</xref>), as expected if each additional eQTL adds to the genetic variance. However, among genes with the highest heritability (423 genes with h<sup>2</sup> ≥0.6), heritability was negatively correlated with the number of eQTLs (r = −0.47, p&lt;2.2e-16; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B</xref>). For these genes, the strongest eQTL accounts for a progressively larger fraction of heritability (r = 0.56, p&lt;2.2e-16, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2C &amp; D</xref>), while for genes with lower heritability this relationship was slightly negative (r = −0.04, p=0.001). Thus, while the lower heritability typical of most genes tended to arise from multiple eQTLs that each had small to intermediate effect, high heritability tended to arise from single, strong eQTLs. The single eQTLs that by themselves generated heritability of ≥0.9 were all local eQTLs for genes in regions of the genome with high, structurally complex variation (e.g. the <italic>ENA</italic> locus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Treusch et al., 2015</xref>) or subtelomeres [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bergström et al., 2014</xref>]), as well as the gene <italic>HO</italic>, which is deleted in our RM but not in the BY strain.</p></sec><sec id="s4-23-4"><title>Supplementary discussion 4 – Allele-specific expression analyses</title><p>To estimate the fraction of local eQTLs that act in <italic>cis</italic> vs. in <italic>trans</italic>, we compared the local eQTLs to RNA-Seq data from a diploid BY/RM hybrid. In the hybrid, <italic>trans</italic>-acting genetic variation influences both alleles at a gene similarly. By contrast, <italic>cis</italic> effects can be detected as an allelic imbalance in expression (also called 'allele specific expression', ASE) between the BY and the RM allele. We analyzed two independent BY/RM hybrid datasets and quantified ASE for 3340 genes that have at least one variant in their coding sequence. Of these, 1974 (59%) had a genome-wide significant local eQTL.</p><p>Genes with significant ASE (Bonferroni-corrected p&lt;0.05) had more local eQTLs than expected by chance (at least one significant ASE dataset: 451/598 genes, p&lt;2.2e-16, odds ratio (OR)=2.5; both ASE datasets significant: 100/121; p=3e-8, OR=3.4). Most genes with ASE but without a local eQTL had ASE of very small magnitude. For these genes, the local eQTLs that would be expected to correspond to the ASE may have been missed in spite of high power in our current dataset. The remaining genes with ASE but without a local eQTL were located very close to strong eQTLs that may have been misclassified as distant (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A and B</xref>). Overall, significant ASE typically resulted in a detectable local eQTL.</p><p>We next examined what fraction of the local eQTLs arises in <italic>cis</italic> from ASE vs. from local <italic>trans</italic> acting variation. A simulation analysis of the diploid hybrid data showed that even if there is perfect agreement between ASE and local eQTLs, the statistical power to detect ASE of the magnitude typical for most local eQTLs is limited (Materials and Methods, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). Indeed, 77% (1523/1974) of the local eQTLs did not have significant ASE. Those local eQTLs that had significant ASE had larger effects than those that did not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Of the 35 local eQTLs for which power to detect ASE was at least 80%, 30 had ASE in at least one ASE dataset (26 in both datasets; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D</xref>). Thus, most cases of missing ASE were probably due to low statistical power, rather than caused by local <italic>trans</italic> effects. We present genes with the strongest discrepancies between ASE and local eQTLs in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary files 2, 3 and 4</xref>.</p><p>Regulatory sequence variants in upstream regulatory regions such as the promoter are expected to act in <italic>cis</italic> and should result in both ASE and local eQTLs. Genes vary in the number of variants in their upstream regions. While the number of upstream variants was only weakly correlated with ASE (Spearman’s rho = 0.04, p=0.01), there was a stronger correlation with the fold changes of local eQTLs (rho=0.23, p&lt;2.2e-16). This analysis is imperfect because not every upstream variant has effects on expression, and because multiple variants with opposite effects could cancel each other’s effect on expression. Therefore, <italic>cis</italic> effects are not expected to be a simple function of upstream variant number. Nevertheless, better correlation of variant number with local eQTLs than with ASE is consistent with <italic>cis</italic> regulatory effects that were better detected in the current well-powered eQTL data than in the available ASE data.</p><p>The absolute values of the fold changes agreed remarkably well between ASE and local eQTLs. The standardized major axis (SMA) slope for all local eQTL effects compared to ASE was 0.94 (r<sup>2</sup>=0.45, p&lt;2.2e-16). Thus, the effects of <italic>cis</italic>-acting variation on allelic expression were typically carried forward to local eQTLs of nearly the same magnitude. The SMA slope was just less than one (confidence interval 0.91–0.97), which may indicate a small tendency for local <italic>trans</italic>-acting variation to buffer some <italic>cis</italic>-acting variants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bader et al., 2015</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-23-5"><title>Supplementary discussion 5 – Comparison of eQTLs and protein QTLs (pQTLs)</title><p>The main text presents a comparison focused on the strongest distant eQTLs and pQTLs. The results for all genome-wide significant distant QTLs, as well as for local QTLs are presented here.</p><p>The 154 genes that were present in both our current dataset and our earlier X-pQTL data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Albert et al., 2014b</xref>) had 1,059 distant eQTLs and 1,024 distant pQTLs. Of these eQTLs, 30% (321) overlapped a pQTL, while of the pQTLs, 31% (314) overlapped an eQTL. The number of overlapping QTLs differed between these two comparisons because a QTL in one dataset can overlap two neighboring QTLs in the other dataset due to wide confidence intervals of weaker QTLs. Of the overlapping QTLs, 77% (254 / 331) had the same direction of effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). π1 statistics suggested that 66% of all distant eQTLs have a matching pQTL, while 47% of all distant pQTLs match an eQTL. These estimates for overlap among all distant QTLs are lower than those for strong QTLs reported in the main text. This is expected, given the small effect sizes of most distant QTLs will frequently be missed even when comparing two datasets with high statistical power.</p><p>Our X-pQTL dataset comprised experiments for testing the effects of local pQTLs for 41 genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Albert et al., 2014b</xref>), which revealed local pQTLs for 21 genes (at a LOD of &gt;3). From the current mRNA data, we observed local eQTLs for 27 of these 41 genes. We found both a local pQTL and a local eQTL for 16 genes, which was not more than expected by chance (one-sided Fisher’s exact test, p=0.14, odds ratio=2.6). However, there was a positive correlation between effect sizes for local eQTLs and pQTLs for all 41 genes (Spearman’s rho=0.6, p=0.0001). Tests for local pQTLs with high statistical power at more genes will be necessary to draw firm conclusions about the agreement of local eQTLs and pQTLs.</p></sec></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Noorossadat Torabi for unpublished ASE data, Meru Sadhu and Olga Schubert for comments on the manuscript, and the Minnesota Supercomputing Institute (MSI) at the University of Minnesota for computational resources.</p></ack><sec id="s5" sec-type="additional-information"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf2"><p>Reviewing editor, <italic>eLife</italic></p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Data curation, Software, Formal analysis, Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing—original draft, Project administration, Writing—review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Data curation, Software, Formal analysis, Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing—original draft, Project administration, Writing—review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Investigation, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Investigation, Collected a substantial portion of the data</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Writing—original draft, Project administration, Writing—review and editing</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec id="s6" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="sdata1"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.35471.021</object-id><label>Source data 1.</label><caption><title>Expression values.</title><p>This xlsx file contains expression levels in units of log2(TPM) for all genes and segregants.</p></caption><media mime-subtype="zip" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-35471-data1-v2.zip"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="sdata2"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.35471.022</object-id><label>Source data 2.</label><caption><title>Covariates.</title><p>This xlsx file contains information on experimental batch and growth covariates for all segregants.</p></caption><media mime-subtype="xlsx" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-35471-data2-v2.xlsx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="sdata3"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.35471.023</object-id><label>Source data 3.</label><caption><title>Genotypes.</title><p>This xlsx file contains genotypes at 42,052 markers for all segregants.

Each page shows three gene co-expression networks. Each network displays connections among genes with the strongest linkages to the hotspot. The left plots show genes with higher expression in the presence of the RM allele. The middle plot shows genes with higher expression in the presence of the BY allele. The left and middle panels each show up to 50 genes with the strongest linkages to the hotspot in the given direction. If fewer than 50 genes were affected by the hotspot in the given direction, all genes affected in this direction are plotted, and their number indicated in the panel title. The right panel shows the joint network formed by the genes in the left and middle panel, with colors indicating up- or down-regulation by the hotspot. Genes with local eQTL located in the 95% confidence interval for hotspot location are indicated by red circles. Genes local eQTL located anywhere in the region tested by bootstraps are indicated by orange circles.

A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Genetics of <italic>trans</italic>-regulatory variation in gene expression&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Patricia Wittkopp as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This manuscript makes use of an elegant experimental design to investigate how genetic variation influences gene expression in <italic>cis</italic> and <italic>trans</italic>. Using over a thousand genotyped segregants from a cross between two yeast strains, the authors investigate how inherited genetic variation accounts for differences in gene expression levels as measured by RNA-seq. The eQTL catalogue is fairly exhaustive and explains over 70% of the heritability in gene expression levels. The authors report that while 50% of genes harbor local, relatively large-effect <italic>cis</italic>-eQTLs, the aggregate effect of <italic>trans</italic>-acting eQTLs typically outweigh that of local variation. Those <italic>trans</italic>-eQTLs cluster in a small number of hotspots that are responsible for the majority of gene expression variation, likely due to reverberating indirect effects through the cell machinery. The study involves a large amount of experimental work and seems to have been designed with great care.</p><p>Concerns were raised about the novelty of many of the findings in this study relative to prior work, but the reviewers and editor were ultimately swayed to support publication based on the advance in rigor and resolution provided by this work combined with some new findings for the field. There were also other issues raised, however, that we think can be successfully addressed in a revision within the next 2 months.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Figures are quite poorly designed. Figure 5 is a particularly egregious example: panel B would be more readable as a violin plot, and there is definitely a better way to present panel A than grey lines of variable width with no legend. Color heatmaps such as used for chromosome contacts data come to mind. Similar concerns stand for Figure 1B and D, Figure 2A and Figure 4.</p><p>2) Most of the biological interpretation on <italic>trans</italic>-eQTLs hotspots relies on Gene Ontology analyses, and is rather weak and speculative. Considering that these hotspots contain variants with the ability to reverberate through the gene expression network and influence many genes, a more thorough analysis would have been appreciated: are some transcription factor binding sites overrepresented in those hotspots overall? How do these hotspots relate to the 3D structure of the genome? Do they exhibit special features relative to gene organization? During our discussion, we were unable to identify a particular set of analyses that would best address this point, however, so are passing along this comment for your consideration only.</p><p>3) The analysis on eQTLs with epistatic effects fell very short considering that, as the authors note, this study design is one of the few that can identify such interactions. Please expand the discussion and, if necessary, analyses in this section.</p><p>4) Relating these findings in yeast to human cells may be more complicated than suggested in the text. Please either better justify or tone down this extrapolation. Some differences articulated by one of the reviewers:</p><p>Much throughout the text, the authors draw links between the genetic architectures of gene expression levels in yeasts and in humans. While there are indeed similarities in the numbers, e.g. the median heritability of gene expression levels, or <italic>trans</italic>-variants accounting for 2-3X more expression variation than <italic>cis</italic>-variants, I do not think that there is enough evidence that the conclusions and observations made in this work applies to human cells (which I felt was implicit in the text). In fact, I do not think that the observations here apply to humans:</p><p>For example, there is limited to no evidence from current human data that <italic>trans</italic>-eQTLs cluster in a very small number of genomic regions. Even with the few number of <italic>trans</italic>-eQTLs that were found in data from GTEx (100-500 per tissue, I believe?), we would expect to see significant clustering. I am not sure if anyone has looked into this or seen this? The authors write that &quot;the limited number of human <italic>trans</italic>-eQTL discovered to date also tend to influence the expression of multiple genes […] suggesting that a similar hotspot-dominated architecture could underlie human expression variation&quot; but I find that quite unconvincing.</p><p>From Figure 1C, it seems that distant (<italic>trans</italic>) eQTLs explain typically 0.5-1X as much gene expression level variation compared to <italic>cis</italic>-eQTLs. I believe that in humans, the difference is much larger, i.e. <italic>trans</italic> eQTLs explain only 0.01 times to 0.05 times as much gene expression level variation as <italic>cis</italic>-eQTLs. Because the <italic>trans</italic> vs <italic>cis</italic> contributions are similar between humans and yeast, this could imply that <italic>trans</italic>-eQTLs for human genes are distributed far more uniformly than for yeast genes.</p><p>Furthermore another difference is that we would expect a strong enrichment for coding variants for the human trans-eQTLs that were found in previous studies, which does not seem to be case. Might there be strong selection against trans-variants with ubiquitous effects in humans?</p><p>For these reasons, I would suggest either the author to provide evidence that their conclusions apply to human, or explicitly caution readers against this interpretation.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.35471.062</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Figures are quite poorly designed.

Specifically, these figures show:</p><p>Figure 9: Locations and examples of markers that form epistatic interactions in <italic>trans.</italic></p><p>Figure 10: Locations and examples of markers that form <italic>cis</italic> by <italic>trans</italic> epistatic interactions.</p><p>In Figures 9 and 10, we have chosen to represent interactions as circle plots. We have explored visualizations using heatmaps as suggested by the reviewers but decided against this representation because the interactions are relatively sparse, so that heatmaps are dominated by uninformative white space.</p><p>Figure 11: A revised version of the former Figure 5B, showing the distribution of effects from additive eQTLs vs. pairwise interactions. This figure now incorporates a violin plot, following the reviewers’ suggestions.</p><p>Figure 12: Examples of interactions without detectable additive effects.</p><p>Figure 1B has been altered by changing the alpha value of the points to make the shape of the center of the cloud more visible. We have also added a new panel 1D showing the distribution of heritability explained across all genes. We believe that these revised panels, 1B and 1D, completely represent this important information.</p><p>The former Figure 1D has been replaced by a new Figure 2. Panel 2B is the former inset of Figure 1D, while the new panel 2A is much more detailed visualization of the contribution of local and distant eQTLs.</p><p>We have chosen to leave Figure 2A (now 3A) unchanged. We had carefully thought about representing the entire eQTL set in a single panel and tried multiple different visualizations for our initial submission. We believe that this figure is a vivid and informative way to display the overall result of the paper, in terms of 1) the dense diagonal of many, strong local eQTLs, 2) the highly non-uniform distribution of the <italic>trans</italic> eQTLs, 3) the <italic>trans</italic>-depleted regions we discuss later in the text, and 4) differences in effect sizes among eQTLs.</p><p>We have made subtle visual changes to Figure 4B (now 6B), and, more importantly, added an inset to Figure 6B that shows the difference between the expectation and observation for each eQTL bin.</p><p>We have chosen to leave Figure 4A (now 6A) as is. We believe that the current display is an accurate and informative representation of both the random distribution (in particular, it highlights the high number of local eQTLs per hotspot expected by chance) as well as the slight but significant enrichment in real data.</p><p>We have moved the part of former Figure S6 on the <italic>ERC1</italic> hotspot into the main text (now Figure 5). We also moved the two figures about eQTL/pQTL agreement into the main text (now Figures 7 and 8).</p><p>We added two figure supplements for Figure 4 (Figure 4—figure supplement 1 and Figure 4—figure supplement 2) on our new result on hotspots at transcription factors with damaging mutations.</p><p>Together, we believe these changes greatly improve the visual accessibility of our results. We thank the reviewers for their guidance to reconsider how we had displayed our results.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Most of the biological interpretation on trans-eQTLs hotspots relies on Gene Ontology analyses, and is rather weak and speculative.

During our discussion, we were unable to identify a particular set of analyses that would best address this point, however, so are passing along this comment for your consideration only.</p></disp-quote><p>We have carefully considered these suggestions and performed additional analyses as detailed below. In addition, we suspect that our previous manuscript may have been too laconic in pointing out the many analyses we had in fact performed on each hotspot, and which were presented in a series of supplementary data and image files. We have now added expanded text to the results drawing attention to these files, and have moved parts of former Figure S6 (now Figure 5) to the main text.</p><p>We have also performed additional analyses of transcription factor genes with damaging variants. Strikingly, we found that out of 8 such genes in our cross, 6 did reside in a hotspot, often very close to the hotspot peak. One of the remaining two cases may be explained by incorrect gene annotation in the reference genome (the variant does not in fact reside in a coding region), while the other involves a frameshift very late in the coding region, perhaps limiting its effect on gene function. We have added these analyses to the Results and Discussion and have added two figure supplements (Figure 4—figure supplements 2 and 3) displaying these results. We are grateful to the reviewers and editor for their recommendation to revisit the transcription factors enrichment.</p><p>Regarding the reviewers’ specific suggestions:</p><p>We tested if the genes in the narrow hotspot regions we use in the main text were enriched for having transcription factor binding sites (TFBS). We did not find any convincing enrichment beyond what is expected by chance. We note that no such enrichment is expected <italic>a priori</italic> because it is not clear why multiple, independent hotspots across the genome should happen to be targets of a given transcription factor (this is the reason we had not performed such an analysis before). We have decided not to add these analyses to the manuscript. We do stress that the target genes of each hotspot had of course been tested for TFBS enrichment, and these analyses were summarized in Supplementary file 10 and fully detailed in the Materials and methods. Our expanded exposition of these tables may help address this comment.</p><p>We also tested whether there is enrichment for chromatin contacts between hotspot regions and their target genes, using data from Duan et al., 2010 (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20436457), focusing on the HindIII-dreived contacts as Duan et al. did in their paper. We counted contacts between each hotspot and its targets, and found that these closely matched the distribution expected by chance, if target genes were assigned to hotspots at random. The most significant “enrichment” was for the <italic>IRA2</italic> locus, which had a randomization p-value of 0.005. We note that this is no better than expected by chance given that we tested 102 hotspots.</p><p>We point out that the assumption for distant eQTL hotspots in yeast is to act in <italic>trans</italic>, i.e. via a diffusible factor. This has indeed been found for every hotspot for which the causal gene is known so far (including <italic>IRA2</italic>). Further, gene regulation in yeast does not involve distant enhancers that act by distant chromatin contacts. Yeast interphase chromatin is organized such that inter-chromosomal contacts are largely determined by chromosomal position and length, rather than regulatory contacts between distant loci (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22940469). As such, no enrichment of chromatin contacts between a hotspot and its targets would be expected <italic>a priori</italic>. Given these considerations, we have chosen not to include these (negative and expected) results in the paper.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The analysis on eQTLs with epistatic effects fell very short considering that, as the authors note, this study design is one of the few that can identify such interactions. Please expand the discussion and, if necessary, analyses in this section.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for this prompt to expand the Results and Discussion sections. We have now added more detailed analyses of the epistatic pairs identified by the fully unbiased search and have added or expanded the following key observations to the paper, along with new and revised figures:</p><p>– Many interactions involve additive <italic>trans</italic>-hotspots (Figure 9).</p><p>– Many interactions involve a local and a distant eQTL (Figure 10).</p><p>– Most epistatic pairs involve markers that also show additive effects.</p><p>– There are hardly any instances of purely non-additive effects (Figure 12 presents the best examples).</p><p>We have expanded our Discussion accordingly, in which we stress that while epistatic interactions clearly exist, their overall contribution to expression variance is small.</p><p>We have also expanded the information given in Dataset 14, which now presents the locations as well as effects of each detected epistatic pair.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Relating these findings in yeast to human cells may be more complicated than suggested in the text.

It was not our intention to imply that our results would directly translate to humans. We have carefully searched the text for statements that could be understood that way and have edited them accordingly. We have also added two paragraphs to the Discussion that make explicit where we do and do not see parallels between yeast and human eQTL results, and which lessons for human eQTL studies can and cannot be drawn from our current work.</p><p>We address this reviewer’s specific comments below.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>For example, there is limited to no evidence from current human data that trans-eQTLs cluster in a very small number of genomic regions.

This result has been seen beginning with the earliest well-powered searches for human <italic>trans</italic> eQTLs (e.g. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3150446/) and has recently culminated in evidence for “hundreds of <italic>trans</italic>-eQTLs [that] each affect hundreds of transcripts” (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5384037/). We acknowledge that this point had been addressed only in passing in our manuscript. We have added a review paragraph in the Discussion providing an extended, current set of human <italic>trans</italic> eQTL references expanding on this point.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>From Figure 1C, it seems that distant (trans) eQTLs explain typically 0.5-1X as much gene expression level variation compared to cis-eQTLs.

Nevertheless, we acknowledge the reviewer’s point, and have added explicit language to the discussion stating that human <italic>trans</italic> eQTLs may be more uniformly distributed than we see in our yeast cross. Resolution of this question will require further research in humans. We do find it relevant to state (and have done so in the Discussion), that early eQTL searches in this cross have revealed much sparser <italic>trans</italic> architectures than we now see, suggesting that human <italic>trans</italic> eQTLs may yet follow a similar route of discovery. We have also added text enumerating some of the reasons (more variation, more complex gene regulation, more genes, and cell-type-specificity) for which the human <italic>trans</italic> eQTL landscape may turn out to be even more complex than what we observed here.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Furthermore another difference is that we would expect a strong enrichment for coding variants for the human trans-eQTLs that were found in previous studies, which does not seem to be case.

We wholeheartedly agree that the question of the molecular nature of causal variants underlying <italic>trans</italic> eQTLs is highly interesting.</p><p>We also agree that the action of selection on causal variants is an exciting topic. However, we feel that a deep exploration of this important question is beyond the scope of our current manuscript.
