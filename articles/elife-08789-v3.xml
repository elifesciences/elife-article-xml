A similar relationship has also been established between GABA levels in the posteromedial cortex and the strength of the default mode network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Kapogiannis et al., 2013</xref>).

In line with previous findings, we demonstrated that, at baseline, GABA levels within M1 correlate with the strength of the motor network at rest. We have also replicated the previous finding that anodal tDCS reduces GABA concentration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Stagg et al., 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">2011a</xref>) and increases functional connectivity in the stimulated cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Sehm et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Amadi et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Stagg et al., 2014</xref>). However, we show for the first time that the magnitude of these changes does not correlate across subjects, suggesting that they may be driven by distinct underlying mechanisms. We also provide novel evidence on the time course of GABA change with anodal tDCS and demonstrate that the previously described reduction in GABA is most prominent in the 30 min period after stimulation.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Effects of anodal tDCS on GABA</title><p>As predicted, we saw a significant decrease in GABA levels in response to anodal tDCS with effects developing during stimulation and persisting for at least 30 min following stimulation. These results extend those of previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Stagg et al., 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">2011a</xref>), in which we were not able to acquire data during stimulation, and data were only acquired for 20 min post stimulation. As we could not practically continue beyond 30 min, it is not clear how long it would take for GABA to fully return to baseline after the stimulation period. Previous neurophysiological data show an increase in cortical excitability lasting for 90 min following 13 min of 1 mA anodal tDCS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Nitsche and Paulus, 2001</xref>), suggesting that much longer scan times may be required to fully track the time course of tDCS-induced GABA changes.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Relationship between GABA and functional connectivity changes</title><p>To our knowledge, this is the first study to directly test for relationships between GABA and resting fMRI both at baseline and after plasticity induction. At baseline, in line with previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Kapogiannis et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Stagg et al., 2014</xref>), we found a significant negative correlation between the degree of resting inhibition in M1 and the degree of motor network functional connectivity. This finding reflects strong evidence from experimental and theoretical studies that long-range connectivity relates to local oscillatory activity in the beta and gamma bands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Cabral et al., 2011</xref>), activity which in turn is directly determined by local GABA<sub>A</sub> synaptic activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Hall et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>A number of studies have directly investigated the relationship between MRS-assessed GABA and oscillatory activity in the gamma range, with earlier studies demonstrating a direct relationship between the two measures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Edden et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Muthukumaraswamy et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Gaetz et al., 2011</xref>), findings that have not been replicated in a subsequent larger study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cousijn et al., 2014</xref>). There may be a number of reasons for the lack of a consistent relationship between MRS-assessed GABA and gamma oscillations. GABA MRS is likely relatively insensitive to synaptic GABA<sub>A</sub> activity, more closely reflecting extra-synaptic GABAergic tone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Stagg et al., 2011b</xref>). While at baseline functional GABA<sub>A</sub> synaptic activity and GABAergic tone may be related, they are unlikely to be perfectly correlated, meaning that MRS-assessed GABA and gamma oscillations should not necessarily be expected to be tightly related. In addition, although there is extensive data from animal models to demonstrate a clear relationship between beta and gamma oscillatory activity and GABA<sub>A</sub> activity, it is not necessarily clear how best to quantify oscillatory activity derived from MEG to most clearly demonstrate a similar relationship. It may be therefore, that differences in the acquisition or analysis of the MEG data mean that any relationship between gamma oscillations and GABA is difficult to reproduce using the techniques available in humans. Similarly, small differences in GABA MRS acquisition and analysis approaches may potentially impact on GABA estimates in ways that are not completely understood.</p><p>There was no significant relationship found between the tDCS-induced change in GABA levels and change in functional connectivity within the motor network.</p><p>There are a number of potential explanations for this lack of a relationship after plasticity induction, and we are unable to distinguish between these here. It may be that the time course of the tDCS-induced changes in GABA and functional connectivity are different, meaning that a direct comparison between functional connectivity immediately after stimulation and a later post-stimulation GABA measure would not demonstrate the expected relationship. In addition, as discussed in detail above, GABA MRS is likely relatively insensitive to synaptic GABA<sub>A</sub> activity, more closely reflecting extra-synaptic GABAergic tone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Stagg et al., 2011b</xref>). It may be therefore, that extra-synaptic GABA tone and GABA<sub>A</sub> synaptic activity are differentially modulated by tDCS, and hence MRS-assessed GABA is not a good surrogate marker for the change in oscillatory activity in the gamma and beta bands after stimulation, and hence long-range functional connectivity, which may be primarily dependent on GABA<sub>A</sub> synaptic activity. Alternatively, it may be that the relationship between GABA and functional connectivity is not causal and driven perhaps by another factor which we have not quantified. This seems unlikely given the evidence supporting the role of GABA in local oscillatory activity, and hence long-term connectivity but cannot be ruled out.</p><p>Given the close biochemical relationship between GABA and glutamate, GABA measures are unlikely to reflect overall changes in cortical excitability per se, and indeed no direct relationship between measures of GABA and cortical excitability has been demonstrated previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Stagg et al., 2011b</xref>). The expected increases in cortical excitability following anodal tDCS have been shown to be multifactorial, and certainly are driven by modulation of both GABAergic and glutamatergic signalling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Stagg and Nitsche, 2011</xref>). It is worth noting, however, that the time course of GABA changes demonstrated here are broadly in line with those shown previously using paired pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation (ppTMS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Nitsche et al., 2005</xref>). We did not acquire measures of excitability during or following tDCS in the subjects studied here. Future work could acquire excitability data over a similar time course to the one studied here using an interleaved TMS/MRI approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Siebner et al., 2003</xref>), in order to test directly for any agreement between tDCS-induced changes in GABA and changes in excitability.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Participants</title><p>Twelve healthy participants (four males; aged 22–28 years, mean 24 years) gave their informed consent to participate in this study in accordance with ethical approval from the East London Research Ethics Committee (Ref: 10/H0703/50). All participants were right handed as assessed by the Edinburgh Handedness Inventory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Oldfield, 1971</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Experimental design</title><p>All subjects participated in two testing sessions with either anodal or sham tDCS. The sessions were separated by at least one week and the order of the sessions was counterbalanced across the group. In each experimental session, GABA measurements were acquired at three time points: at baseline, during, and post-tDCS. Measures of resting state connectivity were acquired at baseline and immediately post-tDCS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>tDCS</title><p>A DC-Stimulator (Magstim, Ltd; UK) delivered a 1-mA current to the brain via electrodes measuring 5 × 7 cm (Easycap, GmbH; Germany). One electrode was centred over the left M1 and positioned 5 cm lateral to mid-pre-central position (Cz). The reference electrode was placed over the contralateral supraorbital ridge. High Chloride Electrolyte-Gel (Easycap, GmbH; Germany) was used as the conducting medium between the scalp and electrodes. The electrodes contained 5 kΩ resistors and extension leads connected the stimulator, which was located outside of the magnetic field, to the subject positioned in the scanner. For anodal stimulation, the current was ramped up over 10 s and was then held at 1 mA for 20 min, before being ramped down over 10 s. For sham stimulation the DC-stimulator was ramped up for 10 s then switched off, as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Stagg et al., 2011a</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Magnetic resonance acquisition</title><p>All data were acquired on a 3-T Siemens Verio scanner. T1-weighted images (MPRAGE, 192 × 1 mm axial slices, TR/TE = 2040/5 ms, flip angle = 8°, FOV 200 × 181) were used to place a 2 × 2 × 2 cm voxel of interest over the left precentral knob, a known landmark for the hand motor representation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Yousry et al., 1997</xref>).</p><p>Edited GABA spectra were acquired using the MEGA-PRESS sequence (TR/TE = 2000/68 ms, 144 averages, TA = 4:56 blocks) with 20 ms double-banded Gaussian inversion pulses for simultaneous spectral editing and water suppression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Mescher et al., 1998</xref>). The water suppression band was set to a frequency of 4.7 ppm, and an editing band alternated between 1.9 ppm (edit on) and 7.5 ppm (edit off) in even and odd acquisitions, respectively. Spectra were acquired in blocks of 4.56 min. Three blocks were acquired at baseline, four blocks during tDCS, and three blocks post-tDCS.</p><p>A multiband 2 mm isotropic echo-planar imaging (EPI) acquisition (TR/TE = 1300/40 ms, FOV = 212 × 212 mm, bandwidth = 1814 Hz/Px, multi-band acceleration factor 6, voxel dimension = 2 mm isotropic, whole brain, acquisition time = 6:42 min for a total of 300 vol) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Feinberg et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Moeller et al., 2010</xref>) was performed before and immediately after tDCS. Subjects fixated on a cross-hair image presented centrally on the screen during resting fMRI acquisition and watched a nature video at all other times.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>MRS analysis</title><p>MRS data pre-processing was performed using in-house scripts, including removal of motion-corrupted averages, frequency drift, and zero- and first-order phase corrections. To increase signal-to-noise, data from subsequent blocks within each time period were then averaged together, resulting in GABA measurements from 9:52 min acquisitions for the following time points: Baseline1, Baseline2, During1, During2, During3, Post1, and Post2.</p><p>MRS analysis was performed on the combined spectra using jMRUI v2.2 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.mrui.uab.es/mrui/">http://www.mrui.uab.es/mrui/</ext-link>). As is standard, first, any residual water signal was removed using a Hankel Lanczos singular value decomposition (HLSVD) filter. Second, Creatine and NAA line-widths were obtained from the first non-edited acquisition for each time point using AMARES—a non-linear least square fitting algorithm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Vanhamme et al., 2001</xref>). The Creatine linewidth was used to constrain the linewidth of the GABA resonance from the edited spectra. The GABA resonance was fitted with 2 Gaussian peaks. A single Gaussian curve was fitted to the NAA resonance and was constrained to the linewidth of NAA in the non-edited spectrum. Spectra with an NAA linewidth of greater than 10 Hz were excluded from further analysis. Two spectra from different sessions in the same subject were excluded in this way.</p><p>FMRIB's automated segmentation tool (FAST), part of the FMRIB software library (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl">http://www.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl</ext-link>), calculated the relative quantities of grey matter and white matter within the voxel of interest on the T1-weighted structural scan as previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Stagg et al., 2011a</xref>). As has been done previously, the amplitude of GABA peaks were corrected for the proportion of grey matter volume within the voxel (divided by [GM]/([GM] + [WM] + [CSF])), and Creatine concentrations were corrected for the proportion of total brain tissue volume within the voxel (divided by (([GM] + [WM])/([GM] + [WM] + [CSF])) All neurotransmitter concentrations reported are given as a ratio to Creatine (GABA:Cr). Mean GABA:Cr values for each time point were normalised to the average of the baseline values for that condition, and henceforth are referred to as GABA levels for simplicity. We used Creatine as a simultaneously acquired reference peak as this is likely to remain stable over the timescale of this study. Note that in our original study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Stagg et al., 2014</xref>), this was not possible due to acquisition limitations with an older scanner, and so in that study we referenced GABA to NAA. However, we would not expect this to have a significant impact on our findings.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Resting state functional connectivity analysis</title><p>Analysis of resting state fMRI data was carried out using an independent component analysis (ICA) approach as implemented in MELODIC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Beckmann et al., 2005</xref>) and tools from the FMRIB Software Library (FSL; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl">http://www.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl</ext-link>). Standard pre-processing steps were applied, which included motion correction, brain extraction, spatial smoothing using a Gaussian kernel of full-width at half-maximum (FWHM) of 2 mm, and high-pass temporal filtering equivalent to 100 s. fMRI volumes were registered to the individual's structural scan using boundary-based registration (BBR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Greve and Fischl, 2009</xref>) and then to standard space images using FMRIB's nonlinear image registration tool (FNIRT). Pre-processed functional data containing 300 volumes for each time point and each subject were temporally concatenated across subjects to create a single 4D data set.</p><p>A dual regression technique was used to allow for between-subject voxel-wise comparisons of resting functional connectivity as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Filippini et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Stagg et al., 2014</xref>). To identify large-scale patterns of functional connectivity in the population of subjects, the concatenated 4D data set was decomposed using ICA into 25 components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Stagg et al., 2014</xref>). The motor RSN was identified manually by eye and then confirmed by using spatial cross-correlations against a previously defined motor map (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Beckmann et al., 2005</xref>). A dual regression approach was then used to identify subject-specific temporal dynamics and associated spatial maps. This involved the following steps: for each subject the group-average set of spatial maps was regressed into the subject's 4D space-time data set. This generated a set of subject-specific time series for each group-level spatial map. Regressing these time series into the same 4D data set resulted in a set of subject-specific spatial maps, one for each group-level spatial map.</p><p>We then performed region of interest (ROI) analyses on the resulting subject-specific RSN map to investigate changes in motor resting state connectivity within specific ROIs. In all cases, the mean value within the ROI was extracted for each subject and used as a measure of the strength of functional connectivity within the RSN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Stagg et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>To investigate the relationship between GABA levels and motor functional connectivity, individual subject masks of the MRS voxel were created to quantify the strength of motor network functional connectivity within the same region where the GABA was measured. In addition, to investigate the tDCS-induced changes in motor resting state connectivity, the voxel with the maximum degree of connectivity across the group was identified within the left precentral gyrus. This voxel was then dilated to create a 8 mm-radius ROI, which included the hand knob of M1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Yousry et al., 1997</xref>). A mean measure of motor RSN functional connectivity strength within the ROIs was then extracted for each subject at each time point and condition separately.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Statistical analyses on the data were conducted using SPSS (Version 22, IBM).

Your submission has been favorably evaluated by Eve Marder (Senior editor) and three reviewers of the original eLife manuscript (Stagg et al., eLife, 2014), one of whom, Jody Culham, is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This manuscript combines two approaches previously examined separately in an earlier eLife paper from a larger group in eLife (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Stagg et al., 2014</xref>). The earlier paper showed that (1) GABA levels in primary motor cortex (M1) measured by magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) were inversely correlated with functional connectivity of M1 with other regions; and (2) anodal transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), a technique thought to reduce GABA levels, delivered to M1 led to an increase in its functional connectivity. Here the authors explicitly test the effects of tDCS to M1 on MRS GABA levels (before during and after tDCS) and functional connectivity. While they replicate both earlier findings, perhaps surprisingly, they don't find correlations between the degree of M1 GABA reductions and the increase in M1 connectivity.</p><p>The three reviewers agreed that the paper makes a valuable addition to the earlier results. Most notably, they investigate the cause and effect relationship between GABA levels and resting state fMRI connectivity and find that it is less straightforward than expected. Although these results may not be as exciting as one may have hoped, the reviewers were positive about the quality of the project and the Reviewing editor thought that this was a good example of how eLife Advances can contribute to a better understanding of earlier results (even if through adding caveats).</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) There was some confusion over the basis for the conclusion that post-tDCS GABA decreases have no relationship with connectivity measures. This warrants clarification.</p><p>One reviewer wrote, “Although the authors conclude no relationship given that GABA decreases significantly and connectivity increases significantly it would appear that there should be some correlation. I assume that the author's conclusion is based on the time course of connectivity being different (presumably the increases occur before the drop in GABA). However if this is the reasoning used it should be made clearer in the manuscript.”</p><p>The Reviewing editor assumed the basis was a near-zero correlation (subjects = data points) between them and recommends including a scatterplot to show this. As this seems to be the most important finding in this advance, it warrants its own figure (more so than some of the other data shown in figures, such as the fourth replication of the GABA:connectivity relationship).</p><p>2) As part of the study the authors reproduce their and other groups results which is commendable. However there has been some controversy recently on how well GABA changes track changes in cortical excitability (or gamma EEG) in other paradigms. The authors should briefly discuss these findings and offer an explanation for the discrepancy (methodological or biological) in results.</p><p>Recommended revisions/considerations:</p><p>3) Given that we do not know what constitutes a biologically significant drop in GABA, or increase in connectivity, I suggest that the authors also as a secondary analysis examine if there is a correlation if they take out the magnitude of the changes and just bin into increase, decrease, and no change. If no correlation is still seen then this analysis would bolster the author's conclusion.</p><p>4) Although the authors conclude that the impact of tDCS on GABA and resting state fMRI connectivity are independent I believe it is important that they also address the question of whether the drop in GABA has a role in the overall increase in cortical excitability. Given that they have now a time course of GABA drop I strongly suggest they examine whether there is a similar time course in the increase in cortical excitability in the region of the GABA voxel. If the two are in good agreement it would be important further evidence that GABA level has a modulatory role on cortical excitability and via that mechanism presumably plasticity.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.08789.009</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>1) There was some confusion over the basis for the conclusion that post-tDCS GABA decreases have no relationship with connectivity measures.

It is difficult to know exactly why there is no correlation between the functional connectivity change and the GABA change – there are a number of potential explanations for this, and we are unable to distinguish between them here. We have expanded the discussion of this point in light of the reviewers’ comments, which we hope will clarify the justification for the conclusions for the reviewer:</p><p>“There are a number of potential explanations for this lack of a relationship after plasticity-induction, and we are unable to distinguish between these here. It may be that the time-course of the tDCS-induced changes in GABA and functional connectivity are different, meaning that a direct comparison between functional connectivity immediately after stimulation and a later post-stimulation GABA measure would not demonstrate the expected relationship. In addition, as discussed in detail above, GABA MRS is likely relatively insensitive to synaptic GABAA activity, more closely reflecting extra-synaptic GABAergic tone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Stagg et al., 2011b</xref>). It may be therefore, that extra-synaptic GABA tone and GABAA synaptic activity are differentially modulated by tDCS, and hence MRS-assessed GABA is not a good surrogate marker for the change in oscillatory activity in the gamma and beta bands after stimulation, and hence long-range functional connectivity, which may be primarily dependent on GABAA synaptic activity. Alternatively, it may be that the relationship between GABA and functional connectivity is not causal, and driven perhaps by another factor which we have not quantified. This seems unlikely given the evidence supporting the role of GABA in local oscillatory activity, and hence long-term connectivity, but cannot be ruled out.”</p><p>We are very happy to add in the scatter plot as the Reviewing editor suggests, and have now incorporated this into the manuscript (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>).</p><p><italic>2) As part of the study the authors reproduce their and other groups results which is commendable. However there has been some controversy recently on how well GABA changes track changes in cortical excitability (or gamma EEG) in other paradigms. The authors should briefly discuss these findings and offer an explanation for the discrepancy (methodological or biological) in results</italic>.</p><p>We are happy to include a discussion of this point:</p><p>“A number of studies have directly investigated the relationship between MRS-assessed GABA and oscillatory activity in the gamma range, with earlier studies demonstrating a direct relationship between the two measures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Muthukumaraswamy et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Edden et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Gaetz et al., 2011</xref>), findings that have not been replicated in a subsequent larger study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cousijn et al., 2014</xref>). There may be a number of reasons for the lack of a consistent relationship between MRS-assessed GABA and gamma oscillations. GABA MRS is likely relatively insensitive to synaptic GABAA activity, more closely reflecting extra-synaptic GABAergic tone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Stagg et al., 2011b</xref>). While at baseline functional GABAA synaptic activity and GABAergic tone may be related, they are unlikely to be perfectly correlated, meaning that MRS-assessed GABA and gamma oscillations should not necessarily be expected to be tightly related. In addition, although there is extensive data from animal models to demonstrate a clear relationship between beta and gamma oscillatory activity and GABAA activity it is not necessarily clear how best to quantify oscillatory activity derived from MEG to most clearly demonstrate a similar relationship. It may be therefore, that differences in the acquisition or analysis of the MEG data mean that any relationship between gamma oscillations and GABA is difficult to reproduce using the techniques available in humans. Similarly, small differences in GABA MRS acquisition and analysis approaches may potentially impact on GABA estimates in ways that are not completely understood.”</p><p><italic>Recommended revisions/considerations:</italic></p><p><italic>3) Given that we do not know what constitutes a biologically significant drop in GABA, or increase in connectivity, I suggest that the authors also as a secondary analysis examine if there is a correlation if they take out the magnitude of the changes and just bin into increase, decrease, and no change. If no correlation is still seen then this analysis would bolster the author's conclusion</italic>.</p><p>We thank the reviewers for this suggestion. We have performed the analysis as requested, and have binned both the change in GABA and change in functional connectivity into “increase” and “decrease” (No subject demonstrated no change in either measure). Analysis of this data showed no significant correlation between these two bins, either when all the post-stimulation data was considered (χ<sup>2</sup> = 0.167, p = 0.68), or when the anodal tDCS data was considered alone (χ<sup>2</sup> = 1.33, p = 0.25). We have not added this analysis to the manuscript, but are happy to do so if the reviewers and editor feel it is appropriate.</p><p><italic>4) Although the authors conclude that the impact of tDCS on GABA and resting state fMRI connectivity are independent I believe it is important that they also address the question of whether the drop in GABA has a role in the overall increase in cortical excitability. Given that they have now a time course of GABA drop I strongly suggest they examine whether there is a similar time course in the increase in cortical excitability in the region of the GABA voxel. If the two are in good agreement it would be important further evidence that GABA level has a modulatory role on cortical excitability and via that mechanism presumably plasticity</italic>.</p><p>This is an interesting point, but it is difficult to know how to best address this question directly. As demonstrated previously (Nitsche et al., J Physiol, 2005), substantially different mechanisms underlie the cortical excitability changes during and after anodal tDCS, findings which would be broadly in line with the results described in our paper.</p><p>In their 2005 paper, Nitsche and colleagues demonstrated a trend towards an increase in cortical excitability during anodal tDCS but with no change in SICI, the TMS measure of GABAA activity. This would be broadly in line with our findings here, where there was no significant decrease in MRS-assessed GABA until after the stimulation period had ceased.</p><p>Conversely, 13 minutes of 1mA tDCS has been shown to lead to an increase in cortical excitability that outlasts the stimulation period by 60-90 minutes (Nitsche &amp; Paulus, Neurology, 2001; Nitsche et al., J Physiol, 2005; Monte-Silva et al., Brain Stimulation, 2012). This increase in cortical excitability has been demonstrated to be broadly stable from the offset of stimulation for at least 60 minutes, in line with our GABA findings here. This increase in cortical excitability occurs concurrently with both an increase in intracortical facilitation (ICF; a TMS measure of both glutamate and GABA) and a decrease in SICI, suggesting that the increase in cortical excitability seen after anodal tDCS is driven by both a decrease in GABA and an increase in glutamatergic activity (Nitsche et al., J Physiol, 2005). It is important to note that although 20 minutes of 1mA anodal tDCS has been shown to be excitatory to M1 (O’Shea et al., NeuroImage, 2014) the timecourse of cortical excitability changes has not directly been studied to our knowledge and no ppTMS measures performed.</p><p>We do not have TMS measures of cortical excitability in the subjects in the current paper, but we would not wish to argue that the expected increase in excitability was driven solely by GABA changes, or indeed that the magnitude of GABA changes and the degree of overall excitability increase were necessarily related in an individual subject. As stated above, the increase in cortical excitability is almost certainly multi-factorial and driven at least by increases in glutamatergic signaling as well as decreases in GABA. MRS, providing as it does concentration measures, does not given a good measure of glutamatergic activity and therefore is not in our opinion the best modality to assess this question.</p><p>Rather, we would like to argue that while increases in excitability are driven by multifactorial effects, changes in GABA per se can be related to one aspect of these – long range functional connectivity. We have added the following to the discussion to clarify this point:</p><p>“Given the close biochemical relationship between GABA and glutamate, GABA measures are unlikely to reflect overall changes in cortical excitability per se, and indeed no direct relationship between measures of GABA and cortical excitability has been demonstrated previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Stagg et al., 2011b</xref>). The expected increases in cortical excitability following anodal tDCS have been shown to be multifactorial, and are certainly driven by modulation of both GABAergic and glutamatergic signalling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Stagg &amp; Nitsche, 2011</xref>). It is worth noting, however, that the timecourse of GABA changes demonstrated here are broadly in line with those shown previously using paired pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation (ppTMS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Nitsche et al., 2005</xref>). It is worth noting, however, that the timecourse of GABA changes demonstrated here are broadly in line with those shown previously using paired pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation (ppTMS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Nitsche et al., 2005</xref>). We did not acquire measures of excitability during or following tDCS in the subjects studied here. Future work could acquire excitability data over a similar timecourse to the one studied here using an interleaved TMS/MRI approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Siebner et al., 2003</xref>), in order to test directly for any agreement between tDCS induced changes in GABA and changes in excitability.”</p></body></sub-article></article>
