For example, in multicellular organisms, different cells must cooperate with each other and refrain from dividing in a cancerous fashion to ensure the propagation of the germline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Michod and Roze, 2001</xref>). Cooperation between species, or mutualistic cooperation, is also common (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Boucher, 1985</xref>). In extreme cases, mutualistic cooperation is obligatory, that is, cooperating partners depend on each other for survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cook and Rasplus, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Zientz et al., 2004</xref>). For example, insects and endosymbiotic bacteria exchange costly essential metabolites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Zientz et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gil and Latorre, 2019</xref>).</p><p>Cooperation is vulnerable to ‘cheaters’ who gain a fitness advantage over cooperators by consuming benefits without reciprocating fairly. Cancers are cheaters of multicellular organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Athena et al., 2015</xref>), and rhizobia variants can cheat on their legume hosts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gano-Cohen et al., 2019</xref>). How might cooperation survive cheaters?</p><p>Various mechanisms are known to protect cooperation against cheaters. In ‘partner choice,’ an individual preferentially interacts with cooperating partners over spatially equivalent cheating partners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Sachs et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kiers et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bshary and Grutter, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Shou, 2015</xref>). For example, client fish observes cleaner fish cleaning other clients and then chooses the cleaner fish that offers high-quality service (removing client parasites instead of client tissue) to interact with (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bshary and Grutter, 2006</xref>).</p><p>For organisms lacking partner choice mechanisms, a spatially structured environment can promote the origin and maintenance of cooperation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Sachs et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chao and Levin, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Momeni et al., 2013a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Harcombe, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Nowak, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Pande et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Harcombe et al., 2018</xref>). This is because in a spatially structured environment, neighbors repeatedly interact, and thus cheaters will eventually suffer as their neighbors perish (partner fidelity feedback). In a well-mixed environment, since all individuals share equal access to the cooperative benefit regardless of their contributions, cheaters are favored over cooperators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Harcombe, 2010</xref>). An exception is that cooperators can stochastically purge cheaters if cooperators happen to be better adapted to an environmental stress than cheaters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Asfahl et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Morgan et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Waite and Shou, 2012</xref>). Finally, pleiotropy – a single mutation affecting multiple phenotypes – can stabilize cooperation if reducing benefit supply to partner also elicits a crippling effect on self (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Foster et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dandekar et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Oslizlo et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Harrison and Buckling, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sathe et al., 2019</xref>). For example, when the social amoeba <italic>Dictyostelium discoideum</italic> experience starvation and form a fruiting body, a fraction of the cells differentiates into a non-viable stalk in order to support the remaining cells to differentiation into viable spores. <italic>dimA</italic> mutants attempt to cheat by avoiding the stalk fate, but they also fail to form spores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Foster et al., 2004</xref>). In this case, a gene links an individual’s partner-serving trait to its self-serving trait, thus stabilizing cooperation.</p><p>To date, pleiotropic linkage between a self-serving trait and a partner-serving trait has been exclusively demonstrated in systems with long evolutionary histories of cooperation. Thus, it is unclear how easily such a genetic linkage can arise. One possibility is that cooperation promotes pleiotropy. Indeed, theoretical work suggests that cooperation can stabilize pleiotropy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dos Santos et al., 2018</xref>), and that as cooperators evolve to resist cheater invasion, pleiotropic linkage between self-serving and partner-serving traits is favored (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Frénoy et al., 2013</xref>). A second possibility is that pleiotropy promotes cooperation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Foster et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dandekar et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Oslizlo et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Harrison and Buckling, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sathe et al., 2019</xref>). These two possibilities are not mutually exclusive.</p><p>Here, we investigate whether pleiotropic ‘win-win’ mutations directly benefiting self and directly benefiting partner could arise and stabilize nascent cooperation. We test this in a synthetic cooperative community growing in an environment unfavorable for cooperation (e.g. in a well-mixed environment or in monocultures without the cooperative partner). The community is termed CoSMO (<underline>Co</underline>operation that is <underline>S</underline>ynthetic and <underline>M</underline>utually <underline>O</underline>bligatory). CoSMO comprises two non-mating engineered <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> strains: <italic>L<sup>-</sup>H<sup>+</sup></italic> requires lysine (<italic>L</italic>) and pays a fitness cost to overproduce hypoxanthine (<italic>H</italic>, an adenine derivative) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Waite and Shou, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hart et al., 2019a</xref>), while <italic>H<sup>-</sup>L<sup>+</sup></italic> requires hypoxanthine and pays a fitness cost to overproduce lysine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hart et al., 2019b</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Overproduced metabolites are released into the environment by live cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hart et al., 2019a</xref>), allowing the two strains to feed each other. CoSMO models the metabolic cooperation between certain gut microbial species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Rakoff-Nahoum et al., 2016</xref>) and between legumes and rhizobia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Schubert, 1986</xref>), as well as other mutualisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Beliaev et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Helliwell et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Carini et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Rodionova et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Zengler and Zaramela, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Jiang et al., 2018</xref>). Similar to natural systems, in CoSMO exchanged metabolites are costly to produce (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Waite and Shou, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hart et al., 2019a</xref>), and cooperation can transition to competition when the exchanged metabolites are externally supplied (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Momeni et al., 2013b</xref>). Importantly, principles learned from CoSMO have been found to operate in communities of un-engineered microbes. These include how fitness effects of interactions might affect spatial patterning and species composition in two-species communities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Momeni et al., 2013b</xref>), as well as how cooperators might survive cheaters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Momeni et al., 2013a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Waite and Shou, 2012</xref>; see Discussions in these articles).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Win-win mutation in a nascent cooperative community.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) CoSMO (<underline>Co</underline>operation that is <underline>S</underline>ynthetic and <underline>M</underline>utually <underline>O</underline>bligatory) consists of two non-mating cross-feeding yeast strains, each engineered to overproduce a metabolite required by the partner strain. Metabolite overproduction is due to a mutation that renders the first enzyme of the biosynthetic pathway resistant to end-product inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Armitt and Woods, 1970</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Feller et al., 1999</xref>).

The two strains can be distinguished by different fluorescent markers. (<bold>B</bold>) Win-win mutation. A pleiotropic win-win mutation confers a self-serving phenotype (orange) and a partner-serving phenotype (lavender).</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-57838-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig><p>In our previous work, we allowed nine independent lines of CoSMO to evolve for over 100 generations in a well-mixed environment by performing periodic dilutions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hart et al., 2019a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Shou et al., 2007</xref>). Throughout evolution, the two cooperating strains coexisted due to their metabolic co-dependence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Momeni et al., 2013b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Shou et al., 2007</xref>). In a well-mixed environment, since partner-supplied benefits are uniformly distributed and equally available to all individuals, a self-serving mutation will be favored regardless of how it affects the partner. Indeed, all characterized mutants isolated from CoSMO displayed self-serving phenotypic changes (e.g. improved affinity for partner-supplied metabolites; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Waite and Shou, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hart et al., 2019a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hart et al., 2019b</xref>), outcompeting their ancestor in community-like environments. Here, we report the identification of a pleiotropic win-win mutation which is both self-serving and partner-serving. This win-win mutation also arose in the absence of the cooperative partner. Thus, cooperation-promoting win-win mutations can arise in a community without any evolutionary history of cooperation and in environments unfavorable to cooperation. Our work suggests the possibility that pre-existing pleiotropy can stabilize nascent cooperation in natural communities.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Criteria of a win-win mutation</title><p>A win-win mutation is defined as a single mutation (e.g., a point mutation, a translocation, a chromosome duplication) that directly promotes the fitness of self (self-serving) and the fitness of partner (partner-serving). To define ‘direct’ here, we adapt the framework from Chapter 10 of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Peters et al., 2017</xref>: A mutation in genotype <italic>A</italic> exerts a direct fitness effect on genotype <italic>B</italic> if the mutation can alter the growth rate of <italic>B</italic> even if the biomass of <italic>A</italic> is fixed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hart et al., 2019b</xref>).</p><p>For <italic>L<sup>-</sup>H<sup>+</sup></italic>, a self-serving mutation should improve the growth rate of self by, for example, increasing cell’s affinity for lysine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, orange). A self-serving mutation allows the mutant to outcompete a non-mutant. A partner-serving mutation should improve the growth rate of partner at a fixed self biomass. Since the partner requires hypoxanthine, a partner-serving mutation in <italic>L<sup>-</sup>H<sup>+</sup></italic> should increase the hypoxanthine supply rate per <italic>L<sup>-</sup>H<sup>+</sup></italic> biomass. Since the biomass of <italic>L<sup>-</sup>H<sup>+</sup></italic> is linked to lysine consumption, the partner-serving phenotype of <italic>L<sup>-</sup>H<sup>+</sup></italic> translates to hypoxanthine supply rate per lysine consumption, or equivalently, hypoxanthine release rate per cell (<italic>r<sub>H</sub></italic>) normalized by the amount of lysine consumed to make a cell (<italic>c<sub>L</sub></italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hart et al., 2019b</xref>).

As expected, all evolved <italic>L<sup>-</sup>H<sup>+</sup></italic> clones displayed self-serving phenotypes, achieving a higher growth rate than the ancestor in low lysine presumably by stabilizing the lysine permease Lyp1 on cell membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hart et al., 2019b</xref>). Surprisingly, <italic>ecm21</italic> mutants also displayed partner-serving phenotypes, promoting the steady state growth rate of partner <italic>H<sup>-</sup>L<sup>+</sup></italic> and of community (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>) via increasing the hypoxanthine release rate per lysine consumption (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>).</p><p>The partner-serving phenotype of <italic>L<sup>-</sup>H<sup>+</sup></italic> emerged as a side effect of adaptation to lysine limitation instead of adaptation to a cooperative partner. We reached this conclusion because <italic>ecm21</italic> mutations were also observed in <italic>L<sup>-</sup>H<sup>+</sup></italic> evolving as monocultures in lysine-limited chemostats (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). Being self-serving does not automatically lead to a partner-serving phenotype. For example, in the <italic>DISOMY14</italic> mutant, duplication of the lysine permease <italic>LYP1</italic> improved mutant’s affinity for lysine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) without improving hypoxanthine release rate per lysine consumption (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>) or partner’s growth rate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hart et al., 2019b</xref>).</p><p>How might <italic>ecm21</italic> mutants achieve higher hypoxanthine release rate per lysine consumption? One possibility is that purine overproduction is increased in <italic>ecm21</italic> mutants, leading to a steeper concentration gradient across the cell membrane. A different, and not mutually exclusive, possibility is that in <italic>ecm21</italic> mutants, purine permeases are stabilized much like the lysine permease, which in turn leads to increased membrane permeability. Future work will reveal the molecular mechanisms of this increased exchange ratio.</p><p>The win-win effect of <italic>ecm21</italic> is with respect to the ancestor. <italic>ecm21</italic> may disappear from a population due to competition with fitter mutants. If <italic>ecm21</italic> is fixed in <italic>L<sup>-</sup>H<sup>+</sup></italic>, then a new state of faster community growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>) will be established. An interesting future direction would be to investigate whether during long-term evolution of CoSMO, other win-win mutations can occur in the <italic>ecm21</italic> background or in backgrounds that can outcompete <italic>ecm21</italic>, or in the partner strain.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>How might nascent cooperation be stabilized?</title><p>A spatially structured environment is known to facilitate the origin and maintenance of cooperation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Sachs et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chao and Levin, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Momeni et al., 2013a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Harcombe, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Nowak, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Pande et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Harcombe et al., 2018</xref>). Here, we discuss three additional mechanisms that can stabilize nascent cooperation without partner choice capability, even when the environment is well mixed.</p><p>First, nascent cooperation can sometimes be stabilized by physiological responses to a new environment. For example, the mutualism between two metabolically complementary <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> strains was enhanced when one strain over-released metabolites after encountering the partner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hosoda et al., 2011</xref>). Interestingly, <italic>L<sup>-</sup>H<sup>+</sup></italic> cells increased its hypoxanthine release rate in the presence of low lysine (which mimics the presence of cooperative partners) compared to in the absence of lysine (which mimics the absence of cooperative partners, although without lysine consumption, an exchange ratio cannot be calculated; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hart et al., 2019a</xref>).</p><p>Second, nascent cooperation can be stabilized by self-benefiting changes that, through promoting self-fitness, <italic>indirectly</italic> promote partner’s fitness. Consider a mutant with improved affinity for lysine but no alterations in the metabolite exchange ratio (e.g., <italic>DISOMY14</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hart et al., 2019b</xref>). By growing better in low lysine, this mutant will improve its own survival which in turn helps the whole community (and thus the partner) to survive the initial stage of low cell density. Indeed, all evolved <italic>L<sup>-</sup>H<sup>+</sup></italic> clones tested so far improved community (and partner) survival in the sense that all mutants reduced the minimal total cell density required for the community to grow to saturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Waite and Shou, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Shou et al., 2007</xref>). Unlike <italic>ecm21</italic>, some of these mutations (e.g., <italic>DISOMY14</italic>) are not directly partner-serving and would not improve partner’s steady state growth rate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hart et al., 2019b</xref>).</p><p>Third, nascent cooperation can be stabilized by pleiotropic win-win mutations which <italic>directly</italic> promote self-fitness (by increasing competitiveness against non-mutants) and <italic>directly</italic> promote partner fitness (by increasing benefit supply rate per intake benefit). In this study, win-win mutations in <italic>ecm21</italic> rapidly evolved in a well-mixed environment, even in the absence of cooperative partner or any evolutionary history of cooperation.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Pleiotropy and cooperation</title><p>Pleiotropic linkage between a self-serving trait and a partner-serving trait arises when both traits are controlled by the same gene (co-regulated) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dos Santos et al., 2018</xref>). For example, the quorum sensing network of <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> ties together a cell’s ability to make ‘public goods’ (such as extracellular proteases that provide a benefit to the local population) with the cell’s ability to make ‘private goods’ (such as intracellular enzymes involved in metabolism) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dandekar et al., 2012</xref>).

Indeed, pleiotropic linkage between self-serving and partner-serving traits has been observed in several natural cooperative systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Foster et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dandekar et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Oslizlo et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Harrison and Buckling, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sathe et al., 2019</xref>) and is thought to be important for cooperation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Foster et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dandekar et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Oslizlo et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Harrison and Buckling, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sathe et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Frénoy et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Mitri and Foster, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chisholm et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Queller, 2019</xref>).

In our evolution experiments, win-win <italic>ecm21</italic> mutations repeatedly rose to be readily detectable in independent lines (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>) and promoted both community growth rate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>) and community survival at low cell densities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Waite and Shou, 2012</xref>). Future work will reveal the evolutionary persistence of win-win mutations and their phenotypes.</p><p>In known examples of pleiotropic linkages between self-serving and partner-serving traits, cooperation has a long evolutionary history and is intra-population. Our work demonstrates that pleiotropy can give rise to win-win mutations that promote nascent, mutualistic cooperation. Interestingly, win-win mutation(s) have also been identified in a different engineered yeast cooperative community where two strains exchange leucine and tryptophane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Müller et al., 2014</xref>; Andrew Murray, personal communications). As another example, in a synthetic mutualistic community between un-engineered <italic>E. coli</italic> and un-engineered N<sub>2</sub>-fixing <italic>Rhodopseudomonas palustris</italic>, a mutation in <italic>E. coli</italic> that improves the uptake of partner-supplied nutrients improved community growth rate (and final yield), suggesting that this mutation may also be win-win (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fritts et al., 2020</xref>). Overall, these observations in synthetic communities raise the possibility that pre-existing pleiotropy may have stabilized nascent cooperation in natural communities. Future work, including unbiased screens of many mutations in synthetic cooperative communities of diverse organisms, will reveal how pleiotropy might impact nascent cooperation.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Strains</title><p>Our nomenclature of yeast genes, proteins, and mutations follows literature convention.

Three 3 ml community replicates (replicates 1, 2, and 3) per initial ratio were initiated, thus constituting nine independent lines. Since the evolutionary outcomes of the nine lines were similar, they could be treated as a single group. Communities were grown at 30°C in glass tubes on a rotator to ensure well mixing. Community turbidity was tracked by measuring the optical density (OD<sub>600</sub>) in a spectrophotometer once to twice every day. In this study, 1 OD was found to be 2–4×10<sup>7</sup> cells/ml. We diluted communities periodically to maintain OD at below 0.5 to avoid additional selections due to limitations of nutrients other than adenine or lysine.

requests and the accompanying author responses.</p></boxed-text><p><bold>Acceptance summary:</bold></p><p>We appreciate how this study demonstrates that so-called pleiotropic mutations that generate a beneficial effect for the mutated individual as well as for other individuals with which the mutant cooperates, can promote the cooperative behavior. Specifically, the authors use an engineered mutualism where two types of yeast cells exchange two essential metabolites. A mutation that increases the uptake of one of these metabolites in one partner also causes increased secretion of the other metabolite, thereby also benefitting the partner's fitness. The study shows that in such (engineered) mutualistic systems, mutations that are selected because they yield a fitness benefit for the mutated partner, can also serve the non-mutated partner and thus benefit the cooperative system as a whole.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Pleiotropic win-win mutations can rapidly evolve in a nascent cooperative community despite unfavourable conditions&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Diethard Tautz as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>We would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). Specifically, when editors judge that a submitted work as a whole belongs in <italic>eLife</italic> but that some conclusions require a modest amount of additional new data, as they do with your paper, we are asking that the manuscript be revised to either limit claims to those supported by data in hand, or to explicitly state that the relevant conclusions require additional supporting data.</p><p>Our expectation is that the authors will eventually carry out the additional experiments and report on how they affect the relevant conclusions either in a preprint on bioRxiv or medRxiv, or if appropriate, as a Research Advance in <italic>eLife</italic>, either of which would be linked to the original paper.</p><p>All reviewers agree that this is an interesting piece of work that shows how a mutation that is selected because it imparts a benefit, can also impart a benefit to non-mutated cells with which the mutant exchanges metabolites and/or predispose the mutant to engage in a mutualistic partnership.</p><p>However, all reviewers also raised a few salient questions, in particular about 1) the underlying molecular mechanism and 2) the exact nature and ecological and evolutionary novelty and relevance of the observation.</p><p>As far as we understand, the <italic>ecm21</italic> mutation increases the uptake rate of lysine because the <italic>LYP1</italic> permease becomes more highly expressed, thereby giving the mutants a (temporary?) fitness benefit (they are fitter than cells not carrying the <italic>ecm21</italic> mutation), but as far as we can tell, the yield coefficients (i.e. the efficiency of metabolism) do not change, and we would not be surprised if the <italic>ecm21</italic> mutants will in fact have a lower fitness (division rate) once they outcompeted all non-mutant cells because overexpression of the <italic>LYP1</italic> lysine permease. This would also mean that at this point, the secretion of hypoxanthine may drop back to what it was in cultures with cells not carrying <italic>ecm21</italic>, or perhaps even lower.</p><p>Firstly, we would ask the authors to better explain in plain wording the phenotypic consequences of the <italic>ecm21</italic> mutation. What does this mutation do exactly, and how does it increase fitness of the mutant? And, more importantly, how does that explain the benefit for the other genotype? What is the fitness effect in monocultures and mixed cultures over time? Is there only a positive fitness effect for <italic>ecm21</italic> mutants as long as WT and <italic>ecm21</italic> cells are present together? Does the <italic>ecm21</italic> mutant become fixed over time? Is a mutation really win-win if it or its benefit disappears over time?

In evolutionary terms, this is a Red Queen effect (or even tragedy of the commons, in case cells are wasting energy to increase the uptake rate). Is this also the case here? In other words, what are the yield coefficients for biomass and hypoxanthine per lysine consumed? What is the specific growth rate of the cells (in pure and mixed cultures)? And, how this depend on the concentration of lysine? Is there only a difference when the concentration of the limiting nutrient is kept very low and near-constant, which is perhaps not a very relevant condition for a more natural setting?

This last class of mutation is termed &quot;win-win&quot; and the main idea of the paper is that this type of mutation can be favored in the absence or the presence of the cooperative partner.</p><p>This was a very interesting paper to read and in general I had just a few broad questions for the authors to address. I don't think any of these require new experiments.</p><p>1) The paper establishes that some self-benefiting mutations, for example, those that increase lysine uptake/affinity, are positively selected purely on the basis of their direct fitness benefit and have no effect on the partner.

It was explained how <italic>DISOMY14</italic> could be beneficial, but I don't think I saw in the manuscript where it is explained how <italic>ecm21</italic> is self-benefiting. Is there a known mechanistic basis for this? If not are the authors able to speculate about this? This would really help in the Discussion section.</p><p>2) From the text presented it wasn't clear to me how generalizable these results necessarily are. This is linked in part to the first note above regarding the mechanism by which <italic>ecm21</italic> mutation confers benefit to self. Is there a reason to suspect on the basis of metabolic network structure that the type of win-win mutation found here is something that can occur readily in many contexts, microbial or otherwise? Or is this example more likely idiosyncratic to this particular engineered mutualism? Some more detailed commentary to this effect would I think help strengthen the paper's message.</p><p>3) Is there any difference in the relative abundance of <italic>ecm21</italic> mutants at the end of evolution experiments in mono-culture versus experiments in co-culture with the mutualist partner? One might naively expect so given that <italic>ecm21</italic> mutants receive the benefit of increased partner feedback, while other purely self-benefiting mutations do not.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>Here the authors extend their previous work on a synthetic mutualism published in <italic>eLife</italic> by exploring in thoughtful detail a mutation that benefits both the focal yeast and the mutualistic partner yeast. The conceptualization and design of the experiments in the paper are strong, but there are gaps in communication and framing that, once clarified, could significantly improve the manuscript. Those areas include detailing the rationale for the sequencing choices and better anchoring expectations and results in theory and empirical data.</p><p>1) It is not particularly surprising (to me) that mutations arose in the first place or that each mutation that was beneficial to &quot;self&quot; either had a positive, neutral, or negative effect on the obligate partner. Instead, in my opinion, the novelty lies in whether these newly arisen mutations increase in frequency and are stable regardless of whether they evolve in response to a partner or to an abiotic metabolite source. Unfortunately, the sequencing design doesn't allow a robust answer to that question.</p><p>2) Can the authors provide some rationale for the choices made about which clones to sequence from the nine experimental replicates? My understanding is that five clones from different generations were sequenced from each of three evolution replicates.</p><p>• A1 1000:1 initial strain ratio (two clones @ gen 24 at two @ 151 gen),</p><p>• B1 1:1 initial strain ratio (one clone @ gen 25, one clone @ gen 49, three clones @ gen 76),</p><p>• and B3 1:1 initial strain ratio (two clones @ gen 14, two clones @ gen 34, one clone @ gen 63).</p><p>This sequencing design doesn't allow insight into the relative frequency of variants at a given time point (i.e., did most yeast clones at timepoint X have an <italic>ecm21</italic> mutation?). In fact, in 2 of the three replicates, <italic>ecm21</italic> mutations that were present in the early time point, were not present at the later time points.</p><p>3) The themes and results of this new work connect closely to recent modeling work by dos Santos (do Santos, Ghoul and West, 2018). Some of the key points from that work that might be relevant:</p><p>• pleiotropy only stabilizes cooperation under very narrow circumstances and these are valid for any trait and not just cooperation;</p><p>• the directionality of stabilization can occur the other way around with cooperation stabilizing pleiotropy.</p><p>4) &quot;CoSMO models the metabolic cooperation between certain gut microbial species (Rakoff-Nahoum, Foster and Comstock, 2016) and between legumes and rhizobia (Schubert, 1986), as well as other mutualisms (Beliaev et al., 2014; Helliwell et al., 2011; Carini et al., 2014; Rodionova et al., 2015; Zengler and Zaramela, 2018; Jiang et al., 2018).&quot; Can the authors provide more clarification for why is CoSMO is a useful model for the mutualisms listed? Many of these examples, like legumes and rhizobia, are facultative and/or spatially segregated, not obligate, and well-mixed.</p><p>5) The title is not very specific. Describing why illustrates some of my confusion with the language used in the paper more broadly.</p><p>• &quot;Pleiotropic win-win mutations&quot; – most readers won't know a priori that the win-win is referring to the fitness consequences to two members of a mutualism (a cooperative community could be more than two members).</p><p>• &quot;nascent cooperative community&quot; – nascent could mean lots of things to readers. As an evolutionary biologist, I imagine a nascent cooperative community to be one where the cooperative alleles are not fixed. Someone else might imagine a situation where cooperation is facultative. Here it refers to a synthetic, obligate mutualism.</p><p>• &quot;despite unfavorable conditions&quot; – are the well-mixed conditions used here a genuinely unfavorable for the maintenance of an established, obligate mutualism? I know theory suggests that mutualisms should be harder to establish in well-mixed environments, but is there empirical or theoretical evidence to back up the idea that obligate mutualisms should breakdown in less than 100 generations in a well-mixed environment?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.57838.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>[…] All reviewers agree that this is an interesting piece of work that shows how a mutation that is selected because it imparts a benefit, can also impart a benefit to non-mutated cells with which the mutant exchanges metabolites and/or predispose the mutant to engage in a mutualistic partnership.</p><p>However, all reviewers also raised a few salient questions, in particular about 1) the underlying molecular mechanism and 2) the exact nature and ecological and evolutionary novelty and relevance of the observation.</p><p>As far as we understand, the ecm21 mutation increases the uptake rate of lysine because the LYP1 permease becomes more highly expressed, thereby giving the mutants a (temporary?) fitness benefit (they are fitter than cells not carrying the ecm21 mutation), but as far as we can tell, the yield coefficients (i.e. the efficiency of metabolism) do not change, and we would not be surprised if the ecm21 mutants will in fact have a lower fitness (division rate) once they outcompeted all non-mutant cells because overexpression of the LYP1 lysine permease.

I will make a more detailed response specific to reviewer 1.</p><p>The secretion of hypoxanthine in a pure <italic>ecm21</italic> culture is maintained at a higher level than a pure ancestral culture (Figure 3A). The exchange ratio (release rate/consumption amount) can be interpreted as a form of yield coefficient. We have added the following to our text:</p><p>“We call this ratio “<italic>H</italic>-<italic>L</italic> exchange ratio” (Figure 1B, purple), which can be interpreted as the yield coefficient while converting lysine consumption to hypoxanthine release.”</p><p>“Thus, compared to the ancestor, <italic>ecm21∆</italic> has a higher hypoxanthine release rate per lysine consumption.

We showed previously that duplication of Lyp1 improves cells’ ability to compete for limited lysine (Hart et al., <italic>eLife</italic> 2019). Your point is fair in that we did not directly show that Lyp1 stabilization explains the self-serving phenotype of <italic>ecm21</italic> (e.g. demonstrating that destabilizing Lyp1 renders <italic>ecm21</italic> ineffective when competing with wildtype in low lysine). Such experiment is challenging because if we delete <italic>LYP1</italic>, <italic>L<sup>-</sup>H<sup>+</sup></italic> cells will not grow, and “titrating” the Lyp1 protein level to be similar to wildtype is not trivial. Thus, we have revised our text:</p><p>The self-serving phenotype is due to an increased abundance of the high-affinity lysine permease Lyp1 on the cell membrane. A parsimonious explanation for <italic>ecm21</italic>’s self-serving phenotype is that during lysine limitation, the high-affinity lysine permease Lyp1 is stabilized on cell surface in the mutant.</p><p>The beneficial effect of <italic>ecm21</italic> on partner fitness can be quantitatively explained by <italic>ecm21</italic>’s increased hypoxanthine release rate per lysine consumption (see the paragraph starting with “The partner-serving phenotype of <italic>ecm21∆</italic> can be explained by the increased hypoxanthine release rate per lysine consumption, rather than the evolution of any new metabolic interactions.”) The question of why <italic>ecm21</italic> can improve hypoxanthine release rate per lysine consumption is beyond the scope of this work. We quote the relevant text from the Discussion:</p><p>“How might <italic>ecm21</italic> mutants achieve higher hypoxanthine release rate per lysine consumption? One possibility is that purine overproduction is increased in <italic>ecm21</italic> mutants, leading to a steeper concentration gradient across the cell membrane. […] Future work will reveal the molecular mechanisms of this increased exchange ratio.”</p><p>Also note that:</p><p>“Being self-serving does not automatically lead to a partner-serving phenotype. For example in the <italic>DISOMY14</italic> mutant, duplication of the lysine permease <italic>LYP1</italic> improved mutant’s affinity for lysine (Figure 2) without improving hypoxanthine release rate per lysine consumption (Figure 3A) or partner’s growth rate (Hart et al., <italic>eLife</italic>, 2019).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>What is the fitness effect in monocultures and mixed cultures over time?

I have now made this more explicit by adding the following text to Introduction:</p><p>“To date, pleiotropic linkage between a self-serving trait and a partner-serving trait has been exclusively demonstrated in systems with long evolutionary histories of cooperation.

By demonstrating that this phenomenon can occur in a synthetic community, our work raises the possibility that pre-existing pleiotropy may have stabilized nascent cooperation in natural communities. Clearly, concrete statements on the generality of our observation will require future work. Interestingly, Andrew Murray lab (Harvard) has found a similar phenomenon in a different synthetic yeast community. In fact, his lab and our lab have been trying to coordinate joint paper submission since 2014. To cut a very long story short, it took us a few years to figure out the right way of measuring phenotypes (Hart et al., PLoS Biology 2019) and the right definition of partner-serving phenotype (Hart et al., <italic>eLife</italic> 2019). Eventually, we submitted this article by ourselves since Prof. Murray informed us that he was too bogged down with administrative responsibilities. However, with his kind permission and with my recent literature search, I have added the following to the Discussion on the generality of our finding:</p><p>“Interestingly, win-win mutation(s) have also been identified in a different engineered yeast cooperative community where two strains exchange leucine and tryptophane (Muller et al., 2014) (Andrew Murray, personal communications). […] Future work, including unbiased screens of many mutations in synthetic cooperative communities of diverse organisms, will reveal how pleiotropy might impact nascent cooperation.”</p><p>Point 2C: Finally, if history is of any value in predicting the future, then CoSMO has done quite well. I have added the following to Introduction:</p><p>“Importantly, principles learned from CoSMO have been found to operate in communities of un-engineered microbes. These include how fitness effects of interactions might affect spatial patterning and species composition in two-species communities (Momeni et al., 2013), as well as how co-operators might survive cheaters (Momeni, Waite and Shou, 2013; Waite and Shou, 2012) (see Discussions in these articles).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Third, we also believe that it would help to rephrase the title to make it more broadly accessible.</p></disp-quote><p>Point 3: Thanks for the great suggestion.

Here, I will attempt to explain it without using math (the math part will come later if you are interested).</p><p>In chemostats, population growth rate is fixed by the input rate of the limiting metabolite.

If a chemostat is set to run at 8-hr doubling time, then the steady state concentration of lysine in the growth chamber will be 1 uM. Now, suppose that a mutant with a better affinity for lysine arises. The mutant can grow at 4-hr doubling time at 1 μm lysine, and 8-hr doubling time at 0.1 μm lysine. The mutant grows faster than the ancestor and displaces the ancestor, and in due course, lowers lysine concentration in the growth chamber.

Is there a reason to suspect on the basis of metabolic network structure that the type of win-win mutation found here is something that can occur readily in many contexts, microbial or otherwise? Or is this example more likely idiosyncratic to this particular engineered mutualism? Some more detailed commentary to this effect would I think help strengthen the paper's message.</p></disp-quote><p>See Point 2B.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Is there any difference in the relative abundance of ecm21 mutants at the end of evolution experiments in mono-culture versus experiments in co-culture with the mutualist partner? One might naively expect so given that ecm21 mutants receive the benefit of increased partner feedback, while other purely self-benefiting mutations do not.</p></disp-quote><p>The takeover of <italic>ecm21</italic> is so rapid (since <italic>ecm21</italic> grows &gt;4-fold faster than the ancestor) in both cases that we have not done this analysis. Note that partner feedback is absent in a well-mixed environment (i.e. ancestor and <italic>ecm21</italic> experience the same environment regardless of their contributions to the partner).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>Here the authors extend their previous work on a synthetic mutualism published in eLife by exploring in thoughtful detail a mutation that benefits both the focal yeast and the mutualistic partner yeast. The conceptualization and design of the experiments in the paper are strong, but there are gaps in communication and framing that, once clarified, could significantly improve the manuscript. Those areas include detailing the rationale for the sequencing choices and better anchoring expectations and results in theory and empirical data.</p><p>1) It is not particularly surprising (to me) that mutations arose in the first place or that each mutation that was beneficial to &quot;self&quot; either had a positive, neutral, or negative effect on the obligate partner.</p></disp-quote><p>Your statement is certainly correct. However, the literature does tend to focus on “cheater” mutations, because cheater is the major problem that any cooperative system must overcome. We reasoned that an unbiased view of what mutations, especially pleiotropic mutations, can do will provide a more holistic view about what can happen during the evolution of cooperation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Instead, in my opinion, the novelty lies in whether these newly arisen mutations increase in frequency and are stable regardless of whether they evolve in response to a partner or to an abiotic metabolite source. Unfortunately, the sequencing design doesn't allow a robust answer to that question.</p></disp-quote><p>With our original goal in mind, we simply sequenced random clones from independent monoculture and coculture lines to identify recurrent mutations. We observed that <italic>ecm21</italic> showed up in both monoculture and coculture evolution. From the enormous (&gt;4-fold) fitness advantage of <italic>ecm21</italic> over wildtype (see Figure 2A and Point 1B), <italic>ecm21</italic> will rapidly increase in frequency (saving for clonal interference), and that is why we repeatedly detected <italic>ecm21</italic> mutations when randomly sequencing clones. Also see Point 1C.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Can the authors provide some rationale for the choices made about which clones to sequence from the nine experimental replicates? My understanding is that five clones from different generations were sequenced from each of three evolution replicates.</p><p>• A1 1000:1 initial strain ratio (two clones @ gen 24 at two @ 151 gen),</p><p>• B1 1:1 initial strain ratio (one clone @ gen 25, one clone @ gen 49, three clones @ gen 76),</p><p>• and B3 1:1 initial strain ratio (two clones @ gen 14, two clones @ gen 34, one clone @ gen 63).</p><p>This sequencing design doesn't allow insight into the relative frequency of variants at a given time point (i.e., did most yeast clones at timepoint X have an ecm21 mutation?). In fact, in 2 of the three replicates, ecm21 mutations that were present in the early time point, were not present at the later time points.</p></disp-quote><p>We initially chose three starting strain ratios because we wanted to see whether it influenced evolutionary trajectories. We randomly sequenced a small number of clones from different generations to look for common mutations. In both coculture and monoculture lines, <italic>ecm21</italic> can be observed in at least some of the lines at later generations (&gt;50 Gen). The number of clones sequenced is too small to draw any conclusions on evolutionary dynamics (except that <italic>ecm21</italic> repeatedly evolved). Also note that clonal interference can allow <italic>ecm21</italic> to exist with other mutations in a dynamic fashion, or even make <italic>ecm21</italic> disappear. Regardless, our goal here is to show that a win-win mutation can occur and can persist in at least some of the lines. See Point 1C.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The themes and results of this new work connect closely to recent modeling work by dos Santos (dos Santos, Ghoul and West, 2018). Some of the key points from that work that might be relevant:</p><p>• pleiotropy only stabilizes cooperation under very narrow circumstances and these are valid for any trait and not just cooperation</p><p>• the directionality of stabilization can occur the other way around with cooperation stabilizing pleiotropy</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for pointing this out. It is a bit embarrassing – this project had such a long incubation time that I had forgotten that the last literature search was done years ago! I have done a new literature search, and added quite a few references. As described in Point 2A, I have added:</p><p>“To date, pleiotropic linkage between a self-serving trait and a partner-serving trait has been exclusively demonstrated in systems with long evolutionary histories of cooperation. […] A second possibility is that pleiotropy promotes cooperation (foster et al., 2004; Dandekar, Chugani and Greenberg, 2012; Oslizlo et al., 2014; Harrison and Buckling, 2009; Sathe et al., 2019). These two possibilities are not mutually exclusive.”</p><p>Also see Point 1C.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) &quot;CoSMO models the metabolic cooperation between certain gut microbial species (Rakoff-Nahoum, Foster and Comstock, 2016) and between legumes and rhizobia (Schubert, 1986), as well as other mutualisms (Beliaev et al., 2014; Helliwell et al., 2011; Carini et al., 2014; Rodionova et al., 2015; Zengler and Zaramela, 2018; Jiang et al., 2018).&quot; Can the authors provide more clarification for why is CoSMO is a useful model for the mutualisms listed? Many of these examples, like legumes and rhizobia, are facultative and/or spatially segregated, not obligate, and well-mixed.</p></disp-quote><p>CoSMO is similar to these mutualisms because it involves costly metabolic exchange. CoSMO cooperation can also be made facultative if we supply lysine and hypoxanthine, just like legumerhizobia mutualism becoming facultative if nitrogen fertilizer is supplied. We used well-mixed environment to make the environment non-conducive for cooperation. We have now added:</p><p>“Similar to natural systems, in CoSMO exchanged metabolites are costly to produce (Waite and Shou, 2012; Hart et al., PLoS Biology 2019), and cooperation can transition to competition when the exchanged metabolites are externally supplied (Momeni et al., 2013).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The title is not very specific. Describing why illustrates some of my confusion with the language used in the paper more broadly.</p><p>• &quot;Pleiotropic win-win mutations&quot; – most readers won't know a priori that the win-win is referring to the fitness consequences to two members of a mutualism (a cooperative community could be more than two members).</p><p>• &quot;nascent cooperative community&quot; -nascent could mean lots of things to readers. As an evolutionary biologist, I imagine a nascent cooperative community to be one where the cooperative alleles are not fixed. Someone else might imagine a situation where cooperation is facultative. Here it refers to a synthetic, obligate mutualism.</p><p>• &quot;despite unfavorable conditions&quot; – are the well-mixed conditions used here a genuinely unfavorable for the maintenance of an established, obligate mutualism? I know theory suggests that mutualisms should be harder to establish in well-mixed environments, but is there empirical or theoretical evidence to back up the idea that obligate mutualisms should breakdown in less than 100 generations in a well-mixed environment?</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for such detailed feedback. See Point 3.</p><p>With regard to your last point, if we add cheaters to the two CoSMO strains at 1:1:1 ratio in a well-mixed environment, 50% communities will crash (stop growing and eventually die) within ~20-30 doublings (Waite and Shou, 2012). In a spatially-structured environment, all cooperative communities survived by physically excluding cheaters (Momeni et al., 2013). Although this does not directly address your question, it does show that for mutualistic systems, a well-mixed environment is less desirable than a spatially-structured environment. Work from Will Harcombe also demonstrates the critical importance of a spatially-structured environment in the origin of costly mutualisms.</p></body></sub-article></article>
