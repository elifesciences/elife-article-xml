The parasubthalamic nucleus (PSTN), a relatively unexplored population of neurons in the posterior hypothalamus, has been hypothesized to regulate appetite due to its connectivity with other anorexigenic neuronal populations and because these neurons express Fos, a marker of neuronal activation, following a meal. However, the individual cell types that make up the PSTN are not well characterized, nor are their functional roles in food intake behavior. Here, we identify and distinguish between two discrete PSTN subpopulations, those that express tachykinin-1 (PSTN<sup>Tac1</sup> neurons) and those that express corticotropin-releasing hormone (PSTN<sup>CRH</sup> neurons), and use a panel of genetically encoded tools in mice to show that PSTN<sup>Tac1</sup> neurons play an important role in appetite suppression. Both subpopulations increase activity following a meal and in response to administration of the anorexigenic hormones amylin, cholecystokinin (CCK), and peptide YY (PYY). Interestingly, chemogenetic inhibition of PSTN<sup>Tac1</sup>, but not PSTN<sup>CRH</sup> neurons, reduces the appetite-suppressing effects of these hormones. Consistently, optogenetic and chemogenetic stimulation of PSTN<sup>Tac1</sup> neurons, but not PSTN<sup>CRH</sup> neurons, reduces food intake in hungry mice. PSTN<sup>Tac1</sup> and PSTN<sup>CRH</sup> neurons project to distinct downstream brain regions, and stimulation of PSTN<sup>Tac1</sup> projections to individual anorexigenic populations reduces food consumption. Taken together, these results reveal the functional properties and projection patterns of distinct PSTN cell types and demonstrate an anorexigenic role for PSTN<sup>Tac1</sup> neurons in the hormonal and central regulation of appetite.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>parasubthalamic</kwd><kwd>PSTN</kwd><kwd>feeding</kwd><kwd>energy homeostasis</kwd><kwd>hypothalamus</kwd><kwd>parabrachial</kwd><kwd>AgRP</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000062</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R15 DK105510</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Carter</surname><given-names>Matthew E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>IOS 1652060</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Carter</surname><given-names>Matthew E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The hypothalamic parasubthalamic nucleus can be subdivided into two distinct populations, one of which decreases food consumption and is necessary for the full appetite-suppressing effects of anorexigenic hormones.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The brain regulates food intake behavior through the coordinated activity of several distinct neuronal populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Andermann and Lowell, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Sternson and Eiselt, 2017</xref>). Activity in orexigenic (appetite-inducing) populations, such as agouti-related peptide (AgRP)-expressing neurons in the hypothalamic arcuate nucleus, can rapidly and reversibly promote an increase in food intake (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aponte et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Krashes et al., 2011</xref>). In contrast, activity in anorexigenic (appetite-suppressing) populations, such as pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC)-expressing neurons in the hypothalamus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aponte et al., 2011</xref>) or calcitonin gene related peptide (CGRP)-expressing neurons in the brainstem parabrachial nucleus (PBN<sup>CGRP</sup> neurons) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Campos et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Carter et al., 2013</xref>), suppresses feeding. In recent years, the parasubthalamic nucleus (PSTN), a relatively understudied population of neurons in the posterolateral hypothalamus, has been hypothesized to regulate feeding behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Shah et al., 2022</xref>); however, the gene expression patterns within the PSTN and the roles of individual cell types in food intake behavior have remained relatively uncharacterized.</p><p>The few studies that have explored the PSTN demonstrate a potential role for these neurons in feeding. Anatomically, PSTN neurons receive afferent projections from orexigenic AgRP neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Livneh et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Wang et al., 2015</xref>) and anorexigenic populations including arcuate POMC neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Wang et al., 2015</xref>), PBN<sup>CGRP</sup> neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Huang et al., 2021</xref>), and the central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Barbier et al., 2017</xref>). In turn, these neurons project to anorexigenic brain regions including the PBN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Goto and Swanson, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Zséli et al., 2016</xref>), CeA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Barbier et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Zséli et al., 2018</xref>), nucleus of the solitary tract (NST) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Ciriello et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Goto and Swanson, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Holt et al., 2019</xref>), and paraventricular thalamic nucleus (PVT) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Zhang and van den Pol, 2017</xref>). PSTN neurons express Fos, an immediate early gene that serves as an indirect marker of neuronal activation, following a large meal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Barbier et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chometton et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Zséli et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Zséli et al., 2018</xref>), during a learned conditioned flavor aversion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Yasoshima et al., 2006</xref>), and in response to dietary amino acid deficiency that causes a decrease in appetite (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Zhu et al., 2012</xref>). Optogenetic stimulation of glutamatergic projections from the PSTN to the PVT reduces food intake (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Zhang and van den Pol, 2017</xref>). Finally, chemogenetic inhibition of PSTN neurons attenuates the appetite suppressing effects of the hormone cholecystokinin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Sanchez et al., 2022</xref>), and chemogenetic inhibition of PSTN neurons that express tachykinin-1 (Tac1) decreases taste neophobia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Barbier et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>Taken together, these initial studies suggest a role for the PSTN in feeding behavior. However, the individual subpopulations that make up the PSTN remain relatively uncharacterized, as do their functional roles during food consumption. We therefore sought to characterize the cell types that make up the PSTN, determine their activity patterns in response to various appetitive stimuli, perturb their function in freely behaving mice, and map their connectivity with other brain regions. We identify two discrete populations of PSTN neurons, each with distinct influences on feeding behavior.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Identification of distinct PSTN cell populations</title><p>We initially identified the PSTN as a candidate anorexigenic population by investigating sources of afferent input to PBN<sup>CGRP</sup> neurons, a population that has previously been shown to suppress appetite and control meal termination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Campos et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Campos et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Carter et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Essner et al., 2017</xref>).

Therefore, to better characterize these Fos-expressing neurons, we analyzed the cell types that make up the PSTN and explored their roles in food intake behavior.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>PSTN neurons project to anorexigenic PBN<sup>CGRP</sup> neurons and are activated by refeeding.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Modified rabies viral strategy used to identify afferent input to PBN<sup>CGRP</sup> neurons.

Therefore, inhibition of PSTN<sup>Tac1</sup> neurons is insufficient to affect baseline food intake. Because anorexigenic hormones increased activity in PSTN<sup>Tac1</sup> neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>), we assessed whether this activity is necessary for their anorexigenic effects. As expected, administration of amylin, CCK, and PYY significantly reduced food intake relative to administration of saline (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D–G</xref>). Intriguingly, co-administration of CNO significantly attenuated these anorexigenic effects in hM4Di-transduced animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E–G</xref>), demonstrating the necessity of PSTN<sup>Tac1</sup> neuronal activity for the full anorexigenic effects of amylin, CCK, and PYY. To better understand how PSTN<sup>Tac1</sup> neuron inhibition increases food intake in these conditions, we analyzed individual meal parameters in the first 3 hr following injection of CNO. Administration of CNO did not affect meal size or meal duration, but increased meal frequency in hM4Di-mCherry-transduced mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H–J</xref>).

Consistently, these two populations have differential expression patterns, with PSTN<sup>Tac1</sup> neurons uniquely projecting to downstream regions that suppress appetite including the PBN, NTS, and PVT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). Stimulation of projections to these downstream regions also reduces food consumption (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). Taken together, these anatomical and functional results demonstrate that activity in PSTN<sup>Tac1</sup> neurons negatively regulates food consumption. We therefore propose that exposure to food or an increase in anorexigenic hormones causes a transient activation of PSTN<sup>Tac1</sup> neurons, which signals to downstream populations via both glutamatergic and peptidergic signaling to reduce food intake.</p><p>We note that our measurements of PSTN neuron activity following refeeding or presentation of food (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) utilized solid mouse chow while experiments that tested the effects of inhibition or stimulation of PSTN neural activity on food intake behavior (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">8</xref>) utilized a more palatable liquid diet.

Because PSTN<sup>Tac1</sup> neurons are glutamatergic (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D and E</xref>), they likely decrease feeding by increasing activity in downstream anorexigenic neural populations. In addition to glutamatergic stimulation, tachykinin-1 is alternatively spliced into four neuropeptides including substance P, which has been shown to suppress feeding when centrally administered in rodents and birds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dib, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Pauliukonis et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Tachibana et al., 2010</xref>). Because the effects of optogenetic stimulation of PSTN<sup>Tac1</sup> neurons did not decrease food consumption during the post-stimulation period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>), these neurons may primarily signal via fast glutamatergic neurotransmission, however, the specific contributions of glutamate versus neuropeptide release remain unknown. Future studies should test the effects of PSTN<sup>Tac1</sup> neuron stimulation in Tac1<sup>-/-</sup> animals or during concurrent administration of specific neuropeptide receptor antagonists.</p><p>PSTN<sup>CRH</sup> neurons exhibited an increase in neural activity following exposure to food stimuli, but stimulation or inhibition of these neurons caused no noticeable effects on food intake behavior. Therefore, these neurons may be involved in aspects of food intake not studied here, such as regulating nutrient intake or responding to food palatability. Interestingly, Zhu et al. found that deficiency of indispensable amino acids caused substantial upregulation of <italic>Crh</italic> transcript in PSTN<sup>CRH</sup> neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Zhu et al., 2012</xref>), suggesting that these neurons may mediate appetite for specific nutrients. Alternatively, these neurons may regulate conditioned associations between specific foods and aversive or appetitive cues.</p><p>Previous studies identified downstream projections from PSTN neurons to other anorexigenic neural populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Barbier et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Zhang and van den Pol, 2017</xref>), and our present results distinguish between projections from PSTN<sup>Tac1</sup> and PSTN<sup>CRH</sup> neurons. We initially identified the PSTN as a potential anorexigenic population by determining monosynaptic sources of input to PBN<sup>CGRP</sup> neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), subsequently determining that these projections originate from PSTN<sup>Tac1</sup> neurons. Consistently, stimulation of these projections reduces food consumption (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8M–P</xref>). Zhang et al. previously showed that stimulation of glutamatergic projections from the PSTN to the PVT reduces food consumption (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Zhang and van den Pol, 2017</xref>), and our consistent results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8I–L</xref>) suggest that these projections originate from PSTN<sup>Tac1</sup> neurons. We also determined that stimulation of projections from PSTN<sup>Tac1</sup> neurons to the CeA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8E–H</xref>) and NTS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8Q–T</xref>) reduce food consumption. Because we do not yet know whether individual PSTN<sup>Tac1</sup> neurons project to one or more downstream regions, we cannot rule out the potential effects of antidromic activation of each projection target, although stimulation of projections to the BNST caused no observable effects.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Role of PSTN neurons in mediating anorexigenic hormones</title><p>In addition to food stimuli, we found that administration of the anorexigenic hormones amylin, CCK, and PYY caused activation of PSTN<sup>Tac1</sup> and PSTN<sup>CRH</sup> neurons using <italic>Fos</italic> expression analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A–E</xref>). Likewise, using fiber photometry, we observed a transient increase in activity in PSTN<sup>Tac1</sup> neurons following administration of these hormones via an intraperitoneal catheter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F–L</xref>). Interestingly, chemogenetic inhibition of PSTN<sup>Tac1</sup> neurons attenuated but did not completely rescue the reduction in food intake caused by these hormones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A–J</xref>), indicating that PSTN<sup>Tac1</sup> neuron activity is partially necessary for the appetite-suppressing effects of these hormones. In support of these results, a recent study reported that chemogenetic inhibition of glutamatergic PSTN neurons decreases the appetite-suppressing effects of CCK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Sanchez et al., 2022</xref>). These results are similar to the effects of inhibiting PBN<sup>CGRP</sup> neurons, which also attenuates but does not completely rescue decreases in food consumption following administration of anorexigenic compounds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Campos et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Carter et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>It is interesting that chemogenetic inhibition of PSTN<sup>Tac1</sup> neurons caused an increase in food intake behavior over a sustained period even though the recorded calcium dynamics in these neurons occurred over a relatively short period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G–L</xref>). Perhaps, the neuropeptides released by PSTN<sup>Tac1</sup> neurons cause a sustained change in neural activity in downstream neural populations. Indeed, many other neural populations that affect food intake behavior also show a transient increase in neural activity on the timescale of seconds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Berrios et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Luskin et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Mohammad et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Wu et al., 2022</xref>). Alternatively, perhaps PSTN<sup>Tac1</sup> neurons exhibit a transient increase in activity but do not completely return to baseline levels over a sustained period in a way that is not detectable by fiber photometry. Indeed, comparisons of fiber photometry versus electrophysiology recordings of other neuronal populations, such as AgRP neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chen et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Mandelblat-Cerf et al., 2015</xref>), demonstrate that increased activity of neurons may persist even when fiber photometry recordings return to baseline.</p><p>It is also noteworthy that chemogenetic inhibition of PSTN<sup>Tac1</sup> neurons attenuates the effects of amylin, CCK, and PYY by decreasing the frequency of meals as opposed to meal size or meal duration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Previous studies of these anorexigenic hormones, especially amylin and CCK, indicate that they affect food intake primarily by decreasing meal size as opposed to meal frequency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Drazen and Woods, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lutz et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">West et al., 1987</xref>). Therefore, inhibition of PSTN<sup>Tac1</sup> neurons might attenuate the effects of these hormones indirectly, perhaps by reducing activity in downstream populations such as the NTS or PBN. In this model, infusion of anorexigenic hormones activate PSTN<sup>Tac1</sup> neurons that, in turn, cause sustained activation of downstream populations. Without this sustained activity, downstream populations may not have sufficient activity to cause a reduction in the inter-meal interval, leading to increased bouts of feeding. The mechanism by which anorexigenic hormones activate PSTN<sup>Tac1</sup> neurons, as well as how decreases in PSTN<sup>Tac1</sup> neuronal activity affect downstream populations, are important topics for future investigation.</p><p>The necessity of the PSTN for the full suppression of appetite following administration of anorexigenic hormones is similar to the findings of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Barbier et al., 2020</xref>, who report that PSTN neurons increase Fos expression in response to novel food exposure, to administration of the anorexigenic compound lipopolysaccharide (LPS), or to the anticancer chemotherapy drug cisplatin. Interestingly, chemogenetic inhibition of PSTN<sup>Tac1</sup> neurons also attenuated but did not completely rescue the reduction in food intake caused by LPS. Inhibition also reduced the reduction of food consumption following exposure to a novel taste. Thus, the PSTN seems to be partially necessary for the suppression of food intake following a wide variety of stimuli including endogenous anorexigenic hormones, exogenous compounds that induce sickness, and behaviors such as taste neophobia. Interestingly, these stimuli all cause activation of neurons in regions downstream of the PSTN including the CeA, NTS, and PBN. However, it is important to note that other studies show that PSTN neurons do not express Fos following administration of LiCl, a compound that causes transient visceral malaise, nor sensory exposure to the bitter tastant quinine hydrochloride (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Yasoshima et al., 2006</xref>). Future studies should examine a diverse range of stimuli that activate these neurons, as well as whether PSTN neuron activity is necessary for their full effects.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4"

Mice were anesthetized with 2.5% isoflurane (Henry Schein Animal Health) through a nose cone. Hair was removed from the animal’s ventral abdomen and dorsal back near the scapulae using Nair Hair Remover. A small incision was made between the scapulae and the skin was bluntly dissected from the subcutaneous tissue toward the left flank. A transverse abdominal skin incision was made and the skin was bluntly dissected from the subcutaneous tissue toward the flank to complete a subcutaneous tunnel between the two skin incisions. A sterilized catheter attached to a button (Instech, #1-VABM1B/25) was pulled through the tunnel using a hemostat. A small incision was made into the abdominal cavity and the tip of the catheter was placed into the incision site and sutured into place. The button was inserted into the incision made between the scapulae under the skin and was secured with sutures. The absence of leakage was confirmed by injecting 0.9% saline into the catheter and looking for liquid on the outside of the mouse. The abdominal muscle was sutured and the skin incision was closed in two layers.

For chemogenetic experiments, mice received intraperitoneal injection of clozapine-N-oxide (CNO; 0.3 mg/kg, Sigma-Aldrich, #C0832) 10 min prior to injection of an anorexigenic compound followed immediately by food intake recordings. Each mouse was used for a total of 5 experimental sessions, and the mean food intake value for each mouse was included for data analysis across all mice within an experimental group.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Fiber photometry</title><p>All fiber photometry experiments were performed in clear circular chambers with fresh bedding for each trial. Mice implanted with mono fiber-optic cannulae were attached to optical patchcords (400 µm core, 0.48 NA, 1 m long; Doric Lenses) via zirconia connectors (Doric Lenses, Sleeve_ZR_2.5_BK) at least 30 min before each trial to allow for habituation.</p><p>During each trial, a GCaMP excitation wavelength of 465 nm blue light modulated at 566 Hz was delivered through the patchcord. A control wavelength of 405 nm violet light modulated at 211 Hz was also delivered to detect calcium-independent GCaMP fluorescence or photobleaching. Delivered frequencies were offset to mitigate contamination or interference from electrical noise in the testing room. Excitation and control lights were generated from light emitting diodes (LEDs; Tucker-Davis Technologies, CLED_465 and CLED_405) and processed through a real-time amplifier (Tucker-Davis Technologies, RZ5P). Fluorescence signals were detected by a visible femtowatt photoreceiver (Tucker-Davis Technologies, Model 2151) with gain set to DC low. The light was then converted to electrical signals and demodulated by a real-time processor (Tucker-Davis Technologies, RZ5P). Data were recorded using Synapse software (Tucker-Davis Technologies).</p><p>To test the effects of food exposure on PSTN activity, mice were either fasted for 18 hr or fed ad libitum. After acclimating to the cage, a 30 min baseline recording was produced to ensure a stable signal and decrease photobleaching. At time t=0, mice were provided with either standard laboratory chow pellets, a small scoop of peanut butter, or a novel object (a mini screwdriver or roll of tape). To eliminate any effects of novelty, mice were provided peanut butter in their home cages for at least 2 days prior to testing. In some experiments, mice were water-deprived for 16 hr and at time t=0 a water port was placed in the cage.</p><p>To test the effects of peripheral hormone administration, mice were food deprived for 18 hr prior to acclimating in the testing chamber. Amylin, CCK, PYY, or 0.9% saline was delivered by intraperitoneal catheter at a total volume of 300 µl. Following hormone injection, the photometry recording continued for 20 min.</p><p>Data were analyzed using custom MATLAB (MathWorks) scripts (available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/MattCarter-WilliamsCollege/FiberPhotometryCode.git">https://github.com/MattCarter-WilliamsCollege/FiberPhotometryCode.git</ext-link>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Carter, 2022</xref>). The 465 and 405 signals were independently downsampled to 1 Hz and normalized to baseline signals to determine ΔF/F, in which ΔF/F = (F – F<sub>baseline</sub>) / F<sub>baseline</sub>, and F<sub>baseline</sub> is the median of 30 s baseline recording prior to time zero. No isosbestic normalization was introduced. To eliminate movement and bleaching artifacts, recordings with more than 20% change in the 405 nm signal were excluded from analyses. Plots representing mean ± standard error ΔF/F signals for each experiment and heatmaps representing ΔF/F for each trial were generated in MATLAB. Quantitative data analysis was performed in MATLAB and Prism 8.0 (GraphPad). The maximum ΔF/F was defined as the maximum ΔF/F signal intensity from t=0 to t=75 s. The area under the curve was defined as the integral of ΔF/F from t=0 until the time when ΔF/F returned to 0.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Optogenetic photostimulation</title><p>Mice were attached to fiber optic cables (200 μm core, 0.2 NA, 2 m long; Doric Lenses), coated with opaque heat-shrink tubing, via zirconia connectors (Doric Lenses, Sleeve_ZR_2.5) and allowed to acclimate for at least 3 days prior to experimental sessions. Cables were attached to a 473 nm blue-light laser (LaserGlow) driven by a Master-8 Pulse Stimulator (A.M.P.I.). Light was delivered in 10ms pulses at 20 Hz for 1 s every 4 s over a 1 hr period. During the testing period, food intake was measured for 1 hr before photostimulation, 1 hr during photostimulation, and 1 hr after photostimulation. Each mouse was used for a total of 5 experimental sessions, and the mean food intake value for each mouse was included for data analysis across all mice within an experimental group.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Perfusions and sectioning</title><p>Mice were anesthetized with intraperitoneal injection of 2, 2, 2-Tribromoethanol (Sigma-Aldrich, #48402) dissolved in Tert-amyl alcohol and sterile 0.9% saline. Mice were then transcardially perfused with cold 0.01 M phosphate buffered saline (PBS), pH 7.4, followed by 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS. The brains were extracted, allowed to postfix overnight in 4% paraformaldehyde at 4 °C, and cryoprotected in 30% sucrose dissolved in PBS for an additional 24 hr at 4 °C. Each brain was sectioned coronally at 30 µm on a microtome (Leica Microsystems) and collected in cold PBS. For projection tracing and fluorescent in situ hybridization experiments, the left side of each brain was marked with a pinhole to ensure images were taken from the same hemisphere in each brain. Brain sections were mounted onto SuperFrost Plus glass slides (VWR, #48311–703) and either immediately used for in situ hybridization experiments, immunohistochemistry experiments, or coverslipped with DAPI Fluoromount-G (Southern Biotech, #0100–20) and stored in the dark at 4 °C.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Fluorescent in situ hybridization</title><p>Fluorescent in situ hybridization reactions were performed using an RNAscope Multiplex Fluorescent Reagent Kit v2 (ACDBio, #323100) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.

The <italic>Fos</italic> probe was diluted 1:10 to reduce background hybridization. Fluorophore reagent packs (Akoya Biosciences) including Opal 520 (FP1487001KT), Opal 570 (FP1488001KT), and Opal 690 (FP1497001KT) were diluted to a final concentration of 1:1,500 with TSA buffer. Following staining procedures, slides were coverslipped with Fluoromount-G (Southern Biotech, #0100–01) and stored in the dark at 4 °C until microscopy and imaging.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Immunohistochemistry</title><p>Brain sections were washed three times in PBS with 0.2% Triton X-100 (PBST) for 10 min at room temperature. Sections were then incubated in a blocking solution composed of PBST with 3% normal donkey serum (Jackson ImmunoResearch, #017-000-121) for 15 min at room temperature. For primary antibody exposure, sections were incubated in rabbit anti-Fos (1:1000; Cell Signaling Technology, #2250) in blocking solution overnight at 4 °C. After three 5 min washes in blocking solution, sections were incubated in AlexaFluor 488 donkey anti-rabbit (1:250; Jackson ImmunoResearch, #711-545-152) in block solution for 1 hr at room temperature. Finally, sections were washed three times in PBS. Following staining procedures, slides were coverslipped with DAPI Fluoromount-G (Southern Biotech, #0100–20) and stored in the dark at 4 °C until microscopy and imaging.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Microscopy</title><p>For confirmation of virally targeted reporter expression, analysis of anterograde/retrograde projections, and examination of immunofluorescent labeling, slides were examined using an Eclipse 80i epifluorescent microscope (Nikon) and images were captured using a Retiga 2000R digital camera (QImaging). For FISH experiments, slides were examined using a Leica DMi8 confocal microscope. Single channel and overlay pictures were acquired for each section. The resulting images were minimally processed using Photoshop (Adobe) to enhance the brightness and contrast for optimal representation of the data. All digital images were processed in the same way between experimental conditions to avoid artificial manipulation between different datasets.</p><p>Analysis of anterograde or retrograde expression was performed on coronal brain sections spanning the entire rostrocaudal distance of the brain. Fluorescently labelled brain regions were identified using the Allen Mouse Brain Atlas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dong, 2008</xref>) and the Paxinos and Franklin Mouse Brain Atlas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Franklin and Paxinos, 2013</xref>).</p><p>Quantification of colocalization of fluorescently-labelled markers in the PSTN was performed on adjacent sections from ~ –2.3 to –2.84 mm from bregma (18 sections per mouse). The Photoshop <italic>count tool</italic> was used to accurately identify and tally individual neurons.

Assuming a significance level of 0.05, this calculator shows that with at least four mice per group, we had an 80% confidence level of achieving statistical significance between means of 1.1-fold. We excluded an animal from data analysis if flagged by an animal care technician for health reasons during the experimental period or if post hoc histological analysis showed no viral transduction as indicated by an absence of mCherry or GCaMP fluorescence.</p><p>Data were analyzed using Prism 8.0 (GraphPad Software).

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editor, and the evaluation has been overseen by John Huguenard as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Gina Leinninger (Reviewer #2); J. Nicholas Betley (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>As outlined below, several issues need to be clarified to improve the manuscript.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>(1) Intriguingly, the authors pinpointed that PSTMTac1 neurons may play distinguished roles from other anorexigenic neuronal circuits such as the parabrachial nucleus (PBN) and the central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA) as PSTNTac1 neurons may not be involved in aversive food intake behavior such as malaise. However, PSTMTac1 neurons project to the PBN and CeA, and the stimulation of terminal of PSTNTac1 neurons in the PBN and CeA decrease food intake. Although the authors argued that previous studies have shown that pharmacological compounds, which can induce malaise, do not induce Fos expression PSTN, it does not exclude the possibility that PSTNTac1 neuronal activation cause malaise or other aversive behavior. The authors may want to test this possibility by carrying out the simple experiment like examining if PSTNTac1 neuronal activation alters the amount of Kaolin intake.</p><p>(2) It is difficult to reconcile the following data in Figure 6. (A) Because the food intake was changed after 30-40 minutes after optogenetic stimulation (panel D), one can assume that PSTNTac1 neurons use neuropeptide instead of fast neurotransmitter as the authors discussed. (B) Interestingly, optogenetics approaches showed (panel E) that the amount of food intake after post-stimulation was comparable between groups, suggesting that fast neurotransmitters are involved. (C) Chemogenetic data showed that immediate decreases in food intake unlike optogenetics (though there were no significant differences in 0-40 min. It is a little bit odd as the error bars are extremely tight), and the effects lasted for 3 hours (panel K). In general understanding, chemogenetic effects are slow as CNO has to be metabolized, and CNO effects can last 30-90 minutes. The authors may want to discuss the data (especially chemogenetics) with the emphasis of differences between optogenetics and chemogenetics results.</p><p>(3) I recognized the superiority of liquid food for the precise measurement of food intake. However, the digestion (and other unknown factors) of liquid food may differ from solid food, which may affect hormone release (like insulin, GLP-1, etc) and eventually food intake behavior. I was wondering if the authors have tried solid food or can add discussion regarding the form of food used in the paper.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>I enjoyed this manuscript and think it is excellent in characterizing an understudied brain area with an array of methods. I have some suggestions regarding the text that the authors might consider, as there are some pieces of data that might bear further interpretation or altered presentation to better convey their meaning.</p><p>1) The title claims an &quot;essential&quot; role for a PSTN subpopulation in appetite suppression. To my understanding, an essential neuron is one that, if lesioned or inhibited, would prevent any manifestation of appetite suppression.

However, PSTMTac1 neurons project to the PBN and CeA, and the stimulation of terminal of PSTNTac1 neurons in the PBN and CeA decrease food intake. Although the authors argued that previous studies have shown that pharmacological compounds, which can induce malaise, do not induce Fos expression PSTN, it does not exclude the possibility that PSTNTac1 neuronal activation cause malaise or other aversive behavior. The authors may want to test this possibility by carrying out the simple experiment like examining if PSTNTac1 neuronal activation alters the amount of Kaolin intake.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the Reviewer for this suggestion. We are indeed currently performing experiments for a follow-up study to investigate whether PSTN neural activity is aversive. These experiments include studying the effect of PSTN neuron stimulation on Kaolin intake (as suggested), as well as other indices of aversion including conditioned place avoidance and conditioned flavor avoidance. We would prefer to keep these experiments together in a separate study, which we hope is acceptable to the Reviewer.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) It is difficult to reconcile the following data in Figure 6. (A) Because the food intake was changed after 30-40 minutes after optogenetic stimulation (panel D), one can assume that PSTNTac1 neurons use neuropeptide instead of fast neurotransmitter as the authors discussed. (B) Interestingly, optogenetics approaches showed (panel E) that the amount of food intake after post-stimulation was comparable between groups, suggesting that fast neurotransmitters are involved. (C) Chemogenetic data showed that immediate decreases in food intake unlike optogenetics (though there were no significant differences in 0-40 min. It is a little bit odd as the error bars are extremely tight), and the effects lasted for 3 hours (panel K). In general understanding, chemogenetic effects are slow as CNO has to be metabolized, and CNO effects can last 30-90 minutes. The authors may want to discuss the data (especially chemogenetics) with the emphasis of differences between optogenetics and chemogenetics results.</p></disp-quote><p>The Reviewer brings up excellent points that are worth discussion.</p><p>In our hands, CNO takes about 10 min to exert effects, and these effects often last 4-6 hours, much longer than the 3-h experimental duration for our stimulation and inhibition experiments.</p><p>We believe that our optogenetic and chemogenetic experiments are consistent with each other because each resulted in significant decreases in cumulative food intake about 50 min after the onset of stimulation. If we look at 5-min intervals starting from the onset of stimulation, we can observe statistically significant decreases in food intake earlier than 50 min, but we chose to report cumulative food intake because this method of visualizing data was less noisy and easy to perceive. For the optogenetic stimulation, all the significant differences between mCherry- and ChR2-mCherry-transduced animals in the post-stimulation period are due to the accumulated effects of stimulation during the stimulation period (as can be observed in panel 6E). The increased effects of chemogenetic stimulation during time 60-180 min are probably due to the fact that chemogenetic stimulation has not ceased and there is no post-stimulation data to report.</p><p>The Reviewer brings up an excellent point that the fact that optogenetic stimulation of PSTN<sup>Tac1</sup> neurons did not cause a statistically significant effect in the post-stimulation period suggests that these neurons may primarily exert effects due to glutamatergic rather than peptidergic signaling in downstream neurons. We added this point to the Discussion (page 13):</p><p>“Because the effects of optogenetic stimulation of PSTN<sup>Tac1</sup> neurons did not decrease food consumption during the post-stimulation period (Figure 6E), these neurons may primarily signal via fast glutamatergic neurotransmission, however, the specific contributions of glutamate versus neuropeptide release remain unknown. Future studies should test the effects of PSTN<sup>Tac1</sup> neuron stimulation in Tac1<sup>-/-</sup> animals or during concurrent administration of specific neuropeptide receptor antagonists.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) I recognized the superiority of liquid food for the precise measurement of food intake. However, the digestion (and other unknown factors) of liquid food may differ from solid food, which may affect hormone release (like insulin, GLP-1, etc) and eventually food intake behavior. I was wondering if the authors have tried solid food or can add discussion regarding the form of food used in the paper.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the Reviewer that this is an important point. We occasionally tried solid food in some experiments—informal observations suggest that stimulation of PSTN<sup>Tac1</sup> neurons does indeed reduce food intake in mice eating standard lab chow, but we did not perform these experiments with rigor necessary for publication. We agree that the differences between solid and liquid diet are important to mention, therefore we added a paragraph to the Discussion (page 12):</p><p>“We note that our measurements of PSTN neuron activity following refeeding or presentation of food (Figure 3) utilized solid mouse chow while experiments that tested the effects of inhibition or stimulation of PSTN neural activity on food intake behavior (Figures 5, 6, and 8) utilized a more palatable liquid diet. We chose a liquid diet to more precisely measure food consumption, but this diet differs in texture and nutritional content with a notably higher carbohydrate content. It is therefore likely that this liquid diet affects stomach distention and hormone release differently from solid chow.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>I enjoyed this manuscript and think it is excellent in characterizing an understudied brain area with an array of methods. I have some suggestions regarding the text that the authors might consider, as there are some pieces of data that might bear further interpretation or altered presentation to better convey their meaning.</p><p>1) The title claims an &quot;essential&quot; role for a PSTN subpopulation in appetite suppression. To my understanding, an essential neuron is one that, if lesioned or inhibited, would prevent any manifestation of appetite suppression. Yet, inhibiting PSTNTac1 neurons at baseline does not impede feeding. Inhibiting the PSTNTac1 neurons does mitigate the ability of anorectic hormones to suppress feeding, but does not completely prevent it. As such, I would suggest removing &quot;essential&quot; from the title to appropriately categorize the role of the neurons.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the Reviewer for this very valid suggestion. We have removed the word “essential” from the Title. Our revised title is now: “A discrete parasubthalamic nucleus subpopulation plays a critical role in appetite suppression.” We have also removed the word “essential” from the Abstract.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) In Figure 3C, the Crh1:cFos quantitation looks elevated and similar to Tac:cFos quantification, but the qualitative images do not show much, if any, Crh1:Fos. Perhaps more representative Crh1:Fos images could be included.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate this comment very much because it demonstrates that our coloring scheme depicting overlap between Fos (cyan) and Crh (green) is not ideal. The qualitative image does indeed show a high degree of overlap between Fos and Crh, but it is not easy to perceive. Therefore, we have kept the original images but adopted a new color scheme which we believe is much easier to discern. Please see our response to the next comment, below, which addresses the same issue.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) In general, green + cyan colocalization is difficult to appreciate. The authors might consider an alternative pseudo-coloring scheme to make the overlap easier to see.</p></disp-quote><p>Following the comment above, we have changed our coloring scheme to a format that we think is much easier to perceive. We changed the cyan color to a deeper blue that has better contrast with the green color used to label Crh-expressing neurons. We also changed the settings in our “merged” images such that any colocalization between the blue and either magenta or green channels results in a white color. Therefore, the three individual colors stand out from each other and the colocalization is much easier to discern. We are very thankful to the Reviewer for this suggestion as it makes our histological data in Figures 2-4 much more impactful and improves the visualization of our data.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Figure 8: the text suggests that the PSTNTac1 and PSTNCrh populations project to some different areas, but the figure doesn't show all of the same brain areas for BOTH populations. Presenting the same areas would be optimally transparent and more impactful to appreciate the differences of the populations.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the Reviewer for this excellent suggestion and have changed the Figure accordingly (We believe the Reviewer was referring to Figure 7 instead of Figure 8). Figure 7 now presents representative images of the same brain areas for both populations of neurons.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) It would be helpful to state the n's in the figure legends.</p></disp-quote><p>We have edited the figure legends to state N values.</p></body></sub-article></article>
