In insects and other arthropods, which have only innate immune mechanisms, four main immune-specific modules have been described in the defense against microbial invaders: the Toll pathway, the Imd pathway, the melanization response, and phagocytosis by plasmatocytes. Our present understanding of their relative importance remains fragmented as their contribution to host defense has never been simultaneously assessed across a large panel of pathogens. Here, we use newly described immune mutants in a controlled genetic background to systematically delete these four immune modules individually, in pairs, or even all four simultaneously. Surprisingly, flies simultaneously deficient in all four immune modules are viable (poor viability), homozygous fertile, and display no overt morphological defects, suggesting these immune mechanisms are not strictly required for organismal development. We assessed the contribution of each module individually and collectively against a diverse panel of viruses, fungi, and bacteria. We find these four modules largely function independently and additively in host defense. We could confirm previous findings on the importance of Imd and Toll, and their antimicrobial peptide and Bomanin (Bom) effectors, against relevant microbes. We also reveal a highly important role of melanization against viruses. Examining microbial load kinetics confirms how these modules contribute to resistance or tolerance against specific microbes. The set of immune-deficient lines provided here offers tools to better assess the role of these immune modules in host defense.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>phagocytosis</kwd><kwd>melanization</kwd><kwd>antimicrobial peptides</kwd><kwd>Toll</kwd><kwd>Imd</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/00yjd3n13</institution-id><institution>Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Förderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>310030_215073</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lemaitre</surname><given-names>Bruno</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/029chgv08</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id award-id-type="doi">10.35802/227559</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hanson</surname><given-names>Mark Austin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection, and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.

Although immunity has been studied in many animal species, it has been extensively characterized in only a subset of them such as the nematode <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>, the fruit fly <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>, zebrafish, rodents, and humans. The traditional understanding of the immune system pictures it as a specialized group of cells and tissues, but this has gradually changed over recent years to a more complex picture of highly redundant multilevel defense modules. We have learned a great deal in the last few decades on the molecular mechanisms regulating each of these immune modules from recognition and signaling to effector action (e.g. phagocytosis, antimicrobial peptides [AMPs]) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Pradeu et al., 2024</xref>). However, an immune response encompasses the concomitant activation of several modules, and there has been little investigation of how each module collectively contributes to host defense. Indeed, the immune research field has traditionally focused on one module at a time. This article aims to fill this gap by collectively analyzing the specific contribution of the main immune modules involved in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> systemic response.</p><p>The <italic>Drosophila</italic> systemic immune response consists of a set of humoral and cellular reactions in the hemolymph (insect blood) when flies are systemically infected by bacteria, viruses, or fungi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Liegeois and Ferrandon, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Westlake et al., 2024</xref>). A first facet of the systemic immune response is the production of host-defense effectors by the fat body and hemocytes that are secreted into the hemolymph. Among the best-characterized effectors are the AMPs, whose expression is induced to incredibly high levels upon infection in a race to control invading microbes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hanson et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Imler and Bulet, 2005</xref>). AMPs are small cationic peptides that exhibit antimicrobial activity that directly participates in microbial killing. Beyond AMPs, many other proteins and host defense peptides (HDPs) are secreted into the hemolymph, creating a hostile environment for invading pathogens. The systemic antimicrobial response is predominantly regulated at the transcriptional level by the Toll and Imd pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">De Gregorio et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Lemaitre et al., 1996</xref>). In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, the Toll pathway is activated by cell wall components (fungal glucans and Lysine-type peptidoglycan), as well as microbial proteases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Gottar et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Issa et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Leulier et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Vaz et al., 2019</xref>). Toll signaling culminates in the activation of two NF-κB transcription factors, Dif and Dorsal, which regulate a large set of immune genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Ip, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Lemaitre et al., 1996</xref>). These encode small peptides such as the antifungal peptide Drosomycin, the Toll-regulated Bomanin peptides, and many other proteins (e.g. serine proteases, serpins, and lipases) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Clemmons et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">De Gregorio et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Fehlbaum et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Ligoxygakis et al., 2003</xref>). Flies lacking the Toll pathway are viable but highly susceptible to infection by Gram-positive bacteria and fungi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Buchon et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Lemaitre et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Rutschmann et al., 2002</xref>). The Imd pathway is activated by DAP-type peptidoglycan produced by Gram-negative bacteria and a subset of Gram-positive bacteria (e.g. <italic>Bacillus</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Kaneko et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Lemaitre et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Leulier et al., 2003</xref>). The binding of peptidoglycan to receptors of the Peptidoglycan Recognition Protein family (PGRP-SD, PGRP-LC, PGRP-LE) initiates an intracellular signaling cascade, which ultimately activates the NF-κB factor Relish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Choe et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Iatsenko et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Kaneko et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Westlake et al., 2024</xref>). The Imd pathway regulates the expression of many genes encoding antibacterial peptides and serine proteases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">De Gregorio et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Lemaitre et al., 1997</xref>). Imd-deficient flies are viable but susceptible to Gram-negative bacterial infection.</p><p>In addition to humoral pathways, melanization, and phagocytosis are two complementary mechanisms that contribute to host survival upon systemic infection. Melanization is an arthropod-specific immune response resulting in the rapid deposition of the black pigment melanin at wound or infection sites and the concomitant production of microbicidal reactive oxygen species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cerenius et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Nappi et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Westlake et al., 2024</xref>). The melanization and Toll pathways are co-activated at the level of the serine proteases Hayan and Persephone, which in turn activate Spatzle-processing enzyme (SPE) of the Toll pathway and serine proteases critical to cleavage of prophenoloxidases (PPOs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Dudzic et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Nakano et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Shan et al., 2023</xref>), collectively referred to as the Toll-PO SP cascade (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Westlake et al., 2024</xref>). The melanization reaction itself relies on the oxidation of phenols, resulting in the polymerization of melanin. Two PPOs (PPO1 and PPO2) are the primary catalysts for the synthesis of melanin during the melanization response upon systemic infection. Flies deficient for both <italic>PPO1</italic> and <italic>PPO2</italic> are viable but lack hemolymph phenoloxidase activity and exhibit susceptibility to certain Gram-positive bacteria and fungi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Binggeli et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dudzic et al., 2015</xref>). In addition, a third PPO gene (PPO3) is specifically expressed by lamellocytes, specialized hemocytes that differentiate in larvae responding to and enveloping invading parasites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dudzic et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Phagocytosis by both sessile and circulating plasmatocytes (<italic>Drosophila</italic> equivalent of macrophages) is thought to provide a complementary and important host defense (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Melcarne et al., 2019b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Ulvila et al., 2011</xref>). The use of hemocyte-deficient flies, via the targeted expression of a pro-apoptotic gene in plasmatocytes only, has shown that hemocytes contribute to survival upon systemic infection to certain bacterial species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Charroux and Royet, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Defaye et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Stephenson et al., 2022</xref>). Phagocytosis of bacteria greatly relies on two transmembrane receptors, NimC1 and Eater (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bretscher et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Kocks et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Kurucz et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Melcarne et al., 2019b</xref>). <italic>NimC1, Eater</italic> double mutant larvae are viable, have elevated hemocyte numbers at the larval stage, and their hemocytes can encapsulate and melanize macroparasites; however, their hemocytes are non-sessile and nearly totally phagocytosis deficient. <italic>NimC1, Eater</italic> adult flies have decreased hemocyte numbers and fail to perform phagocytosis, providing a good tool to assess the role of the cellular response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Melcarne et al., 2019b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Melcarne, 2020</xref>).</p><p>We have circumstantial evidence that these four immune modules are critical for defense against certain pathogens. However, how, when, and to what extent each of these four immune modules contributes to host defense against specific pathogens is fragmented as they have never been simultaneously assessed. Moreover, the extent to which these findings can be generalized to broad classes of pathogens remains unclear.</p><p>In this article, we have used a specific set of mutations principally affecting phagocytosis (<italic>NimC1, Eater</italic>)<italic>,</italic> melanization (<italic>PPO1, PPO2</italic>), the Toll pathway (<italic>spz</italic>), and the Imd pathway (<italic>Rel</italic>) in a controlled genetic background to address their role in host defense. We then recombined these and other mutations to generate double and even quadruple mutants of the four immune modules. This set of tools allowed us to compare the survival of flies deficient in these responses against a broad panel of viruses, fungi, Gram-positive bacteria, and Gram-negative bacteria, to reveal the relative contribution of each immune mechanism to resistance against these pathogens.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>A set of immune-deficient lines in the iso Drosdel background</title><p>Mutations affecting only one of the four main modules of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> systemic immune response have been described.

In addition, to blocking phagocytosis, <italic>∆Phag</italic> flies have a defect in hemocyte sessility, an increased total number of larval hemocytes, and a decreased number of hemocytes at the adult stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bretscher et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Melcarne et al., 2019b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Melcarne, 2020</xref>). We have preferred to use <italic>NimC1<sup>1</sup>; eater<sup>1</sup></italic> to study the contribution of hemocytes rather than other approaches with important indirect effects such as the pre-injection of latex beads to saturate phagocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Elrod-Erickson et al., 2000</xref>), or expression of a pro-apoptotic gene in plasmatocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Charroux and Royet, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Defaye et al., 2009</xref>). All the mutations in this study were partly isogenized for seven or more generations into the DrosDel <italic>iso w<sup>1118</sup></italic> genetic background (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Ferreira et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Ryder et al., 2004</xref>). We then generated by recombination six out of the seven combinations of flies simultaneously lacking two immune modules with the exception of <italic>ΔTOLL</italic>, <italic>ΔPhag</italic> as <italic>NimC1<sup>1</sup>; eater<sup>1</sup></italic>, <italic>spz<sup>rm7</sup></italic> flies were not viable (see fly strains in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). Of note, in our hands, recombinant <italic>Rel<sup>E20</sup>, spz<sup>rm7</sup></italic> flies were not viable in the DrosDel isogenic background, forcing us to use non-iso flies to assess the host defense of <italic>ΔIMD</italic>, <italic>ΔTOLL</italic> flies. Over the course of our study, isogenic <italic>NimC1<sup>1</sup>;eater<sup>1</sup></italic> flies also displayed viability issues, and specific experiments used non-isogenic flies to improve confidence in phenotypes; these experiments are noted in figure captions. We used two approaches to simultaneously delete the Toll and Melanization modules: (i) <italic>PPO1</italic><sup>∆</sup><italic>, PPO2</italic><sup>∆</sup>; <italic>spz<sup>rm7</sup></italic> flies (referred to as <italic>ΔTOLL</italic>, <italic>ΔMel<sup>PPS</sup></italic>) and (ii) flies carrying a small viable deletion <italic>Hayan-psh<sup>Def</sup></italic> (referred to as <italic>ΔTOLL</italic>, <italic>ΔMel<sup>HP</sup></italic>) that removes two clustered serine protease genes, <italic>Hayan</italic>, and <italic>persephone</italic>, which blocks the TOLL-PO SP cascade that regulates both humoral-Toll and melanization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Dudzic et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Westlake et al., 2024</xref>). This allowed us to delete the Toll and melanization pathways using only one deletion event on the <italic>X</italic> chromosome. Excitingly, we succeeded in generating a fly line deficient for all four immune modules with the genotype: <italic>Hayan-psh<sup>Def</sup>; NimC1<sup>1</sup>; eater<sup>1</sup>, Rel<sup>E20</sup></italic> hereafter named <italic>ΔITPM</italic> (<italic>ΔIMD</italic>, <italic>ΔTOLL</italic>, <italic>ΔPhag</italic>, <italic>ΔMel</italic>). These flies were homozygous viable with very poor viability and homozygous fertile, despite major deficiencies in these four important systemic immune mechanisms. These flies allow us to monitor survival kinetics and pathogen growth in the near-total absence of an immune system. Finally, we added two isogenic fly lines in our analysis that delete key HDPs downstream of the Toll and Imd pathways: (i) <italic>Bom<sup>∆55C</sup></italic>, a short deletion removing ten Bomanins at position 55C, which causes a major susceptibility to infection by Gram-positive bacteria and fungi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Clemmons et al., 2015</xref>), and (ii) <italic>∆AMP14</italic>, a compound fly line of eight mutations removing 14 AMP genes (4 Cecropins, 4 Attacins, 2 Diptericins, Drosocin, Defensin, Drosomycin, and Metchnikowin), which causes a major susceptibility to infection by Gram-negative bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Carboni et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hanson et al., 2019</xref>).

For instance, the Toll and Imd pathways both regulate a subset of genes involved in melanization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">De Gregorio et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Ligoxygakis et al., 2002</xref>). Moreover, one module can indirectly affect another. For instance, a lack of melanization could increase the bacterial load after infection, resulting in higher activation of the Toll and Imd pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Binggeli et al., 2014</xref>). As a first step, we analyzed the activation of each of the four modules in single- and multiple-module-deficient flies using classical readouts of these modules. This also allowed monitoring of the possible effects of deleting one module on the activity of another. We analyzed the immune response in single-module-deficient flies by monitoring (i) the expression of the antibacterial peptide gene <italic>Diptericin</italic> (<italic>DptA</italic> – a target of the Imd pathway), and (ii) the antifungal peptide gene <italic>Drosomycin</italic> (<italic>Drs</italic> – a target of the Toll pathway) upon systemic infection with a mixture of heat-killed <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> and <italic>Micrococcus luteus</italic>, (iii) ex vivo phagocytosis of <italic>E. coli</italic> and <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> coated bio-particles incubated with larval hemocytes, and (iv) melanization at the injury site of adult flies. This analysis first confirmed that <italic>∆IMD</italic>, <italic>∆TOLL</italic>, <italic>∆Phag</italic>, and <italic>∆Mel</italic> flies are deficient for Imd, Toll, phagocytosis, and melanization, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–D</xref>). We note that the expression level of <italic>DptA</italic> was roughly similar to the wild-type in <italic>∆TOLL</italic> and <italic>∆Mel</italic> flies; however, <italic>DPhag</italic> flies show reduced <italic>DptA</italic> induction at 6 hr compared to WT (~50%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). This still represents an immense induction of <italic>DptA</italic> after infection but may suggest a lag or lesser overall Imd response in <italic>DPhag</italic> flies. <italic>DptA</italic> expression in <italic>DPhag</italic> was, however, comparable to wild-type at 12 and 24 hr. On the other hand, the <italic>Drs</italic> induction at 6 hr of <italic>DMel</italic> flies upon heat-killed <italic>M. luteus</italic> injection was significantly higher than WT (~1.6x), as found previously using live <italic>M. luteus</italic> infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Binggeli et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). The phagocytic assay confirmed that the <italic>∆Phag</italic> mutant was significantly impaired in its ability to phagocytose bacterial bio-particles. Furthermore, <italic>∆IMD</italic> and <italic>∆Mel</italic> mutant larvae had similar levels of phagocytic index to the wild-type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), while <italic>∆TOLL</italic> had a higher phagocytic index, if anything.

Collectively, this analysis indicates that each of the four immune modules can be selectively blocked in the isogenic DrosDel background without interfering with the competence of the others. We sometimes noticed a modest difference of module activity in the absence of another (higher Toll activity in <italic>∆Mel</italic>, lower IMD activity in <italic>∆Phag</italic>, and higher phagocytic activity in <italic>∆TOLL</italic>)<italic>,</italic> findings that require further exploration to be fully established.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Each immune module functions largely independently from other immune modules.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Activation of the Imd pathway, as revealed by <italic>DptA</italic> expression following infection with a mixture of heat-killed <italic>E. coli</italic> and <italic>M. luteus,</italic> is broadly wild-type in single-module mutants other than Imd.

This analysis confirms that <italic>ΔITPM</italic> flies, although viable, are indeed fully immune deficient for the four host defense modules. We did not detect any striking synergistic or antagonistic effects in which deleting two modules has a vastly different impact compared to the additive effect of deleting the two modules individually.

The <italic>∆TOLL, ∆Mel<sup>PPS</sup></italic> and <italic>∆TOLL, ∆Mel<sup>HP</sup></italic> flies display <italic>Drs</italic> induction at 6 hr, which is resolved to unchallenged WT levels by 12 hr, consistent with this induction coming from an early input from the IMD pathway in these backgrounds. Taken together, all the compound mutant flies behave largely as expected given the sum effects of their individual mutations, confirming that these modules largely function independently.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Both the Melanization and TOLL modules contribute to wounding and lifespan</title><p>Before assessing the resistance to infection, we monitored fly survival at 25 and 29°C to determine if these mutations impact viability in the absence of challenge. At 25°C, no single mutants died significantly more than the wild-type in the absence of challenge within the 10-day window (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). However, looking at compound mutants, even in the absence of challenge, each compound mutant other than <italic>∆IMD, ΔTOLL</italic> suffered 25% cumulative mortality by 10 days post-eclosion, while <italic>∆TOLL, ΔMel<sup>PP</sup></italic><sup>S</sup>, and <italic>∆ITPM</italic> flies suffered even greater cumulative mortality. Similar trends were observed at 29°C with slightly elevated mortality (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>).

This pathway also contributes, albeit to a lesser extent, to survival against the Gram-positive bacteria <italic>B. subtilis</italic> and <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic>, which bear DAP-type peptidoglycan at their membrane that triggers Imd activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Kaneko et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Leulier et al., 2003</xref>). We were interested to see the impact of our <italic>∆IMD</italic> flies in host defense to viruses as the specific mutation we used (<italic>Rel<sup>E20</sup></italic>) deletes a transcription factor common to both the canonical Imd pathway and the recently appreciated cGLR–Sting–Relish pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Goto et al., 2018</xref>). We found that <italic>∆IMD</italic> mutant flies were somewhat susceptible to the four viruses DCV, FHV, DXV, and IIV6, but not SINV, agreeing with previous studies showing a reduction in lifespan of 1–2 days for <italic>Rel</italic> mutant flies after viral infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Costa et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Goto et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Sansone et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>This study also confirms a prominent role of the Toll pathway in survival upon infection by all virulent Gram-positive bacteria and fungi upon septic injury.

A contribution of the Toll pathway to survival was also observed for some Gram-negative bacteria, including a minor contribution to survival upon <italic>Pr. rettgeri</italic> infection, and a major contribution after <italic>V. parahemolyticus</italic> infection. In addition, we found a susceptibility of ΔTOLL flies to FHV, DXV, and IIV6, suggesting Toll-regulated effectors mediate defense against viral infection.</p><p>Use of <italic>DPhag</italic> mutants reveals a role of the cellular response in survival against the fungus <italic>B. bassiana.

Susceptibilities to Gram-negative bacteria could result from the observed lag in Imd pathway activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>); indeed, previous studies have shown a full <italic>DptA</italic> response is pivotal for defense against <italic>Pr. rettgeri</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hanson et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hanson et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Unckless et al., 2016</xref>), and lifespans are greatly impacted by subtle differences when using pathogens with intermediate levels of virulence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Duneau et al., 2017a</xref>). A role for Imd in explaining <italic>DPhag</italic> susceptibilities does not detract from the importance of the cellular response, but instead offers a mechanistic route to explore for these phenotypes.</p><p>Surprisingly, our study reveals a relatively consistent role of melanization against all the tested viruses, notably so for DXV, IIV-6, and SINV. <italic>∆Mel</italic> flies also display a minor increased susceptibility to <italic>B. bassiana</italic> natural infection and septic injury. As previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Dudzic et al., 2019</xref>), <italic>DMel</italic> flies are highly susceptible to the Gram-positive bacterium <italic>S. aureus</italic>, rivaling the susceptibility of <italic>DITPM</italic> flies. <italic>DMel</italic> flies further show a strong susceptibility to <italic>Pr. rettgeri</italic> rivaling <italic>DIMD</italic> flies, and also a minor susceptibility to infection by other Gram-negative bacteria (<italic>Pr. burhodogranariea</italic>, <italic>E. coli</italic>).</p><p>Collectively, the use of single-module mutants confirms the major role of the Imd pathway against Gram-negative bacteria and Toll against virulent Gram-positive bacteria and fungi. Interestingly, melanization was consistently important to survive virus infection and plays a prominent and important role in defense against specific bacterial species. While it was almost never the most critical module, phagocytosis and the cellular response contribute to survival against various germs. Use of single-module-deficient flies alongside <italic>DITPM</italic> flies reveals that survival to some of the microbes tested can rely almost entirely on one pathway (Imd – <italic>Ecc15</italic>, <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic>, <italic>E. cloacae</italic>, <italic>Pr. burhodogranariea</italic>; Toll – <italic>E. faecalis</italic>), or can receive notable contributions from two pathways (Toll and IMD – <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic>, <italic>B. subtilis</italic>, <italic>V. parahemolyticus</italic>; Toll and Phagocytosis – <italic>A. fumigatus</italic> and <italic>B. bassiana</italic> natural infection<italic>;</italic> Imd and Melanization – DCV).

These peptides are the principal effectors of the Toll and Imd pathways, yet mutations for AMPs and HDPs typically have not been tested alongside mutations for both the Imd and the Toll pathways across pathogens, as studies have typically included just the one relevant pathway mutation as a positive control. Thus, the importance of AMPs and HDPs relative to the pathways that regulate them has been only partially investigated. We used <italic>DAMP14</italic> and <italic>DBom</italic> flies to assess the extent by which AMPs and Bomanins contribute to Toll and Imd activities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>).

However, they did not assess the possible additive, synergistic, or antagonistic contribution of these four modules. Moreover, they did not monitor to which extent these modules were important in the absence of other modules. To address this, we compared the survival of single- to double-module-deficient flies lacking two modules and <italic>DITPM</italic> flies lacking all four modules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>).</p><p>We first observed that <italic>ΔITPM</italic> flies, which lack the four modules, were always as or more susceptible than single- and double-module-deficient flies. In multiple cases, single or double mutants already rivaled the susceptibility of <italic>ΔITPM</italic> flies in microbe-specific ways. In particular, the susceptibility of <italic>ΔIMD</italic> flies to most Gram-negative bacteria rivaled <italic>ΔITPM</italic>, and for some germs, <italic>DTOLL</italic> (<italic>L. monocytogenes</italic>, <italic>E. faecalis</italic>, <italic>B. bassiana</italic> injury) or <italic>DMel</italic> (<italic>S. aureus</italic>) alone was comparable to <italic>DITPM</italic>. In other cases, however, combined loss of two pathways was necessary to rival <italic>DITPM</italic> susceptibilities. For instance, <italic>ΔIMD, ΔTOLL</italic> deletion causes complete <italic>DITPM</italic>-like susceptibility to <italic>B. subtilis</italic>, <italic>M. luteus</italic>, and <italic>E. coli</italic>, and near-complete susceptibility to <italic>Sa. typhimurium. ΔIMD, ΔTOLL</italic> further causes increased susceptibility to most viruses compared to their individual mutant strains. In these cases, there is clear synergy or additivity of the contributions of the two pathways, as either pathway alone results in only a minor or no susceptibility. We also observed intriguing differences between our two versions of <italic>ΔTOLL, ΔMel</italic> flies, as <italic>ΔTOLL, ΔMel<sup>PPS</sup></italic> tended to succumb to infection to a greater extent than <italic>ΔTOLL, ΔMel<sup>HP</sup></italic>, consistent with the differences observed upon clean injury (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). <italic>DTOLL</italic>, <italic>DMel<sup>PPS</sup></italic> displayed a minor increase in susceptibility compared to <italic>DTOLL</italic>, <italic>DMel<sup>HP</sup></italic> to <italic>A. fumigatus</italic> natural infection, and more prominent susceptibilities to the yeast <italic>C. albicans</italic>, the Gram-positive bacteria <italic>M. marinum</italic>, <italic>M. luteus</italic>, and also to Gram-negative bacteria <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic>, <italic>E. coli</italic>, <italic>Pr. rettgeri</italic>, and <italic>Pr. burhodogranariea</italic>.</p><p>Collectively, use of double-module-deficient flies uncovers the role of immune modules to host defense that were masked by other modules.

Meanwhile, activation of the Imd and Toll pathways takes hours to reach peak concentrations of HDPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Uttenweiler-Joseph et al., 1998</xref>).

This suggests the Imd pathway can suppress early <italic>S. aureus</italic> growth, and possibly also phagocytosis, although this <italic>∆Phag</italic> could ultimately stem from lesser Imd induction. Interestingly, flies lacking melanization displayed the highest susceptibility but did not depart from wild-type or other modules in pathogen load until 12 hr post-infection. While the melanization reaction is a rapid response, these results suggest that the killing activity of the melanization response acts with slower kinetics. In <italic>DITPM</italic> flies, we further observed earlier <italic>S. aureus</italic> growth at 2 and 6 hr like <italic>DIMD</italic> and <italic>DPhag</italic> flies. However, <italic>S. aureus</italic> loads at 12–24 hr were more comparable in <italic>DITPM</italic> flies to <italic>DMel</italic> flies. These trends agree both with survival data kinetics and an independent action of each of these pathways in their resistance effects against <italic>S. aureus</italic>.

On the other hand, <italic>∆Phag</italic> and <italic>∆Mel</italic> flies did not show any increased <italic>C. albicans</italic> loads within the 24 hr time window despite onset of mortality at later time points. Finally, <italic>∆ITPM</italic> flies displayed more consistent and rapid growth of <italic>C. albicans</italic> than <italic>DTOLL</italic> or <italic>DIMD</italic> alone, particularly visible at 12–24 hr post-infection, consistent with independent contributions of both Toll and Imd in resistance to this yeast.</p><p>All survival experiments to this point were done with males.

For all three pathogens (<italic>Pr. rettgeri</italic>, <italic>S. aureus</italic>, and <italic>C. albicans</italic>), the rank order of susceptibility was broadly similar between males and females, with higher rates of mortality in females overall. Thus, we found no marked sex-by-genotype interaction. Interestingly, the greater susceptibility of females in our hands is true even for <italic>∆ITPM</italic> flies against <italic>C. albicans</italic>, although there were only a few surviving flies on which we can base these conclusions. However, these data may suggest the sexual dimorphism in defense against infection that we see against these pathogens is due to factors independent of the immune modules we disrupted.</p><p>Collectively, we observed that microbial growth parallels the susceptibility of modules indicating that they work in resistance. Surprisingly, we did not observe an early role in pathogen killing for melanization despite melanization regulating a rapid blackening response in ex vivo assays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Nakhleh et al., 2017</xref>). We further recover stochasticity in microbe loads across genotypes as expected when only a subset of individuals suppresses the pathogen and survives the infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Duneau et al., 2017a</xref>). The more rapid and more consistent microbial growth kinetics of <italic>DITPM</italic> flies, particularly visible by 18 hr, further demonstrate that these pathways contribute to resistance collectively.</p></sec><sec id="s2-8"><title>Contributions of individual modules to disease tolerance</title><p>An increasingly used metric to delineate roles of resistance and tolerance is the Pathogen Load Upon Death (PLUD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Duneau et al., 2017a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Duneau et al., 2025</xref>).

Yet here we recovered many individuals from both of these module-deficient lines that died with a far lower PLUD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>).

Using various assays, we confirmed the validity of our lines, revealing that each module can be activated independently. We did, however, observe a higher Toll activation in <italic>∆Mel</italic> flies upon systemic infection with dead bacteria. Future studies may reveal if this higher Toll activity in <italic>∆Mel</italic> flies involves a regulatory pathway, or perhaps reflects higher persistence of microbial elicitors (e.g. peptidoglycan) that activate the Toll pathway. We also observed a lesser Imd activation in <italic>∆Phag</italic> flies at 6 hr post-infection, which could reflect a role for hemocytes to stimulate the Imd systemic response. In this study, we used <italic>NimC1<sup>1</sup>; eater<sup>1</sup></italic> double mutants to assess the cellular response. These flies have defects in phagocytosis, but also adhesion and sessility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Melcarne et al., 2019b</xref>). <italic>NimC1<sup>1</sup>; eater<sup>1</sup></italic> larvae also have increased hemocyte number at the larval stage, but adults rapidly lose Hml-positive cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Melcarne, 2020</xref>). Despite these limitations, we believe that the mutations we have used here are among the best available to assess the role of these four modules to host defense. Surprisingly, we could produce a fly line lacking the four main defense mechanisms of the systemic immune response, indicating that none of these modules is essential for survival. Theoretically, <italic>∆ITPM</italic> flies are almost completely immune deficient, but they can still clot wounds, activate the JNK and JAK–STAT pathways that mediate the wound healing response, and retain constitutive immune defense molecules that could also provide a certain degree of protection. Consistent with several studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Capilla et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Carvalho et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Rämet et al., 2002</xref>), we show that Toll and melanization synergistically contribute to wound healing in adults. However, the observation that <italic>∆Phag, ∆Mel</italic> or <italic>∆IMD, ∆Mel</italic> double mutant flies are also more susceptible to clean injury than <italic>∆Mel</italic> flies indicates that the Imd pathway and phagocytosis also contribute to wound healing. Thus, although immune-deficient fly lines for the four modules are viable, the use of compound mutation and <italic>∆ITPM</italic> flies reveals a clear role of the immune system in response to wounding and lifespan maintenance.</p><p>Use of single- and double-module-deficient flies provides key insights on the mechanisms used by <italic>Drosophila</italic> to combat infection. We could confirm previous studies revealing the role of Imd against Gram-negative bacteria, Toll against Gram-positive bacteria and virulent fungi, and an importance of melanization and phagocytosis against specific pathogens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Charroux and Royet, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Defaye et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Garg and Wu, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Nehme et al., 2011</xref>). Surprisingly, melanization was a consistently important module in survival to virus infection. It seems unlikely that PPO activity taking place in the hemolymph could combat viral agents that are intracellular. We instead speculate this contribution of melanization to surviving virus infection could be due to its role in wound healing, a role in infected cell clearance, or perhaps autotoxic contributions of melanization reaction intermediates that fail to convert in phenoloxidase-deficient flies. We additionally recovered a role of Imd signaling (i.e. <italic>Relish</italic>) in antiviral defense, which was expected given recent characterizations of cGLR–Sting–Relish antiviral immunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ai et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cai et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Goto et al., 2018</xref>). However, susceptibilities of <italic>Rel<sup>E20</sup></italic> flies were paralleled by <italic>∆AMP14</italic> in all cases, suggesting AMPs contribute to this susceptibility. While Sting regulates a number of genes likely important for antiviral defense (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Goto et al., 2018</xref>), the susceptibility we observe here could be a direct action of AMPs on enveloped viruses as described in some studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Feng et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Huang et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Yasin et al., 2004</xref>), or an indirect effect, such as a failure to regulate gut microbes after the damage induced by viral replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Marra et al., 2021</xref>). We additionally used dual modes of infection for the fungus <italic>B. bassiana</italic>, finding an importance of melanization and Toll signaling in both infection modes. However, our study reveals that Bomanin effectors explain most of the Toll contribution upon septic injury but not natural infection, for <italic>B. bassiana</italic>. This observation is in line with different importance of effectors or modules according to the route of infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Martins et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Our double-module mutant analysis reveals that most modules contribute additively to host defense. This is consistent with these modules functioning independently. However, we noticed instances of synergy between two pathways, notably including Toll and Imd. Synergy between Toll and Imd can be explained by the fact that many immune-inducible regulated genes receive input from both the Imd and Toll pathways, including genes like <italic>Metchnikowin</italic>, <italic>Drosomycin</italic>, and <italic>Transferrin1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">De Gregorio et al., 2002</xref>). Finally, we also observed rarer cases of synergistic susceptibility in flies deficient for Toll and Melanization or Imd and Melanization.</p><p>Our study confirms that the Toll and Imd humoral modules provide a broad role against certain classes of pathogens, Imd for Gram-negative bacteria and DAP-type containing Gram-positive bacteria, and Toll for Fungi and Gram-positive bacteria. Use of AMP and Bomanin mutants revealed that this can be largely explained by the effectors they control. In contrast, the contribution of phagocytosis and melanization appears to be critical to a more specific and diverse set of pathogens. We speculate that phagocytes or melanization are critical to handle bacteria that resist HDPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hanson et al., 2019</xref>), or can hide from them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Touré et al., 2023</xref>). The melanization reaction is a source of ROS that is potent against pathogens such as <italic>S. aureus</italic> that have been shown to be sensitive to ROS and resistant to Toll and Imd defenses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Dudzic et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Ford and King, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Needham et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Ramond et al., 2021</xref>). These two modules play important roles in immune-related processes such as encapsulation (melanization), the uptake of bacteria escaping from the gut, or tissue homeostasis (phagocytosis) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Braun et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Melcarne et al., 2019b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Nehme et al., 2007</xref>), which were not assessed here. Collectively, our study validates, with minor discrepancies, many studies that have assessed the contribution of these modules individually (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Apidianakis et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Binggeli et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Lamiable et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Lemaitre et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Lemaitre et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Nehme et al., 2011</xref>). Our mutant lines can now be used to analyze the contribution of these immune modules in resistance to other pathogens, notably wasps, nematodes, microsporidia, and protozoans, or in other contexts such as mating and local infection.</p><p>While some immune modules play a predominant role against some pathogens, other pathogens are handled by multiple modules. We hypothesize that pathogens that have intermediate levels of virulence, killing only a fraction of wild-type flies, may better reveal the role of multiple modules. Indeed, the stochasticity in survival analysis partly stems from the arms race occurring between the pathogen and host immunity, as shown for <italic>Pr. rettgeri</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Duneau et al., 2017a</xref>). In this condition, any small change in the immune system may tip the outcome of the arm race toward lethality or survival. In this line of thinking, it is notable that multiple modules were important to survive <italic>Pr. rettgeri</italic> infection. Previous studies have revealed a major role of the Imd pathway-regulated AMP Diptericin A against this bacterium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hanson et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hanson et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Unckless et al., 2016</xref>). However, Duneau et al. showed that survival patterns to <italic>Pr. rettgeri</italic> bifurcate into two outcomes based on time taken to fully activate systemic defenses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Duneau et al., 2017a</xref>), and showed a role for a Toll-PO SP cascade regulating serine protease in defense against this microbe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Duneau et al., 2017b</xref>). We may speculate that melanization, although not as uniquely critical as Diptericin, might tip the balance of this arms race toward host lethality, resulting in comparable survival phenotypes. The observation that <italic>DPhag</italic> flies expressed less <italic>DptA</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) can also explain their susceptibility. Future studies will clarify how these multiple modules can contribute to host survival according to additive or Achilles dynamics – the concept that microbes have generic or specific weaknesses that host effectors can target (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Hanson, 2024</xref>). It will also be important to consider the distinct roles of resistance, tolerance, and resilience in host defense (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Howick and Lazzaro, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Wukitch et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Duneau et al., 2025</xref>).</p><p>We observed a good correlation between survival analysis and pathogen growth in single-module flies for <italic>Pr. rettgeri</italic>, <italic>S. aureus</italic>, and <italic>C. albicans</italic>. This indicates that these immune modules mostly contribute to resistance mechanisms that target pathogen growth. Our study did not reveal key early contributions of phagocytosis or melanization to control pathogen growth, despite their quasi-immediate activation; higher <italic>S. aureus</italic> growth at 2 hr in <italic>DPhag</italic> flies was paralleled by <italic>DImd</italic> flies, and we observed lesser Imd activation in <italic>DPhag</italic> flies. Melanization, while being critical to survive <italic>S. aureus</italic> infection, impacts bacterial growth beginning only after the 6-hr time point. This indicates that the melanization microbicidal activity in vivo takes place slower than the blackening reaction seen from bled hemolymph. Interestingly, <italic>∆Phag</italic> and also <italic>∆Mel</italic> flies could suppress <italic>C. albicans</italic> yeast growth, but ultimately some individuals succumb to infection with lower PLUD levels. We confirmed <italic>∆Phag</italic> PLUD results using both an isogenic and a second wild-type genetic background, suggesting this lower PLUD is genuine. Susceptibility to fungal infection independent of fungal proliferation has also been reported using an <italic>A. fumigatus</italic> septic infection model and relies on the protection offered by Bomanins from pathogen-secreted toxins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Xu et al., 2023</xref>). It is tempting to speculate, based on the modules involved, that the loss of tolerance to <italic>C. albicans</italic> we observe has to do with wound repair or accumulating damage, such as what has been reported in beetles that suffer renal failure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Khan et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Li et al., 2020</xref>), or flies with autotoxic trachea degradation upon stress pathway disruption (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Rommelaere et al., 2024</xref>). Thus, this tolerance effect could rely on pathogen-mediated or autotoxic damage, which may be elucidated in a future study.</p><p>Here, we have provided a single and double mutant analysis of <italic>Drosophila</italic> immune module functions. Our study provides several insights on what modules are most important to survive infection by defined pathogens. However, we also highlight the collective contribution of modules to defense even when one module is of an outsized importance. We extend our comprehension of innate immune responses by revealing higher complexity, implicating multiple host defense modules in survival to various germs, including some with more cryptic contributions. As illustrated by our previous characterizations of AMP function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Carboni et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hanson et al., 2019</xref>), the melanization response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dudzic et al., 2015</xref>), and stress-induced Turandot proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Rommelaere et al., 2024</xref>), a combinatorial mutation approach to deciphering immune functions can be extended even to the broad level of immune modules. Of note, we were unable to systematically sample all genotype-by-pathogen interactions equally. We have therefore been highly conservative in our reporting of major effects. There are likely many important interactions not discussed in our study. Future investigations may highlight important biology that is apparent in our data, but which we may not have mentioned here. To this end, we have deposited our isogenic immunity fly stocks in the Vienna <italic>Drosophila</italic> Resource Centre to facilitate their use. Beyond immunity, our tools can also be of use to study various questions at the cutting edge of aging, memory, neurodegeneration, cancer, and more, where immune genes have been implicated repeatedly. We hope that this set of lines will be useful to the community to better characterize the <italic>Drosophila</italic> host defense.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Insect stocks</title><p>Precise details of <italic>Drosophila</italic> stocks used in this study are provided in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>.

Double mutants for <italic>NimC1<sup>1</sup>; Eater<sup>1</sup></italic> were poorly viable when isogenized in the <italic>DrosDel iso w<sup>1118</sup></italic> background, and so we used both isogenic and non-isogenic lines over the course of our study to facilitate investigation. Furthermore, the <italic>NimC1<sup>1</sup>; spz<sup>rm7</sup>, Eater<sup>1</sup></italic> triple mutants were homozygous lethal isogenized or not, and so could not be included. In addition, the line <italic>∆AMP14</italic> bears a knockout of 14 different AMP genes, which includes the AMP families Drosomycin, Metchnikowin, Cecropin, Defensin, Drosocin, Attacin, and Diptericin, described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Carboni et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hanson et al., 2019</xref>).

Statistical differences were tested using Brown–Forsythe and Welch ANOVA tests with Dunnett’s multiple test correction, which consider unequal variance.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf2"><p>Reviewing editor, eLife</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Data curation, Investigation, Methodology, Writing – original draft</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Conceptualization, Investigation, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Data curation, Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Data curation, Formal analysis, Supervision, Validation, Visualization, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Project administration</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s6"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="supp1"><label>Supplementary file 1.</label><caption><title>Microbe characteristics and growth conditions.</title></caption><media xlink:href="elife-107030-supp1-v1.xlsx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="xlsx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="supp2"><label>Supplementary file 2.</label><caption><title>Survival curves for data summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>.</title></caption><media xlink:href="elife-107030-supp2-v1.zip" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="zip"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="supp3"><label>Supplementary file 3.</label><caption><title>Survival analysis outputs for data summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>.</title></caption><media xlink:href="elife-107030-supp3-v1.zip" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="zip"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="supp4"><label>Supplementary file 4.</label><caption><title>Supplemental discussion of fly genetics and considerations for the use of genotypes described in this study.</title></caption><media xlink:href="elife-107030-supp4-v1.docx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="docx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="mdar"><label>MDAR checklist</label><media xlink:href="elife-107030-mdarchecklist1-v1.docx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="docx"/></supplementary-material></sec><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="s7"><title>Data availability</title><p>All data analyzed in this manuscript are provided in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1 supp2 supp3 supp4">Supplementary file 1–4</xref>.

Four major immune-specific modules-the Toll pathway, the Imd pathway, melanization, and phagocytosis-play critical roles in orchestrating the immune response. Traditionally, most studies have focused on the function of individual modules in isolation. However, in recent years, it has become increasingly evident that effective immune defense requires intricate interactions among these pathways.</p><p>Despite this growing recognition, the precise roles, timing, and interconnections of these immune modules remain poorly understood. Moreover, addressing these questions represents a major scientific undertaking.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>In this manuscript, Ryckebusch et al. systematically evaluate both the individual and combined contributions of these four immune modules to host defense against a range of pathogens. Their findings significantly enhance our understanding of the layered architecture of innate immunity.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="referee-report" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.107030.3.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Reviewer #2 (Public review):</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><anonymous/><role specific-use="referee">Reviewer</role></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>Summary:</p><p>In this work, the authors take a holistic view at the <italic>Drosophila</italic> immunity by selecting four major components of fly immunity often studied separately (Toll signaling, Imd signaling, phagocytosis and melanization), and studying their combinatory effects on the efficiency of the immune response. They achieve this by using fly lines mutant for one of these components, or modules, as well as for a combination of them, and testing the survival of these flies upon infection with a plethora of pathogens (bacterial, viral and fungal).</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>It is clear that this manuscript has required a large amount of hands-on work, considering the number of pathogens, mutations and timepoints tested. In my opinion, this work is a very welcome addition to the literature on fly immune responses, which obviously do not occur one type of a response at a time, but in parallel, subsequently and/or are interconnected. I find that the major strength of this work is the overall concept, which is made possible by the mutations designed to target the specific immune function of each module, without effects on other functions. I believe that the combinatory mutants will be of use for the fly community and enable further studies of interplay of these components of immune response in various settings.</p><p>To control for the effects arising from the genetic variation other than the intended mutations, the mutants have been backcrossed into a widely used, isogenized <italic>Drosophila</italic> strain called w1118. Therefore, the differences accounted for by the genotype are controlled.</p><p>I also appreciate that the authors have investigated the two possible ways of dealing with an infection: tolerance and resistance, and how the modules play into those.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>While controlling for the background effects is vital, the w1118 background is problematic (an issue not limited to this manuscript) because of the wide effects of the white mutation on several phenotypes (also other than eye color/eyesight). It is a possibility that the mutation influences the functionality of the immune response components. I acknowledge that it is not reasonable to ask for data in different backgrounds better representing a &quot;wild type&quot; fly, but I think this matter should be brought up and discussed.</p><p>The whole study has been conducted on male flies. Immune responses show quite extensive sex-specific variation across a variety of species studied, also in the fly. But the reasons for this variation are not fully understood. Therefore, I suggest that the authors would conduct a subset of experiments on female flies to see if the findings apply to both sexes, especially the infection-specificity of the module combinations.</p><p>Comments on the revised manuscript:</p><p>I appreciate the author's responses to the points I raised and the additional work they have conducted. The authors have now discussed the possible background effect and added an experiment on female flies showing that the module function is applicable to both sexes.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="author-comment" id="sa3"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.107030.3.sa3</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Ryckebusch</surname><given-names>Faustine</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Lausanne</named-content></addr-line><country>Switzerland</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Tian</surname><given-names>Yao</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Lausanne</named-content></addr-line><country>Switzerland</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Rapin</surname><given-names>Mylene</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Lausanne</named-content></addr-line><country>Switzerland</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Schüpfer</surname><given-names>Fanny</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>School of Life Sciences, Ecole Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL)</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Lausanne</named-content></addr-line><country>Switzerland</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Hanson</surname><given-names>Mark Austin</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of Exeter</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Penryn</named-content></addr-line><country>United Kingdom</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Lemaitre</surname><given-names>Bruno</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Lausanne</named-content></addr-line><country>Switzerland</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>The innate immune system serves as the first line of defense against invading pathogens. Four major immune-specific modules - the Toll pathway, the Imd pathway, melanization, and phagocytosis- play critical roles in orchestrating the immune response. Traditionally, most studies have focused on the function of individual modules in isolation. However, in recent years, it has become increasingly evident that effective immune defense requires intricate interactions among these pathways.</p><p>Despite this growing recognition, the precise roles, timing, and interconnections of these immune modules remain poorly understood. Moreover, addressing these questions represents a major scientific undertaking.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>In this manuscript, Ryckebusch et al. systematically evaluate both the individual and combined contributions of these four immune modules to host defense against a range of pathogens. Their findings significantly enhance our understanding of the layered architecture of innate immunity.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for their kind assessment.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>While I have no critical concerns regarding the study, I do have several suggestions to offer that may help further strengthen the manuscript. These include:</p><p>(1) Have the authors validated the efficiency of the mutants used in this study? It would be helpful to include supporting data or references confirming that the mutations effectively disrupted the intended immune pathways.</p></disp-quote><p>We have done so in Figure 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) Given the extensive use of double, triple, and quadruple mutants, a more detailed description of the mutant construction process is warranted.</p></disp-quote><p>We now provide a supplement (File S1) that details the successive genetic crosses and recombinations that were required to generate these compound fly stocks carrying multiple mutations. We also provide some information regarding rapid screening of stocks for phenotypes. Of note some of these fly stocks have been deposited at VDRC as they will be useful to fly community to assess immune modules in a controlled background, and complete stock information will be tied to these stocks there.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>In this work, the authors take a holistic view of <italic>Drosophila</italic> immunity by selecting four major components of fly immunity often studied separately (Toll signaling, Imd signaling, phagocytosis, and melanization), and studying their combinatory effects on the efficiency of the immune response. They achieve this by using fly lines mutant for one of these components, or modules, as well as for a combination of them, and testing the survival of these flies upon infection with a plethora of pathogens (bacterial, viral, and fungal).</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>It is clear that this manuscript has required a large amount of hands-on work, considering the number of pathogens, mutations, and timepoints tested. In my opinion, this work is a very welcome addition to the literature on fly immune responses, which obviously do not occur in one type of response at a time, but in parallel, subsequently, and/or are interconnected. I find that the major strength of this work is the overall concept, which is made possible by the mutations designed to target the specific immune function of each module (at least seemingly) without major effects on other functions. I believe that the combinatory mutants will be of use for the fly community and enable further studies of the interplay of these components of immune response in various settings.</p><p>To control for the effects arising from the genetic variation other than the intended mutations, the mutants have been backcrossed into a widely used, isogenized <italic>Drosophila</italic> strain called w1118. Therefore, the differences accounted for by the genotype are controlled.</p><p>I also appreciate that the authors have investigated the two possible ways of dealing with an infection: tolerance and resistance, and how the modules play into those.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for their kind assessment.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>While controlling for the background effects is vital, the w1118 background is problematic (an issue not limited to this manuscript) because of the wide effects of the white mutation on several phenotypes (also other than eye color/eyesight). It is a possibility that the mutation influences the functionality of the immune response components, for example, via effects of the faulty tryptophan handling on the metabolism of the animal.</p><p>I acknowledge that it is not reasonable to ask for data in different backgrounds better representing a &quot;wild type&quot; fly (however, that is defined is another question), but I think this matter should be brought up and discussed.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer and have included caveats on the different genetic effects brought about the combinatory mutant approach including differences in white gene status, insertion of GFP or DsRed markers, and nature of genetic mutations (Line 142-on).</p><p>“Of note, the strains used in this study differ in their presence/absence of the white<sup>+</sup> gene, present in the PPO1<sup>∆</sup>, NimC1<sup>1</sup> and eater<sup>1</sup> mutations. In addition to its well established function in eye pigmentation, the white gene can also impact host neurology and intestinal stem cell proliferation (Ferreiro et al., 2017; Sasaki et al., 2021). We did not observe any obvious correlations between white<sup>+</sup> gene status and susceptibilities in this study. Moreover, in a previous study looking at the cumulative effects of AMP mutations on lifespan, white gene status and fluorescent markers did not readily explain differences in longevity (Hanson and Lemaitre, 2023). We therefore believe that the extreme immune susceptibility we have created through deficiencies for pathways regulating hundreds of genes, or major immune modules, overwhelms the potential effects of white<sup>+</sup> and other transgenic markers. For additional information on which stocks bear which markers, see discussion in Supplementary file 1.”</p><p>Of interest, we were highly conscious of this concern in working with combinatory AMP mutants which differed in white, GFP, and DsRed copies. However, even over the many weeks of snowballing effects on microbiota community composition and structure, we found no trends tied strictly to white+ or to other genetic insertions on lifespan (Hanson and Lemaitre, 2023; DMM).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The whole study has been conducted on male flies. Immune responses show quite extensive sex-specific variation across a variety of species studied, also in the fly. But the reasons for this variation are not fully understood. Therefore, I suggest that the authors conduct a subset of experiments on female flies to see if the findings apply to both sexes, especially the infection-specificity of the module combinations.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this suggestion. We have performed the requested experiments, and include female survival trends in Figure 4supp1. We have added the following text to the main manuscript (Line 554):</p><p>“All survival experiments to this point were done with males. We therefore assessed key survival trends for these infections in females to learn whether the dynamics we observed were consistent across sexes (Figure 4supp1). For all three pathogens (Pr rettgeri, Sa aureus, C. albicans) the rank order of susceptibility was broadly similar between males and females, with higher rates of mortality in females overall. Thus, we found no marked sex-bygenotype interaction. Interestingly, the greater susceptibility of females in our hands is true even for ∆ITPM flies, although there are only a few surviving flies on which we can base these conclusions. However, these data may suggest the sexual dimorphism in defense against infection that we see against these pathogens is due to factors independent of the immune modules we disrupted.”</p><p>It is worth noting that male-female sex dichotomies in infection are inconsistent across the literature, with strong lab-specific effects (Belmonte et al., 2020 and personal observation). In our lab setting, we consistently see female mortality higher than males when compared, independent of pathogen and mutant background. We have not seen notable interaction terms of sex and genotype for most immune deficient mutants. It is quite interesting to have done these experiments with ITPM, however, which reveals that there is at least a trend suggesting this dichotomy is independent of the four immune modules we deleted. Still, our infection conditions kill most males, and so it would be good to replicate this sex-specific ∆ITPM result in a dedicated study with doses chosen to improve the resolution of male-female differences. For now, we prefer to use conservative language and avoid overinterpreting this trend, but do feel it merits mentioning.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Recommendations for the authors:</bold></p></disp-quote><p>Comment on statistical requests</p><p>Both reviewers requested further clarity on the statistical analyses supplemental to Figure 3. We haved address these comments as follows.</p><p>First, we now provide an additional supplementary .zip file containing summary statistics for all survival data in Figure 3 (Supplementary File 3). We have additionally added this text to line 226 to make this data treatment more clear:</p><p>…” we chose to focus on major differences apparent in summary statistics,Highlighting”…</p><p>And we highlight that all survival data are also provided as Kaplan-Meier survival curves in the main or supplementary figures in Line 233:</p><p>“Kaplan-Meier survival curves for all experiments are provided in the main text or supplementary information”.</p><p>Second, as outlined in the main text, we were unable to sample across all pathogenby-genotype interactions systematically, and this unfortunately obfuscates robust statistical modelling. We addressed the challenge of finding meaningful statistical differences by focusing on trends only if they were (i) consistent across experimental replicates, (ii) of a consistent logic across comparable genotypes, ensuring random inter-experimental noise was not unduly shaping interpretations, and (iii) of a mean lifespan difference ≥1.0 days compared to wild-type, and compared to relevant unchallenged or clean-injury controls. This last choice was especially important because not all experimental replicates included all genotypes due to challenges of animal husbandry and coordination among multiple researchers over five years of data collection. As a result, our initial analyses using a cox mixed-effects model found it to be rather useless, being insensitive to important experiment batch effects visible to the eye because statistically-affected genotypes were not present in all experiments.</p><p>We therefore ensured that behaviour relative to controls within* experiments was consistent, rather than the comparison of genotypes to controls across the sum of experiments with a post-hoc treatment attempting to apportion variance to experiment batch (but unable to do so for some genotypes and some batches). Due to differeces in baseline health and the dynamics explained by studies like Duneau et al. 2017; eLife, there is an expected unequal variance of genotype*pathogen interactions across experiment batches. Unfortunately, this unequal variance, coupled with incomplete sampling across experiment batches, means “highly significant” differences can emerge that don’t hold up to scrutiny of comparisons to controls taken only from within an experiment batch. Thus, we chose to forego a cox mixed effect model approach entirely. Instead, our highly conservative approach, focusing on only very large effects with a mean lifespan difference ≥1.0 days, mitigates these issues. We have taken great care to ensure that any results we highlight stand up to inter-experiment batch effects. We would further draw the reviewers’ attention to our response to Reviewer 2 relating to Figure 3, which emphasizes the level of conservativism that we are applying.</p><p>At the end of the Discussion, we have added the following sentence to emphasize these limitations:</p><p>“…a combinatorial mutation approach to deciphering immune function can be extended even to the broad level of whole immune modules. Of note, we were unable to systematically sample all genotype-bypathogen interactions equally. We have therefore been highly conservative in our reporting of major effects. There are likely many important interactions” not discussed in our study. Future investigations may highlight important biology that is apparent in our data, but which we may not have mentioned here. To this end, we have deposited our isogenic immunity fly stocks in the Vienna <italic>Drosophila</italic> Resource Centre to facilitate their use. Beyond immunity, our tools can also be of use to study various questions at the cutting edge of aging, memory, neurodegeneration, cancer, and more, where immune genes are repeatedly implicated. We hope that this set of lines will be useful to the community to better characterize the <italic>Drosophila</italic> host defense.”</p><p>We recognise this response may not fully satisfy the reviewers’ requests. While use of summary statistics is simple, our rules for highlighting interactions of importance are defined, readily understood and interpreted, and draw attention to key trends in that are backed by a solid understanding of the data and its limitations. We have taken this approach out of a responsibility to avoid making spurious assertions that stem from underpowered statistical models rather than from the biology itself.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p><p>(1) Lines 1092-1093 - Please double-check the labeling of the panels in Figure 2.

We focus on differences of mean lifespan of at least 1 day, and which are consistent in direction across combinatory mutations. We have avoided the multiple comparisons of cox proportional hazard survival analyses throughout this study because they are overly sensitive for our purposes, as we have previously when systematically comparing many genotypes to each other (see Hanson and Lemaitre, 2023; DMM).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) Minor points: Hml-Gal4, UAS-GFP should be italic; Line 192-- &quot;uL&quot; and &quot;uM&quot;; Line 596: P&gt;.05.</p></disp-quote><p>We have made these changes.

For the main figures, statistics should be indicated in the figure for an easier assessment of the data. In case of multiple comparisons potentially crowding the plots too much, statistics may be in a supplementary file/table.</p></disp-quote><p>See response above.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In case of the hemocytes, besides phagocytosis, I would think that ROS generation via the DUOX/NOX system is also an integral part of the immune response against pathogens, and that has not been included here. That might be an interesting addition for future experiments. As the NimC1, eater double mutant flies are said to have fewer hemocytes, it is possible that this function of the hemocytes is affected as well. This could be commented on in the text.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer raises a good point. The role of DUOX and NOX in ROS responses is not assessed in our study. To our knowledge, DUOX and NOX participate primarily in the wound repair response, or in epithelial renewal at damage sites or in the gut. In our study on systemic immunity, we did not assess the role of clotting, the precise function of ROS, and we have missed other host defense or stress response mechanisms as well (e.g. constitutively-expressed AMP-like genes, TEPs, JAK-STAT) that likely play a role in the systemic immune defense. Considering the lethality caused by Nox and Duox mutation, there would be inherent genetic difficulties to recombine these as multiple mutations. Unfortunately, this makes it difficult to include these processes in our analysis in a systematic manner. We are already happy to have generated fly lines lacking four immune modules simultaneously, even if they are not fully immune deficient. We have mentioned this point in the discussion (Line 613-on).</p><p>Of note, the NimC1, eater double mutants actually have decreased hemocyte counts at the adult stage (Melcarne et al,. 2019). Thus NimC1, eater double mutants are not impaired only in phagocytosis, but the overall cellular response. We make a point to outline this in Line 225-257, and 607.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>I think it could be mentioned that the melanization response at larval stage (against parasitoids) functions differently from the melanization described here (requiring hemocyte differentiation and PPO3).</p></disp-quote><p>A good point. We have added this mention in Line 97:</p><p>“In addition, a third PPO gene (PPO3) is specifically expressed by lamellocytes, specialized hemocytes that differentiate in larvae responding to and enveloping invading parasites (Dudzic et al., 2015)”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Overall, the clarity of the figures and figure legends could be worked on to make them a bit easier to follow. Below are some of my suggestions:</p><p>(1) In Figure 2, adding headings to parts C &amp; D (similarly to A &amp; B) would make it easier to follow what is happening in the figure at a glance. Also, it is rather difficult to visually follow which strain is which in the plots. I'd suggest adding the key/legend for single mutants below 2A &amp; B, and the key for the double mutants below C &amp; D. If a mutant is present in A &amp; B and in C &amp; D, it could be included in both keys. I also think that it would be intuitive to present the single mutants by dashed lines and double mutants by continuous lines (or vice versa), so that one would easily distinguish between them. Of note, the figure legend says that A &amp; B are single mutants, but for example in B there are also some double mutants (?).</p></disp-quote><p>We have modified Figure 2 and Figure 2supp1 labelling. We also realise there was an error in the column titling that contributed to the confusion. We hope the new layout is clear, and thank the reviewers for noting this issue.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) In Figure 3, it looks like ΔMel is almost identical to controls in the clean injury survival, but in Figure 2C, it is clearly doing worse. I might be missing something here, but would like the authors to clarify the matter. Also, the meaning of the numbers in the heat map could be explained in the figure legend and/or added to the figure (color key).</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer is correct. We thank the reviewer for this astute observation. Inadvertently, we used an old version of the Figure 2 preparation where only a subset of experiments was entered in the Prism data file rather than the total data used to inform Figure 3. This issue affected all genotypes.</p><p>We have reviewed the data in Figure 2, Figure 2supp1, and Figure 3, and updated these figures accordingly to ensure they represent the full survival data. We have also incorporated new experiments into the sum data related to male-female differences and to fill gaps in the data from the 1<sup>st</sup> submission. We will also note due to the nature of 1<sup>st</sup> decimal rounding that the difference between WT and ΔMel appears slightly underrepresented: the true difference (over the 7-day lifespan) is 0.37. We’ve provided a version of this figure rounded to 2 decimal places below, but prefer the simpler 1 decimal place in the main text for readability. The updated Figure 2 shows the full data in Figure 3 accurately.</p><p>We will also take this opportunity to highlight how conservative our ≥1.0 days difference approach is. Breaking down survival curve patterns in Figure 2 relative to mean differences in Figure 3, for clean injury, approximately ~75% of ΔMel flies survive to day 7 with mortality mostly taking place between days 3-7. The result is a mean lifespan of 6.37 days. On a survival curve, this difference appears quite strong, but in our mean lifespan table the difference is rather muted (WT vs. ΔMel difference = 0.37 days). Thus, differences of ≥1.0 days reflect very strong trends in survival data that are near-guaranteed to be independent of experimental noise. While we note issues that prevented us from a fully systematic sampling for all experiments, we are confident that the ≥1.0 day differences we highlight, using the rules explained in the main text, are robust. While this approach could be seen as overly conservative, it is our preference in this initial study, containing combinations of 25 treatments and 14 genotypes, to be highly conservative. Future studies may investigate other strong differences we have not highlighted, and the data we provide here can help generate expectations and guide those studies.</p><fig id="sa3fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Figure 3 with 2 decimals places of rounding for mean lifespans.</title><p>The 7-day clean injury mean lifespan of WT is 6.74 days, and of ΔMel is 6.37 days. Due to rounding, in the 1 decimal Figure 3 this difference appears as if it is only 0.3 days, but it closer to 0.4 days. Regardless, this level of difference, which appears rather clearly in a survival curve, is well below the level of difference we have chosen to highlight in our study.</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-107030-sa3-fig1-v1.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(1) Figure 4: I find it very tedious to compare CFUs among different mutants from the plots. As the idea is to compare bacterial loads among the mutants at different timepoints, it would be easier to compare them if the data were shown within a timepoint (CFUs of each mutant at 2h, at 6h, and so on). This is also how the results are written in the text (within a time point).

We feel both representations have merits and pitfalls, but prefer our original design showing the progression of bacterial growth within genotype first. However, we have added dotted lines representing the wild-type bacterial loads at 2hpi, 12hpi, and 24hpi to assist the reader in making acrossgenotype comparisons at key time points. Like this, the reader can see if the error bars (StDev) overlap the mean of the wild-type, and so make more intuitive judgements about whether these differences are meaningful.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) Figure 2D is not referred to in the text.</p></disp-quote><p>We now cite Fig2D in Line 356.</p></body></sub-article></article>
