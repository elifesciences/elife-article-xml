plays an apparent dual physiological role by participating in activation and proliferation of leukocytes as well as promoting apoptosis in several types of tumor cells. Therefore, Kv1.3 is considered a potential pharmacological target for immunodeficiency and cancer. Different cellular locations of Kv1.3, at the plasma membrane or the mitochondria, could be responsible for such duality. While plasma membrane Kv1.3 facilitates proliferation, the mitochondrial channel modulates apoptotic signaling. Several molecular determinants of Kv1.3 drive the channel to the cell surface, but no information is available about its mitochondrial targeting. Caveolins, which are able to modulate cell survival, participate in the plasma membrane targeting of Kv1.3. The channel, via a caveolin-binding domain (CDB), associates with caveolin 1 (Cav1), which localizes Kv1.3 to lipid raft membrane microdomains. The aim of our study was to understand the role of such interactions not only for channel targeting but also for cell survival in mammalian cells. By using a caveolin association-deficient channel (Kv1.3 CDB<italic><sub>less</sub></italic>), we demonstrate here that while the Kv1.3–Cav1 interaction is responsible for the channel localization in the plasma membrane, a lack of such interaction accumulates Kv1.3 in the mitochondria. Kv1.3 CDB<italic><sub>less</sub></italic> severely affects mitochondrial physiology and cell survival, indicating that a functional link of Kv1.3 with Cav1 within the mitochondria modulates the pro-apoptotic effects of the channel. Therefore, the balance exerted by these two complementary mechanisms fine-tune the physiological role of Kv1.3 during cell survival or apoptosis. Our data highlight an unexpected role for the mitochondrial caveolin–Kv1.3 axis during cell survival and apoptosis.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>ion channels</kwd><kwd>leukocytes</kwd><kwd>apoptosis</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd><kwd><italic>Xenopus</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100014440</institution-id><institution>Ministerio de Ciencia, Innovación y Universidades</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BFU2017-87104-R</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Felipe</surname><given-names>Antonio</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100014440</institution-id><institution>Ministerio de Ciencia, Innovación y Universidades</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PID2020-112647RB-I00</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Felipe</surname><given-names>Antonio</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100014440</institution-id><institution>Ministerio de Ciencia, Innovación y Universidades</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CSD2008-00005</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Morales</surname><given-names>Andrés</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100005010</institution-id><institution>Italian Association for Cancer Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>20286</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Szabó</surname><given-names>Ildiko</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003407</institution-id><institution>Ministero dell'Istruzione, dell'Università e della Ricerca</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PRIN 20174TB8KW_004</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Szabó</surname><given-names>Ildiko</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100007378</institution-id><institution>Associazione Italiana Sclerosi Multipla</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Szabó</surname><given-names>Ildiko</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100008530</institution-id><institution>European Regional Development Fund</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Felipe</surname><given-names>Antonio</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The association of caveolin with the potassium channel Kv1.3 fine-tunes cell survival and apoptosis.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The voltage-gated potassium channel Kv1.3 is present at the plasma membrane of different cell types, mostly neurons and leukocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cahalan and Chandy, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Martínez-Mármol et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Solé et al., 2016</xref>). Kv1.3 participates in cell proliferation, activation, and apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Pérez-Verdaguer et al., 2016b</xref>). Thus, altered expression of the channel is linked to different pathologies such as autoimmune diseases and cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Rus et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Vallejo-Gracia et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Serrano-Novillo et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Szabo et al., 2021</xref>). Kv1.3 is efficiently expressed on the cell surface, which depends on multiple forward trafficking signatures located at the C-terminal domain of the channel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Martínez-Mármol et al., 2013</xref>). Moreover, different ancillary interactions modulate the trafficking of Kv1.3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Capera et al., 2019</xref>). For example, the Kv1.5 channel and the regulatory KCNE4 subunit retain Kv1.3 at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), negatively modulating the channel surface expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Vicente et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Vicente et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Solé et al., 2009</xref>). In addition, the scaffolding protein caveolin 1 (Cav1) controls Kv1.3 spatial localization in raft microdomains, which is important for signaling and cell physiology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Pérez-Verdaguer et al., 2016a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Pérez-Verdaguer et al., 2018</xref>). Therefore, by controlling Kv1.3 surface expression and localization, oligomeric associations fine-tune physiological events.</p><p>Caveolin (Cav) is the main structural component of caveolae, a specialized form of membrane lipid raft with a characteristic omega-shaped structure. Caveolae are abundant at the plasma membrane of highly differentiated cells, such as adipocytes, pneumocytes, and muscle cells, but they are not abundant in central neurons and lymphocytes. Cav1, the main isoform in non-muscle tissues, forms large oligomers with high affinity for cholesterol and sphingolipids. In addition, Cav1 can recruit different proteins into caveolar and non-caveolar rafts through its Cav scaffolding domain (CSD). Therefore, rafts, acting as signaling platforms, initiate signaling pathways, participate in vesicular transport, and contribute to cholesterol homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Simons and Ikonen, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Razani et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Parton et al., 2006</xref>). In addition, these microdomains are essential for immunological synapses during the immune response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Rao et al., 2004</xref>), as well as for the insulin modulation of adipocyte physiology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Pérez-Verdaguer et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>In this context, the role of Cav1 in cancer progression raises an intense debate. Cav1 acts either as a tumor suppressor or as an oncogene, depending on the cancer type and the clinical stage of the disease. For instance, low Cav1 expression is associated with low survival in stromal breast cancer cells, whereas high expression of Cav1 indicates poor prognosis in invasive breast cancer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Qian et al., 2011</xref>). Thus, Cav1 regulates different oncogenic properties, such as neoplastic transformation, apoptosis resistance, migration, invasiveness, and angiogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Quest et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Qian et al., 2019</xref>), likely depending on the cell type and/or Cav1 interactions with specific partners. Reciprocal regulation between Cav1 and the cell oxidative state regulates cell survival and stress-dependent responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Wang et al., 2017</xref>). In addition, Cav1 also plays non-caveolar functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Volonte et al., 2016</xref>). Cav1 localizes not only to the plasma membrane, but also to mitochondria, where it participates in the regulation of cell bioenergetics and apoptosis and, consequently, in cancer progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Nwosu et al., 2016</xref>). Cav1 upregulation promotes apoptosis resistance and provides a metabolic advantage to cancerous cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Wang et al., 2017</xref>). In fact, Cav1 inhibits Bax-dependent cell death, helping cancer cells to escape chemotherapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Zou et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Shiroto et al., 2014</xref>). In contrast, Cav1 knockdown has been reported to cause hyperpolarization of the inner mitochondrial membrane (IMM) potential (∆ψ<sub>m</sub>) and to alter the lipid composition of the IMM, leading cells to apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bosch et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>Kv1.3, which is present in lipid rafts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bock et al., 2003</xref>) and associates with Cav1, participates in apoptosis and chemotherapy resistance through its mitochondrial localization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Szabó et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Leanza et al., 2012</xref>). Mitochondrial Kv1.3 (mitoKv1.3) mediates the pro-apoptotic effects of Bax. Bax blocks Kv1.3 causing the hyperpolarization of the IMM and a subsequent reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. These events lead to the opening of the permeability transition pore (PTP) and to consequent IMM depolarization, which is followed by the release of cytochrome c and the triggering of the intrinsic apoptotic cascade. Sustained PTP opening leads to the loss of mitochondrial integrity and respiration and induces swelling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Szabó et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Szabò et al., 2011</xref>). The effect of Bax, which is often downregulated in cancer cells, can be mimicked by mitochondria-targeted Kv1.3 inhibitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Leanza et al., 2012</xref>). For this reason, mitoKv1.3 has become a potential target for chemotherapy and a solution for overcoming chemotherapeutic resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Leanza et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Leanza et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Szabo et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>Because the Kv1.3 and Cav1 interaction in lipid rafts has an enormous influence on cell physiology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Vicente et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Pérez-Verdaguer et al., 2016a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Pérez-Verdaguer et al., 2018</xref>), we analyzed the functional link between Kv1.3 and Cav1 in the regulation of intrinsic apoptosis. We demonstrated that the interaction of Kv1.3 with Cav1 is important for the plasma membrane targeting of the channel. On the other hand, once in the mitochondria, the Kv1.3–caveolin axis functions as an anti-apoptotic mechanism protecting the cells from Kv1.3-mediated cell death. Our data increases the understanding of the heterogeneity of cancer by consolidating the roles of Kv1.3 and Cav1 as targets for anti-cancer therapies.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Interaction with caveolin-1 governs the spatial localization of Kv1.3</title><p>We have previously described that the interaction between Kv1.3 and Cav1 results in the localization of the channel to lipid rafts and caveolae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Pérez-Verdaguer et al., 2016a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Pérez-Verdaguer et al., 2018</xref>). Kv1.3 contains a caveolin-binding domain (CBD) situated on the N-terminal end of the channel. Molecular simulations of Kv1.3 identified this CBD as an α-helix in an exposed orientation of the tetrameric structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).

To further study the nature of the Kv1.3–Cav1 interaction, we abrogated the CBD by replacing the aromatic residues with Ala or Gly (Kv1.3 CBD<italic><sub>less</sub></italic>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Deletion of the CBD motif of Kv1.3 caused the loss of Kv1.3–Cav1 association, as demonstrated by the absence of co-IP and Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B–D</xref>). Analogous CBDs are located at the N-terminus of HCN channels, and some point mutations of this motif are sufficient to alter Cav1 binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Barbuti et al., 2012</xref>). Therefore, we analyzed whether this also applied for Kv1.3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Any substitution of aromatic residues in the CBD decreased the colocalization with Cav 1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A–C</xref>). However, similar to HCN4, only the disruption of the last pair of aromatic amino acids (W171G/F174A) greatly impaired the association with Cav 1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>The caveolin-binding domain (CBD) of Kv1.3 mediates the interaction with Cav1 targeting the channel to lipid raft microdomains.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Ribbon representation of a Kv1.3 tetramer.

We showed that the Cav1 interaction is essential for plasma membrane targeting of the channel and that CBD disruption triggered a punctate intracellular phenotype. Therefore, we wondered whether this scenario affected the mitochondrial localization of the channel, especially because targeting mechanisms for mitoKv1.3 are unknown. While Kv1.3 does not display a classical N-terminal mitochondria-targeting pre-sequence, membrane-permeant mitochondriotropic channel antagonists have unequivocally demonstrated a pivotal role for mitoKv1.3 in the death of primary human lymphocytic leukemia cells as well as of B16F10 melanoma cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Leanza et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Leanza et al., 2017</xref>). Thus, we used melanoma cells in addition to HEK 293 cells, to decipher a general mechanism. Similar to HEK 293 cells, Kv1.3 CBD<italic><sub>less</sub></italic> exhibited less cell surface abundance than Kv1.3 WT in B16F10 melanoma cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>).

Therefore, a deficient caveolin interaction, impairing surface expression, partially redirected Kv1.3 to mitochondria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>), where it triggered mitochondrial network fragmentation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Morphometric analysis of Kv1.3 CBD<italic><sub>less</sub></italic> HEK 293 cells indicated that mitochondria were smaller and more round-shaped than those observed in Kv1.3 WT cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B–D</xref>). Correlative transmission electron microscopy in both B16F10 melanoma (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E,F</xref>) and HEK 293 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>) showed that only the mitochondria in cells expressing Kv1.3 CBD<italic><sub>less</sub></italic> lost cristae and became more round.

Functional Kv1.3 CBD<italic><sub>less</sub></italic>, which is unable to interact with Cav1, was trafficking to mitochondria rather than to the cell surface. Therefore, it is tempting to speculate that either the imbalance between plasma membrane Kv1.3 and mitoKv1.3 is the factor that contributes to apoptosis, or the lack of association with caveolin in mitochondria is what makes the difference. In any case, interaction with caveolin would be at the onset of both scenarios. Therefore, because caveolin exerts anti-apoptotic effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Shiroto et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Schilling et al., 2018</xref>), we wondered whether Cav1, by association with the channel, may modulate the role of Kv1.3 in mitochondria. Similar to Kv1.3, Cav1 is also present in mitochondria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>), and both proteins are located in close proximity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B,C</xref>). To evaluate the effects of the Cav1 interaction on mitoKv1.3, we used several different and complementary cell models. Jurkat T lymphocytes are normally deficient in caveolin (Jurkat Cav−), but express endogenous Kv1.3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Szabò et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>). However, we selected a clone of Jurkat cells, which did express Cav1 (Jurkat Cav+). In this context, evidence indicates that some leukocytes, that do not initially express caveolin, may express the protein under certain states of activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Hatanaka et al., 1998</xref>). In Jurkat Cav−, no differences were observed in apoptosis when Kv1.3 WT or Kv1.3 CBD<italic><sub>less</sub></italic> were overexpressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D,E</xref>).

Furthermore, caveolin is also involved in both pro- and anti-apoptotic events participating in the regulation of cell survival and in cancer protection. Our results indicate that the interaction of Kv1.3 with Cav1 has important physiological consequences for controlling apoptosis. Cav1 association, via the N-terminal located CBD of Kv1.3, drives the channel to the plasma membrane. Altering the CBD impairs membrane targeting, promoting the Kv1.3 intracellular retention and mitochondrial accumulation. In this way, we were able to distinguish the effects of intracellular/mitochondrial Kv1.3 from those of the plasma membrane channel. Once inside mitochondria, the CBD<italic><sub>less</sub></italic> channel facilitates apoptosis. In the presence of Kv1.3, either the depletion of caveolin or the lack of Cav1 binding favors apoptosis, suggesting that the Cav1 functional interaction with the channel facilitates apoptotic resistance. Therefore, we identified that Cav1 associates with Kv1.3, thereby modulating the pro-apoptotic effects of mitochondrial Kv1.3 channels. This observation is key for the understanding how these two proteins can reciprocally regulate their role in cancer progression, with significant implications for anti-cancer therapy.</p><p>Acute inhibition of mitoKv1.3 transient hyperpolarizes IMM inducing ROS release. Subsequent PTP opening leads to loss of mitochondrial integrity, IMM depolarization, swelling, and cytochrome c release. Overexpression of mitochondrial K<sup>+</sup> transporting pathways drives the influx of depolarizing K<sup>+</sup> into the matrix triggering mitochondrial depolarization as well as changes in ultrastructure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Paggio et al., 2019</xref>). Thus, acute changes in the mitochondrial membrane potential, upon block of the channel, induce ROS and PTP opening, while overexpression of mitochondria-located Kv1.3, that is more prominent in the case of CBDless mutant or in the absence of Cav (for both WT and CBD<italic><sub>less</sub></italic> Kv1.3), causes sustained depolarization that sensitizes cells to apoptotic stimuli. PTP opening further depolarizes IMM and reduces respiration due to swelling and loss of cytochrome c. Here we show that overexpression of WT or CBD<italic><sub>less</sub></italic> Kv1.3 equally depolarized mitochondria and caused apoptosis in primary T cells, which lack endogenous Cav. Interestingly, while overexpression of Kv1.3 promotes apoptosis, the channel deficiency renders the cells resistant to apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Szabó et al., 2008</xref>). Thus, similarly to the ATP-dependent K<sup>+</sup> channel of pancreatic β cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Miki et al., 1998</xref>), pharmacological block of Kv1.3 does not yield the same physiological effects of channel downregulation, as the block triggers a series of signaling events that cannot be induced in cells lacking Kv1.3.</p><p>Cav interacts with the CBD of target signaling proteins through its CSD. Mutating the CSD of Cav1 modulates migration of cancerous cells by affecting interaction with signaling partners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Okada et al., 2019</xref>). Kv1.3, by interaction with Cav1, targets to lipid raft microdomains. These observations are consistent with our previous data, showing that the presence of Kv1.3 in lipid rafts was dependent on Cav1 expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Pérez-Verdaguer et al., 2016a</xref>). Evidence supports that CBDs should contain solvent exposed aromatic residues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Byrne et al., 2012</xref>). Our data support this claim because, in our molecular simulation, the Kv1.3 CBD is exposed and located close to transmembrane domains, which favor physical interactions with Cav1. Aromatic residues are involved in protein folding. Therefore, because of the proximity of the CBD to the channel tetramerization domain (T1), we assessed Kv1.3 CBD<italic><sub>less</sub></italic> functionality. Kv1.3 CBD<italic><sub>less</sub></italic> forms functional tetramers but with altered electrophysiological properties. The main feature is the reduction of current intensity, probably due to impaired surface expression. In fact, we have previously shown that the absence of Cav1 expression reduces the half-life, cell surface expression, and current amplitude of Kv1.3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Pérez-Verdaguer et al., 2016a</xref>). Kv1.3 CBD<italic><sub>less</sub></italic> showed a hyperpolarizing shift in the steady-state activation and altered inactivation kinetics. These observations are not surprising because the lipid composition of the plasma membrane modulates the activity, kinetics, and voltage-dependence of ion channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Levitan et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Brini et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Poveda et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Zakany et al., 2019</xref>). Furthermore, the biophysical properties of Kv1.3 CBD<italic><sub>less</sub></italic> might be due to multiple additional factors, including changes in membrane lipid composition that occur during apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Tepper et al., 2000</xref>). Altogether, our data would support that Kv1.3 surface expression and thus the current density are notably dependent on its Cav1 interaction.</p><p>As mentioned above, the lack of interaction between Kv1.3 CBD<italic><sub>less</sub></italic> and Cav1 drastically impaired the cell surface targeting of the channel. However, Kv1.3 CBD<italic><sub>less</sub></italic> kept targeting to mitochondria, and this occurred before Golgi processing, given that the mitochondria-targeted channel is not glycosylated. This fact raises up an interesting scenario because we separated the effects of mitochondrial Kv1.3 from those of the plasma membrane channel. Expression of Kv1.3 CBD<italic><sub>less</sub></italic> notably sensitized the cells to apoptosis, most likely due to the preferential localization of this mutated channel to the mitochondria. Indeed, by itself, mitochondrial Kv1.3 CBD<italic><sub>less</sub></italic> dramatically altered mitochondrial morphology (i.e., lower cristae density) and function, triggering apoptosis. In addition, expression of Kv1.3 CBD<italic><sub>less</sub></italic> caused mitochondrial network fragmentation, something typically observed in apoptotic cells, which show a high fission-to-fusion ratio (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Xie et al., 2018</xref>). In general, mitochondrial fission regulation couples mitochondrial dynamics/morphology to the cellular energetic state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Giacomello et al., 2020</xref>). Fission, induced by AMPK-mediated phosphorylation (AMP), senses adapting mitochondrial function and dynamics. AMPK facilitates mitochondrial fission downstream of mitochondrial dysfunction caused, for example, by an impaired mitochondrial respiration. This mechanism facilitates apoptosis in cells with severely dysfunctional mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Toyama et al., 2016</xref>). Apoptosis can be triggered by the permeabilization of the outer mitochondrial membrane and the prolonged depolarization of the IMM (dissipation of ∆ψ<sub>m</sub> in IMM), which causes the release of pro-apoptotic factors from the mitochondrial intermembrane space to the cytosol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Zorova et al., 2018</xref>). We can therefore explain the ability of Kv1.3 CBD<italic><sub>less</sub></italic> triggered apoptosis by the observation that mitochondria were significantly depolarized and mitochondrial respiration was highly impaired, suggesting that cells were undergoing apoptosis. We propose that the absence of Cav1 interaction with mitoKv1.3 favors the pro-apoptotic effects of Kv1.3. The results obtained in human CD4+ lymphocytes, Jurkat T cells, and 3T3-L1 preadipocytes support this hypothesis. In T-lymphocytes, which lack of endogenous Cav1 expression, no differences in apoptosis between cells expressing Kv1.3 WT and Kv1.3 CBD<italic><sub>less</sub></italic> were found. Similarly, silencing of Cav1 expression in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes increased the apoptosis. However, the presence of Cav1 exhibited anti-apoptotic properties but solely in cells expressing the wild-type channel.</p><p>In summary, our data indicate that the physiological role of Kv1.3 is highly dependent on its interaction with Cav1. The Kv1.3 interaction with Cav1 can drive the channel either to the membrane and support proliferation or to mitochondria. MitoKv1.3 sensitizes cells to apoptosis, in agreement with our previous observation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Szabó et al., 2008</xref>), and possibly, mitochondrial Kv1.3 interaction with Cav1 modulates the pro-apoptotic effects of the channel. Therefore, the balance exerted by these two complementary mechanisms would fine-tune the physiological role of Kv1.3 during cell survival or apoptosis. Although a direct interaction of these proteins in mitochondria has not been confirmed, and warrants further investigation, evidence suggests that apoptosis is dependent on mitoKv1.3–caveolin functional axis. Our work has important implications not only in the understanding of Kv1.3-dependent cancer progression but possibly also in metabolic diseases, where Cav1 and Kv1.3 both play an important role. Our data would suggest an essential role for the caveolin–Kv1.3 axis during tumorigenesis and apoptosis.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Expression plasmids and site-directed mutagenesis</title><p>T.C.

To understand the mechanisms that contribute to these seemingly opposing roles of Kv1.3, this study examines the contribution of interaction between caveolin 1 (Cav1) and Kv1.3 channels on subcellular distribution and functional properties. Multiple lines of evidence suggest that the interaction between Kv1.3 and Cav1 in mitochondria prevents Kv1.3 mediated cell-death. However, the reviewers have raised a number of substantive concerns. Although many of these concerns can be addressed by adding new experiments, it seems unlikely that the revised manuscript can be resubmitted within the next couple of months. We are happy to give due consideration to the revised version of this manuscript if you decide to submit it to <italic>eLife</italic> again but it will be treated as new submission. Please do not hesitate to contact us if you have questions.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>This manuscript described the effects of the ablation of the Caveolin 1 (Cav1) interaction site in Kv1.3. on subcellular distribution, functional properties and effects on apoptosis. The main conclusion of the paper is that the interaction between Kv1.3 and Cav1 plays a crucial role not only in the proper plasma membrane localization of Kv1.3, resulting in an enrichment of mitochondrial localization, but that the interaction with Cav1 at the mitochondria also modulates the induction of apoptosis. Such an effect would justify the proposal of a Cav1-Kv1.3 axis, and would be a very relevant finding adding to the emerging importance of both Cav1 and Kv1.3 in physiology and pathology, especially in cancer.</p><p>The main concern is the possibility that an &quot;overload&quot; of the mitochondria with either wild type or CBDless Kv1.3 is responsible for the observed effects.</p><p>1. Whereas the enrichment in mitochondrial Kv1.3 in CBDless channels leaves little doubt, to what extent that interaction at the mitochondria is important for apoptosis is less clear. Kv1.3 wild type overexpression induces an increase of apoptosis on its own. If Cav1 binding-defective mutants are more abundant at the mitochondria, this alone could explain the increase in apoptosis described. The effects reported in both Jurkat and 3T3-L1 could in principle be also explained if the excess of Kv1.3 is equally targeted to mitochondria in Jurkat cells regardless of CBD due to the low Cav1 level, and if knockdown of Cav1 reduces PM Kv1.3 in preadipocytes and therefore increases mitoKv1.3 (at least it seems to alter the ratio between mature and non-glycosylated channel, Figure 7F).</p><p>2. As the authors state, it appears that the reduced PM activity of Kv1.3CBDless is due to trafficking defects (less targeting to the membrane and shorter half-life). Actually, the mutant is activated at less depolarized potentials, suggesting a more favorable transition to an open state. Inhibition of mitoKv1.3 by Bax or pharmacological agents triggers apoptosis in several cell types. It is therefore counterintuitive, or at least it is not directly explained in the manuscript, that overexpression of a variant of the channel, which is in fact &quot;more active&quot; than the wild type induces more apoptosis, unless the effect is different from the physiological role of mitoKv1.3.</p><p>3. It would be extremely interesting to know what the effect of mitochondria-targeted Kv1.3 inhibitors like the ones described previously by some of the authors have on cells overexpressing Kv1.3 (wild type and CBDless), and if such agents can counteract the effect of Cav1 knockdown. One would expect that such treatment would be protective rather than apoptosis-inducing.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>The comparison of WT-Kv1.3 and the CBDless Kv1.3 mutant (166-FQRQVWLLF-174 to 166-AQRQVGLLA-174) is the central focus of this paper. In an earlier paper (Sci Rep 2016;6:22453), the authors reported that the CBDless Kv1.3 mutant did not interact with caveolin-1 and exhibited reduced lipid raft portioning. In the present paper, the authors report that the CBDless Kv1.3 mutant preferentially accumulates in mitochondria, resulting in altered mitochondrial physiology and cell survival.</p><p>CBDless Kv1.3 mutant</p><p>• In <italic>Xenopus oocytes</italic>, the CBDless Kv1.3 mutant produced roughly 1/4th the current amplitude of WT Kv1.3. The authors conclude that the reduced current density is the consequence of reduced surface abundance. However, reduced current density could also be due to decreased production of the CBDless Kv1.3 mutant. A Western blot comparing Kv1.3 protein expression in <italic>Xenopus oocytes</italic> injected with WT Kv1.3 versus the CBDless mutant could exclude this possibility.</p><p>• In <italic>Xenopus oocytes</italic>, the CBDless triple mutation in the N-terminus alters voltage-dependence of activation and accelerates C-type inactivation (which involves changes in the outermost selectivity filter; J Gen Physiol 141: 151-160; Nat Struct Mol Biol. 2017; 24: 857-865). Clearly, the CBDless mutation impacts regions of Kv1.3 distant from the N-terminus. A more detailed electrophysiological characterization of the CBDless mutant channel is warranted.</p><p>• Since many studies are done on HEK293, B16F10 melanoma or Jurkat cells transfected with WT Kv1.3 or the CBDless Kv1.3 mutant, it is essential to show electrophysiology data for both channels in these cells. Mutations of 1 or 2 of the three aromatic residues in the CBD may be sufficient to reduce caveolin-1 binding and be less disruptive to the channel. Point mutations in the CBD of HCN4 are sufficient to alter caveolin-1 binding (J Mol Cell Cardiol. 2012;53:187-95).</p><p>• If Kv1.3's association with caveolin-1 is essential to localize Kv1.3 in lipid raft membrane microdomains in the plasma membrane, how do Kv1.3 channels in caveolin-1 deficient Jurkat cells translocate to the plasma membrane and generate normal Kv1.3 currents (J Biol Chem. 2001;276:12249-56)? In Jurkat cells transfected with WT Kv1.3 versus CBDless Kv1.3 channels, is the Kv1.3 membrane-to-mitochondrial ratio, mitochondrial morphology and mitochondrial function different?</p><p>MitoKv1.3, mitochondrial dysfunction, apoptosis</p><p>• In Figure 3, please show membrane Kv1.3 expression normalized to Na-K-ATPase in cells transfected with WT Kv1.3 or CBDless Kv1.3. This could be correlated with Kv1.3 channel density determined electrophysiologically.</p><p>• In Figure 6C, one Kv1.3-spot is shown in HEK293 cells transfected with WT Kv1.3, and in Figure 6E, one Kv1.3-spot is shown in HEK293 cells transfected with CBDless Kv1.3. Wouldn't you expect more Kv1.3 channels spots in the mitochondria? In Figure 7C, Kv1.3 is shown inside the organelle and not at the inner mitochondrial membrane. Do you have any images showing Kv1.3 and caveolin-1 in the inner mitochondrial membrane?</p><p>• If caveolin-1's interaction with mitoKv1.3 alleviates the pro-apoptotic activity of mitochondrial Kv1.3, caveolin-1 deficient Jurkat cells (that contain mitoKv1.3 unbound to caveolin-1) should be more prone to apoptosis than caveolin-1 and Kv1.3 containing cells, and over-expression of caveolin-1 in Jurkat cells should suppress apoptosis. This might be worth testing.</p><p>• Is increased apoptosis in 3T3-L1 cells following caveolin-1 knockdown due to the pro-apoptotic effects of mitoKv1.3 (as you suggest), or is it due to p53-p21-dependent induction of mitochondrial dysfunction and cellular senescence caused by caveolin-1 deficiency (Aging Cell 2017;16:773-784)? One could distinguish between these possibilities by over-expressing Kv1.3 in 3T3-L1 cells such that there is an excess of mitoKv1.3 over caveolin-1. If apoptosis is enhanced, it would suggest that mitoKv1.3 is a driver of apoptosis.</p><p>• Human T cells express caveolin-1, and caveolin-1 deficiency in T cells reduces effector function (J Immunol. 2017; 199: 874-884). Based on your results, caveolin-1 deficient primary human T cells would be predicted to express less surface Kv1.3 and more mitoKv1.3, exhibit altered mitochondrial morphology and physiology, and be more susceptible to apoptosis. This might be worth testing.</p><p>• Accumulation of Kv1.3 in the ER and Golgi when CBD is mutated (Figure 2D) may affect the physiology of these organelles. The authors may wish to address/discuss this.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>Capera et al. cover an interesting topic in their manuscript, which reports a novel role of the interaction between caveolin 1 and Kv1.3 channels. The Authors present a detailed analysis on the possible function of caveolin and Kv1.3 in cellular processes such as apoptosis. They revealed that mitochondrion associated Kv1.3 without caveolin 1 binding domain is pro-apoptotic, WT Kv1.3 show colocalization with caveolin in the mitochondrial inner membrane, contributes to the mitochondrial dysfunction via destructing the structure of cisterna. Authors concluded that Kv1.3-caveolin 1 &quot;crosstalk&quot; can sensitize the cancer cells to apoptosis. Based on these my questions and comments are the following:</p><p>1. Authors in a series of experiments use Cav1 knock-down HEK cell line. However, I did not find in the manuscript if they applied it in the mitochondrial function and apoptosis experiments. As all the experiments related to Cav1-driven Kv1.3 targeting I suppose it would be practical to use a cell line lacking endogenous Cav1 and then &quot;re-add&quot; Cav1 with transfection of Cav1 plasmid e.g. for organelle-localization experiments, mitochondrial location, apoptosis.</p><p>2. For electrophysiology Authors chose oocytes instead of HEK cells. Why did not the authors show data which were measured in HEK cells? In their previous paper the authors demonstrated that in Cav1- HEK cells the Kv1.3 channel had slower inactivation kinetics than in those with Cav1 expression, and not a drastic reduction in the current happened upon Cav1 knock-down. Here the data show that prevention of Cav1 binding to Kv1.3 channels results in a drastic change. I think these outcomes, at least in part, are contradictory. Do the Authors have any explanation for that? Is it possible that mutation eliminated the interaction between the channel and another (not Cav1) protein necessary for PM targeting?</p><p>3. For the TEM images the authors mentioned that Kv1.3 channels are localized to mitochondria detected using the immunogold labeling technique. I could observe only one-two gold beads/mitochondria (or organelles), which I suppose is unexpectedly low as Kv1.3 protein was overexpressed (and also large fraction of channels target to mitochondria). On the other hand, I wonder if any specific markers for organelles were applied to identify them.</p><p>[Editors’ note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;A novel mitochondrial Kv1.3-caveolin axis controls cell survival and apoptosis&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been evaluated by Kenton Swartz (Senior Editor) and a Reviewing Editor.</p><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed, as outlined below:</p><p>1. One of the claims made in the paper: &quot; interactions between caveolin and Kv1.3 are essential for apoptosis&quot; seems slightly overstated. We recommend the authors to soften this claim and discuss alternative possibilities. Their work clearly provides evidence for improper trafficking of Kv1.3 CBDless to the plasma membrane and ectopic expression in mitochondria, resulting in apoptosis. They have also shown that caveolin is involved in modulating apoptosis. Previous work from their lab has shown caveolin interacts with Kv1.3 and increases C-type inactivation and fails to interact with CBDlessKV1.3. It remains unclear whether there is any direct interaction/cross-modulation between Kv1.3 and caveolin in the mitochondria, causing apoptosis, and that requires more direct evidence to support the claim.</p><p>There is no doubt that both caveolin and Kv1.3 are involved in apoptosis and apoptosis IS dependent on Kv1.3-caveolin axis, but the direct interaction between these two proteins in the mitochondria warrants further investigations. The experimental evidence provided in the manuscript are suggestive of such an interaction in mitochondria and resulting apoptosis, but it is not definitive. Addressing it in the discussion will benefit the readers.</p><p>2. Regarding the electrophysiological properties of the mutant channel, against the view of the authors and even though the construct appears toxic to mammalian cells and the experiments need to be done in oocytes, if the mutant activates „earlier&quot;, it is in our view more active at any potential. Also, in oocytes, if the transport to the membrane is altered, then it would be expected that the currents are smaller. A decrease in the input resistance of the oocyte would also rather indicate a &quot;higher&quot; basal activity. If we understand correctly, the role of Kv1.3 in apoptosis relies on the fact that reduction of its activity through bax blockade triggers ∆ψm hyperpolarization and then apoptosis, so it is counterintuitive how a &quot;more active&quot; channel is proapoptotic. Importantly, how activation of Kv1.3 happens with the values of ∆ψm in the context of mitochondria (140 mV negative to the activation potential of Kv1.3) remains an unanswered question. We think that this issue merits a few words in the discussion. Moreover, Cav1 maintains mitochondrial depolarization, as its knockdown induces hyperpolarization. This is against what one would expect if it acts partly through Kv1.3. The concept &quot;Kv1.3-mediated cell death&quot; is somewhat misleading if Kv1.3 blockade is what triggers apoptosis. Why does then mitoKv1.3 overexpression promote apoptosis? We might well have got the point wrong, but we think other readers would have the same problem.</p><p>3. Disregarding the fact that Kv1.3 overexpression on its own reduces respiration by almost one-half (Figure 5), the mitochondrial fragmentation induced by Kv1.3CBDless deserves some comments in this context.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>This manuscript addresses the importance of Cav1 interaction for Kv1.3 targeting to the plasma membrane and the relevance of the interaction for the impact of Kv1.3 in apoptosis.

This is indeed a very nice control. However, it is very hard to assess how efficiently YMVIii is targeted to the mitochondria. Loss of membrane targeting would, in any case, increase Pearsons's correlation against any intracellular marker. It would be much more convincing if the copurification experiments in Figure 3 or 7 would be reproduced here.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>The authors have presented an elegant work on the role of Kv1.3 in cellular homeostasis. Authors clearly demonstrated that CBDless Kv1.3 failed to localize on the plasma membrane. The work highlights the significance of interactions between Kv1.3 and caveolin in cellular apoptosis. The data presented supports the notion that improper trafficking of Kv1.3 to plasma membrane can result in ectopic expression in the mitochondrial membrane, which can dysregulate protein interactions, causing apoptosis.</p><p>In my opinion, the authors have addressed all the reviewers comments and the manuscript is ready to be accepted for publication. No further edits are required. Congratulations to all the authors for an intensive work presented in the manuscript.</p><p>This is one minor suggestion to the authors for future work (and is not required for this manuscript): To test the currents in oocytes where caveolin and Kv1.3 are co-expressed and compare it with CBDless clones (with and without the co-expression of caveolin). This might provide more direct evidence into Kv1.3 modulation by caveolin. This, of course, might not address their role pertaining to mitochondrial functions, as oocyte expression will be in the plasma membrane, but will certainly provide insights into functional interactions. Lack of interaction between CBDless Kv1.3 and caveolin in oocytes will provide validation that many reviewers raised. Again, such intensive study is outside the scope of current manuscript and is merely suggested here for future work.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.69099.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>[Editors’ note: the authors resubmitted a revised version of the paper for consideration.

Indeed one of the most relevant findings has been the identification of the essential role of the mitochondrial Cav/Kv1.3 association controlling cell survival and apoptosis.</p><p>Although the overload of either Kv1.3 could exert some observed effects, this is unlikely because Kv1.3 WT sensitizes to apoptotic stimuli rather than generating apoptosis by itself, with no changes in mitochondrial morphology in the presence of caveolin (Figure 4-7).

To further examine this point, we performed new experiments using primary human T-cells and 3T3 fibroblasts, where we modulated only expression of caveolin (but not of Kv1.3). These new data further support our findings (Figure 7-10).

Whereas the enrichment in mitochondrial Kv1.3 in CBDless channels leaves little doubt, to what extent that interaction at the mitochondria is important for apoptosis is less clear. Kv1.3 wild type overexpression induces an increase of apoptosis on its own.</p></disp-quote><p>Kv1.3, as mentioned above, sensitives to apoptosis rather generates apoptosis (see Figure 4-7). The Reviewer is right that in HEK293 cells (see Figure 6A), the % of apoptotic cells is relatively high after expression of WT Kv1.3, but it is significantly less than in the case of cells expressing Kv1.3 CBDless. Please note also that in Suppl. Figure 5, where the B16F10 melanoma cells were first sorted following transfection and then treated with pro-apoptotic stimuli (or left untreated), the % of apoptotic cells is again much higher in the case of the cells expressing the mutant channels. Importantly, even in the HEK293 transfected with Kv1.3 WT, the cells look healthy and mitochondria maintained correct cristae organization (Figures 6 and 7) and the mitochondrial membrane potential as well the maximal respiration are similar to that observed in control cells (Figure 5). In addition, results obtained with the Kv1.3 YMVIii mutant also supports our claims (Supplemental Figure 6).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>If Cav1 binding-defective mutants are more abundant at the mitochondria, this alone could explain the increase in apoptosis described.</p></disp-quote><p>The channel mitochondrial accumulation is not exclusively responsible for the apoptotic effects. Indeed, YMVIii mutant reroutes to mitochondria but generates no apoptosis (Supplemental Figure 6). In addition, the expression of WT Kv1.3 in T-cells (Jurkat and primary T-lymphocytes, low cav) promotes similar apoptosis than that caused by Kv1.3 CBDless, but the introduction and/or the endogenous expression of Cav partially protects cells from apoptosis in Kv1.3WT but not in CBDless (Figure 7 and 10. The ablation of cav 1 in 3T3 fibroblasts with no alteration of Kv1.3 further supports our data (Figure 7). Therefore, all these data strongly suggest that the apoptosis is mostly related to the absence of cav/Kv1.3 association rather than to the unique expression of Kv1.3 by itself. In fact, caveolin by itself is claimed to be anti-apoptotic (just few examples: Yang et al., Cancer Invest. 2012, 30:453-462; Codenotti et al., Cancer Lett. 2021, 505:1-12; Aberg et al., Apoptosis. 2020, 25:519-534).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The effects reported in both Jurkat and 3T3-L1 could in principle be also explained if the excess of Kv1.3 is equally targeted to mitochondria in Jurkat cells regardless of CBD due to the low Cav1 level, and if knockdown of Cav1 reduces PM Kv1.3 in preadipocytes and therefore increases mitoKv1.3 (at least it seems to alter the ratio between mature and non-glycosylated channel, Figure 7F).</p></disp-quote><p>Yes, the reviewer is correct. When Kv1.3 does not associate with cav, the channel impairs membrane expression (lower non-glycosylated band). However, the level of Kv1.3 rerouting to mitochondria is not proportional to the level of apoptosis. In addition, the new YMVIii mutant data, which targets to mitochondria but associates with caveolin, clearly supports that the level of Kv1.3 channel in mitochondria is not the unique cause (supplemental Figure 6). Thus, the mitoKv1.3 association with caveolin rather than the level of mitoKv1.3 by itself should be the responsible of such effect. Furthermore, we have incorporated data with fresh human primary T-cells, which naturally lack expression of Cav. In such cells, both Kv1.3 channels (WT and CBDless) generate similar level of basal apoptosis, but the introduction of external caveolin partially protects the cells when the channel can interact with Cav, i.e. only in Kv1.3 WT (Figure 10). These data therefore further support Jurkat and 3T3-L1 results (Figure 7).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. As the authors state, it appears that the reduced PM activity of Kv1.3CBDless is due to trafficking defects (less targeting to the membrane and shorter half-life). Actually, the mutant is activated at less depolarized potentials, suggesting a more favorable transition to an open state. Inhibition of mitoKv1.3 by Bax or pharmacological agents triggers apoptosis in several cell types. It is therefore counterintuitive, or at least it is not directly explained in the manuscript, that overexpression of a variant of the channel, which is in fact &quot;more active&quot; than the wild type induces more apoptosis, unless the effect is different from the physiological role of mitoKv1.3.</p></disp-quote><p>To our knowledge, the fact that CBDless activates earlier does not mean that is more active. In fact, the current generated by Kv1.3 CBDless is much lower. The electrophysiology was performed in oocytes because the plasma membrane of mammalian cells was severely altered by the Kv1.3 CBDless-related massive apoptosis. Therefore, trying to establish a close relationship between channel kinetics and physiology is misleading. Because we could not perform patch clamp in CBDless-transfected mammalian cells, we analyzed the lipid composition of the PM under apoptosis. CBDless dependent apoptotic cells exhibited a reduction in membrane cholesterol (12%), phosphatidylserine + phosphatidylinositol (10%) and sphingolipids (5%), which severely affects the membrane integrity to be patch-clamped. Seals broke and cells died. Voltage clamp studies in oocytes solely demonstrate a functional channel which generates tetramers despite altering an important motif lying close the Shaker tetramerization domain. In fact, we also saw important effects on the membrane resistance of oocytes (input resistance, Supplemental Figure 3), which further supports the weakness of the membrane in severely apoptotic mammalian cells (see Figure 6D). Our results demonstrate that CBDless-injected oocytes displayed about half membrane resistance than WT (Supplemental Figure 3). These changes in membrane (HEK and oocytes) are concomitant to important losses of membrane integrity during apoptosis.</p><p>On our opinion the data presented here do not contradict the well-delineated mechanism by which mitoKv1.3 block triggers apoptosis. We here further decipher a new mechanism involving Kv1.3, which does not argue against the previous one and further reinforces the role of mitoKv1.3 in this important process. The mitoCav, acting as antiapoptotic (as widely demonstrated) regulates the mitoKv1.3-dependent apoptotic effects. The possibility of a competition between the Bax effect and the Cav effect is feasible and would fine-tune the mitoKv1.3-related apoptotic control under different insults, but addressing this point would be far beyond the scope of the present manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. It would be extremely interesting to know what the effect of mitochondria-targeted Kv1.3 inhibitors like the ones described previously by some of the authors have on cells overexpressing Kv1.3 (wild type and CBDless), and if such agents can counteract the effect of Cav1 knockdown. One would expect that such treatment would be protective rather than apoptosis-inducing.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this inquire. However, we do not fully understand her/his claims in the context of our work. We humbly think that the reviewer misunderstands the CBDless activity (see above). Anyway, The PAPTP mitoKv1.3 inhibitor has been used as requested. However, the data generates misunderstandings as expected. As previously published, PAPTP (Leanza et al., 2017, Cancer Cell 31, 516–531) triggered apoptosis in the Kv1.3 expressing cells similarly to the intrinsic apoptosis inducer staurosporine. As previously published, cells with low activity of Kv1.3, such as primary human fibroblasts, MSCs and, in our case, with CBDless channel, PAPTP has little effects. As abovementioned, we claim that the CBDless channel is not more active. Basal apoptosis in the CBDless-expressing cells was extremely high; thereby, the slightly increase of apoptosis triggered by PAPTP, although logical, is difficult to interpret. We do not understand why PAPTP should counteract the apoptosis in CBDless. Furthermore, the absence of caveolin-Kv1.3 association would further increase apoptosis because caveolin should be contemplated as anti-apoptotic in many cell models.</p><p>The effectivity of mitoKv1.3 inhibitors, such as PAPTP, might be influenced by different factors. Thus, (i) the activity and expression of Kv1.3 channels (Arcangeli et al., 2009; Leanza et al., 2013); (ii) cells with elevated Kv1.3 exhibit a hyperpolarized IMM (Hockenbery, 2010); (iii) redox state (e.g., Sabharwal and Schumacker, 2014) and (iv) membrane permeability to molecules (such as PAPTP) increase oxidative stress above a critical threshold triggering apoptosis. In fact, loss of <italic>mitochondrial</italic> membrane potential (ΔΨ<sub>m</sub>) has been shown to be an early event during <italic>apoptosis</italic> in some systems. Thus, we show that both channels (WT and CBDless) triggered hyperpolarization in both HEK 293 and oocytes (Figure 5 and Suppl Figure 3).</p><p>The main issue of our manuscript deals with the association of Kv1.3 with caveolin rather than the Kv1.3CBDless activity by itself. Therefore, many uncertain inputs, such as changes in membrane lipids, massive apoptosis, minor membrane resistance and more permeable plasma membrane in CBDless channel, indicate that raising conclusions about blocking channel activity should be discarded. However, our data is in accordance with what it has been described before – PAPTP triggers apoptosis – and the massive apoptosis generated by the CBDless channel slightly increased nor decreased by PAPTP. In fact as abovementioned, the CBDless channel is not more active; thereby, the data is much debatable. In this scenario, although we include this data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref> for the internal report evaluation, the inclusion of this uncertain data in the main body of the manuscript would be unclear. We humble demand not to be included in the manuscript because would raise confusion.</p><fig id="respfig1"><label>Author response image 1.</label><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-69099-resp-fig1-v1.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>The comparison of WT-Kv1.3 and the CBDless Kv1.3 mutant (166-FQRQVWLLF-174 to 166-AQRQVGLLA-174) is the central focus of this paper.

Clearly, the CBDless mutation impacts regions of Kv1.3 distant from the N-terminus. A more detailed electrophysiological characterization of the CBDless mutant channel is warranted.</p></disp-quote><p>While we acknowledge the useful suggestion of the Reviewer, we feel that being the main aim of the present work that of deciphering whether the association of Kv1.3 and caveolin influences cell survival and apoptosis, the electrophysiological characterization of the CBDless mutant is not strictly related to this story. Nonetheless, as requested by the reviewer, we introduced into this version new biophysical data from the CBDless mutant channel (Supplemental Figure 3). This include membrane potential, membrane resistance, conductance and cumulative inactivation analysis. The rationale for including a partial electrophysiological characterization of the CBDless mutant was the fact that we were concerned about the possibility that modifying the CBD, next to the tetramerization domain, could impair the oligomerization of the channel. In our previous version, we analyzed few parameters to demonstrate that the CBDless was functional in terms of tetramerization and conductivity. The effects for a limited caveolin interaction were addressed previously as you mention above (Sci Rep 2016;6:22453). In fact, Kv1.3CBDless-exressing cells undergo severe apoptosis and changes in membrane lipid composition and membrane integrity are evident (Figure 6). Because of that, patch-clamp was impossible to achieve in mammalian culture cells. We analyzed the lipid composition of Kv1.3CBD-less HEK cell membrane and they exhibited about 12% cholesterol, 10% phosphatidylserine + phosphatidylinositol and 5% sphingolipids less in their membranes than Kv1.3 WT cells. This clearly will affect the integrity of the membrane as well as the kinetic of channels (Cholesterol regulation of Ion channels and receptors, I. Levitan and F.J. Barrantes eds. 2012. DOI: 10.1002/9781118342312. John Wiley and Sons, Inc). The data is concomitant with a 50% decrease in membrane input resistance of Kv1.3 CDBless-injected oocytes. In this scenario, with such amount of inputs affecting electrophysiological parameters, we honestly think that raising conclusions from those results would be extremely uncertain. Indeed, we mention when describing the newly introduced biophysical parameters that any biophysical conclusion from this CBDless mutant should be taken with caution.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>• Since many studies are done on HEK293, B16F10 melanoma or Jurkat cells transfected with WT Kv1.3 or the CBDless Kv1.3 mutant, it is essential to show electrophysiology data for both channels in these cells.</p></disp-quote><p>We initially desired to perform the electrophysiology in our mammalian cell models rather than in oocytes. However, as abovementioned, Kv1.3CBDless triggers important changes at the cell physiology and membrane integrity. First, membrane cholesterol and sphingolipids decreased, triggering membrane weakness impeding patch clamp experiments. Therefore, seals were extremely difficult to achieve and cells died just applying the whole cell configuration. Second, severe apoptotic cells exhibit an extremely sensitive cell membrane integrity (see input resistance oocytes, Supplemental Figure 3). This is clearly observed in electron micrographs throughout the manuscript (i.e. Figure 6). We do not know whether the former or the last goes first but, this clearly impeded the study. Finally, we chose oocytes because, under these circumstances, they exhibit an extremely resistant membrane for the validation of channel tetramerization and functionality. To sum up, mammalian cell models were not suitable for electrophysiology with the CBDless mutant.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Mutations of 1 or 2 of the three aromatic residues in the CBD may be sufficient to reduce caveolin-1 binding and be less disruptive to the channel.

In fact, the CBDless channel tetramerizes (Supplemental Figure 2), is functional (Supplemental Figure 3) and associates to Kvβ subunits (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig2">Author response image 2</xref>). That interacts with Kv1 channels at a site that lies next to the CBD.</p><fig id="respfig2"><label>Author response image 2.</label><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-69099-resp-fig2-v1.tif"/></fig><p>Consensus sequences for the caveolin binding domains are: ΦXΦXXXXΦ,ΦXXXXΦXXΦ, or ΦXΦXXXXΦXXΦ, where Φ = Trp, Phe, or Tyr (Couet et al., J Biol Chem. 1997;272(10):6525-33). As suggested by the reviewer, we have performed the experiments, which include mutations of 1 or 2 residues (new Supplemental Figure 1). Only when the second cluster of aromatic residues was substituted, the association to caveolin is impaired. However, both clusters seem to cooperatively participate in the Kv1.3/cav colocalization.

This is one of our current laboratory goals. Our working hypothesis is that in cells, with a low expression of caveolin, other post-translational mechanisms or protein interactions could take the lead. We are currently deciphering the role of these mechanisms on the Kv1.3-dependent physiology in lymphocytes but addressing this issue in the present manuscript is beyond the scope in our opinion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In Jurkat cells transfected with WT Kv1.3 versus CBDless Kv1.3 channels, is the Kv1.3 membrane-to-mitochondrial ratio, mitochondrial morphology and mitochondrial function different?</p></disp-quote><p>This is a very relevant question. In addition, some additional inquiries from the editorial report demanded experiments in primary human T lymphocytes. Therefore, to concentrate our efforts, in order to answer this query, we preferred to use freshly isolated human T lymphocytes rather than a cell line. These, more physiological data, shows that in fresh blood human T-lymphocytes, which do not express caveolin, Kv1.3 WT and Kv1.3CBD<sub>less</sub> channels triggered similar effects. Thus, the membrane and mitochondrial colocalization (confocal studies, Figure 8), the mitochondrial morphology (confocal studies, Figure 9) and the mitochondrial function by tetramethylrhodamine, methyl ester (TMRM) dye (mitochondrial membrane potential, Figure 10) were similar with both channels. In addition, annexin V (apoptosis) showed that both channels triggered similar cell apoptosis but, when caveolin was introduced in T-lymphocytes, apoptosis was partially counteracted in cells expressing Kv1.3 WT (Figure 10 B). Furthermore, new data with a selected Jurkat cell line that endogenously expresses caveolin (Figure 7) further confirms that the presence of caveolin triggers certain protection against apoptosis with Kv1.3WT but not with CBDless.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>MitoKv1.3, mitochondrial dysfunction, apoptosis</p><p>• In Figure 3, please show membrane Kv1.3 expression normalized to Na-K-ATPase in cells transfected with WT Kv1.3 or CBDless Kv1.3.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this suggestion.

This might be worth testing,</p></disp-quote><p>We want to thank the reviewer for this inquiry. Evidence in the literature suggest that some leukocytes, that do not initially express caveolin, may express the protein under certain states of activation (Hatanaka et al., Biochem Biophys Res Commun 1998, 253: 382387). Indeed, we managed to isolate some Jurkat cells that started to express endogenously caveolin (most probably due to several freezing/thawing cycles they underwent due to the lock down). New data (Figure 7 D, E) with these Jurkat cav+ cells have been incorporated. As suggested by the reviewer, in Jurkat cells, which do express caveolin endogenously, the apoptosis was partially counteracted. However, it must be said that regular, primary Tlymphocytes are clearly defective in caveolin (see Figure 8). Indeed, new data from primary fresh human T-cells (Figure 8-10), which do not express caveolin, further support our claims. Similar to Jurkat, Kv1.3 WT and CBDless channels trigger similar results, but when caveolin 1 was introduced, as requested, only in WT-transfected cells, apoptosis was partially counteracted (Figure 10).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>• Is increased apoptosis in 3T3-L1 cells following caveolin-1 knockdown due to the pro-apoptotic effects of mitoKv1.3 (as you suggest), or is it due to p53-p21-dependent induction of mitochondrial dysfunction and cellular senescence caused by caveolin-1 deficiency (Aging Cell 2017;16:773-784)? One could distinguish between these possibilities by over-expressing Kv1.3 in 3T3-L1 cells such that there is an excess of mitoKv1.3 over caveolin-1. If apoptosis is enhanced, it would suggest that mitoKv1.3 is a driver of apoptosis.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this suggestion. The reviewer is right that the paper published in Aging cell confers such a role to Cav. On the other hand, deficiency of caveolin itself may trigger mitodysfunction and cellular senescence. In fact, caveolin has been postulated as protective against apoptosis and cell death (just few examples: Yang et al., Cancer Invest. 2012, 30:453462; Codenotti et al., Cancer Lett. 2021, 505:1-12; Aberg et al., Apoptosis. 2020, 25:519534). In this context, we claim that the function of Kv1.3 should be considered within the association to caveolin. All our data support this claim and is concomitant with a partial role for caveolin as mentioned by the reviewer.</p><p>Unfortunately, 3T3-L1 cells are extremely resistant to transfection and the experiment suggested is hard to achieve. We tried several times to perform this experiment, but over-expression of Kv1.3 (chemical transfection or electroporation), getting healthy cells to work with, was impossible to achieve in our hands. However, merging the rest of experiments, we may suggest that the axis of interaction between Kv1.3 and caveolin, not just Kv1.3, is at the onset of the apoptotic response. Thus:</p><p>1. The overexpression of Kv1.3 CDBless, but not Kv1.3 WT, in HEK-293 and B16F10 melanoma cells, which accumulates in mitochondria, without caveolin association, triggers apoptosis.</p><p>2. The overexpression of Kv1.3 WT and CBDless in regular Jurkat (cav -) cells yielded similar apoptosis. However, the use of Jurkat (cav+) cells – see above – indicated that apoptosis was partially prevented solely in Kv1.3 WT, which has the capacity of caveolin association.</p><p>3. Similar results were obtained with fresh peripheral human T-lymphocytes. These native cells, as many leukocytes, do not express caveolin (Hatanaka et al., Biochem Biophys Res Commun 1998, 253: 382-387; Vallejo and Hardin, FASEB J. 2005, 19:586-587; Sawada et al., Blood. 2010, 115:2220-2230). The introduction of caveolin protected partially against apoptosis in Kv1.3 WT, but not in Kv1.3 CBDless.</p><p>4. In 3T3-L1 cells, caveolin may be ablated by shRNA, thereby an increase in the Kv1.3/caveolin ratio, which surely impairs the Kv1.3-caveolin association, results in more apoptosis. These results parallel T-cell data.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>• Human T cells express caveolin-1, and caveolin-1 deficiency in T cells reduces effector function (J Immunol. 2017; 199: 874-884).</p></disp-quote><p>Although Borger et al. claim the expression of caveolin 1, caveolin 1 is only observed upon concentration by immunoprecipitation. In contrast, the defective expression of caveolin in lymphocytes has been reported in several papers by different groups (Hatanaka et al., Biochem Biophys Res Commun 1998, 253: 382387; Vallejo and Hardin, FASEB J. 2005, 19:586-587; Sawada et al., Blood. 2010, 115:22202230). It is true that Hatanaka et al., 1998 suggest that certain cell lines may express caveolin under certain states of activation. Our data agrees with that observation (see our new panel in Figure 7D). In fact, we detected, in a regular WB with no immunoprecipitation, a faint band of cav 1 (Figure 7D). Therefore, we mention that cav1 expression is limited. Anyway, Kv1.3 is much more abundant than caveolin. However, as abovementioned, we managed to select some Jurkat cav+ (Figure 7D) and results in this cell clone, as well as primary T-lymphocytes support our claim.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Based on your results, caveolin-1 deficient primary human T cells would be predicted to express less surface Kv1.3 and more mitoKv1.3, exhibit altered mitochondrial morphology and physiology, and be more susceptible to apoptosis. This might be worth testing.</p></disp-quote><p>As abovementioned, in deficient Jurkat T-cells (regular cav-) both channels (WT and CBDless) triggered similar level of apoptosis and this is partially counteracted by the endogenous expression of caveolin (Jurkat cav+) (Figure 7E). However, as suggested by the reviewer, we have performed several studies in freshly isolated primary human Tlymphocytes (Figure 8-10). In these T-cells, with no endogenous caveolin, apoptosis was partially counteracted in Kv1.3 WT-expressing cells, but not in CBDless cells, once cav was introduced. In addition, both Kv1.3 channels share similar location in primary T-cells with no caveolin (Figure 8). As mentioned by the reviewer, Pearson’s coefficient of colocalization is higher in mitochondria than membrane. However, this should be taken with caution because membrane and mitochondrial marker staining are quite different.</p><p>In addition, new data on primary human T-lymphocytes (Figure 9-11) demonstrate that the reviewer is correct and the expression of Kv1.3 triggers “<italic>altered mitochondrial morphology and physiology, and cells are more susceptible to apoptosis</italic>”. Overall, our data supports that the association Kv1.3/cav is important for fine-tuning the apoptosis susceptibility.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>• Accumulation of Kv1.3 in the ER and Golgi when CBD is mutated (Figure 2D) may affect the physiology of these organelles. The authors may wish to address/discuss this.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank the reviewer for this suggestion. The increment of colocalization of Kv1.3CBDless with these organelles is a result of a massive increase of intracellular retention. However, Supplemental Figure 7 we show no ER stress. Anyway, in order to address this specific concern, in this new version, we have used a Kv1.3 mutant (YMVIii) that shows massive ER intracellular retention and does not reach the membrane surface (Martinez-Marmol et al., J Cell Sci. 2013, 126:5681-5691). The Kv1.3 YMVIii mutant, associates with caveolin, colocalizes within the ER (Martinez-Marmol et al., 2013), routes to mitochondria, targets no plasma membrane (Martinez-Marmol et al., 2013) and causes no apoptosis (Supplemental Figure 6D). Therefore, data obtained with this channel further support that the Kv1.3/caveolin association rather than the intracellular retention by itself is the main responsible for our claims. These results are introduced now as a Supplemental Figure 6.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>Capera et al. cover an interesting topic in their manuscript, which reports a novel role of the interaction between caveolin 1 and Kv1.3 channels.

Authors in a series of experiments use Cav1 knock-down HEK cell line. However, I did not find in the manuscript if they applied it in the mitochondrial function and apoptosis experiments. As all the experiments related to Cav1-driven Kv1.3 targeting I suppose it would be practical to use a cell line lacking endogenous Cav1 and then &quot;re-add&quot; Cav1 with transfection of Cav1 plasmid e.g. for organelle-localization experiments, mitochondrial location, apoptosis.</p></disp-quote><p>We only used the HEK cav1- cell line when FRET between cav and Kv1.3 was analyzed (Figure 1D). The rest of the paper deals mostly with HEK-293 wt cells and lymphocytes. In fact, the HEK cav1- was not of interest in this work. This cell line was widely characterized in a previous work (Perez-Verdaguer et al., Sci Rep. 2016, 6:22453). As requested, we have introduced a set of new experiments with primary human T-cells, which have limited expression of cav, and introduced cav in order to evaluate what the Reviewer proposes. Importantly, our new data in primary human T-cells (Figure 8-10) and Jurkat (Figure 7) demonstrate that the presence of cav partially protects from apoptosis. In summary, taking into account all cellular models (HEK, B16F10 melanoma, Jurkat, primary human T-cells and NIH 3T3 L1 cells) allows us achieving relevant conclusions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. For electrophysiology Authors chose oocytes instead of HEK cells. Why did not the authors show data which were measured in HEK cells?</p></disp-quote><p>The aim of the present work was to decipher whether the association of Kv1.3 and caveolin influences cell survival and apoptosis. We initially wanted to perform the electrophysiology in our mammalian cell models rather than in oocytes. However, as abovementioned, Kv1.3CBDless generates important changes at the membrane physiology and integrity triggering membrane weakness impeding patch clamp experiments.</p><p>As mentioned above, CBDless cells undergo severe apoptosis and changes in membrane lipid composition and membrane integrity are evident. Because of that, and patch-clamp being impossible to achieve in mammalian culture cells, we analyzed the cholesterol and sphingolipid concentration of Kv1.3CBDless HEK cells. CBDless cells exhibited a reduction of 12% cholesterol, 10% phosphatidylserine + phosphatidylinositol and 5% sphingolipids in their membranes. This clearly will affect the integrity of the membrane as well as the kinetic of channels (Cholesterol regulation of Ion channels and receptors, I. Levitan and F.J.</p><p>Barrantes eds. 2012. DOI: 10.1002/9781118342312. John Wiley and Sons, Inc).</p><p>Probably because of this reason, seals were extremely instable and cells died just applying the whole cell configuration. To sum up, mammalian cell models were not suitable for electrophysiology.</p><p>Our choice of using oocytes was driven by the observation that these cells exhibit an extremely resistant membrane for the validation of channel tetramerization and functionality. In any case, the rationale for the electrophysiological characterization of the CBDless mutant was the fact that altering the CBD, lying next to the tetramerization domain, could impair the oligomerization and functionality of the channel. Therefore, we wanted to exclude the possibility that Kv1.3 CBDless gives rise to a non-functional channel, but the detailed electrophysiological characterization of this mutant was not the primary scope of the current study. In our previous version, we analyzed few parameters to demonstrate that the CBDless was functional in terms of tetramerization and conductivity. The effects of a limited caveolin interaction of the channel on the electrophysiological parameters of the CBDless mutant were addressed previously (Perez-Verdaguer et al., Sci Rep 2016;6:22453).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In their previous paper the authors demonstrated that in Cav1- HEK cells the Kv1.3 channel had slower inactivation kinetics than in those with Cav1 expression, and not a drastic reduction in the current happened upon Cav1 knock-down. Here the data show that prevention of Cav1 binding to Kv1.3 channels results in a drastic change. I think these outcomes, at least in part, are contradictory. Do the Authors have any explanation for that?</p></disp-quote><p>The Reviewer raises and interesting point that is currently under study in our laboratory. In our previous study, knock-down of Cav1 still allowed Kv1.3 to reach the plasma membrane, at least partially. Here we show that the same is true for the Kv1.3 CBDless, where there is no interaction at all with Cav1, and thus the intracellular retention of the mutant channel is further enhanced. As mentioned above, to establish a direct correlation to answer the question of the reviewer, the electrophysiological parameters should be studied in HEK293 cells, which is however impossible in the case of the CDB-less Kv1.3.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Is it possible that mutation eliminated the interaction between the channel and another (not Cav1) protein necessary for PM targeting?</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer is correct and because the CBD lies close the tetramerization domain as well as to the Kvβ binding domain, we have checked both possibilities. Throughout the manuscript we show that Kv1.3CBD less mutant tetramerizes (Supplemental Figure 2) being functional (Supplemental Figure 3) and we now include for the internal reviewer’s evaluation some preliminary raw data showing that the CBDless mutant is also able to associate to Kvβ subunits. Although we have addressed the possible elimination of the channel interaction with the auxiliary subunit due to mutation, lying next to the CBD cluster, the possibility of any alternative protein remains open; therefore further studies need to be performed, that are out of the scope of the paper on our opinion. For this reason, we decided to show these data here to the Reviewer, but not to include it into the manuscript. Another important issue could be the interaction of Kv1.3 with lipids. The apoptosis generated by the CBDless mutant trigger an important decrease of membrane cholesterol. The effects of cholesterol on ion channels have been widely documented (Cholesterol on Ion channels, book, Levitan and Barrantes editors).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. For the TEM images the authors mentioned that Kv1.3 channels are localized to mitochondria detected using the immunogold labeling technique. I could observe only one-two gold beads/mitochondria (or organelles), which I suppose is unexpectedly low as Kv1.3 protein was overexpressed (and also large fraction of channels target to mitochondria). On the other hand, I wonder if any specific markers for organelles were applied to identify them.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer is right, but please note that in the immunogold TEM, images of a single, tiny section of mitochondria are visible. Figure 7C shows two spots for Kv1.3 and only one spot for Cav, while both proteins are well-detectable in purified mitochondria by Western blot. We have to take into consideration that in the TEM images, using a very limited dilution of antibody, as we did use, we assure that the staining is specific. More staining often represents increase in background, false labeling and poor structural preservation.</p><p>[Editors’ note: what follows is the authors’ response to the second round of review.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed, as outlined below:</p><p>1. One of the claims made in the paper: &quot; interactions between caveolin and Kv1.3 are essential for apoptosis&quot; seems slightly overstated. We recommend the authors to soften this claim and discuss alternative possibilities. Their work clearly provides evidence for improper trafficking of Kv1.3 CBDless to the plasma membrane and ectopic expression in mitochondria, resulting in apoptosis. They have also shown that caveolin is involved in modulating apoptosis. Previous work from their lab has shown caveolin interacts with Kv1.3 and increases C-type inactivation and fails to interact with CBDlessKV1.3. It remains unclear whether there is any direct interaction/cross-modulation between Kv1.3 and caveolin in the mitochondria, causing apoptosis, and that requires more direct evidence to support the claim.</p><p>There is no doubt that both caveolin and Kv1.3 are involved in apoptosis and apoptosis IS dependent on Kv1.3-caveolin axis, but the direct interaction between these two proteins in the mitochondria warrants further investigations. The experimental evidence provided in the manuscript are suggestive of such an interaction in mitochondria and resulting apoptosis, but it is not definitive. Addressing it in the discussion will benefit the readers.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the Reviewer for this important comment. Indeed, we agree that direct interaction of mitoKv1.3 with mitochondria-located caveolin is not proven in our experiments. Thus, as kindly suggested, our claims have been soften thoroughly the manuscript.</p><p>We have modified the Discussion accordingly and a new sentence has been included (p 11, l 16-19): “Although a direct interaction of these proteins in mitochondria has not been confirmed and warrants further investigation, evidence suggests that apoptosis is dependent on mitoKv1.3-caveolin functional axis”.</p><p>In addition, we have deleted the following sentence from the Discussion: “The severity of the Kv1.3-mediated events highly depends on its intramitochondrial association with Cav1.”</p><p>We have also modified the subheading (p 7) and a sentence in the Results section: “Our data indicated that altering the functional crosstalk between Cav1 and Kv1.3 plays a crucial role in determining the sensitivity of cells to apoptosis” (p 8, l 21-22). This statement emphasizes that interaction between mitoKv1.3 and mitochondria-located Cav1 is functional (not necessarily physical). To note that, functional crosstalk is supported by several observations reported in our work, including that, unlike Kv1.3 CBDless, Kv1.3 (YMVIii) partially locates to mitochondria, associates to Cav 1 (Suppl Figure 6C), but does not trigger relevant apoptosis (Suppl Figure 6D).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. Regarding the electrophysiological properties of the mutant channel, against the view of the authors and even though the construct appears toxic to mammalian cells and the experiments need to be done in oocytes, if the mutant activates „earlier&quot;, it is in our view more active at any potential. Also, in oocytes, if the transport to the membrane is altered, then it would be expected that the currents are smaller. A decrease in the input resistance of the oocyte would also rather indicate a &quot;higher&quot; basal activity. If we understand correctly, the role of Kv1.3 in apoptosis relies on the fact that reduction of its activity through bax blockade triggers ∆ψm hyperpolarization and then apoptosis, so it is counterintuitive how a &quot;more active&quot; channel is proapoptotic.</p></disp-quote><p>We would like to emphasize that currents generated by the CBDless mutant should be taken with caution and mostly considered artefacts because the massive fail of cellular integrity. The electrophysiological characterization of Kv1.3 CDBless was undertaken exclusively to demonstrate that the mutant channel was functional because the CBD lies near the tetramerization domain. CBDless mutant currents are deeply affected by the massive cellular apoptosis, which affects the integrity of their plasma membrane and lipid composition (see Cholesterol Regulation of Ion Channels and Receptors, Levitan and Barrantes eds. John Wiley and Sons Inc; 2012).</p><p>Anyway, the reviewer is correct and the conductance/voltage curve of the Kv1.3 CBDless shifts to left indicating that the channel activates a more negative potentials (earlier activation). However, because the membrane expression is very different the K<sup>+</sup> conductance at -40 mV (close to the resting membrane potential of oocytes) is similar for CBDless and WT (5.89 ± 1.20 μS, n=28, vs 5.93 ± 0.98 μS, n=23, for CBD-less and WT, respectively) what explains why the membrane potential of both groups was similar. These values cannot be correlated with input resistance because the input resistance is measured at -100/-80 mV and Kv1.3 is not active at the plasma membrane. Therefore, this value only indicates passive properties of oocyte membrane. The fact that the CBDless mutant exhibited a less input resistance is because the membrane is more leaky that WT because cells are sick (apoptosis).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Importantly, how activation of Kv1.3 happens with the values of ∆ψm in the context of mitochondria (140 mV negative to the activation potential of Kv1.3) remains an unanswered question. We think that this issue merits a few words in the discussion. Moreover, Cav1 maintains mitochondrial depolarization, as its knockdown induces hyperpolarization. This is against what one would expect if it acts partly through Kv1.3. The concept &quot;Kv1.3-mediated cell death&quot; is somewhat misleading if Kv1.3 blockade is what triggers apoptosis. Why does then mitoKv1.3 overexpression promote apoptosis? We might well have got the point wrong, but we think other readers would have the same problem.</p></disp-quote><p>Many thanks for calling our attention to the need of explaining better the somewhat complex physiology of mitochondrial channels. The Reviewer is correct that unfortunately it is still unknown how mitoKv1.3 can be active at the highly negative membrane potential found across the inner mitochondrial membrane (IMM) (around -180mV). As mentioned in the Introduction, what was shown is that acute inhibition of mitoKv1.3 causes IMM hyperpolarization, and this triggers ROS production with subsequent opening of the permeability transition pore (PTP). When PTP opens, this leads to loss of mitochondrial integrity, IMM depolarization, swelling and cytochrome c release (now we added this sentence to accentuate the consequences of PTP opening). PTP opening can be triggered, among other factors, either by ROS (triggered by hyperpolarization due to the chemical reduction of respiratory chain complexes) or by IMM depolarization above a certain threshold. Overexpression of K<sup>+</sup> transporting pathways in mitochondria causes depolarization, as they allow the influx of depolarizing K<sup>+</sup> into the matrix following the electrochemical gradient for this ion and cause mitochondrial depolarization as well as changes in ultrastructure (see e.g. Figure 3d, Paggio et al., Nature. 2019;572(7771):609-613.). Thus, acute changes in the membrane potential, upon block of the channel, induce ROS and PTP opening, while overexpression of mito-located Kv1.3, that is more prominent in the case of CBDless mutant or in the absence of Cav1 (for both WT and CBD-less Kv1.3), causes sustained depolarization that sensitizes the cells to apoptotic stimuli (Suppl Figure 5). PTP opening then further depolarizes IMM and reduces respiration due to swelling and loss of cytochrome c from the respiratory chain. Overexpression of WT or CBDless equally depolarizes mitochondria and causes apoptosis in primary T cells that lack endogenous Cav1. It has to be mentioned that while overexpression promotes apoptosis, the lack of the channel (WT Kv1.3) renders the cells resistant to apoptosis (Szabo et al., PNAS, 2008). This situation is similar to other ones, where the pharmacological block of a channel (e.g. KATP; Miki et al., Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A 1998;95(18):10402-6) does not yield the same effect of KO, as the former one triggers a series of signaling events that cannot be triggered in the cells lacking the channel. We now introduced the above considerations in the Introduction (page 4, lines 18-19) and Discussion (p 9, l 18-34) as suggested.</p><p>In addition, the role of Cav1 in mitochondrial function is under debate. While the reviewer mentions: <italic>“Cav1 maintains mitochondrial depolarization, as its knockdown induces hyperpolarization”</italic>, Yu et al., (Aging Cell. 2017; 16(4):773-784) claim that Cav-1 knockdown prevents mitochondrial respiration and ATP production. In fact, the enzymatic activity of OXPHOS complex I after Cav-1 knockdown was reduced to approximately 40%. This fact would trigger depolarization rather hyperpolarization. Furthermore, we have recently shown that mitoKv1.3 interacts with complex I and inhibition of mitoKv1.3 reduces complex I activity (Peruzzo et al., 2020 Redox Biology; 37:101705). Therefore, it is tempting to speculate that if Cav1 knockdown reduces complex I activity, and mitoKv1.3 blockage reduces complex I activity, a functional link between Cav1 and mitoKv1.3 would exist at the level of complex I further supporting our claim. However, this is far beyond the scope of the present manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. Disregarding the fact that Kv1.3 overexpression on its own reduces respiration by almost one-half (Figure 5), the mitochondrial fragmentation induced by Kv1.3CBDless deserves some comments in this context.</p></disp-quote><p>Basal (without addition of oligomycin) (Figure 5B) and maximal respiration (Figure 5C) were slightly reduced (by 15%) in the case of WT Kv1.3, while reduction was significantly higher for Kv1.3 CBD-less. The cells were transfected directly in the Seahorse plate and efficiency (more than 60% of the cells were transfected and transfection efficiency was controlled by YFP fluorescence, as mentioned in the Materials and methods section). In any case, in Figure 5C data were normalized with respect to the basal respiration and thus show a significant decrease in maximal respiration independently of the cell number. In general, mitochondrial fission is regulated in a way to couple mitochondrial morphology to the energetic status of the cell (see e.g. Giacomello et al., 2020, Nature reviews Molecular cell biology 21, 204-224). Fission is induced by phosphorylation mediated by AMPK, able to sense the changes in the energy status of a cell and consequently adapt mitochondrial function and dynamics. AMPK facilitates mitochondrial fission downstream of mitochondrial dysfunction caused by mitochondrial respiration inhibition. This mechanism was proposed to facilitate apoptosis in cells with severely dysfunctional mitochondria (Toyama et al., 2016, Science (New York, NY) 351, 275-281). The above explanation has now been added to the Discussion section (p 10, l 30-36).</p></body></sub-article></article>
