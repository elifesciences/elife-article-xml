crucial for harmonious fetal development throughout pregnancy. Their premature rupture is often the consequence of a physiological phenomenon that has been exacerbated. Beyond all the implied biological processes, inflammation is of primary importance and is qualified as ‘sterile’ at the end of pregnancy. In this study, complementary methylomic and transcriptomic strategies on amnion and choriodecidua explants obtained from the altered (cervix zone) and intact fetal membranes at term and before labour were used. By cross-analysing genome-wide studies strengthened by in vitro experiments, we deciphered how the expression of toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), an actor in pathological fetal membrane rupture, is controlled. Indeed, it is differentially regulated in the altered zone and between both layers by a dual mechanism: (1) the methylation of TLR4 and miRNA promoters and (2) targeting by miRNA (let-7a-2 and miR-125b-1) acting on the 3’-UTR of TLR4. Consequently, this study demonstrates that fine regulation of TLR4 is required for sterile inflammation establishment at the end of pregnancy and that it may be dysregulated in the pathological premature rupture of membranes.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>fetal membrane</kwd><kwd>methylome</kwd><kwd>transcriptome</kwd><kwd>TLR4</kwd><kwd>PPROM</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Auvergne Rhone-Alpes Region Jeune Chercheur Framework</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Not applicable</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Blanchon</surname><given-names>Loïc</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Methylomic and trancriptomic analyses demonstrate the regulation of the toll-like receptor 4 inflammatory gene expression, an essential actor of the fetal membrane weakening at the end of pregnancy.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Placenta and fetal membranes are extra embryonic tissues that are originally formed by trophoblastic cell differentiation. Although these organs are transitory, their integrities throughout pregnancy are essential for harmonious in utero fetal development. Protecting the fetus (which is considered a semiallogeneic graft), fetal membranes are composed of amnion and chorion, creating a 0.5 mm thick layer surrounding the amniotic cavity. They are important for the protection of the fetus against infections ascending the genital tract and for the initiation of programmed term rupture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Joyce et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kendal-Wright, 2007</xref>). The site of rupture is a particular and unique zone of altered morphology (ZAM) situated around the cervix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">McLaren et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">McParland et al., 2003</xref>), which, along with a zone of intact morphology (ZIM), presents specific histological and cellular characteristics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">El Khwad et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Mauri et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">de Castro Silva et al., 2020</xref>). Furthermore, these processes lead to the emergence of a phenomenon called ‘sterile inflammation’, which occurs because of the release of numerous DAMP (damage-associated molecular pattern) molecules, such as HMGB1, the S100 protein family and HSPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Zindel and Kubes, 2020</xref>), all of which provoke the release of proinflammatory cytokines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gomez-Lopez et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Dysregulation of the fetal membrane’s integrity or premature activation of inflammatory pathways could lead to preterm premature rupture of membranes (PPROM), which is usually defined when occurring before 37 weeks of gestation and encountered in 1–3% of all births (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Waters and Mercer, 2011</xref>). This is associated with a high mortality rate and significant morbidity in newborn survivors because of fetal prematurity and maternal complications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Goldenberg et al., 2008</xref>). Both sterile intra-amniotic inflammation and intra-amniotic infections (Gram-negative bacteria) are the causes for PPROM pathology, whereas transcriptomic profiles could be different (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Konwar et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Motomura et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Musilova et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Romero et al., 2006</xref>). Nevertheless, they share common cellular actors, such as surface-expressed pattern recognition receptors, as the innate components of the immune system, including the most frequently described toll-like receptor (TLR) family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kawai and Akira, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Newton and Dixit, 2012</xref>).</p><p>To better understand the physiological and pathological rupture of membranes, the molecular study of global changes in gene expression can be accomplished using high-scale technical analyses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Eidem et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Haddad et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Han et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kawai and Akira, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Li et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lim et al., 2012</xref>). Surprisingly, only one unique transcriptome study focused on the ZIM or ZAM regions and amnion and chorion tissues, characterising a specific differential expression in a spontaneous rupture at term with labour; in the study, differences were observed in the chorion, though not in the amnion, specifically involving biological processes, such as extracellular matrix–receptor interaction and inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Nhan-Chang et al., 2010</xref>). In addition to classical direct gene regulation by transcription factors, DNA methylation is another well-known epigenetic mechanism that can interfere with the transcriptional regulation of all RNA types. This has only been investigated in one study on the amnion methylation status between labour and nonlabour explants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kim et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kim et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>The purpose of our study is to exhaustively combine and correlate methylomic and transcriptomic analyses between ZIM and ZAM in the case of ‘sterile inflammation’. By cross-analysing our genome-wide studies, our objectives are to explain the different levels of gene expression by comparing the amnion/choriodecidua and the ZIM/ZAM. At term without labour (to avoid contraction influence and bacteria contamination at parturition), here by classifying genes into specific biological processes, we demonstrated that toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), which is classically involved in the recognition of Gram-negative bacteria and that triggers an inflammatory response in chorioamnionitis leading to PPROM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Medzhitov et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Poltorak et al., 1998</xref>), was overexpressed in the ZAM choriodecidua compared with the ZAM amnion. The mechanisms implying TLR4 in the physiological or pathological rupture of membrane in case of PPROM are well known. Triggering TLR4 will lead to NF-κB activation, leading to an increase of the release of proinflammatory cytokine, concentration of matrix metalloprotease and prostaglandin, which are well established actors of fetal membrane rupture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Robertson et al., 2020</xref>). Furthermore, we discovered that TLR4 regulation leads to layer and zone specificity. The latter occurred because of the hypomethylation of the TLR4 gene body in the ZAM choriodecidua, whereas its weak expression in the ZAM amnion layer was a direct consequence of the action of two hypomethylated miRNAs targeting the 3-UTR of TLR4: let-7a-2 and miR-125b-1. Therefore, the physiological choriodecidual overexpression of TLR4 could be exacerbated in PPROM, leading to the enhancement of the first step of early fetal membrane rupture.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Methylomic analysis of fetal membranes allows for defining the Gene Ontology classification for the ZAM</title><p>After identifying the differentially hypermethylated genes between the amnion and choriodecidua on the whole genome between the ZIM and ZAM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), biological process analysis was performed; this has been represented by a four-way Venn diagram (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). If the hypermethylated genes were clearly lower in the ZIM (1746 genes) than the ZAM (9830 genes), the specific genes only found in the ZIM (hyper- or hypomethylated; total number 98 [i.e., 10 + 88, as illustrated by black circles]) did not exhibit any statistically significant result (p-value &lt; 0.01 with Bonferroni correction). In contrast, the specific genes modified in terms of methylation for the ZAM (total number 5750 [i.e., 3379 + 2371, as illustrated by white circles]) led to the discovery of the numerous biological processes detailed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>. Specifically, the number of characterisations of an enrichment in Gene Ontology (GO) term IDs were clearly more concentrated and, thus, were more biologically significant in the case where a definite gene was more methylated in the amnion than in the choriodecidua (mA&gt; mC). The biological process term IDs containing the most important gene number were the G protein-coupled receptor signalling pathways (such as for defence response, detection of stimulus or inflammatory response), which could be linked to sterile inflammation and the onset of parturition related to fetal membrane ruptures.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Differential cytosine methylation analysed for the zone of intact morphology (ZIM) and zone of altered morphology (ZAM).</title><p>(A) Genes affected by differential methylation between the amnion and choriodecidua, separately studied for the ZIM (left) and ZAM (right).

Biological process (GO term) analysis was not significant, which is likely because of the small number of studied genes and because the underlying generic processes were linked only to urogenital abnormalities, not to pathological pregnancy, as confirmed by the MeSH disease terms (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1e</xref>).</p><p>Conversely, 105 genes were hypermethylated in the amnion and were more expressed in the choriodecidua (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1f</xref>); they could be classified as MeSH disease terms linked directly to pregnancy pathologies, such as placenta diseases (trophoblastic neoplasms, pre-eclampsia, fetal growth retardation, or placenta accreta), female urogenital diseases, and pregnancy complications (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1g</xref>). GO term analysis clearly identified three complementary pathways: response to external stimulus, detection of LPS, and inflammatory response. Interestingly, fetal membranes were sensitive to external stimuli, such as Gram-negative bacterial molecules and LPSs, in relation to the inflammatory response. Of all the genes classified in these processes, TLR4 was the only one represented in all these biological processes and, therefore, seems to play a central role in parturition at term. To validate this in silico observation and pave the way for describing TLR4’s importance, immunofluorescence experiments were first conducted to confirm the protein’s presence in the amnion and choriodecidua of the ZAM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Considering the important role of TLR4 in sterile (regarding HMGB1 release) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bredeson et al., 2014</xref>) or pathological inflammation (chorioamnionitis) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Robertson et al., 2020</xref>), the remainder of the study focused on the characterisation and regulation of TLR4 expression in fetal membranes, as ascertained by cross-analysis of the methylomic and transcriptomic results.</p><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Common genes observed between the mA&gt; mC methylomic results and choriodecidua/amnion transcriptomic analysis in the zone of altered morphology (ZAM).</title><p>(A) Gene Ontology (GO) terms’ representative distribution and their log10 p-values are shown for the 105 common genes across both genome-wide studies.

PPROM represents one-third of pregnancies that end prematurely and principally depends on an early scale and the kinetic activation of inflammation, signalling a cascade in gestational tissues.</p><p>Because the inflammatory mechanisms of preterm and term birth are broadly similar, understanding how human fetal membranes are prepared for their physiological rupture is essential and could be a molecular mechanism abnormally exacerbated during PPROM. Studies have partially documented and established that a weak zone (ZAM) situated in the cervix zone emerges at the end of the 9-month gestation period (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">McLaren et al., 1999</xref>) as a direct consequence of global layer disorganisation and weakening. All of these phenomena are key determinants of a rupture and could be directly linked to a common denominator: the regulation and modification of gene expression levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Romero et al., 2006</xref>). For the first time, a complementary high-throughput approach was applied by performing both transcriptomic and methylomic analyses of the same samples. Moreover, one strength of our work is highlighting both the global geographical (ZIM/ZAM) and tissue layer (amnion vs. choriodecidua) differences in terms of DNA methylation and gene expression.</p><p>Indeed, our methylomic study established a global profile of fetal membranes in the ZIM and ZAM samples. The number of hypermethylated genes in the amnion or choriodecidua was more important in the ZAM than in the ZIM; this allowed us to perform a GO term classification focused on the ZAM, where cell adhesion, response to a stimulus, tissue development, and reproductive processes are significantly represented. We found some similarities with transcriptomic analysis, where overexpressed genes in the choriodecidua ZAM were linked to biological adhesion (important in tissue integrity), regulation of cell proliferation, extracellular matrix organisation, and responses to internal and external stimuli.</p><p>By cross-analysing both methods for the ZAM, a link for the 105 genes overexpressed in the choriodecidua and hypomethylated in the amnion with MeSH disease terms (e.g., pregnancy complication) was revealed. Especially in GO terms, these highlighted processes could be directly linked to preparation for parturition through a sterile inflammation cascade. We then turned our attention to TLR4, a major mediator of inflammation, for the following reasons: First, this upstream gatekeeper of innate immune activation was the only gene appearing in each of the considered GO terms, as illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>. Second, it is an important partner of many other genes included in our list of 105 genes (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Third, TLR4 was already known to be expressed in the fetal membranes and cervices of animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gonzalez et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Harju et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Moço et al., 2013</xref>) and to play a role as a key regulator in a sterile or septic inflammatory reaction in response to aggression by a pathogen-associated molecular pattern/DAMP, which leads to PPROM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Chin et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Li et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Patni et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Wang and Hirsch, 2003</xref>). Fourth, TLR4 is also known to be involved in parturition in the classical term of pregnancy, activating a sterile inflammation cascade (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Choi et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Wahid et al., 2015</xref>). Fifth, it could be considered a promising therapeutic target to prevent preterm birth through better control of its proinflammatory signalling.</p><p>According to a previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Krol et al., 2010</xref>)—and as confirmed by our qPCR and Western blot quantification—TLR4 was more expressed in the choriodecidua than in the amnion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B and C</xref>). Targeting the choriodecidua is interesting because it is the first breaking layer in the different steps of the rupture of membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Méhats et al., 2011</xref>). This overexpression could be because of differential methylation and/or transcription factor fixations or could be a consequence of post-transcriptional regulation by miRNAs. miRNAs play crucial regulatory roles in biological and pathological processes; they are well documented in gestational tissues, such as the placenta, endometrium, and fetal membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Doridot et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gu et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kamity et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Montenegro et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Wang et al., 2016</xref>), and they have begun to be considered as potential biomarkers for pregnancy pathologies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cretoiu et al., 2016</xref>). Indeed, studies have already shown that uninfluenced by labour, some miRNA expressions decrease in chorioamniotic membranes with gestational age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Montenegro et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Montenegro et al., 2007</xref>). We found two miRNAs (mir-125b-1 and let-7a-2) that were hypermethylated in the choriodecidua compared with the amnion, which could potentially target TLR4 mRNA in the amnion to decrease its expression level. They were previously unknown to be able to specifically target TLR4, leading us to demonstrate the consequences of their transfection on the quantification of TLR4 mRNA and protein on the cell line AV3 or primary amniotic epithelial cells using the luciferase 3’UTR of the TLR4 reporter gene.</p><p>Surprisingly, these two miRNAs are part of an miR-100-let-7a-2 cluster host gene: MIR100HG. This cluster has never been studied in relation to the placenta or fetal membrane environment, unlike others such as C14MC, C19MC, and miR-371–3, whose expressions change during pregnancy between the whole and terminal villi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gu et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Morales-Prieto et al., 2013</xref>). In humans, 10 mature let-7s are synthesised and implicated in different physiological and pathological events, from embryogenesis to adult development, such as inflammatory responses and innate immunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Roush and Slack, 2008</xref>). However, the latter finding could not be linked only to simple TLR4 targeting because both miRNAs were also already known to have implications for innate immunity by influencing not only the expression of interleukins and TNFα, but also cell senescence, which is another well-known phenomenon occurring at the end of fetal membrane life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Iliopoulos et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Nyholm et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Schulte et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Tili et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>On a global scale, the results obtained in the present study provide information regarding the implication of inflammation in the physiological rupture of fetal membranes. However, future studies are needed to exploit all the data accumulated during this work. Nevertheless, by focusing on a unique candidate—TLR4, which is a well-known actor in the physiological and pathological rupture of membranes—we have outlined the complex molecular process of gene regulation and have proposed a fetal membrane layer-specific model to better understand fetal membrane ruptures in the ZAM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). This regulation is intriguing because it implies a double molecular mechanism of regulation (at the DNA and mRNA levels), which is apparently layer specific, though located in the same geographical area of the fetal membrane. These first results could doubtlessly be extrapolated to other genes by our high-scale studies and to gestational tissues or resident/circulating immune cells, such as neutrophils and monocytes/macrophages, which are implicated in the amplification of the inflammatory response in PPROM and physiological FM rupture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Galaz et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gomez-Lopez et al., 2022</xref>).

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Y M Dennis Lo as the Senior Editor and Reviewing Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1. The study is highly descriptive and the authors should consider that sterile inflammation and microbe-associated inflammation induce distinct transcriptomic profiles in human fetal membranes, which was recently reported in Infect Immun. 2021 Apr 16;89(5):e00819-20. The authors could consider utilizing these publicly available data to enhance the translational value of their hypothesis.</p><p>2. There are currently available animal models of premature rupture of membranes (e.g., ultrasound-guided or mini-laparotomy). The authors should consider adding in vivo experiments to prove causality between TLR4 and rupture of membranes.</p><p>3.

There are currently available animal models of premature rupture of membranes (e.g., ultrasound-guided or mini-laparotomy). The authors should consider adding in vivo experiments to prove causality between TLR4 and rupture of membranes.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that animal models are available. Nevertheless, we considered that such models are far from the human reality. In fact, animal models are often used for fetal membrane studies, but they are different regarding pregnancy physiology, structure and uterine environment, which hamper their use. In addition, these animal models are usually based on the injection of bacterial products. However, it is well known that the percentage of PPROM associated with microbial invasion can vary based on the weeks of gestation. In fact, early gestational ages are clearly linked to high microbial associated intra-amniotic inflammation prevalence (64.3% when &lt;25 WGA), whereas this percentage subsequently decreases throughout gestation (Romero et al., 2015), reaching one-third at term, which is better linked with the gestational stage of their study. Furthermore, the quantification of TLR4 mRNA expression and protein in the case of PPROM without chorioamnionitis compared with term no labor without chorioamnionitis has already been carried out (Kim et al., 2004), indicating an absence of a clear link between chorioamnionitis and TLR4 expression. These observations support the fact that the TLR4 model in physiological rupture could be transposed—at least in part—to sterile PPROM and initiated by the presence of alarmins (<italic>i.e.,</italic> HMGB1) and their binding to such type of receptors. Indeed, TLR4 is now well described as being stimulated by ligands other than LPS, such as HMGB1, a member of the DAMPs (Robertson et al., 2020). Finally, in an animal model of PPROM, an article underlined the importance of TLR4 in preterm labor by using TLR4 mice mutants in a sterile context (Wahid et al., 2015). This is why we decided (i) to not consider the proposal of the reviewer concerning animal models and (ii) removed Figure 3C (expression of TLR4 in the presence of LPS from bacterial origin), which helped keep a greater focus on the physiological rupture of fetal membranes without the involvement of bacterial presence.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. The authors focus on the rupture zone of the membranes, but fail to explain how the regulation of TLR4 mediates the process of membrane rupture.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with your comment; however, ‘how the regulation of TLR4 mediates the process of membrane rupture is not the topic of the manuscript. In addition, this has already been well established in previous publications. Nevertheless, we added a sentence in the introduction part between the lines lines 97-100: ‘The mechanisms implying TLR4 in the physiological or pathological rupture of membrane in case of PPROM are well known. Triggering TLR4 will lead to NF-κB activation, leading to an increase of the release of proinflammatory cytokine, concentration of matrix metalloprotease and prostaglandin, which are well established actors of fetal membrane rupture (Robertson et al., 2020).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. The amnion layer is structurally different from the chorion. The chorion is infiltrated by innate immune cells during sterile and microbe-associated inflammation. The authors should consider evaluating the process of rupture of membranes in a more multi-dimensional manner, in which amnion, chorion, and immune cells are implicated.</p></disp-quote><p>According to the reviewer’s recommendation, at the end of the discussion, we added a sentence considering the essential fetal–maternal dialogue between amnion and choriodecidua, tissue layers and cell diversity: ‘Furthermore, to complete such investigations, the use of recently developed technology such as organ-on-chip (OOC) will better mimic fetal–maternal communication and exchanges between tissue layer and cell types’ (see lines 307-309).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>The abstract, introduction and discussion would benefit from some rewriting.

In fact, Figure 1B (Venn diagram) focused on the ZAM zone because there is no significant changes in methylation status in the ZIM zone. Concerning the ZAM, in Figure 1B, the left-upper part indicates genes where the methylation status is higher in amnion compared with the choriodecidua (<italic>i.e.</italic>, 3379). For the right-upper part, genes are hypermethylated in the choriodecidua compared with the amnion (<italic>i.e.</italic>, 2371). In the middle part, the 980 genes encountered in ZAM zone do not show a methylation difference between these two layers. To be exhaustive, we made three lists of these genes. To future readers, we have provided a supplementary file 2 containing a sheet regarding methylome ZAM (three lists of genes) (sheet 1).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Both in figures 1 and 2 many genes where shared by the ZIM and ZAM.

To complete Figure 7, at the end of the discussion, we added the following paragraph: ‘This regulation is intriguing because it implies a double molecular mechanism of regulation (at the DNA and mRNA levels), which is apparently layer specific, though located in the same geographical area of the fetal membrane’ (line 300-302). The latter could doubtlessly be extrapolated to other genes by our high-scale studies and to gestational tissues or resident/circulating immune cells, such as neutrophils, which are implicated in the amplification of the inflammatory response in late gestation’.

The text added is as follows: ‘Briefly, a suture sewn onto the FMs (from caesarean deliveries) in front of the cervix by the midwife allowed us to identify the ZAM; then, a 4 cm diameter circle was cut and considered the ZAM, and explants localised places away from circle boundary were considered the ZIM’.
