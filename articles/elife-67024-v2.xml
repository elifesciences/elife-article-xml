relationship remains unknown. Herein, we have examined the contribution of viral infection to the severity of arthritis in mice. We have provided the first evidence that latent gammaherpesvirus infection enhances clinical arthritis, modeling EBV’s role in RA. Mice latently infected with a murine analog of EBV, gammaherpesvirus 68 (γHV68), develop more severe collagen-induced arthritis and a Th1-skewed immune profile reminiscent of human disease. We demonstrate that disease enhancement requires viral latency and is not due to active virus stimulation of the immune response. Age-associated B cells (ABCs) are associated with several human autoimmune diseases, including arthritis, though their contribution to disease is not well understood. Using ABC knockout mice, we have provided the first evidence that ABCs are mechanistically required for viral enhancement of disease, thereby establishing that ABCs are impacted by latent gammaherpesvirus infection and provoke arthritis.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Rheumatoid arthritis is one of the most common autoimmune diseases, leaving patients in pain as their immune system mistakenly attacks the lining of their joints. The precise cause is unknown, but research suggests a link to the Epstein-Barr virus, the agent responsible for mononucleosis (also known as glandular fever). After infection and recovery, the virus remains in the body, lying dormant inside immune ‘B cells’ which are often responsible for autoimmune diseases. Of particular interest are a sub-group known as ‘age-associated B-cells’, which are mostly cells left over from fighting past infections such as mononucleosis. Yet, the link between Epstein-Barr virus and rheumatoid arthritis remains hard to investigate because of the long gap between the two diseases: the virus mostly affects children and young people, while rheumatoid arthritis tends to develop in middle age.</p><p>To investigate how exactly the two conditions are connected, Mouat et al. created a new animal model: they infected young mice with the murine equivalent of the Epstein-Barr virus, and then used a collagen injection to trigger rheumatoid arthritis-like disease once the animals were older.</p><p>Next, Mouat et al. monitored the paws of the mice, revealing that viral infection early in life worsened arthritis later on. These animals also had more age-associated B cells than normal, and the cells showed signs of participating in inflammation. On the other hand, early viral infection did not make arthritis worse in mice unable to produce age-associated B cells. Taken together, these results suggest that the immune cells are required to enhance the effect of the viral infection on rheumatoid arthritis. This new insight may help to refine current treatments that work by reducing the overall number of B cells. Ultimately, the animal model developed by Mouat et al. could be useful to identify better ways to diagnose, monitor and treat this debilitating disease.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>arthritis</kwd><kwd>gammaherpesvirus-68</kwd><kwd>epstein-barr virus</kwd><kwd>age-associated B cells</kwd><kwd>latent infection</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd><kwd>Virus</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000261</institution-id><institution>Multiple Sclerosis Society of Canada</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id># 3070</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Horwitz</surname><given-names>Marc S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Latent gammaherpesvirus infection predisposes mice to develop more severe disease following induction of arthritis by elevating pathogenic interferon-gamma-expressing age-associated B cells.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is one of the most common autoimmune diseases in adults, though the etiology and pathophysiology are not fully understood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Humphreys et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Firestein and McInnes, 2017</xref>). RA, as well as other autoimmune diseases including multiple sclerosis (MS) and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), is associated with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Balandraud et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Ascherio and Munger, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gross et al., 2005</xref>). EBV infection typically takes place during childhood or adolescence, while RA generally becomes symptomatic during middle age, indicating that the latent EBV infection likely modulates the immune system over time in a manner that contributes to the development of RA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Humphreys et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dowd et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Fourcade et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alamanos et al., 2006</xref>). The circulating EBV load is higher in individuals with RA than in otherwise healthy adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Balandraud et al., 2003</xref>), and RA patients have increased levels of antibodies specific to multiple EBV-encoded proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Blaschke et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ferrell et al., 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Catalano et al., 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Alspaugh et al., 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hazelton et al., 1987</xref>). Further, RA patients have increased EBV-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lünemann et al., 2008</xref>), yet these cells have a reduced ability to kill EBV-infected B cells when compared to the same subset of EBV-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells from healthy controls (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Takei et al., 2001</xref>). However, the precise role of EBV in RA pathogenesis remains unknown.</p><p>Evidence from in vivo models is scarce and previous studies have focused primarily on the direct relationship between EBV infection and damage to the joint capsule, with little attention given to systemic effects of EBV infection on immune modulation preceding and continuing throughout disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kuwana et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">LeBel et al., 2018</xref>). Mice with humanized immune systems, namely NOD/Shi-<italic>scid</italic>/IL-2Rγ<sup>null</sup> mice reconstituted with CD34<sup>+</sup> hematopoietic stem cells, that were infected with EBV went on to spontaneously develop erosive arthritis, suggesting a causative role of EBV in arthritis development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kuwana et al., 2011</xref>). Related, a serum transfer‐induced arthritis model was used to demonstrate that Ly6C<sup>high</sup> monocytes play a role in transporting murine gammaherpesvirus 68 (γHV68), an EBV homolog, to the synovium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">LeBel et al., 2018</xref>). Our group has previously shown that latent γHV68 infection exacerbates experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) and leads to a disease that more closely resembles MS, with increased demyelination and infiltration of CD8 to cells of the central nervous system in γHV68-infected mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Casiraghi et al., 2012</xref>). Critically, this enhancement was specific to γHV68; other viruses, including lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) and murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV), did not lead to enhancement of EAE. Additionally, enhancement took place without changes to autoantibody levels. An in vivo model that recapitulates the temporal and systemic immunological aspects of the relationship between EBV and RA is critical.</p><p>To examine the relationship between EBV and RA, we have adapted in vivo models of both. γHV68 is a natural pathogen that is a well-established and widely-used murine model of EBV infection that shares an array of characteristics with human EBV infection, including latent persistence in B cells, viral reactivation from latency, a potent CD8 T cell response, and immune evasion tactics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Olivadoti et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Wirtz et al., 2016</xref>). Type II collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) is a commonly used model of RA wherein mice are injected with type II collagen emulsified in an adjuvant. Here, we chose to use C57BL/6J mice due to the extensive past characterization of γHV68 infection in C57BL/6 mice and the numerous knockout (KO) strains available on this background. Multiple strains of mice are susceptible to CIA, including C57BL/6 mice that, despite displaying a less severe disease course than other strains, generate a robust T cell response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Inglis et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Campbell et al., 2000</xref>). In C57BL/6 mice, CIA follows a chronic disease course with a sustained T cell response, presence of anti-collagen IgG, and infiltration of inflammatory lymphocytes into the joint capsule (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Inglis et al., 2007</xref>). EBV primary infection generally takes place in childhood or adolescence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dowd et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Fourcade et al., 2017</xref>), and RA can occur at any age, though the mean incidence is in the sixth decade of life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Myasoedova et al., 2010</xref>). Accordingly, we have infected immunologically and sexually mature 6- to 8-week-old C57BL/6J mice with γHV68 and have induced CIA when the mice were adults at 11–13 weeks old. Here we have shown that C57BL/6J mice infected with latent γHV68 and induced for CIA develop a more severe clinical course and an altered immunological profile compared to uninfected CIA controls, with expanded CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells and Th1 skewing. We have utilized γHV68 infection and CIA induction to investigate mechanism(s) by which EBV contributes to RA, in particular through the modulation of age-associated B cells (ABCs).</p><p>The role of B cells in the relationship between EBV and RA is intriguing because B cells contribute pathogenically to RA, and EBV infects B cells and alters the B cell profile (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Marston et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hatton et al., 2014</xref>). ABCs are a subset of B cells that are of particular interest as they have been implicated in both autoimmunity and viral infection. When compared to healthy adults, the relative proportion and/or absolute circulating counts of ABCs are elevated in RA patients, a subset of individuals with MS, individuals with SLE, and a subset of people with common variable immune deficiency that displays autoimmune complications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adlowitz et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Rubtsov et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Thorarinsdottir et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Wang et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Claes et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Wang et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Zhang et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Rakhmanov et al., 2009</xref>). ABCs are required for disease development in mouse models of SLE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Rubtsova et al., 2017</xref>). Also, ABCs are increased during viral infections in mice and/or humans including LCMV, γHV68, vaccinia, hepatitis C virus, HIV, and influenza (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Rubtsova et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Chang et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Knox et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Johnson et al., 2020</xref>). ABCs display an array of functional capacities, including the secretion of anti-viral or autoantibodies, initiation of germinal centers, antigen presentation to T cells, and secretion of cytokines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Rubtsova et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Chang et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Knox et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Johnson et al., 2020</xref>). It is yet to be examined whether ABCs play a role in viral contribution to autoimmunity. We found that ABC KO mice are unable to develop the γHV68-exacerbation of CIA and therefore act as a mediator between viral infection and autoimmunity.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Latent γHV68 infection exacerbates the clinical course of CIA</title><p>The development of RA often occurs years after initial infection with EBV when the virus is latent. To mimic this temporal relationship, we infected mice with γHV68, waited 5 weeks for the lytic infection to clear and the virus to establish latency, and induced CIA. Clearance of the acute virus and establishment of latency have previously been shown by plaque assay on spleens collected 35 days post-infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Casiraghi et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Barton et al., 2014</xref>). Following CIA induction, mice were assessed three times per week for redness and swelling in the two hind paws (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>), which informed a clinical score for each mouse. We observed that CIA in latent γHV68-infected mice (herein referred to as γHV68-CIA mice) had a more severe clinical course than uninfected mice (herein referred to as CIA mice), as evidenced by consistently higher clinical scores and changes in paw heights throughout the clinical course (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). γHV68-CIA mice also developed onset of disease symptoms an average of 7 days earlier than CIA mice, reached a higher score at endpoint, and displayed a higher cumulative score (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C-D</xref>). In agreement with other research groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Campbell et al., 2000</xref>), male and female mice displayed similar clinical scores during CIA, and we also did not observe a sex difference in γHV68-CIA mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E</xref>). As expected, latent γHV68-infected mice (without CIA) did not display any signs of disease (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–B</xref>). Titers of anti-type II collagen autoantibodies (total IgG, IgG1, and IgG2c) were elevated in sera from mice with CIA compared to naive mice without CIA, yet were similar in mice with CIA regardless of infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1F–H</xref>). Additionally, we found that inducing CIA in γHV68-infected mice did not impact viral load (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1I</xref>), indicating that γHV68 is not reactivating. These findings are in line with our previous work showing that latent γHV68 infection enhances EAE without influencing autoantibody levels or reactivating γHV68 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Casiraghi et al., 2012</xref>). These data demonstrate that latent γHV68 infection leads to earlier onset and more severe CIA, though the exacerbation is not due to higher titers of autoantibodies against type II collagen or changes in abundance of particular immunoglobulin isotypes.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Progression of CIA in latent γHV68-infected and control uninfected mice.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Clinical score (y-axis) of collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) measured three times weekly for 8 weeks (x-axis; days) post-CIA induction in mice without (CIA, filled circles) and with latent γHV68 infection (γHV68-CIA, open squares), and starting at day 35 post-infection in mice infected with latent γHV68 infection but not induced for CIA (γHV68, filled triangles).

Investigation of the mechanism by which EBV contributes to RA has previously been challenging due to the lack of a murine model to examine the systemic immune modulation caused by latent gammaherpesvirus infection and resulting influence on arthritis. Here, we show that infecting mice with latent γHV68 prior to CIA induction results in an immune course more similar to that of RA patients than CIA alone and is a suitable model for examining the contribution of EBV to RA. Elucidating how EBV infection contributes to the development of RA is critical to understanding the underlying pathophysiology of the disease.</p><p>As EBV is associated with several autoimmune diseases, it is important to examine whether there are conserved mechanisms of contribution. The overlap in etiology and pathophysiology between these autoimmune diseases may help to explain the cross-efficacy of immunotherapies between MS and RA, including B cell-depletion therapies. Our lab has previously demonstrated that latent γHV68 infection enhances EAE, a common model of MS, clinically and immunologically (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Casiraghi et al., 2012</xref>). In both the γHV68-CIA and γHV68-EAE models, we observed an increase in CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells at the site of disease and increased expression of IFNγ by cytotoxic and helper T cells. Latent gammaherpesvirus infection of mice clearly alters autoimmune disease onset and severity reminiscent of the strong association of latent EBV infection in RA patients. As such, these investigative models will serve to identify common mechanisms in which EBV contributes to multiple autoimmune diseases.</p><p>Due to EBV infection often taking place years before the onset of arthritis, we posit that latent EBV infection modulates the peripheral immune response in a manner that contributes to the development of RA. We suggest that latently EBV-infected B cells alter, either directly or indirectly, lymphocytes that go on to contribute to disease onset, likely through expanding and activating CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells and skewing toward a Th1 response. CD11c<sup>+</sup>CD8<sup>+</sup> DCs may play a role in priming the pathogenic CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell response, as they have been shown to cross-present antigen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">den Haan et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Schulz and Reis e Sousa, 2002</xref>). By acting as a mediator between infected cells and pathogenic T cells, ABCs are likely critical moderators in driving the heightened Th1 immune response to latent viral infection.</p><p>Accumulating evidence shows that ABCs are expanded in multiple autoimmune diseases and function pathogenically in mouse models of lupus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Rubtsov et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Thorarinsdottir et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Wang et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Claes et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Wang et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Zhang et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Rakhmanov et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Rubtsova et al., 2017</xref>). Precisely how ABCs are contributing to pathogenicity is unclear, and ABCs are known to display multiple functional capacities that could contribute to disease. In models of SLE, ABCs have been shown to secrete autoantibodies and compromise germinal center responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Zhang et al., 2019</xref>). Additionally, ABCs function as excellent antigen-presenting cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Rubtsov et al., 2015</xref>). In a model of SLE, the ablation of ABCs decreases activated CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells and IFNγ-CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Rubtsova et al., 2017</xref>). How precisely ABCs alter the CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell population, whether they are cross-presenting antigen or impacting the CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells indirectly, warrants further investigation. Alternatively, ABCs have been shown to secrete regulatory IL10 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Rubtsov et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hao et al., 2011</xref>), suggesting that a portion of the ABC population, in some individuals or contexts, could function in a protective manner. Further characterization of the phenotype and functional capacities of ABCs in autoimmune patients may help to elucidate their functional role. RA patients who experience a relapse following B cell-depletion therapy are more likely to display a reconstitution profile with increased numbers of memory B cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Leandro et al., 2006</xref>). Whether existing therapeutics, such as B cell-depletion therapies or other approved drugs for RA, such as Abatacept (CTLA4 Ig), impact the ABC repertoire remains unknown.</p><p>Further evaluation of the influence of viral infection on ABC pathogenicity is needed. It is intriguing that ABCs are pathogenic in a genetic model of SLE without the presence of a virus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Rubtsova et al., 2017</xref>), though we observe that latent γHV68 is necessary for the pathogenicity of ABCs in CIA. This discrepancy indicates that ABCs may be contributing to disease through various mechanisms or that different contexts can prime ABCs for pathogenicity. The role of ABCs in controlling viral infections is an ongoing topic of study, with multiple papers recently providing compelling evidence that ABCs are critical for an effective anti-influenza response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Johnson et al., 2020</xref>) and are required to control LCMV infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Barnett et al., 2016</xref>), in part through their secretion of antiviral IgG2a. Additionally, the influence of aging on ABC population and on autoimmunity development and progression warrants further study.</p><p>In summary, we have developed an in vivo model of EBV’s contribution to RA that recapitulates aspects of human disease. Further, we have examined the role of ABCs and found that they are critical mediators of the viral enhancement of arthritis.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Mice</title><p><italic>Tbx21<sup>fl/fl</sup>Cd19<sup>cre/+</sup></italic> mice were generated by crossing <italic>Tbx21<sup>fl/fl</sup>Cd19<sup>cre/+</sup></italic> and <italic>Tbx21<sup>fl/fl</sup>Cd19<sup>+/+</sup></italic> mice. <italic>Tbx21<sup>fl/fl</sup> and Cd19<sup>cre/+</sup></italic> mice were provided by Dr. Pippa Marrack (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Rubtsova et al., 2017</xref>).

I would like to list the essential reviews needed, and I'd like to invite the authors to address all the comments from the reviewers.</p><p>1. Statistics: please address all questions regarding statistical analyses raised by reviewer #1.</p><p>2. The authors need to explain upfront why they chose to use young mice for their study, instead of aged subjects.</p><p>3. Is the acute collagen injection reactivating γHV68? The authors assume that the immune responses are largely due to latent viral infection. However, can they rule out a virus reactivation due to the experimental model of CIA?</p><p>4. The title needs to be revised to more faithfully reflect the results presented – in particular, the role of ABC is not clear from the current title.</p><p>5. Most of the comparisons made (as presented in figure 4) compare the ACRTA-γHV68 CIA mice to γHV68 CIA mice – my question is – does the infection with the mutated γHV68 affect these parameters in comparison to CIA mice?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Following are a few comments that concern clarity and rigor of the data analysis and manuscript.</p><p>1. There are a number of concerns regarding the completeness and appropriateness of a number of statistical analyses.</p><p>a. Authors tend to use t-tests throughout the manuscript. T-tests are not appropriate if the data is not normally distributed. In general, a test for normality should be performed (e.g. Shapiro) and mentioned in legends and methods if t-test must be used. Alternatively, it is usually better to choose non-parametric tests (e.g. Wilcoxon or Mann-Whitney) which do not have such prerequisites for usage. Thus, the statistics should be reviewed carefully in any future submission.</p><p>b. Two-way ANOVA analysis does not seem to be appropriate for longitudinal data, such as in Figure 1A. Data analysis methods more suitable for time-lapse datasets, such as area under curve, should be used. In general, a more detailed description of statistical analyses and results used in the manuscript should be added – eg. F-values for ANOVA, etc.</p><p>c. In addition to a &quot;time-course&quot; analysis, end-point statistical test results should be provided for clinical score data – eg. Figure 1A.</p><p>d. Significance test results between CIA and ACRTA-γHV68 CIA mice should also be included in Figures 4B-I.</p><p>e. Significance of difference in clinical scores between CIA and γHV68-CIA in Figure 4A is significantly lower compared to that from Figure 1A. Can the authors comment on this?</p><p>2. The authors use very young mice (6-8 weeks) to study an age-related condition, RA. At that age, mice are barely sexually mature. This a a potential caveat/confound of the study and should be extensively discussed in the manuscript (for instance, discussing how studying the impact of latency in &gt;15 months old mice may alter conclusions).</p><p>3. Data from Figure 4A and Figure 4C do not seem to correlate: ACRTA-γHV68 CIA mice present with lower clinical scores compared to γHV68 CIA mice in Figure 4A, but spleen CD8<sup>+</sup> levels are elevated in ACRTA-γHV68 CIA mice relative to γHV68 CIA mice. Additionally, spleen CD8<sup>+</sup> proportions show greater variance in ACRTA-γHV68 CIA mice. Authors should discuss these points more extensively in the manuscript.</p><p>4. When comparing clinical score data from ABC Ctrl and KO mice, datasets from CIA and γHV68-CIA mice (e.g. Figure 6B and C) should be plotted together instead (or at least in an additional panel if needed). When needed, please note statistical tests should be corrected for multiple comparisons.</p><p>5. In the manuscript, authors state that no difference was observed between males and females in terms of effects of γHV68 on CIA progression. However, since it is well-known that women are significantly more likely to develop RA compared to men, authors should discuss how the findings from this study should be applied to future clinical studies. Additionally, in clinical score data from Supplementary Figure 1B, male mice seem to present with greater difference in clinical scores between CIA and 𝜸HV68-CIA mice compared to females. Comments on these observations should be added to the manuscript.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Regarding the role of 'latent' gammaherpesvirus:</p><p>1) The authors conclude that latent rather than acute EBV is responsible for exacerbating the symptoms of CIA and systematically modulating immune traits. However, the authors never assess whether the stress of collagen injection reactivates γHV68 (i.e. is there a spike in anti- γHV68 IgG?). The authors should check this or restate the conclusions regarding 'latent gammaherpesvirus' infection.</p><p>2) Along the previous comment, it is further not entirely clear how the authors executed their experiments with the acute strain ACRTA. The current methods are not detailed enough and should precisely state when the acute infection was performed/when infection is cleared. To demonstrate that acute infection is truly not modulating immune parameters or exacerbating disease symptoms, acute infection should have been performed at day 35 (depending on how long it takes to clear the pathogen) – is this the case?</p><p>Further clarification of immunological experimentation:</p><p>3) The authors should clarify why they analyzed certain cytokines, as an analysis of a broader set of cytokines would have been clearly valuable given our limited understanding of the role of chronic infections in shaping immune parameters.</p><p>4) The authors are overstating some of their findings given several non-significant reports (see comments below).</p><p>Title: needs be rephrased as it currently reads as if EBV benefits from the presence of ABCs.</p><p>Abstract:</p><p>Line 31/32: it remains unknown whether ABCs are directly stimulated by the virus infection or whether the presence of e.g. certain cytokines/immune cells due to infection are stimulating the appearance of ABCs. Thus &quot;infection stimulates ABCs&quot; should be rephrased as the authors do not provide evidence for a direct causation in their work.</p><p>Introduction:</p><p>Line 42-44: previous work stated in this line reports that RA patients have higher loads of EBV, indicating acute EBV in RA patients. Is anything known how often EBV shifts between lytic and latent stage in these patients?

To address this question, they used a mouse model where they monitored the severity of collagen-induced arthritis (CIA). They demonstrate that disease enhancement requires viral latency and that this enhancement is not due to active virus stimulation of the immune response. They investigated the association between age-associated B cells and the progression of arthritis. Using ABC knockout mice, they provided the first evidence that ABCs are mechanistically required for viral enhancement of disease, thereby establishing that latent gammaherpesvirus infection stimulates ABCs to provoke arthritis.</p><p>They used the C57Bl/6 mice model and infected them with EBV homolog, gHV68, waited 5 weeks for the lytic infection to clear thus, modeling the latent form of the infection. The induction of latency was used in three different scenarios: i) gHV68 only (latent); ii) collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) and; iii) the combination of gHV68 latent infection with CIA. They monitored the severity of the disease by redness and swelling in the hind two paws to inform a clinical score (scale of 0-4) and the δ of paw size. They observe that CIA in latent gHV68-infected mice has a more severe clinical course than uninfected mice and developed the onset of disease symptoms an average of seven days earlier than CIA-only mice. They also found that latent gHV68 infection did not affect autoantibody levels thus, latent gHV68 infection leads to the earlier onset and more severe CIA.</p><p>Next, the authors assessed the frequency of immune cells that infiltrates to the synovium (fluid in a specialized connective tissue) by flushing each joint with a buffer (PBS) and analyzing the composition using flow cytometry. The focus was on CD8<sup>+</sup> and CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell. They found that gHV68-CIA comprises 3.6-fold more CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell in gHV68-CIA mice compared to CIA only. They did not find any change in the proportion of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells. Moreover, they found a significant increase of Tbet (Th1 cell-specific transcription factor) in both CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> that is indicative to Th1 skewing and further tested the levels of IFNγ and IL-17.</p><p>They state that the results indicate that IFNγ-producing T cells are preferentially infiltrating the synovium of gHV68-CIA mice, and a skewing towards cytotoxic CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells in mice latently infected with gHV68 prior to CIA.</p><p>To assess if latent gHV68 infection skews the T cell response towards a pathogenic profile during CIA, the authors examined T cells in the spleen, inguinal/draining lymph nodes and found that gHV68-CIA mice display a decrease in the relative proportion of FoxP3+ Tregs and an increase in the relative proportion of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells in the spleen compared to control CIA mice. They show overall that the T cell profile of gHV68-CIA mice is skewed pathogenically, with decreased Tregs and increased cytotoxic T cells.</p><p>To demonstrates that infection with latent gHV68 is responsible for the enhancement of CIA and this is not due to innate immune stimulation during the acute infection the authors describe the response following the infection with a recombinant gHV68 strain that does not develop latency, namely, ACRTA-gHV68. They found that the immunological changes observed in gHV68-CIA mice, when compared to CIA mice, are absent in ACRTA-gHV68 CIA mice.</p><p>To investigate the role of age-associated B cells (ABCs) to facilitate the viral enhancement of CIA they studied the proportion and phenotype of ABCs in uninfected CIA mice and CIA mice previously infected with latent gHV68 (gHV68-CIA) by flow cytometry. These experiments indicate that ABCs in gHV68-CIA mice display a more pathogenic phenotype than those in CIA, with decreased expression of regulatory cytokine IL10 and inhibitory markers, and increased expression of IFNγ.</p><p>Moreover, they utilized ABC knock-out mice that harbor a B cell-specific Tbet deletion. Without ABCs, gHV68-CIA mice do not display clinical exacerbation, but rather appear similar to uninfected CIA mice in terms of disease severity and day of onset.</p><p>Overall, the authors show that:</p><p>– Infecting mice with latent gHV68 prior to CIA induction results in an immune course more similar to that of RA patients than CIA alone, and is a suitable model for examining the contribution of EBV to RA.</p><p>– Tbet+ B cells, known as age-associated B cells, are critical for this CIA exacerbation</p><p>The author suggests that:</p><p>– Latently EBV-infected B cells alter, either directly or indirectly, lymphocytes that go on to contribute to disease onset, likely through expanding and activating CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells and skewing towards a Th1 response.</p><p>The manuscript is written well and the read flows.

The authors use two models: a murine model of rheumatoid arthritis (CIA), and a murine analog of human EBV: γHV68. The use of these two models allows the investigation of how latent viral infection exacerbates the autoimmune condition via the action of a special class of B cells: Age-associated B cells.</p><p>While all three reviewers recognise the potential of this work, an essential revision is needed before this work can be considered acceptable for publication in eLife.

There are a number of concerns regarding the completeness and appropriateness of a number of statistical analyses.</p><p>a. Authors tend to use t-tests throughout the manuscript. T-tests are not appropriate if the data is not normally distributed. In general, a test for normality should be performed (e.g. Shapiro) and mentioned in legends and methods if t-test must be used. Alternatively, it is usually better to choose non-parametric tests (e.g. Wilcoxon or Mann-Whitney) which do not have such prerequisites for usage. Thus, the statistics should be reviewed carefully in any future submission.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for pointing this out. We have changed t-tests to Mann-Whitney tests throughout the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>b. Two-way ANOVA analysis does not seem to be appropriate for longitudinal data, such as in Figure 1A. Data analysis methods more suitable for time-lapse datasets, such as area under curve, should be used. In general, a more detailed description of statistical analyses and results used in the manuscript should be added – eg. F-values for ANOVA, etc.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for these helpful suggestions. We have added area under the curve values for each individual mouse to supplementary figure 1. We have also re-run ANOVAs to account for multiple comparisons and have added F-values to the figure descriptions for all ANOVA tests throughout the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>c. In addition to a &quot;time-course&quot; analysis, end-point statistical test results should be provided for clinical score data – eg. Figure 1A.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this suggestion, we have added both endpoint and cumulative clinical scores to the supplement.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>d.

Significance of difference in clinical scores between CIA and γHV68-CIA in Figure 4A is significantly lower compared to that from Figure 1A. Can the authors comment on this?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for pointing this out. We have revised the statistical tests to account for multiple comparisons and now find that the differences to be the same between Figure 4A and Figure 1A.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. The authors use very young mice (6-8 weeks) to study an age-related condition, RA. At that age, mice are barely sexually mature. This a a potential caveat/confound of the study and should be extensively discussed in the manuscript (for instance, discussing how studying the impact of latency in &gt;15 months old mice may alter conclusions).</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your concern. The role of age and time between infection and disease onset is something we discuss extensively in our group. In modeling disease associated with EBV, we need to take into consideration that over 95% of EBV infections take place in childhood, adolescence, and early adulthood (before 20 years of age). Prevalence of RA increases with age, typically occurs after the age of EBV infection during middle-age, roughly between 30-60. It is always difficult to make precise age comparisons between different species, especially mice and humans, but general age comparisons can be made. For mice, adolescence and early adulthood is modelled in immunologically and sexually mature mice between 6-8 weeks of age. We make it a practice to only use the fully developed mice. CIA induction takes place 5 weeks post-infection when the mice are well into adulthood. So these are not “very young mice.” We have added this sentence to the introduction to further clarify: “EBV primary infection generally takes place in childhood or adolescence(6,7) and RA can occur at any age, though the mean incidence occurs during middle-age(23). Accordingly, we have infected immunologically and sexually mature 6-8-week-old C57BL/6J mice with γHV68 and have induced CIA when the mice are adults at 11-13 weeks old.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. Data from Figure 4A and Figure 4C do not seem to correlate: ACRTA-γHV68 CIA mice present with lower clinical scores compared to γHV68 CIA mice in Figure 4A, but spleen CD8<sup>+</sup> levels are elevated in ACRTA-γHV68 CIA mice relative to γHV68 CIA mice. Additionally, spleen CD8<sup>+</sup> proportions show greater variance in ACRTA-γHV68 CIA mice. Authors should discuss these points more extensively in the manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate this observation. While there may be higher proportions of CD8 T cells in ACRTA-γHV68, they express significantly less IFNγ (Figure 4E), reflecting altered functional capacity and possibly specificity. We have added this to the text (line 298).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. When comparing clinical score data from ABC Ctrl and KO mice, datasets from CIA and γHV68-CIA mice (e.g. Figure 6B and C) should be plotted together instead (or at least in an additional panel if needed). When needed, please note statistical tests should be corrected for multiple comparisons.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for pointing this out, we have added an additional panel that displays all datasets together (Figure 6D).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. In the manuscript, authors state that no difference was observed between males and females in terms of effects of γHV68 on CIA progression. However, since it is well-known that women are significantly more likely to develop RA compared to men, authors should discuss how the findings from this study should be applied to future clinical studies. Additionally, in clinical score data from Supplementary Figure 1B, male mice seem to present with greater difference in clinical scores between CIA and 𝜸HV68-CIA mice compared to females. Comments on these observations should be added to the manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>While prevalence of RA occurs to a greater extent in women, in CIA induction in mice there is no sex prevalence. As an induced model, it likely breaks through some of the sex related susceptibility/resistance. Similarly, CIA has little association to age. We highlight in the text that this is in line with previous findings: “In agreement with other research groups(22), male and female mice displayed similar clinical scores during CIA and we also do not observe a sex difference in γHV68-CIA mice (Figure 1—figure supplement 1E)” (line 146).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>Regarding the role of 'latent' gammaherpesvirus:</p><p>1) The authors conclude that latent rather than acute EBV is responsible for exacerbating the symptoms of CIA and systematically modulating immune traits. However, the authors never assess whether the stress of collagen injection reactivates γHV68 (i.e. is there a spike in anti- γHV68 IgG?). The authors should check this or restate the conclusions regarding 'latent gammaherpesvirus' infection.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this suggestion. We now provide qPCR data that demonstrates that the viral load is not elevated in γHV68-CIA mice (Figure 1 —figure supplement 1I). These results and methods have been added to the supplementary materials and we have added these sentences to the text: “Additionally, we find that inducing CIA in γHV68-infected mice does not impact viral load (Figure 1—figure supplement 1I), indicating that γHV68 is not reactivating. These findings are in line with our previous work showing that latent γHV68 infection enhances EAE without influencing autoantibody levels or reactivating γHV68(18)” (line 159).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Along the previous comment, it is further not entirely clear how the authors executed their experiments with the acute strain ACRTA. The current methods are not detailed enough and should precisely state when the acute infection was performed/when infection is cleared. To demonstrate that acute infection is truly not modulating immune parameters or exacerbating disease symptoms, acute infection should have been performed at day 35 (depending on how long it takes to clear the pathogen) – is this the case?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you, we apologize for this oversight. We have added further details to the Results section to clarify, which now reads: “In ACRTA-γHV68 the genes responsible for latency are deleted and a lytic gene, RTA, is constitutively expressed, resulting in clearance of the acute virus by day 14 post-infection(48). We infected mice with ACRTA-γHV68, waited 35 days for clearance of the acute infection, and induced CIA” (line 287).</p><p>To the methods we have added: “On day 35 post-γHV68 or ACRTA-γHV68 infection, CIA was induced by injection of immunization-grade, chick type II collagen emulsified in complete Freund’s adjuvant (CFA, Chondrex, Inc) intradermally at the base of the tail, followed by a booster injection of the same emulsion on day 14, as adapted from(59)” (line 538)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Further clarification of immunological experimentation:</p><p>3) The authors should clarify why they analyzed certain cytokines, as an analysis of a broader set of cytokines would have been clearly valuable given our limited understanding of the role of chronic infections in shaping immune parameters.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that examining a wider array of cytokines would be valuable. Our initial approach was to focus our examination on immediately relevant cytokines from our previous work where we show altered chronic disease during latent γHV68 infection. We are currently following up on these findings with a broader examination of the cytokine expression profile.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The authors are overstating some of their findings given several non-significant reports (see comments below).</p><p>Title: needs be rephrased as it currently reads as if EBV benefits from the presence of ABCs</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for pointing this out.

Thus &quot;infection stimulates ABCs&quot; should be rephrased as the authors do not provide evidence for a direct causation in their work.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for pointing this out, this sentence has been rephrased (line 33).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Introduction:</p><p>Line 42-44: previous work stated in this line reports that RA patients have higher loads of EBV, indicating acute EBV in RA patients. Is anything known how often EBV shifts between lytic and latent stage in these patients? And how does it relate to what the authors conclude in their current work?</p></disp-quote><p>In Balandraud et al., the researchers measured EBV DNA and this does not indicate replicating or lytic virus, just overall more virus. The reactivation dynamics and reasons for increased viral load in RA patients are not well understood. It most likely reflects that more cells retain latent virus either through the initial infection or subsequent reactivations with return to latency. The measured increase in virus likely reflects a latent state as patients retain a strong T cell and antibody response to the virus. Lytic infection from reactivation would be quickly controlled. In our work, we observe no reactivation of γHV68 during induction or maintenance of CIA here and in our previous EAE work. The act of maintaining latency is sufficient to induce heightened disease. Likewise, in our EAE work, we have observed that acute infection protects/delays from disease induction.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 47-50: for a better reading flow this should be moved after the sentence in line 42.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this helpful suggestion, we have made the suggested change (line 45).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 52-55: references should be added.</p></disp-quote><p>Added (line 55).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 55: was this examined during an active or chronic EBV infection?</p></disp-quote><p>Unfortunately, the referenced manuscript does not examine EBV infection at this level.

We have reworded this sentence as “Further, fewer splenic ABCs in γHV68-CIA mice express inhibitory receptors CTLA4, PDL1, and PD1 (Figure 5D-F), and thus ABCs in CIA display a more regulatory phenotype than those in γHV68-CIA mice” (line 362).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 285-287: authors need to give more insights why certain parameters were examined.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this observation.

We have added this to the list of attributes that γHV68 shares with EBV in the intro, which now reads: “γHV68 is a natural pathogen that is a well-established and widely-used murine model of EBV infection that shares an array of characteristics with human EBV infection, including latent persistence in B cells, viral reactivation from latency, a potent CD8 T cell response, and immune evasion tactics(19,20)” (line 82). As per ACRTA-γHV68, we have added the sentence: “In ACRTA-γHV68 the genes responsible for latency are deleted and a lytic gene, RTA, is constitutively expressed, resulting in clearance of the acute virus by day 14(48)” (line 287).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>[…] I have several comments/revisions/corrections and questions regarding the data:</p><p>– Line 70: missing space between the letter &quot;a&quot; and the abbreviation &quot;gHV68&quot;</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you, corrected (line 102).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Line 80: typo is the mouse strain – written &quot;C7Bl/6&quot; and should be &quot;C57Bl/6&quot;</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you, corrected (line 122).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Line 86:- &quot;The role of B cells the contribution of EBV to RA is intriguing…&quot;, correct the grammar.</p></disp-quote><p>Corrected, thank you (line 128).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Line 94: In line 63 the abbreviation &quot;lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV)&quot; was defined so when mentioning it the second time it should state the abbreviation and not the full name.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you, corrected (line 116).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Line 146: The authors state that &quot;Synovial cells were not collected from naïve or gHV68-infected mice without CIA because we would not expect there to be sufficient infiltration of immune cells for analysis&quot;.
