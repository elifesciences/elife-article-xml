However, behavioral states such as foraging or courtship typically persist over long time scales to ensure proper execution. It remains unclear how neural circuits generate persistent behavioral states while maintaining the flexibility to select among alternative states when the sensory context changes. Here, we elucidate the functional architecture of a neural circuit controlling the choice between roaming and dwelling states, which underlie exploration and exploitation during foraging in <italic>C. elegans</italic>. By imaging ensemble-level neural activity in freely moving animals, we identify stereotyped changes in circuit activity corresponding to each behavioral state. Combining circuit-wide imaging with genetic analysis, we find that mutual inhibition between two antagonistic neuromodulatory systems underlies the persistence and mutual exclusivity of the neural activity patterns observed in each state. Through machine learning analysis and circuit perturbations, we identify a sensory processing neuron that can transmit information about food odors to both the roaming and dwelling circuits and bias the animal towards different states in different sensory contexts, giving rise to context-appropriate state transitions. Our findings reveal a potentially general circuit architecture that enables flexible, sensory-driven control of persistent behavioral states.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>behavioral states</kwd><kwd>neuromodulation</kwd><kwd>foraging</kwd><kwd>neural circuits</kwd><kwd>sensorimotor</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>C. elegans</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01NS104892</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Flavell</surname><given-names>Steven W</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>IOS 1845663</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Flavell</surname><given-names>Steven W</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DUE 1734870</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Flavell</surname><given-names>Steven W</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100007457</institution-id><institution>JPB Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PIIF</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Flavell</surname><given-names>Steven W</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100007457</institution-id><institution>JPB Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PNDRF</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Flavell</surname><given-names>Steven W</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000874</institution-id><institution>Brain and Behavior Research Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NARSAD Young Investigator Award</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Flavell</surname><given-names>Steven W</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100005270</institution-id><institution>McKnight Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>McKnight Scholars Award</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Flavell</surname><given-names>Steven W</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund8"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100007457</institution-id><institution>JPB Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Picower Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ji</surname><given-names>Ni</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund9"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000879</institution-id><institution>Alfred P.

In contrast to fast motor actions, behavioral states are often highly stable, lasting from minutes to hours. Despite this remarkable stability, animals can flexibly choose their behavioral state based on the sensory context and switch states when the context changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Andalman et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Clowney et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hoopfer et al., 2015</xref>). How the brain generates persistent behavioral states while maintaining the flexibility to select among alternative states is not well understood.</p><p>At the neural level, persistent behavioral states are often associated with stable patterns of neural activity. For example, continuous activation of pCd neurons in male <italic>Drosophila</italic> underlies persistent courtship and aggressive behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Jung et al., 2020</xref>). In addition, recent large-scale recordings of neural activity have revealed that behavioral states such as sleep and active locomotion are represented as stable, stereotyped activity patterns in neurons spanning multiple brain regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Nichols et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Andalman et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dunn et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kato et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Marques et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Musall et al., 2019</xref>). While the encoding of a behavioral state can be broadly distributed, the neurons that control the onset and duration of a state are often a smaller subset of those that comprise the full circuit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Andalman et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cho and Sternberg, 2014</xref>). To gain mechanistic insights into how persistent behavioral states are generated and controlled, it will be critical to elucidate the functional interactions among key control neurons and understand how they incorporate incoming sensory inputs that influence behavioral states.</p><p>Past studies have proposed recurrent circuitry and neuromodulation as two central mechanisms that contribute to the generation of persistent behavioral states. While theoretical studies have shown that recurrent excitatory or inhibitory feedback can underlie stable firing patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Machens et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Major and Tank, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Seung, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Wang, 2001</xref>), direct experimental evidence linking recurrent circuitry with persistent activity during minutes-long behavioral states remains scarce (the role of recurrent inhibition in fast timescale switching is better established <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Wang, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Roberts et al., 2016</xref>). Neuromodulators are known to control persistent behaviors like sleep and wake states, as well as states of stress and hunger (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bargmann, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Marder, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Saper et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Seo et al., 2019</xref>). However, our understanding of how ongoing neuromodulator release in vivo promotes persistent circuit activity remains limited. In addition, it is unclear how dynamic sensory inputs interact with recurrent circuitry and neuromodulation to elicit behavioral state transitions in a changing sensory environment.</p><p>In this study, we investigate the neural circuit mechanisms that give rise to circuit-level activity patterns during persistent foraging states in <italic>C. elegans</italic>. While foraging on bacterial food, <italic>C. elegans</italic> alternate between roaming states, characterized by high-speed forward movement and occasional reorientations, and dwelling states, marked by slow forward and backward movements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Ben Arous et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fujiwara et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Flavell et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kim and Flavell, 2020</xref>). Each state can last up to tens of minutes and the transitions between states are abrupt. The fraction of time an animal spends in each state is influenced by its satiety, ingestion of bacterial food, and sensory cues such as odors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Ben Arous et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fujiwara et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chew et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Shtonda and Avery, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Rhoades et al., 2019</xref>). Consistent with the notion that these states reflect an exploration-exploitation tradeoff, animals favor dwelling in food-rich environments and after starvation, but favor roaming in poor-quality food environments and after aversive stimulation.</p><p>We and others previously found that serotonin (5-HT) and the neuropeptide pigment-dispersing factor (PDF) act as opposing neuromodulators that stabilize dwelling and roaming states, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Rhoades et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Choi et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Flavell et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Sawin et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Iwanir et al., 2016</xref>). Serotonin acts through the serotonin-gated chloride channel MOD-1 to promote dwelling, with a smaller contribution from the other serotonin receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Flavell et al., 2013</xref>). PDF-1 and â2 neuropeptides act through a single PDF receptor, PDFR-1, to drive roaming (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Flavell et al., 2013</xref>). Cell-specific genetic perturbations uncovered the neurons that produce and detect these neuromodulators to control the stability of each behavioral state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Flavell et al., 2013</xref>). However, these identified neurons are densely interconnected with one another and with other neurons in the <italic>C. elegans</italic> connectome, making it infeasible to infer the core functional circuitry that shapes the roaming and dwelling states from these previous genetic studies. Crucially, it remains unclear how 5-HT and PDF impact overall circuit activity to promote persistent behavioral states. In addition, while it is known that the sensory environment can influence roaming and dwelling, how sensory inputs converge onto this core neuromodulatory circuit to influence behavioral states remains an open question.</p><p>To address these questions, we performed simultaneous calcium imaging of defined neurons throughout the roaming-dwelling circuit in freely moving animals. We identified stereotyped, circuit activity patterns corresponding to each foraging state. By combining circuit imaging with genetic perturbations, we identified a mutual inhibitory loop between the serotonergic NSM neuron and the 5-HT and PDF target neurons. We found that this mutual inhibition is critical for the persistence and mutual exclusivity of the neural activity patterns observed during roaming and dwelling. Furthermore, we found that the AIA sensory processing neuron sends parallel outputs to both neuromodulatory systems and can bias the circuit towards either roaming or dwelling, depending on the overall sensory context. Together, these results identify a functional circuit architecture that allows for flexible, sensory-driven control of persistent behavioral states.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Roaming and dwelling states are associated with stereotyped changes in circuit activity</title><p>To understand how roaming and dwelling states arise from circuit-level interactions between neurons, we sought to monitor the activity of neurons throughout the core roaming-dwelling circuit in wild-type animals and additionally during perturbations that alter signaling among the neurons. We built a calcium imaging platform with a closed-loop tracking system that allows for simultaneous imaging of many neurons as animals freely move (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1A-B</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Faumont and Lockery, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Nguyen et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Venkatachalam et al., 2016</xref>).

Roaming animals travel at high speed in forward runs that are punctuated by long, high-speed reversals, which change the animalâs heading direction. To determine how neural activity in the roaming-dwelling circuit encodes locomotion parameters and/or behavioral states, we first examined whether each neuronâs activity was associated with the animalâs axial velocity (i.e. velocity projected along the body axis), axial speed, movement direction (forward or reverse) or foraging state (roaming or dwelling; a Hidden Markov Model used to segment roaming and dwelling states is described in the Methods; see also <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1âfigure supplement 4</xref>). Six of the 10 recorded neurons displayed calcium levels that correlated with axial velocity and movement direction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1DâE</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1âfigure supplement 5A</xref>). Consistent with previous reports, we observed that the PDF-1-expressing neuron AVB and PDFR-1-expressing neurons AIY and RIB, known to promote forward runs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kato et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Roberts et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Li et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Tsalik and Hobert, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gray et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Luo et al., 2014</xref>), exhibited increased activity during forward runs, while the premotor neuron AVA, known to promote reversals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kato et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Roberts et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Luo et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chalfie et al., 1985</xref>), exhibited heightened activity during reversals. A partially overlapping group of neurons, including the serotonergic neuron NSM, displayed activity that co-varied with animal speed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1âfigure supplement 5A</xref>). Moreover, we found that nine of the ten recorded neurons exhibited changes in activity as animals transitioned between roaming and dwelling states (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1DâE</xref>). Interestingly, almost all neurons whose activity correlated with axial velocity and/or movement direction, in particular AVB, AIY, RIB, and AVA, exhibited reduced activity during dwelling, compared to roaming (overall and/or surrounding moments of state transitions; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1DâE</xref>). This observation is consistent with the known roles of these neurons in driving locomotion, insofar as locomotion is reduced during dwelling. These effects can also be clearly detected when comparing the joint activity distributions of forward- and reverse-active neurons during roaming versus dwelling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s6">Figure 1âfigure supplement 6</xref>). In contrast, the serotonergic neuron NSM was more active during dwelling. Together, these data reveal that changes in the roaming/dwelling state of the animal are accompanied by changes in the activities of multiple neurons, including NSM and a set of neurons that have previously been shown to control forward and reverse locomotion.</p><p>The encoding of locomotion and behavioral state across many neurons suggests a circuit-level representation of the animalâs behavior. To test whether the dominant modes of activity in the circuit were associated with the animalâs behavior, we performed Principal Component Analysis (PCA) using the activity profiles of all the recorded neurons. Indeed, the top two principal components (PC1 and PC2), which together explained 44% of the total variance, exhibited clear behavioral correlates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1FâG</xref>). Neural activity along PC1 was coupled to the animalâs forward and reverse locomotion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>), while activity along PC2 was coupled to the animalâs axial speed and foraging state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). PC1 consisted of positive contributions from forward-run-active neurons (e.g. AVB, AIY, RIB, and RME), a negative contribution from the reversal-active neuron AVA, and almost no contribution from the serotonergic neuron NSM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s7">Figure 1âfigure supplement 7</xref>). These results provide a clear match to our single-neuron analyses above and suggest that PC1 primarily encodes movement direction. In contrast, PC2 consisted of a strong positive contribution from NSM, which is active at low speeds, and negative contributions from both forward-run- and reversal-active neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s7">Figure 1âfigure supplement 7</xref>). These results are also consistent with our single neuron analyses and suggest that PC2, which primarily encodes dwelling, is associated with elevated NSM activity and decreased activity in the forward-run- and reversal-active neurons. These results indicate that the main modes of dynamics in this circuit are associated with the animalâs movement direction and foraging state.</p><p>Finally, to test whether neural activity in the roaming-dwelling circuit was sufficient to accurately predict behavior, we trained statistical models to predict animal velocity and behavioral state from neural activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1HâI</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s8">Figure 1âfigure supplement 8</xref>). A nonlinear regression model was able to predict animal velocity from concurrent neural activity data with a high degree of accuracy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>). This observation provides a rough match to a previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hallinen et al., 2021</xref>) and is consistent with the known roles of several of these neurons in controlling velocity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kato et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Wang, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Roberts et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Li et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Luo et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chalfie et al., 1985</xref>). In addition, a logistic regression model trained to predict the roaming and dwelling state achieved over 95 % accuracy when using activity from all 10 neurons, and exhibited classification accuracy significantly above baseline when using data from only NSM or the roaming-active neurons AIY, RIB, and AVB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref>). Thus, ongoing neural activity in the roaming-dwelling circuit can predict the animalâs locomotion and foraging state. This robust mapping between circuit activity and behavior raised the possibility that stable activation of one or more neurons in this circuit might underlie persistent roaming and dwelling states.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Persistent NSM activation and associated circuit activity changes correspond to the dwelling state</title><p>Among the neurons recorded, the serotonergic neuron NSM was unique in that its persistent activation was closely aligned to the dwelling state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1DâE</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1âfigure supplement 5</xref>). NSM activity was increased during dwelling as compared to roaming, resulting in a negative correlation with animal speed, which differs across the two states (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). However, NSM activity was not correlated with speed within the roaming state and it was not associated with movement direction during any state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">1DâE</xref>). An increase in NSM activity consistently preceded dwelling, with an average latency of 23 s (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2BâC</xref>). Dwelling states frequently ended with a decrease in NSM activity, though with a more variable latency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1A</xref>). Across wild-type animals, the durations of individual dwelling states were positively correlated with the durations of co-occurring bouts of NSM activity, which both typically lasted many minutes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). Together, these observations indicate that NSM displays persistent dwelling state-associated neural activity.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Persistent NSM activity is associated with the dwelling state.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Joint distribution of NSM activity and the concurrent axial velocity during the dwelling (left column) or the roaming (right column) state.

To further explore this possibility, we examined how circuit activity evolved in PC space during periods of NSM activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2EâF</xref>). NSM activity serves as a major component of PC2 and is only weakly represented on PC1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s7">Figure 1âfigure supplement 7</xref>). As a result, high and low NSM activity segregates well along PC2, but not PC1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1B</xref>). By aligning circuit activity to the onset of NSM activity bouts and projecting the activity in PC space, we found that NSM activation often began when circuit activity was in the region of the PC space with high PC1 activity and low PC2 activity, typical of forward locomotion during roaming (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>, compare with <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). As NSM became active, circuit activity rose rapidly along PC2 and stayed within the positive half of PC2 (a region typically associated with low speed and dwelling; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1FâG</xref>). Afterwards, circuit activity slowly traveled towards low values of both PC1 and PC2 (a region typically associated with reversals; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). This observation suggests that the persistent activation of NSM during dwelling is associated with stereotyped changes in overall circuit dynamics. To test whether NSM activation was sufficient to drive these changes in circuit dynamics, we stimulated NSM using the red-shifted opsin Chrimson while imaging circuit activity. Indeed, optogenetic stimulation of NSM (performed at a low all-trans-retinal (ATR) concentration to avoid background activation; see Materials and methods) inhibited the activity of the roaming-active neurons AVB, AIY, and RIB and led to a decrease in animal speed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>). These effects were largely abolished in mutants lacking the 5-HT-gated chloride channel <italic>mod-1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1C</xref>), consistent with previous reports that the <italic>mod-1</italic> receptor is critical for 5-HT-induced locomotion changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Flavell et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Sawin et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Iwanir et al., 2016</xref>). Taken together, these results indicate that NSM activation is associated with and can drive, at least in part, stereotyped changes in circuit activity characteristic of the dwelling state.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Persistent activity in serotonergic NSM neurons requires feedback from its target neurons that express the MOD-1 serotonin receptor</title><p>Our analyses of wild-type circuit dynamics revealed that stereotyped changes in circuit activity are associated with the roaming and dwelling states. We next examined how these neural dynamics are influenced by neuromodulatory connections embedded in the circuit. Although the 5-HT and PDF systems are known to act in opposition to regulate roaming and dwelling behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Flavell et al., 2013</xref>), it is not known how these neuromodulators impact circuit dynamics. To address this question, we imaged neural activity in mutants deficient in 5-HT signaling, PDF signaling, or both (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref>). Mutants that disrupt 5-HT signaling, such as those lacking a key enzyme for serotonin biosynthesis (<italic>tph-1</italic>) or a 5-HT-gated chloride channel (<italic>mod-1</italic>), exhibited a decrease in time spent in the dwelling state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3AâB</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3âfigure supplement 2</xref>), consistent with previous results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Flavell et al., 2013</xref>). In wild-type animals, NSM activity was strongly associated with reduced speed, but this relationship was attenuated in <italic>tph-1</italic> and <italic>mod-1</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). Surprisingly, we also found that the durations of the NSM activity bouts, which were minutes-long in wild-type animals, were dramatically shortened in these mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). This resulted in a significant decrease in the fraction of time that NSM is active in the mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). These results indicate that 5-HT signaling is required to sustain the activity of the serotonergic neuron NSM. Because MOD-1 is an inhibitory 5-HT-gated chloride channel, the <italic>mod-1</italic>-expressing neurons are relieved from inhibition by 5-HT in <italic>mod-1</italic> mutants. Thus, the decrease in NSM activity in these mutants suggests an inhibitory role for the <italic>mod-1</italic>-expressing neurons in regulating NSM activity. Previous work has shown that <italic>mod-1</italic> functions in the neurons AIY, RIF, and ASI to promote dwelling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Flavell et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Since none of these neurons directly synapse onto NSM, they must functionally inhibit NSM through a polysynaptic route or via the release of a neuromodulator. To directly test whether activation of these neurons inhibits NSM, we activated the <italic>mod-1</italic>-expressing neurons with Chrimson while recording NSM activity. We delivered the optogenetic stimuli specifically when NSM activity was high and observed a sustained inhibition of NSM activity throughout the stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). Together, these results indicate that the serotonergic NSM neuron promotes its own activity via mutual inhibition with neurons expressing the inhibitory 5-HT receptor MOD-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Serotonin signaling promotes persistent activation of serotonergic NSM neurons via a mutual inhibitory circuit.</title><p>(<bold>AâB</bold>) Example circuit-wide calcium imaging datasets from <italic>tph-1</italic> (<bold>A</bold>) and <italic>mod-1</italic> (<bold>B</bold>) mutant animals, shown as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>.

This mutual exclusivity was strongly disrupted in <italic>pdfr-1</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4CâD</xref>). In addition, an analysis of graded AVB activity changes during periods of NSM activation confirmed that the overall decrease in AVB activity during periods of high NSM activity was disrupted in <italic>pdfr-1</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4âfigure supplement 2</xref>).

Positive correlations also appeared between NSM and other roaming-active neurons, including the <italic>pdfr-1</italic>-expressing neurons AIY and RIB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4âfigure supplement 3</xref>). This increased co-activity of NSM and AVB was observed when using multiple distinct GCaMP normalization methods and when sampling from matched speed distributions in wild-type and mutant animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4âfigure supplement 4</xref>).

One likely explanation for this behavioral phenotype is that ectopic co-activation of NSM and the roaming-active neurons results in mixed behavioral outputs that differ from either roaming or dwelling. These findings indicate that PDF signaling is required for the neural circuit to maintain mutual exclusivity between NSM and the locomotion-controlling neurons that are active during roaming.</p><p>In contrast to the <italic>tph-1</italic> animals, NSM activity bouts in <italic>pdfr-1</italic> mutants were more persistent than they were in wild-type animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4EâF</xref>). This result suggests that PDF signaling plays an important role in suppressing NSM activity. Consistent with this interpretation, constitutive activation of PDFR-1 signaling, via expression of the hyperactive PDFR-1 effector ACY-1(P260S) in the <italic>pdfr-1</italic>-expressing neurons, strongly inhibited NSM activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4EâF</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4âfigure supplement 4B</xref>).

Therefore, the functional circuit architecture revealed through our calcium imaging analyses raised the possibility that incoming sensory inputs that act on the MOD-1- and PDFR-1-expressing neurons might influence the transitions between roaming and dwelling. One prediction of this hypothesis is that these neurons that receive sensory inputs may display stereotyped activity patterns prior to state transitions.</p><p>To test the above hypothesis, we sought to predict state transitions from the circuit-wide activity patterns that precede them. Our calcium imaging results showed that the onset of NSM activity reliably coincided with the onset of dwelling states (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B and C</xref>). We thus focused on uncovering potential circuit elements that function upstream of NSM to drive the roaming-to-dwelling transition. We adopted a supervised machine learning approach by training a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) classifier to predict NSM activation using the preceding multi-dimensional activity profile from all other neurons imaged (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5AâB</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplement 1</xref>; see Materials and methods).

Successfully trained networks consistently employed a convolutional filter where the largest positive weights were associated with the sensory processing neuron AIA and the largest negative weights were linked to RIB and AVA, which promote forward and reverse movement, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). These weights suggest that NSM activation is most likely to occur following increased activity in AIA and decreased activity in RIB and AVA. Withholding AIA, RIB, and AVA from the training data abolished the predictive power of the trained network, while withholding AIA activity alone also led to a significant reduction in test accuracy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5âfigure supplement 2B</xref>). Moreover, networks trained on the activities of only AIA, RIB, and AVA performed nearly as well as those trained on all the neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5âfigure supplement 2B</xref>). Training a CNN classifier to directly predict dwelling state onset from all of the neurons except NSM led to a similar convolutional filter; including NSM in the training data yielded a classifier that predicts dwelling state onset solely using NSM activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5âfigure supplement 3A</xref>).

The resulting convolutional kernels displayed strong positive weight on AVB and RIB. Strong negative weight on NSM was also a feature of the convolutional kernel predicting roaming state onset. These results are consistent with the mutual inhibitory loop described above and suggest that activation of the AVB and other roaming-active neurons, concurrent with NSM inactivation, predicts dwelling-to-roaming transitions.</p><p>Given that AIA, RIB, and AVA activities could predict the onset of NSM activity and dwelling states, we next examined how the activities of these neurons changed during transitions from roaming to dwelling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5CâG</xref>). During roaming, AIA activity was positively correlated with that of forward run-promoting neurons, such as RIB, and negatively correlated with the reversal-promoting neuron AVA. Within 30 s of NSM activation, AIA often exhibited a further increase in activity, while RIB and AVA activity stayed at similar levels or decreased. As NSM activity rose and the animal entered the dwelling state, RIB and AVA activity declined sharply while AIA became correlated with NSM. AIA then declined to baseline over the following minutes. Thus, AIA activity co-varies with the forward-active neurons during roaming and with NSM at the onset of dwelling. This native activity pattern is consistent with the convolutional kernel from the CNN classifier, where heightened activity of AIA relative to the locomotion-promoting neurons RIB and AVA predicts NSM activation. Together, these results reveal a stereotyped, multi-neuron activity pattern that predicts NSM activation.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>AIA activation can elicit both roaming and dwelling states</title><p>Because AIA activity co-varied with both roaming- and dwelling-active neurons and was required for the prediction of NSM activation, we hypothesized that AIA might play an active role in controlling the transitions between roaming and dwelling.

Circuit-wide calcium imaging during roaming and dwelling identified several neurons whose activities differ between the two states, most notably the serotonergic NSM neuron that displays long bouts of activity during dwelling and inactivity during roaming. By combining circuit imaging with genetic perturbations, we found that mutual inhibition between the serotonergic NSM neuron and the 5-HT and PDF target neurons promotes the stability and mutual exclusivity of the neural activity patterns observed during roaming and dwelling. Furthermore, we found that the AIA sensory processing neuron that responds to food odors sends parallel outputs to both neuromodulatory systems and biases the network towards different states in different sensory contexts. This circuit architecture allows <italic>C. elegans</italic> to exhibit persistent roaming and dwelling states, while flexibly switching between them depending on the sensory context.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Neural circuit mechanisms that generate persistent behavioral states</title><p>The recordings in this study provide new insights into how neural activity changes as animals switch between stable, alternative behavioral states. Previous work had shown that 5-HT and PDF were critical for dwelling and roaming behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Flavell et al., 2013</xref>), but how they impact circuit activity was not known. We found that NSM displayed long bouts of activity during dwelling and was inactive during roaming. In addition, several neurons that were previously shown to drive forward and reverse movement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kato et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Wang, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Roberts et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Li et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Luo et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chalfie et al., 1985</xref>), including the PDF-producing neuron AVB, were more active during roaming than they were during dwelling. However, whereas NSM displayed long bouts of persistent activity during dwelling, the locomotion neurons displayed fast timescale dynamics associated with forward and reverse movements during roaming, matching their previously described roles in controlling locomotion. <italic>tph-1</italic> mutants that lack 5-HT had an imbalance in the winner-take-all dynamics of this circuit, such that NSM activity was less persistent. <italic>pdfr-1</italic> mutants that lack PDF signaling displayed ectopic co-activation of NSM neurons along with AVB and other roaming-active neurons, as well as exaggerated persistence in NSM. These results suggest that neuromodulation is critical to establish the overall structure of circuit-level activity. Our data also suggest that there is mutual inhibition between NSM and the neurons that express MOD-1 (an inhibitory 5-HT receptor) and PDFR-1. The MOD-1- and PDFR-1-expressing neurons, which are more active during roaming, synapse onto the PDF-producing neuron AVB that is also more active during roaming, suggesting that they excite AVB. Thus, although NSM and AVB display mutually exclusive high activity states and produce opposing neuromodulators, they do not have direct connections with one another, as is typical in a flip-flop switch. Instead, they coordinate their activities by both interacting with the same network of neurons that expresses the 5-HT and PDF receptors. This architecture might allow for more flexible regulation of behavioral state switching.</p><p>The circuit states that correspond to roaming and dwelling differ in several respects. Dwelling states are characterized by persistent activity in serotonergic NSM neurons and reduced activity in several, but not all, locomotion-associated neurons. NSM activation always occurred within seconds of dwelling state onset and persisted for minutes, though NSM inactivation in some cases occurred one or two minutes from roaming state onsets. It is unclear whether this variable time lag involves the perdurance of 5-HT in extracellular space or other effects. Previous work has identified sub-modes of dwelling where animals display distinct subsets of postures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cermak et al., 2020</xref>), but our datasets here, which lack detailed posture information, did not permitted us to identify neural correlates of these sub-modes. Roaming states are characterized by fast fluctuations in the activities of neurons that have previously been shown to drive forward (AVB, AIY, RIB) and reverse (AVA) movement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kato et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Wang, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Roberts et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Li et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Luo et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chalfie et al., 1985</xref>). We did not identify a neuron that is persistently active throughout roaming in a manner analogous to NSM activation during dwelling. While it is possible that such a neuron may exist (and that we did not record it in our study), it is also possible that the roaming state might be the âdefaultâ state of the <italic>C. elegans</italic> network and thus does not require devoted, persistently-active neurons to specify the state. Consistent with this possibility, circuit dynamics similar to roaming are observed in the absence of food and even in immobilized animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kato et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Nguyen et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Venkatachalam et al., 2016</xref>). The correlational structure of neural activity also differs between roaming and dwelling. For example, the sensory processing neuron AIA is active in both states, but is coupled to NSM during dwelling, and to the forward-active neurons (AVB, AIY, RIB) during roaming. Neurons that can affiliate to different networks and switch their affiliations over time have also been observed in the stomatogastric ganglion and other systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Weimann and Marder, 1994</xref>). The correlational changes that we observe here might allow for state-dependent sensory processing.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Sensory control of roaming and dwelling states</title><p>Previous work showed that chemosensory neurons regulate roaming and dwelling behaviors: mutants that are broadly defective in chemosensation display excessive dwelling, while mutants that are defective in olfactory adaptation display excessive roaming (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fujiwara et al., 2002</xref>). However, the neural circuitry linking sensory neurons to roaming and dwelling had not been characterized. Using a machine learning-based approach, we identified AIA as a pivotal neuron for roaming-dwelling control. AIA receives synaptic inputs from almost all chemosensory neurons in the <italic>C. elegans</italic> connectome and displays robust responses to appetitive food odors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Larsch et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dobosiewicz et al., 2019</xref>). We observed apparently spontaneous AIA dynamics in freely foraging animals, which could reflect responses to small changes in the sensory environment or feedback from other neurons. Here, we found that AIA provides dual outputs to both the dwelling-active NSM neuron and the roaming-active neurons. Three lines of evidence support this interpretation: (1) native AIA activity correlates with NSM during dwelling and with forward-active neurons during roaming, (2) optogenetic activation of AIA can drive behaviors typical of both states, and (3) AIA silencing strongly alters roaming and dwelling states, but has different effects in different sensory contexts: AIA is necessary for roaming while animals navigate up food odor gradients, but is necessary for dwelling while animals are in uniform feeding environments. Thus, AIA is required to couple the sensory environment to roaming and dwelling states.</p><p>The dual output of AIA onto both roaming and dwelling circuits is an unusual aspect of the circuit architecture uncovered here. However, similar functional architectures, where a common input drives competing circuit modules, have been suggested to underlie behavior selection in other nervous systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Anderson, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Seo et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Jovanic et al., 2016</xref>). One possible function of this motif in the roaming-dwelling circuit is that it might allow both the roaming- and dwelling-active neurons to be latently activated when the animal is exposed to food odors detected by AIA. AIA-transmitted information about food odors could then be contextualized by other sensory cues that feed into this circuit. For example, NSM is not directly activated by food odors, but instead is directly activated by the ingestion of bacteria via its sensory dendrite in the alimentary canal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Rhoades et al., 2019</xref>). Thus, when animals detect an increase in food odors that is accompanied by increased ingestion, this might promote dual AIA and NSM activation to drive robust dwelling states. In contrast, when animals detect an increase in food odors that is not accompanied by increased ingestion, this might activate AIA and the other side of the mutual inhibitory loop, biasing the animal towards roaming. This flexible architecture could therefore allow animals to make adaptive foraging decisions that reflect their integrated detection of food odors, food ingestion, and other salient sensory cues.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Mutual inhibition as a network motif for generating opposing activity states</title><p>Long-standing theoretical work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Major and Tank, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Wang, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Seung, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Xiong and Ferrell, 2003</xref>) and recent experimental evidence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Wang, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Goldman et al., 2007</xref>) has highlighted the role of recurrent circuitry in driving persistent neural activity.

For genetic crosses, all genotypes were confirmed using PCR. Transgenic animals were generated by injecting DNA clones plus fluorescent co-injection marker into gonads of young adult hermaphrodites.

This also allowed us to determine the precise GCaMP6m and/or Scarlett expression pattern from each promoter. We then injected these plasmids as a mixture into <italic>lite-1;gur-3</italic> double mutants, which are resistant to blue light delivered during calcium imaging. We selected a line for use that had normal behavioral parameters and showed relatively balanced expression of GCaMP6m and Scarlett in the target cells (SWF90).

As illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1</xref>, two separate light paths, below and above the specimen, were built onto a Ti-E inverted microscope (Nikon).</p></sec><sec id="s4-3-2"><title>High-magnification light path for GCaMP imaging</title><p>The light path used to image GCaMP6m and Scarlett at single cell resolution is an Andor spinning disk confocal system. Light supplied from a 150 mW 488 nm laser and a 50 mW 560 nm laser passes through a 5000 rpm Yokogawa CSU-X1 spinning disk unit with a Borealis upgrade (with a dual-camera configuration). A 40 x/1.15NA CFI Apo LWD Lambda water immersion objective (Nikon) with a P-726 PIFOC objective piezo (PI) was used to image the volume of the wormâs head. A custom quad dichroic mirror directed light emitted from the specimen to two separate Andor Zyla 4.2 USB3 cameras, which had in-line emission filters (525/50, and 625/90). Data was collected at 2 Ã 2 binning in a 512 Ã 512 region of interest in the center of the field of view.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3-3"><title>Low-magnification light path for closed-loop tracking</title><p>A second light path positioned above the animal collected data for closed-loop tracking. Light supplied from a Sola SE2 365 Light Engine (Lumencor) passed through a DSRed (49005, Chroma) filter set and a 10 x/0.3NA air objective to excite Scarlett in the head of the worm. Red light emitted from the specimen passed through the filter set to an acA2000-340km Basler CMOS camera. Data was collected at 100 Hz.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3-4"><title>Synchronized control of camera exposures and illumination light sources</title><p>The Andor Zyla cameras used for calcium imaging were run in rolling shutter mode. A trigger signal was generated by one of the two cameras whenever the camera shutter is fully open (~2 ms per exposure). This trigger signal served as a master control that synchronized several devices (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1B</xref>). First, it was used to drive the 488 nm and 560 nm lasers, such that illumination is only provided when the full field of view is open. Second, the same trigger signal was used controlled the movement of the objective piezo, such that fast piezo movement occurs largely outside the window of laser illumination. Lastly, this signal was used to time the green LED used by the closed-loop tracking system. The LED was turned on only when the calcium imaging cameras were not actively acquiring images (i.e. outside the window when the rolling shutter is fully open) and when the lasers were off. Together, these approaches minimize photo-bleaching, photo-toxicity, and motion artifacts induced by movable parts of the microscope.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3-5"><title>Closed-loop tracking software</title><p>A custom C/C ++ software was used to process incoming frames from the tracking camera and to instruct the movement of a motorized stage (96S107-N3-LE2, Ludl; with a MAC6000 controller) to keep the head region of the animal at the center in the field of view.

The latter was estimated as described below (see <bold>Estimation of instantaneous animal location and velocity</bold>). The right side of the formula was found empirically to be sufficient for predicting future animal velocity. The second modification was that we used the motion of the head region of the animal to extrapolate the locomotory state of the animal. This approach results in a loss of postural information, but circumvents the need for a third light path for imaging the full body of the animal.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3-6"><title>Optogenetic stimulation during calcium imaging</title><p>For experiments where we activated Chrimson while performing circuit-wide imaging, L4 animals were picked to plates with 1 ÂµM ATR (or not, in the case of -ATR controls) for overnight growth.

Plates were uniformly seeded with sparse OP50 bacteria (OD 0.5 diluted 300 x), and one half of the plate was seeded with dense bacteria (OD 0.5 concentrated 20 x). The border between the sparse and dense food was always sharp and typically very straight. Plates were left overnight at room temperature. The following day, 1-day-old adult animals were picked to the sparse side of the food plate, approximately 1.5 cm from the dense food patch. Video recordings were started immediately, although for all analyses the first 20 min of data (equilibration time) was not analyzed. Videos were recorded at three fps using Streampix 7.0, a JAI SP-20000M-USB3 CMOS cameras (41 mm, 5120 Ã 3840, Mono) with a Nikon Micro-NIKKOR 55 mm f/2.8 lens.

We used data from the side of the animal (left or right) that was closest to the microscope objective, due to better optical quality of these data. First, feature points and feature point descriptors were extracted for each frame of the calcium imaging video. Next, an N-by-N similarity matrix (N = number of frames in a video) was generated where each entry equals the number of matched feature points between a pair of frames. The columns of this matrix were clustered using hierarchical clustering. Around 30 frames (typically 1â2% of frames from a video) were chosen across the largest 15 clusters. These frames were then segmented manually. The user was asked to outline the region for interest (ROI) around each neuronal structure of interest (axonal segment for the AIY neurons; soma for all other neurons). After manual segmentation, the automatic segmentation software looped through each of the remaining frames. For each unsegmented frame (target frame), a best match (reference frame) was found among the segmented frames based on the similarity matrix. Then, geometrical transformation matrices were estimated using the locations of the matched feature points. The estimated transformation was then applied to the boundary vertices of each ROI in the reference frame to yield the estimated boundary of the same region in the target frame. Once done, the target frames with their automatically computed ROIs were included into the pool of segmented frames and could serve as a reference frame for the remaining unsegmented frames. This procedure was repeated iteratively through the rest of the video.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5-2"><title>Calcium signal extraction and pre-processing</title><p>The fluorescent signal from each neuron in a given frame was calculated as the median of the brightest 100 pixels within the ROI (or all pixels if the size of the ROI was smaller than 100 pixels) of that neuron. This approach was adopted to render the estimation of calcium signal insensitive to the exact segmentation boundary of the neuron, which could inadvertently contain background pixels. This was done for both the green and the red channels. The following pre-processing steps were then applied to the time-series signals from both channels: (1) To reduce spurious noise, a sliding median filter with a window size of 5 frames were applied to the time series (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1âfigure supplement 2D</xref>). (2) To correct for the decay in fluorescent signal due to photobleaching, an exponential function was first fit to the time series. Next, the estimated exponential was normalized by its initial value and divided away from the denoised time series (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1âfigure supplement 2E</xref>). (3) To control for fluctuations in fluorescent signal due to the movement of the animal, we calculated the ratiometric signal. Specifically, the denoised and bleach-corrected time series from the green channel was divided by that from the red channel. (4) Lastly, to control for the variations in the dynamic range of the calcium signal due to variations in the expression of the fluorescent indicators, we normalized the ratio-metric signal such that the 1st percentile of the signal takes a value of 0 while the 99th percentile takes the value of 1. To control for cases where a given neuron never became active in a given recording (e.g. NSM in <italic>pdfr-1::acy-1gf</italic> animals), exceptions were made if a neuronâs peak activity in a given recording was less than 10 % of the average across all recordings. In this case, the original ÎR/R<sub>0</sub> value was used without normalization. Apart from this exception, the normalized ratio-metric signal was used for subsequent data analyses, except where indicated. These data processing steps (dividing by mScarlett; normalizing to a 0â1 scale) did not change the distributions of GCaMP intensity values (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1âfigure supplement 2H</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-5-3"><title>Estimation of instantaneous animal location and velocity</title><p>The instantaneous location of the animal <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf10"><mml:mfenced close="]" open="[" separators="|"><mml:mrow><mml:mtable><mml:mtr><mml:mtd><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>x</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>a</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mtd></mml:mtr><mml:mtr><mml:mtd><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>y</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>a</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mtd></mml:mtr></mml:mtable></mml:mrow></mml:mfenced></mml:math></inline-formula> was calculated based on the following formula:<disp-formula id="equ2"><mml:math id="m2"><mml:mfenced close="]" open="[" separators="|"><mml:mrow><mml:mtable><mml:mtr><mml:mtd><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>x</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>a</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mtd></mml:mtr><mml:mtr><mml:mtd><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>y</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>a</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mtd></mml:mtr></mml:mtable></mml:mrow></mml:mfenced><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mfenced close="]" open="[" separators="|"><mml:mrow><mml:mtable><mml:mtr><mml:mtd><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>x</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>s</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mtd></mml:mtr><mml:mtr><mml:mtd><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>y</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>s</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mtd></mml:mtr></mml:mtable></mml:mrow></mml:mfenced><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mi>*</mml:mi><mml:mfenced close="]" open="[" separators="|"><mml:mrow><mml:mtable><mml:mtr><mml:mtd><mml:mi>c</mml:mi><mml:mi>o</mml:mi><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:mi>Î¸</mml:mi></mml:mtd><mml:mtd><mml:mo>-</mml:mo><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mi>Î¸</mml:mi></mml:mtd></mml:mtr><mml:mtr><mml:mtd><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mi>Î¸</mml:mi></mml:mtd><mml:mtd><mml:mi>c</mml:mi><mml:mi>o</mml:mi><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:mi>Î¸</mml:mi></mml:mtd></mml:mtr></mml:mtable></mml:mrow></mml:mfenced><mml:mo>â</mml:mo><mml:mfenced close="]" open="[" separators="|"><mml:mrow><mml:mtable><mml:mtr><mml:mtd><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>x</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>c</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mtd></mml:mtr><mml:mtr><mml:mtd><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>y</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>c</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mtd></mml:mtr></mml:mtable></mml:mrow></mml:mfenced></mml:math></disp-formula></p><p>where <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf11"><mml:mfenced close="]" open="[" separators="|"><mml:mrow><mml:mtable><mml:mtr><mml:mtd><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>x</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>s</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mtd></mml:mtr><mml:mtr><mml:mtd><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>y</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>s</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mtd></mml:mtr></mml:mtable></mml:mrow></mml:mfenced></mml:math></inline-formula> is the instantaneous location of the microscope stage, <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf12"><mml:mfenced close="]" open="[" separators="|"><mml:mrow><mml:mtable><mml:mtr><mml:mtd><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>x</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>c</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mtd></mml:mtr><mml:mtr><mml:mtd><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>y</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>c</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mtd></mml:mtr></mml:mtable></mml:mrow></mml:mfenced></mml:math></inline-formula> is the position of the head region of the animal as seen on the frame captured by the tracking camera, <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf13"><mml:mi>Î¸</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula> is the rotation angle between the field of view of the tracking microscope and the sensor of the tracking camera, and <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf14"><mml:mi>r</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula> is the pixel size of the frames taken through the tracking camera. The velocity of the animal was calculated by dividing the displacement vector of the animal between adjacent time points by the duration of the time interval.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5-4"><title>Classification of roaming and dwelling states</title><p>Previous methods to segment roaming and dwelling defined these states based on the speed and angular speed of animal movement measured over 10 s time windows (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Ben Arous et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Flavell et al., 2013</xref>). These prior datasets were recorded on multi-worm trackers with lower resolution than that of our confocal microscope. High-amplitude angular speed measurements from the low-resolution trackers primarily reflected paused movement and/or low-speed forward/backward movement. Under high-resolution confocal recordings, angular speed was measured with greater precision and, thus, displayed a different profile, in part reflecting body oscillations. Therefore, we utilized a slightly different approach to segment roaming and dwelling from our confocal recordings: (i) we computed the median and variance of animal speed using a sliding window of 20 s, which transformed the 1-dimensional speed data into two dimensions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1âfigure supplement 4A</xref>). We then (ii) fit a Hidden Markov Model with Gaussian mixture emissions to this two-dimensional dataset. This yielded a model with three Gaussian components and two hidden states. The two hidden states successfully captured periods of persistent fast and slow movements, which we define as roaming and dwelling, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1âfigure supplement 3</xref>). Roaming and dwelling segmentation of multi-worm tracking data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figures 6</xref>â<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7</xref>) was performed using previous methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Flavell et al., 2013</xref>) and is described above.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5-5"><title>Aligning calcium imaging data with behavioral data</title><p>As described in the Microscope Design and Assembly section, the trigger signal for the confocal laser was simultaneously sent to the computer controlling the tracking microscope. This computer thereby stores two sets of time stamps, one for the laser illumination sequence and the other for the behavioral tracking video. Since the internal clock is the same, we can interpolate both the calcium activity data and the behavioral data onto the same time axis. Specifically, we interpolated both the calcium activity and behavior time series to obtain a common sampling frequency of 2 Hz.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5-6"><title>Principal component analysis (PCA)</title><p>An <italic>N-by-M</italic> data matrix was assembled with the rows representing neuron identity (N = 10) and the columns time points. Data across different recording sessions were concatenated together along the time dimension. PCA was performed by first subtracting the mean from each row and then applying singular value decomposition to the matrix. We chose this method over the previously described approach of performing PCA on the time derivatives of the calcium signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kato et al., 2015</xref>). We found that applying PCA on the time derivatives did not yield PCs with intuitive behavioral correlates when applied to our data. This may have resulted from the higher sensitivity of the time derivatives to measurement noise in these freely moving animals or from our recordings consisting of a different subset of neurons, compared to previous studies.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5-7"><title>Cross-correlation in neural activity</title><p>To estimate the time-lagged similarity between the activity of two neurons for a given genotype, the cross-correlation function (XCF) was first calculated individually for each data set of that genotype and then averaged. Bootstrapping was done to obtain confidence intervals on the mean. To examine the functional coupling between two neurons over time, average XCFs were calculated for data from a series of 60 s time windows spanning from 90 s before NSM activation to 90 s after. For each time window, the point with the largest absolute value along the average XCF was identified. The mean and 95% CI values of these extrema points were concatenated chronologically to generate plots.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5-8"><title>Classification of NSM activity states</title><p>We first computed the local median and variance of NSM activity using a sliding window of 20 s. This transformed the one-dimensional activity data into two dimensions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1âfigure supplement 4B</xref>). We then fit a Hidden Markov Model with Gaussian mixture emissions to this 2-dimensional dataset. This yielded a model with 3 Gaussian components and two hidden states. As the average NSM activity under these two hidden states differed significantly, we interpreted these hidden states as states of high and low NSM activity.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5-9"><title>General linear model to predict animal speed from calcium activity</title><p>The model performs linear regression on a set of linear and nonlinear terms derived from the instantaneous calcium activity of individual neurons.

The threshold values for defining the high versus low values were determined using the Otsu method. This was implemented using the &quot;multithresh&quot; function in MATLAB (with the source data set to the wild type activity of NSM or AVB, and the parameter N set to 1). Thresholds determined from wild-type animals were uniformly applied to all genotypes.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5-12"><title>Convolutional neural network (CNN) classifier</title><p>The classifier was implemented using the Deep Learning Toolbox in MATLAB. The architecture of the network consists of a single convolutional layer with a single channel of two 9-by-3 convolutional kernels with no padding, followed by a Rectified Linear Unit (ReLu) layer, a fully connected layer with two neurons, a two-way softmax layer and a classification output layer. The last layer is specifically required for the Matlab implementation and computes the cross-entropy loss. We used two 9-by-3 convolutional kernels to allow for the possibility that two separate activity patterns might be necessary for accurate predictions, though in reality only one convolutional kernel had informative values (the other was typically comprised of values close to zero). Calcium activity from all neurons imaged, except for the 5-HT neuron NSM, were used for training, validation and testing. To specifically predict the transition from roaming to dwelling, only data during roaming were used to predict the onset of NSM activity. For each wild-type data set, calcium activity during each roaming state was first down-sampled by averaging data from time bins of various widths (7.5â50 s, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplement 1</xref>) starting from immediately prior to the onset of a dwelling state and going back in time to the beginning of the roaming state. The 30 s bin width was selected after a systematic examination of how well CNNs performed when trying a range of different bin widths and total numbers of bins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplement 1</xref>). Each data point in the down-sampled data was assigned a label of 1 or 0: 1 if it is immediately prior to an episode of NSM activation, and 0 otherwise. Positive and negative samples were balanced by weighting the prediction error of each sample by the number of samples in that class. The positive and negative sample groups were each partitioned at random into the training, validation, and test sets at an 8:1:1 relative ratio. This random partition was repeated 200 times. For each data partition, network training was performed 10 times with random initial conditions, using Stochastic Gradient Descent with Moment (SGDM) with the following hyper-parameters:</p><table-wrap id="inlinetable1" position="anchor"><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom">Hyper-parameter name</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Value</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Initial Learning Rate</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">0.09</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">L2 Regularization Rate</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">0.0001</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Learning Rate Drop Factor</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">0.1</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Learning Rate Drop Period</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">10</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Momentum</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">0.9</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Validation Frequency</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">30</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Max number of epochs</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">150</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><p>To identify convolutional kernels that consistently contribute to classifier accuracy, convolutional kernels from networks that achieved greater than 50 % test accuracy were recorded and k-means clustering was performed. Within each cluster, the distribution of weights at each kernel location was used to extract a confidence interval for the mean value of that kernel element. Elements of the kernel with mean values significantly different from 0 were taken to indicate important neural activity profiles for predicting NSM activation. Since each kernel element maps to the activity of a given neuron at a particular time window, the preferred sign of a kernel element would suggest whether a neuron is preferentially active (when the preferred sign is positive) or inactive (when the preferred sign is negative) at that time window.</p><p>Feature selection was performed to identify key neurons whose activity critically contribute to classification accuracy.

In this manuscript, Ji et al. apply multi-neuron imaging in freely behaving animals, genetics, circuit interrogation tools, machine learning and modelling to study how the nematode <italic>C. elegans</italic> control,s maintenance and alternations between two mutually exclusive behavioral states termed roaming and dwelling. In previous work, some of the same authors showed that 5-HT releasing NSM neurons promote dwelling, while several pigment-dispersing factor (PDF) releasing neurons promote roaming. However, how neuronal activity of these populations of neurons relates to these behavioral states was mostly unknown. Moreover, a circuit model showing how these neurons modulate their targets and thereby behavioral output was lacking. Here, the authors propose persistent population activity as a neuronal correlate of roaming and dwelling states. They propose a model of mutual inhibition between NSM and PDF receptor expressing neurons as a circuit mechanism underlying dwelling-roaming switches. Moreover, they propose an intriguing bi-functional role of AIA neurons in triggering sensory evoked roaming dwelling switches.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Please find below a summary of the reviewer's comments. While they find your work very interesting and potentially important, they raised concerns about lacking evidence for persistent circuit activity and the mutual inhibition model. Without at least one of these aspects being substantiated, the work described here appears to be represent only a small advance over previously published work, e.g. your 2013 paper Flavell et al. Therefore, we find it essential that these critiques are fully addressed in a revised manuscript.</p><p>(I) Persistent neuronal activity:<italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>(1) The authors claim that persistent neuronal-circuit activity reflects roaming-dwelling changes, with particular focus on persistent NSM activity throughout dwelling. Inspecting activity traces, including also the corresponding author's previous data (Flavell, Cell, 2013), I am not convinced that this is the case. Dwelling is characterized by slow forward locomotion interspersed by frequent intermittent reversal maneuvers. Neuronal activity explicitly encoding the dwelling state, therefore should persist throughout these switches. However, NSM is rapidly fluctuating during dwelling (see Figure 1C) and, more importantly, seems to be negatively correlated with forward locomotion speed and rapidly down-regulated or inactive during reversals (Figure 1C-D). In this view, average NSM activity at dwelling onsets (Figure 1H) would reflect an average pattern in locomotion speed. A similar tight coupling of neuronal activity with instantaneous behavioral parameters is seen for most other neurons in the present study and this was shown already quantitatively in several previous studies: neuronal activity of AVB, RIB and AIY are positively correlated with forward locomotion speed and inactive during reversals; while AVA activity is tightly locked to reversals. I do not see evidence that any of these neurons' activity is persistent throughout roaming or dwelling, but they rather encode instantaneous parameters and switches in the worms ongoing locomotion. It is possible that these neurons' endocrine signaling via 5-HT and PDF effectively outlasts faster fluctuations of their Ca++ activity, but this remains speculative. I think these are crucial details and if the authors cannot convince me otherwise by more detailed analysis of their data, I think they need to revise one of the major statements they make throughout the paper. The authors would need to show that neuronal activity of NSM and other neurons persists throughout dwelling (and roaming), robustly and irrespective of speed fluctuations and forward-backward switches. Again, for AVA, AVB, RIB and AIY, previous studies that also applied Ca++ imaging in freely crawling worms showed that this is not the case.</p><p>(2) Taken into account the considerations above, PC2 seems to capture the inverse activity of NSM/AIA versus AVB, RIB, AIY, during foreword locomotion (Figure 1Suppl. 3B) with some contribution of AVA and others. In this view PC2 partially reflects the activity of neurons correlated/anti-correlated with forward locomotion speed, which overlaps with the dwelling state, but I don't see evidence for PC2 reflecting a persistent population state for dwelling. How should such a population-code get established and read-out?<italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>(3) The authors suggest that stereotyped circuit-wide activity patterns corresponding to each foraging state are stereotyped but they only present representative calcium traces and ethograms (roaming vs. dwelling) for single animals. This makes it challenging to assess how stereotyped the relationships between activity and behavior are across animals, neuron types, over time, as a function of locomotor kinematics or state. It would be helpful for the authors to present the data in a simpler form (not just bar-graphs or PCA trajectories) to give the reader a better sense of the variability in this rich dataset. A useful demonstration of the stereotypical relationship between network activity and behavior, is to use the calcium activity of these 10 neurons to predict behavior or at least roaming or dwelling.</p><p>(4) The authors suggest NSM plays a unique role in organizing the circuit-wide activity state that corresponds to dwelling. To support this, it would be useful to see each of the 10 neuron's activity plotted on separate axes in PCA space, as for NSM in Figure 1G, as well as plots 1H, Figure 1-Supp3 B, and 1I across neurons for comparison.</p><p>(II) Mutual inhibition model<italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>(1) AVB and NSM were barely coactive in WT, but were frequently coactive in pdfr mutants; during roaming to dwelling transition, the rise of NSM signal was accompanied by a decrease of AVB/RIB calcium signals. These results suggest that NSM is inhibited by polysynaptic inputs or neuromodulators from PDFR neurons.</p><p>I am not convinced by their argument. The lack of PDF receptor may have a broad effect on the neural circuit, and it is not clear to me why it would only affect the outputs from PDFR neurons to NSM.</p><p>In fact, an equally possible (perhaps even better) model is that the activities of NSM and PDFR neurons are differentially modulated by upstream &quot;sensory&quot; inputs through a push-pull mechanism, which can also elicit state transitions without involving a mutual-inhibition loop. Moreover, I postulate that, in pdfr mutants, NSM and PDFR neurons are more likely to be co-activated by sensory inputs, and the competition between the two groups of neurons prevents the animal from roaming. This alternativethe model also explains why AVB/AIY/RIB still exhibit strong and correlated activities during the dwelling state in pdfr mutants.</p><p>(2) Likewise, the argument on the inhibition from NSM to MOD-1/PDFR neurons suffers the same problem.<italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>(3) From the data in Figure 2, the authors conclude that there is a mutual inhibitory relationship between mod-1 neurons and NSM. This conclusion would be better supported by explicitly plotting the relationship between NSM and MOD-1-expressing neuron activities to show an inverse correlation in WT animals, and loss of inverse-correlation in mod-1 animals. Even more direct functional evidence of this inhibitory relationship (even if polysynaptic) would require monitoring NSM activity during acute activation or inhibition of mod-1 neurons. Fundamentally, inferring causal relationships between neuromodulatory systems and circuit dynamics is challenging from examination of mutants alone, since behavioral state space is also dramatically changed in these animals. For example, tph-1 and mod-1 mutants roam more, so it is not surprising that NSM activity is decreased on average. Is there a way to normalize the neuronal activity measurements in Figure 2 to account for the altered baseline behavior?</p><p>(4) The authors suggest that NSM and AVB activities are correlated in WT conditions and become anti-correlated in pdfr-1. Cross-correlations in Figure 3-Supp1 seem to be a bit at odds with this interpretation and rather there is no apparent correlation in WT and the two neurons become anti-correlated in pdfr-1 animals.</p><p>(5) In epistasis experiments, the authors use a sort of classic logic typically applied to molecular signaling pathways to determine whether MOD-1 or PDFR-1-expressing neurons act in the same or parallel pathways. However, given the highly interconnected nature of this circuit and that both MOD-1 and PDFR-1 expressing neurons are heterogenous in their properties, activity, and connectivity patterns (only partially depicted Figure 1B), it seems challenging to use these results to ascertain whether these sub-populations are uniformly &quot;upstream&quot; or &quot;downstream&quot; of each other simply based on the experiments in Figure 3.</p><p>(6) To constrain any model of how circuit dynamics is altered during behavior, it would seem valuable for the authors to more directly probe the relationships between neurons rather than infer them from potentially pleiotropic mutants that also dramatically change behavioral state space. For example, it could be helpful to examine the relationship between NSM and MOD-1-expressing neuron activities in WT and mod-1 mutants, normalizing for the differences in behavior, as suggested (see reviewer #1) by drawing subsets of data form WT that have the same speed distribution as mutants.</p><p>Alternatively, they could monitor NSM activity during acute activation or inhibition of MOD-1 expressing neurons to more directly reveal inhibition.<italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>(7) In Figure 3C the authors show how normalized (0-1) activity of NSM and AVB activities are mutually exclusive, which cannot be seen in pdfr-1 and tph-1; pdfr-1 mutants. I am concerned that this could be a result of pdfr-1 mutants being 'confined' to the subspace of low locomotion speed, and thus high NSM and low AVB activity levels. Conversely, the acy-1(gf) transgene confines the data to the high-speed sub-space. An alternative interpretation is that the relationship between NSM and AVB is stable in the various genetic backgrounds, but data are skewed by the different speed distributions. Especially in the acy-1(gf) data this seems to be the case: the distribution of orange dots seem to be identical to the same speed data in WT. The normalization steps performed by the authors could distort such stable relationships drastically. This can be tested by drawing subsets of data form WT that have the same speed distribution like pdfr-1 mutants and acy-1(gf) animals, and then redo the analyses.</p><p>(III) Other essential revisions:</p><p>(8) The authors compare their PCA results with a previous study (Kato, 2015). While PC1 in the present study recapitulates aspects of the previous work (switching between forward and backward active neurons), higher PCs receive contributions from different neurons. The authors conclude that the worm's neuronal activity space would considerably vary across environmental conditions. One cannot draw this conclusion, because different subsets of neurons were recorded in the two studies, it is thus technically wrong to pairwise compare single PCs between these very different datasets.</p><p>(9) The authors designed a CNN to predict NSM state from preceding neuronal activity. This was indeed useful as it revealed candidate regulators like AIA. But they conclude from this:</p><p>&quot;Together, these results reveal a stereotyped, multi-neuron activity pattern that predicts NSM activation&quot;. Two neurons with strong predictive score are RIB and AVA, which have strong correlates with behavior (Speed and Reversals). Therefore, we wonder if these multi neuron activity patterns contain more information than behavioral correlates. Indeed, one expects that reversals and slow speed would predict dwelling onsets.

They show convincingly that NSM neuronal activity persists throughout dwelling episodes and that 5-HT and PDFR expressing neurons affect each other consistent with a mutual inhibition model. However, their proposal of a persistent network state directly corresponding to roaming dwelling switches is not supported by the data provided, as most neurons in this study are rather primarily locked to locomotion parameters.</p><p>(1) The new analyses indicate that NSM activity differs from other locomotion associated neurons, in a way that it relates to the overall dwelling state as opposed being just anti-correlating to forward locomotion speed. This indeed shows that some aspects of NSM activity persist throughout the dwelling state. I wonder how NSM activity alone would perform in the logistic regression model Figure 1I. If it performs worse than the neuronal population, it should be discussed why. I find the Results section around Figure 1I incomplete without this obvious additional analysis.</p><p>(2) The authors provide convincing new experimental data supporting mutual inhibition between NSM and PDFR expressing neurons, a point mostly raised by the other reviewers.</p><p>(3) I am less convinced by the authors' proposal of circuit wide network states explicitly encoding dwelling or roaming, which is not sufficiently supported by the data. It is known that activity of reverse active interneurons like AVA, when recorded in freely moving animals, gradually correlates with reverse locomotion speed (Kato et al., 2015), like the forward active interneurons (AVB, AIY, RIB) gradually correlate with forward locomotion speed (Kato et al., 2015; Li et al., 2014; Luo et al., 2014). These features extend to other interneuron classes not studied in the present manuscript (Hallinen et al., 2021; Kato et al., 2015). Hence, this is not a new finding of the present study and I feel that this vast amount of literature is not adequately cited. Crucially, since roaming-dwelling states are classified by two speed parameters (Methods), it does not come at a surprise at all that these behavioural states have a signature in network activity; again, because most of the neuronal activities under study are primarily sensitive to locomotion speed during either forward or backward crawling. This, however, should not be confused with a persistent network state that discretely switches between roaming- and dwelling correlates. There is no evidence presented that other neurons than NSM, and perhaps AIA, receive explicit additional modulations during roaming or dwelling. In this manner, the authors over-interpret a PCA result, where PC2 receives some contributions from these locomotion tuned neurons. This is exactly what you expect from PCA analysis of neurons with relationships described above. The statement in the rebuttal letter &quot;we reveal for the first time that the activities of these neurons are also modulated by behavioral state, showing an overall decrease in activity during dwelling&quot; is misleading in this sense. In the same vein, the authors keep their formulations somewhat ambiguous, which I think is misleading readers not familiar with the details in the literature cited above:</p><p>P5: Together, these data reveal widespread encoding of locomotion parameters and</p><p>foraging state by neurons throughout the roaming-dwelling circuit.</p><p>P22: Circuit-wide calcium imaging during roaming and dwelling identified stable activity patterns that correspond to each stateâ¦..

I will stick to the questions raised in my previous review.</p><p>Mutual inhibition:</p><p>(1) The authors provide additional optogenetic experiments to support their mutual inhibition model, namely by activating specific neurons (e.g., NSM) while recording the activity in others (e.g., AVB and AIY). Given the very slow time scale of activity change (~ 10 s after laser onset in Figure 2G) and the diffusive nature of neuromodulators, I am not sure that the data directly support a causal relationship depicted in Figure 3G and Figure 4I. A more illuminating experiment is to carry out the control experiment in mod-1 mutant (the no ATR control is useful, but not instructive).</p><p>(2) Mutual exclusivity between NSM and AVB activity appears to be an oversimplification. While the joint probability â when NSM and AVB both exhibit high activity â is small (new plot in Figure 4C WT, Figure 4 âfigure supplement 3A WT), this observation does not lead to the conclusion that the two neurons are mutually exclusive. Note that much of the neural activity is distributed in a low signal region, suggesting more complicated activity patterns. For example, in the dwelling state, AVB neurons could exhibit prominent calcium transients, but presumably smaller mean amplitude, see raw traces in Figure 1 âfigure supplement 3. As a result, the joint probability distribution would bias towards the lower right quadrant. Overall, the writing is confusing and misleading without a clear and rigorous definition of mutual exclusivity.</p><p>(3) Mutual inhibition and the corresponding neural dynamics could occur in both slow and fast timescales. The authors mention in the Introduction that direct experimental evidence linking recurrent circuitry with persistent activity remains scarce. Here, I would like to bring to your attention two earlier papers in <italic>C. elegans</italic> that will complement the current study. One is Robert et.al., <italic>eLife</italic> 2016 (DOI: 10.7554/<italic>eLife</italic>.12572) and the other Wang et al., <italic>eLife</italic> 2020 ( DOI: 10.7554/<italic>eLife</italic>.56942) both studies investigate flexible motor control, and the roles of mutual inhibitions in motor state transitions.</p><p>Modelling:</p><p>As alluded in my previous review, a model would be useful if it provides additional insights that cannot be articulated by the experimental data and plain text alone. I still don't find much insight in the current revision.</p><p>(4) The idea of representing dwelling and roaming states with two group of neurons with persistent activity is not supported by their data, as reviewer #1 clearly pointed out. The model, however, was constructed based on such a simplification. They need to justify such an assumption in their writing, or extend the model with a reasonable effort. If they cannot, I would suggest that they delete the model to avoid misleading the readers.</p><p>(5) The modelling session remains poorly written. In Equations. (1)-(3), the meanings of \Î³_u, \Î³_a, and \Î³_b are not explained. Neither does G(t) in Equation. (5). It is not clear to me whether Equations. (5)-(6) can be approximated by steady state solutions, or why they are not. And this is why timescale is important.</p><p>Whereas the data suggest that the roaming neurons' calcium activity are fluctuating much faster than NSM, the variable x and y (Equations. (5)-(6)) in their model would lead to fluctuation at the same timescale.</p><p>(6) Specifically, how and why 'AIA' would promote roaming during the odor gradient climbing is presented in a very superficial and mysterious way. It remains entirely unclear whether the &quot;predictions&quot; result from the general structure of the motif or fine-tuning many of the parameters in the model. I also suggest that they present a phase diagram of some of the essential model parameters that would impact the model outcome. One such parameter, for example, is \Î±_x and \Î±_y, the feedforward connection strengths.</p><p>(7) By trying to understand your model, here I tend to offer my own explanation. Given that AIA connects with both roaming and dwelling neurons in their model, the key appears to be the asymmetry in the feedforward connections, namely the synaptic weight to the roaming neuron (Î±_y) is greater than the weight to the dwelling neurons (Î±_x).</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.62889.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(I) Persistent neuronal activity:</p><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>(1) The authors claim that persistent neuronal-circuit activity reflects roaming-dwelling changes, with particular focus on persistent NSM activity throughout dwelling. Inspecting activity traces, including also the corresponding author's previous data (Flavell, Cell, 2013), I am not convinced that this is the case. Dwelling is characterized by slow forward locomotion interspersed by frequent intermittent reversal maneuvers. Neuronal activity explicitly encoding the dwelling state, therefore should persist throughout these switches. However, NSM is rapidly fluctuating during dwelling (see Figure 1C) and, more importantly, seems to be negatively correlated with forward locomotion speed and rapidly down-regulated or inactive during reversals (Figure 1C-D). In this view, average NSM activity at dwelling onsets (Figure 1H) would reflect an average pattern in locomotion speed. A similar tight coupling of neuronal activity with instantaneous behavioral parameters is seen for most other neurons in the present study and this was shown already quantitatively in several previous studies: neuronal activity of AVB, RIB and AIY are positively correlated with forward locomotion speed and inactive during reversals; while AVA activity is tightly locked to reversals. I do not see evidence that any of these neurons' activity is persistent throughout roaming or dwelling, but they rather encode instantaneous parameters and switches in the worms ongoing locomotion. It is possible that these neurons' endocrine signaling via 5-HT and PDF effectively outlasts faster fluctuations of their Ca++ activity, but this remains speculative. I think these are crucial details and if the authors cannot convince me otherwise by more detailed analysis of their data, I think they need to revise one of the major statements they make throughout the paper. The authors would need to show that neuronal activity of NSM and other neurons persists throughout dwelling (and roaming), robustly and irrespective of speed fluctuations and forward-backward switches. Again, for AVA, AVB, RIB and AIY, previous studies that also applied Ca++ imaging in freely crawling worms showed that this is not the case.</p></disp-quote><p>To address this concern, we have characterized the dynamics of the neurons more exhaustively and have conducted further analyses to relate their activity to behavior.</p><p>For each neuron, we assessed its characteristic timescale of activation by measuring the autocorrelation function of the GCaMP signal. We observed that of all the neurons recorded, NSM activity decayed the slowest (Figure 1-Supplement 3B). This observation is consistent with NSMâs minutes-long bouts of activity whose durations are strongly correlated with the durations of co-occurring dwelling states (Figure 2C-D). We also analyzed event-triggered averages of each neuronâs activity time-locked to roam/dwell transitions and forward/reverse transitions (Figure 1D). NSM showed a robust increase in activity at dwelling onset, but did not show any change in activity time-locked to fwd/rev transitions (Figure 1D). Consistent with this observation, we also found that the overall distributions of NSM GCaMP signals are identical during rapid forward and rapid reverse locomotion, but the GCaMP signals are significantly higher during paused (slow forward/backward) movement typical of dwelling (Figure 1E and Figure 2A). (As a minor point of clarification, animals display reversals during both roaming and dwelling, but those during roaming are long reversals whereas those during dwelling are very brief and typically low velocity). These data suggest that NSMâs activity is unrelated to forward/backward locomotion changes, but is higher during slow-locomotion dwelling states and shows a time-locked, sustained increase in activity at the onset of dwelling states.</p><p>We performed similar analyses for the other neurons as well. Consistent with previous reports (see citations in the manuscript), we found that, during roaming, neurons including AVB, AIY, and RIB showed increased activity during forward runs and decreased activity during reversals, while the AVA neuron showed heightened activity specifically during reversals (Figure 1D-E and Figure 1-Supplement 5A). During dwelling, both the forward- and reverse-active neurons showed decreased activity, consistent with the suppression of rapid locomotion during dwelling (Figure 1D-E). Thus, our analyses corroborate previous studies on the roles for AIY, RIB, and AVB in promoting forward locomotion and AVA in promoting backward locomotion. Further, we reveal for the first time that the activities of these neurons are also modulated by behavioral state, showing an overall decrease in activity during dwelling.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) Taken into account the considerations above, PC2 seems to capture the inverse activity of NSM/AIA versus AVB, RIB, AIY, during foreword locomotion (Figure 1Suppl. 3B) with some contribution of AVA and others. In this view PC2 partially reflects the activity of neurons correlated/anti-correlated with forward locomotion speed, which overlaps with the dwelling state, but I don't see evidence for PC2 reflecting a persistent population state for dwelling. How should such a population-code get established and read-out?</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested, we have more closely examined the composition and dynamics of PC2 in relation with behavior.</p><p>Interestingly, PC2 receives positive loading from NSM, but negative loading from the forward- and reverse-active neurons AIY, AVA, and RIB (Figure 1âSupplement 6A). Thus, when PC2 is high, NSM tends to be active while the forward- and reverse-active neurons tend have reduced activity. In contrast, the factor loadings on PC1 are strongly positive for neurons active during forward runs (AIY, AVB, RIB, RME, etc.), small for NSM, and strongly negative for the reversal-active AVA neuron. This suggests that PC1 dynamics should correlate with animal velocity, which is confirmed in Figure 1F.</p><p>Whereas PC1 is high during forward movement and low during reverse movement (Figure 1F), PC2 is the same regardless of movement direction (fwd/rev), but is specifically active during slow movement in the dwelling state (Figure 1F-G). These results are consistent with our single neuron analyses described above in point (1) and suggest that rapid forward/backward movement is associated with neural dynamics along PC1, while the dwelling state is associated with PC2. The fact that several neurons are loaded onto both PC1 and PC2 is consistent with the fact that their activities are modulated by forward/reverse direction changes and overall behavioral state (suppressed during dwelling). We try to make these relationships clearer in the writing of our revised manuscript. (p. 7-10)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>(3) The authors suggest that stereotyped circuit-wide activity patterns corresponding to each foraging state are stereotyped but they only present representative calcium traces and ethograms (roaming vs. dwelling) for single animals. This makes it challenging to assess how stereotyped the relationships between activity and behavior are across animals, neuron types, over time, as a function of locomotor kinematics or state. It would be helpful for the authors to present the data in a simpler form (not just bar-graphs or PCA trajectories) to give the reader a better sense of the variability in this rich dataset. A useful demonstration of the stereotypical relationship between network activity and behavior, is to use the calcium activity of these 10 neurons to predict behavior or at least roaming or dwelling.</p></disp-quote><p>We provide a more extensive set of analyses relating each neuronâs activity to behavior across animals in the revised manuscript. These plots include behavioral-event-triggered averages (Figure 1D), distributions of GCaMP signals across different behaviors (Figure 1E), and more. In addition, we examined whether neural activity in the circuit could predict (i) behavioral state and (ii) acute velocity by training two separate models (logistic regression to predict roam/dwell and a General Linear Model to predict analog velocity). We found a high level of cross-validated performance for both models (Figure 1H-I; Figure 1âfigure supplement 7).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) The authors suggest NSM plays a unique role in organizing the circuit-wide activity state that corresponds to dwelling. To support this, it would be useful to see each of the 10 neuron's activity plotted on separate axes in PCA space, as for NSM in Figure 1G, as well as plots 1H, Figure 1-Supp3 B, and 1I across neurons for comparison.</p></disp-quote><p>We have provided these plots, as suggested: (i) each neuronâs activity during trajectories through PCA space (Figure 1-Supplement 6B); (ii) each neuronâs activity triggered on Fwd/Rev and Roam/Dwell transitions (Figure 1D), and (iii) each neuronâs factor loadings on PC1 and PC2 (Figure 1-Supplement 6A).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(II) Mutual inhibition model</p><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>(1) AVB and NSM were barely coactive in WT, but were frequently coactive in pdfr mutants; during roaming to dwelling transition, the rise of NSM signal was accompanied by a decrease of AVB/RIB calcium signals. These results suggest that NSM is inhibited by polysynaptic inputs or neuromodulators from PDFR neurons.</p><p>I am not convinced by their argument. The lack of PDF receptor may have a broad effect on the neural circuit, and it is not clear to me why it would only affect the outputs from PDFR neurons to NSM.</p><p>In fact, an equally possible (perhaps even better) model is that the activities of NSM and PDFR neurons are differentially modulated by upstream &quot;sensory&quot; inputs through a push-pull mechanism, which can also elicit state transitions without involving a mutual-inhibition loop. Moreover, I postulate that, in pdfr mutants, NSM and PDFR neurons are more likely to be co-activated by sensory inputs, and the competition between the two groups of neurons prevents the animal from roaming. This alternativethe model also explains why AVB/AIY/RIB still exhibit strong and correlated activities during the dwelling state in pdfr mutants.</p><p>(2) Likewise, the argument on the inhibition from NSM to MOD-1/PDFR neurons suffers the same problem.</p></disp-quote><p>To directly test whether NSM and MOD-1/PDF-1 (i.e. roaming-active) neurons mutually inhibit one another, we performed new experiments in which we optogenetically activated specific neurons while recording others. We found that NSM activation acutely inhibited the roaming-active neurons (Figure 2G). Moreover, activation of either the MOD-1-expressing neurons or the PDF-1-expressing neurons acutely inhibited NSM (Figures 3F and 4G). These experiments provide strong support for the mutual inhibitory loop that we describe, but donât rule out the possibility of additional push-pull mechanisms elsewhere in the circuit.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>(3) From the data in Figure 2, the authors conclude that there is a mutual inhibitory relationship between mod-1 neurons and NSM. This conclusion would be better supported by explicitly plotting the relationship between NSM and MOD-1-expressing neuron activities to show an inverse correlation in WT animals, and loss of inverse-correlation in mod-1 animals. Even more direct functional evidence of this inhibitory relationship (even if polysynaptic) would require monitoring NSM activity during acute activation or inhibition of mod-1 neurons. Fundamentally, inferring causal relationships between neuromodulatory systems and circuit dynamics is challenging from examination of mutants alone, since behavioral state space is also dramatically changed in these animals. For example, tph-1 and mod-1 mutants roam more, so it is not surprising that NSM activity is decreased on average. Is there a way to normalize the neuronal activity measurements in Figure 2 to account for the altered baseline behavior?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that interpretation of neural activity in the mutants is potentially complex. Therefore, to directly test whether NSM and MOD-1/PDF-1 (i.e. roaming-active) neurons mutually inhibit one another in a wild-type background, we performed new experiments in which we optogenetically activated specific neurons while recording others. We found that NSM activation acutely inhibited the roaming-active neurons (Figure 2G). Moreover, activation of either the MOD-1-expressing neurons or the PDF-1expressing neurons acutely inhibited NSM (Figures 3F and 4G). These experiments provide additional experiment support for a mutual inhibitory loop.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) The authors suggest that NSM and AVB activities are correlated in WT conditions and become anti-correlated in pdfr-1. Cross-correlations in Figure 3-Supp1 seem to be a bit at odds with this interpretation and rather there is no apparent correlation in WT and the two neurons become anti-correlated in pdfr-1 animals.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for the ambiguity of this description in the previous draft of the manuscript. As is shown in the 2-D histogram in Figure 4C (left panel), the joint distribution of NSM and AVB activity in wild-type animals lie largely near the two axes (âL-shapeâ). Ideally, mutual exclusivity corresponding to a uniform, âL-shapedâ distribution of data points would indeed yield a negative correlation. However, the observed NSM-AVB distribution exhibits a concentration of data points near the origin (i.e. low NSM activity and low AVB activity), when neither neuron is active. This concentration of data points near the origin, which does not exhibit any clear positive or negative correlation, significantly influences the overall correlation of the full distribution. Thus, given the sensitivity of the correlation coefficient, we instead define âmutual exclusivityâ as a lack of co-activity between NSM and AVB, which is manifested by the lack of probability density at the upper right quadrant of the joint activity space (Figure 4C). In the revised manuscript, we present new visualization and quantification of the degree of co-activity across different genotypes (Figures 4C-D and Figure 4-Supplement 3).</p><p>Finally, in <italic>pdfr-1</italic> mutants, NSM and AVB become strikingly correlated, which we communicate better in the revised manuscript also. This can be observed using the co-activity metric described above (Figure 4D) and in the neuron-vs-neuron cross-correlation matrices that we provide in the revised manuscript (Figure 4Supplement 2).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) In epistasis experiments, the authors use a sort of classic logic typically applied to molecular signaling pathways to determine whether MOD-1 or PDFR-1-expressing neurons act in the same or parallel pathways. However, given the highly interconnected nature of this circuit and that both MOD-1 and PDFR-1 expressing neurons are heterogenous in their properties, activity, and connectivity patterns (only partially depicted Figure 1B), it seems challenging to use these results to ascertain whether these sub-populations are uniformly &quot;upstream&quot; or &quot;downstream&quot; of each other simply based on the experiments in Figure 3.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that the epistasis experiments could be complex given the highly interconnected circuit. Therefore, to directly examine how neurons influence one anotherâs activity in this circuit, we performed new experiments in which we optogenetically activated specific neurons while recording others. We found that NSM activation acutely inhibited the roaming-active neurons (Figure 2G). Moreover, activation of either the MOD-1-expressing neurons or the PDF-1-expressing neurons acutely inhibited NSM (Figures 3F and 4G). These experiments provide experiment support for a mutual inhibitory loop. Regarding the epistasis experiments specifically, we have softened the language in our conclusions from these experiments and pointed out the complexity highlighted by the reviewer (p. 17).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(6) To constrain any model of how circuit dynamics is altered during behavior, it would seem valuable for the authors to more directly probe the relationships between neurons rather than infer them from potentially pleiotropic mutants that also dramatically change behavioral state space. For example, it could be helpful to examine the relationship between NSM and MOD-1-expressing neuron activities in WT and mod-1 mutants, normalizing for the differences in behavior, as suggested (see reviewer #1) by drawing subsets of data form WT that have the same speed distribution as mutants.</p><p>Alternatively, they could monitor NSM activity during acute activation or inhibition of MOD-1 expressing neurons to more directly reveal inhibition.</p></disp-quote><p>As is described above, we have performed a series of optogenetics experiments to directly validate the mutual inhibitory interactions between NSM and the MOD-1- and PDF-expressing neurons (Figures 2G, 3F, and 4G).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>(7) In Figure 3C the authors show how normalized (0-1) activity of NSM and AVB activities are mutually exclusive, which cannot be seen in pdfr-1 and tph-1; pdfr-1 mutants. I am concerned that this could be a result of pdfr-1 mutants being 'confined' to the subspace of low locomotion speed, and thus high NSM and low AVB activity levels. Conversely, the acy-1(gf) transgene confines the data to the high-speed sub-space. An alternative interpretation is that the relationship between NSM and AVB is stable in the various genetic backgrounds, but data are skewed by the different speed distributions. Especially in the acy-1(gf) data this seems to be the case: the distribution of orange dots seem to be identical to the same speed data in WT. The normalization steps performed by the authors could distort such stable relationships drastically. This can be tested by drawing subsets of data form WT that have the same speed distribution like pdfr-1 mutants and acy-1(gf) animals, and then redo the analyses.</p></disp-quote><p>We performed further analyses to examine this concern. First, we examined the range and distribution of GCaMP fluorescence measurements from NSM and AVB in the mutants that we recorded (using F/Fmean values, thus avoiding the (0-1) normalization method that raised the concerns). We observed that there was no difference across the mutants, indicating that the range of GCaMP signals observed in each experimental condition is similar (Figure 4-Supplement 3D-E). There was one notable exception to this: the NSM GCaMP distribution was narrowed in the pdfr-1::acy-1(gf) mutants â this indicates that NSM GCaMP dynamics are reduced in this genetic background.</p><p>We also performed the analysis suggested by the reviewer where we compared NSM/AVB co-activity across mutants, drawing subsets of data that are matched for speed distributions. This analysis confirmed that the mutual exclusivity between NSM and AVB can be detected when sampling from data points with similar speed distributions and that this mutual exclusivity is disrupted in <italic>pdfr-1</italic> mutants (Figure 4Supplement 3A-B).</p><p>Finally, because we agree that the (0-1) normalization could in principle lead to the types of effects that the reviewer raised, we provide new figure panels showing that the key NSM/AVB results are essentially the same when using F/Fmean instead (Figure 4-Supplement 3A-B).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(III) Other essential revisions:</p><p>(8) The authors compare their PCA results with a previous study (Kato, 2015). While PC1 in the present study recapitulates aspects of the previous work (switching between forward and backward active neurons), higher PCs receive contributions from different neurons. The authors conclude that the worm's neuronal activity space would considerably vary across environmental conditions. One cannot draw this conclusion, because different subsets of neurons were recorded in the two studies, it is thus technically wrong to pairwise compare single PCs between these very different datasets.</p></disp-quote><p>We have adjusted the writing to remove this conclusion, as suggested by the reviewer.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(9) The authors designed a CNN to predict NSM state from preceding neuronal activity. This was indeed useful as it revealed candidate regulators like AIA. But they conclude from this:</p><p>âTogether, these results reveal a stereotyped, multi-neuron activity pattern that predicts NSM activationâ. Two neurons with strong predictive score are RIB and AVA, which have strong correlates with behavior (Speed and Reversals). Therefore, we wonder if these multi neuron activity patterns contain more information than behavioral correlates. Indeed, one expects that reversals and slow speed would predict dwelling onsets. Is the prediction power of speed and reversal significantly lower than the neuronal activity patterns?</p></disp-quote><p>We attempted to train a classifier to predict NSM activation from preceding behavioral data, but were unable to obtain any classifier with performance greater than that expected by chance.

But there are technical questions that are buried deep in the methods. For example, (1) Why use two 9-by-3 convolutional kernels? (2) Why choose 30 second time window for average? (3) If the generalized linear model works equally well as CNN (Figure 4 âfigure supplement 1), why donât we follow the principle of Occamâs razor?</p></disp-quote><p>We have provided clearer rationale for these technical questions in the revised manuscript. Briefly, (1) the CNN architecture could in principle recover multiple convolutional kernels that each provide important information for predicting NSM activation. Thus, we used 2 convolutional kernels to allow for this possibility. In practice, we only recovered one informative kernel (the other was almost entirely comprised of values close to zero). (2) We systematically varied the width of this time window and found that the 30s averaging time window led to marginally higher performance than other time windows (results for a range of time windows are now provided in Figure 5-Supplement 1). (3) We agree that the GLM and CNN perform similarly, but these models are equally interpretable (and, thus, equally useful to make inferences about how neural activity predicts behavior), so we decided to present the analysis approach that was more innovative (and ultimately more flexible for more complex applications) in the hopes that it might be of interest to readers.

This is somewhat expected because we previously observed that NSM activity very reliably predicts dwelling onset, but the decline in NSM activity is not always perfectly time locked to the end of dwelling states (Figure 2C, discussed in the Discussion of manuscript). This would then be predicted to lead to a small number of errors in classifier performance.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) The authors provide convincing new experimental data supporting mutual inhibition between NSM and PDFR expressing neurons, a point mostly raised by the other reviewers.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) I am less convinced by the authorsâ proposal of circuit wide network states explicitly encoding dwelling or roaming, which is not sufficiently supported by the data. It is known that activity of reverse active interneurons like AVA, when recorded in freely moving animals, gradually correlates with reverse locomotion speed (Kato et al., 2015), like the forward active interneurons (AVB, AIY, RIB) gradually correlate with forward locomotion speed (Kato et al., 2015; Li et al., 2014; Luo et al., 2014). These features extend to other interneuron classes not studied in the present manuscript (Hallinen et al., 2021; Kato et al., 2015). Hence, this is not a new finding of the present study and I feel that this vast amount of literature is not adequately cited. Crucially, since roaming-dwelling states are classified by two speed parameters (Methods), it does not come at a surprise at all that these behavioural states have a signature in network activity; again, because most of the neuronal activities under study are primarily sensitive to locomotion speed during either forward or backward crawling. This, however, should not be confused with a persistent network state that discretely switches between roaming- and dwelling correlates. There is no evidence presented that other neurons than NSM, and perhaps AIA, receive explicit additional modulations during roaming or dwelling. In this manner, the authors over-interpret a PCA result, where PC2 receives some contributions from these locomotion tuned neurons. This is exactly what you expect from PCA analysis of neurons with relationships described above. The statement in the rebuttal letter âwe reveal for the first time that the activities of these neurons are also modulated by behavioral state, showing an overall decrease in activity during dwellingâ is misleading in this sense. In the same vein, the authors keep their formulations somewhat ambiguous, which I think is misleading readers not familiar with the details in the literature cited above:</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for bringing up this important point and apologize for our lack of clarity on this issue. Regarding the forward- and reverse-active neurons, we agree with the reviewer that the observation that several of these neurons display diminished activity during dwelling does not change our understanding of how these forward- and reverse-active neurons control behavior: these results are consistent with the known roles of these neurons in controlling forward and reverse movement and our manuscript does not modify this understanding. We certainly did not mean to imply this and have modified the language throughout the manuscript to ensure that this is clear. In addition, we added the suggested citations. (p. 6-7, p. 22, and elsewhere) The result that we show in the paper is that several of the forward- and reverse-active neurons show reduced activity during dwelling (overall and/or surrounding moments of state transitions; Figure 1D-E). We have included new 2-D histograms of GCaMP signals of RIB and AVA neurons (as exemplar forward/reverse neurons) during roaming vs dwelling to make these results clearer in the revised manuscript (Figure 1 â Figure Supplement 6). We believe it is important to communicate these results, as they provide insights into how neural circuit activity changes across these states. We agree that diminished activity of locomotion-related neurons during the state with less locomotion is not particularly surprising, but we note that this was not the only possible outcome. For example, before we had collected these data, we had considered an alternative hypothesis that during dwelling states the forward- and reverse-active neurons might remain highly active, but have altered coupling to behavior such that they were unable to drive robust forward and backward movement during dwelling (perhaps due to a change in downstream circuits, for example in the ventral cord). However, given our findings, we have now modified the text to make clear that this aspect of our results is not especially surprising. (p. 7 and elsewhere)</p><p>Finally, we have modified the text to limit our discussion of âpersistent activity changesâ to the NSM neuron, which has more prolonged bouts of activity. As examples, we indicate here how we modified the sentences that concerned the reviewer (though see the revised manuscript for similar changes in other parts of the text; under Track Changes):</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>P5: Together, these data reveal widespread encoding of locomotion parameters and foraging state by neurons throughout the roaming-dwelling circuit</p></disp-quote><p>Changed to: âTogether, these data reveal that changes in the roaming/dwelling state of the animal are accompanied by changes in the activities of multiple neurons, including NSM and a set of neurons that have previously been shown to control forward and reverse locomotion.â (p. 7)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>P22: Circuit-wide calcium imaging during roaming and dwelling identified stable activity patterns that correspond to each stateâ¦..</p></disp-quote><p>Changed to: âCircuit-wide calcium imaging during roaming and dwelling identified several neurons whose activities differ between the two states, most notably the serotonergic NSM neuron that displays long bouts of activity during dwelling and inactivity during roaming.â (p.21)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The circuit architecture uncovered here provides new insights into how circuits generate</p><p>persistent activity patterns</p></disp-quote><p>Changed to: âThe recordings in this study provide new insights into how neural activity changes as animals switch between stable, alternative behavioral states.â (p. 21)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>P22-23: We found that NSM and AVB, which produce 5-HT and PDF-1 respectively, have mutually-exclusive activities that correlate with dwelling or roaming.</p></disp-quote><p>Changed to: âWe found that NSM displayed long bouts of activity during dwelling and was inactive during roaming.

However, I still have major concerns on the current revision. I will stick to the questions raised in my previous review.</p><p>Mutual inhibition:</p><p>(1) The authors provide additional optogenetic experiments to support their mutual inhibition model, namely by activating specific neurons (e.g., NSM) while recording the activity in others (e.g., AVB and AIY). Given the very slow time scale of activity change (~ 10 s after laser onset in Figure 2G) and the diffusive nature of neuromodulators, I am not sure that the data directly support a causal relationship depicted in Figure 3G and Figure 4I. A more illuminating experiment is to carry out the control experiment in mod-1 mutant (the no ATR control is useful, but not instructive).</p></disp-quote><p>We have run this suggested experiment, which can be found in Figure 2 âfigure supplement 1C. Briefly, we observed that the effect of NSM::Chrimson stimulation on circuit activity was strongly attenuated in a mod-1 mutant background.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) Mutual exclusivity between NSM and AVB activity appears to be an oversimplification. While the joint probability â when NSM and AVB both exhibit high activity â is small (new plot in Figure 4C WT, Figure 4 âfigure supplement 3A WT), this observation does not lead to the conclusion that the two neurons are mutually exclusive. Note that much of the neural activity is distributed in a low signal region, suggesting more complicated activity patterns. For example, in the dwelling state, AVB neurons could exhibit prominent calcium transients, but presumably smaller mean amplitude, see raw traces in Figure 1 âfigure supplement 3. As a result, the joint probability distribution would bias towards the lower right quadrant. Overall, the writing is confusing and misleading without a clear and rigorous definition of mutual exclusivity</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for bringing up this important point and apologize for our lack of clarity on this issue. We have addressed this concern in two ways: (1) First, when we use the term âmutual exclusivityâ in the Results section for the first time we now define it quantitatively and point the reader to figure panels and a Methods section that explains and supports this quantification method (p. 12). Briefly, we used the Otsu method to determine the thresholds between low/high activity for AVB and NSM and now provide a description of this in the Methods of the revised manuscript (p. 39). (2) We agree that this quantification that examines the joint high activities of NSM and AVB (i.e. percent data in upper right quadrant) still leaves other aspects of NSM-AVB co-activity unexplored. As the reviewer points out, perhaps lower amplitude AVB activity during dwelling would be interesting to compare across conditions. Therefore, we also adopted a more continuous metric for measuring AVB activity, conditional on NSM activity, in which we quantified the probability of observing AVB calcium transients beyond a range of different threshold amplitudes when NSM activity is high (Figure 4 âfigure supplement 2). This analysis shows the same main result, but does so in a more continuous manner: animals lacking <italic>pdfr-1</italic> have higher AVB activity when NSM is high. We believe that providing all of these quantification methods together now provides a more complete view of NSM-AVB co-activity.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) Mutual inhibition and the corresponding neural dynamics could occur in both slow and fast timescales.

Its only purpose was to make things clearer, but it does seem to be sufficiently confusing (and different from the biological system) that it ends up distracting rather than helping.
