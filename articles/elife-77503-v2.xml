MAC formation is initiated when complement enzymes on the bacterial surface convert complement component C5 into C5b. Although the MAC is a membrane-inserted complex, soluble forms of MAC (sMAC), or terminal complement complex (TCC), are often detected in sera of patients suffering from infections. Consequently, sMAC has been proposed as a biomarker, but it remains unclear when and how it is formed during infections. Here, we studied mechanisms of MAC formation on different Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria and found that sMAC is primarily formed in human serum by bacteria resistant to MAC-dependent killing. Surprisingly, C5 was converted into C5b more potently by MAC-resistant compared to MAC-sensitive <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> strains. In addition, we found that MAC precursors are released from the surface of MAC-resistant bacteria during MAC assembly. Although release of MAC precursors from bacteria induced lysis of bystander human erythrocytes, serum regulators vitronectin (Vn) and clusterin (Clu) can prevent this. Combining size exclusion chromatography with mass spectrometry profiling, we show that sMAC released from bacteria in serum is a heterogeneous mixture of complexes composed of C5b-8, up to three copies of C9 and multiple copies of Vn and Clu. Altogether, our data provide molecular insight into how sMAC is generated during bacterial infections. This fundamental knowledge could form the basis for exploring the use of sMAC as biomarker.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>complement</kwd><kwd>membrane attack complex</kwd><kwd>terminal complement complex</kwd><kwd><italic>Escherichia coli</italic></kwd><kwd><italic>Staphylococcus</italic></kwd><kwd>C5</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>E. coli</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000781</institution-id><institution>European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>(639209-ComBact</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rooijakkers</surname><given-names>Suzan HM</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003246</institution-id><institution>Nederlandse Organisatie voor Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Aspasia</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rooijakkers</surname><given-names>Suzan HM</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Utrecht Molecular Immunology HUB</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>eSTIMATE</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rooijakkers</surname><given-names>Suzan HM</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Netherlands Proteomics Centre</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>184.034.019</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Heck</surname><given-names>Albert JR</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004836</institution-id><institution>Independent Research Fund Denmark</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>9036-00007B</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lukassen</surname><given-names>Marie V</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Bacteria that resist direct complement-mediated killing by pores can still potently activate the complement system and trigger release of incomplete pores into human serum.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The complement system is a part of the human immune system that plays a crucial role in clearing invading bacteria to prevent infections. The complement system consists of soluble plasma proteins that circulate as inactive precursors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gasque, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Ricklin et al., 2010</xref>). When complement is activated at the bacterial surface, a proteolytic cascade is triggered that labels the surface with convertase enzymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gasque, 2004</xref>). These convertases initially convert C3 into anaphylatoxin C3a and C3b, labelling bacteria for phagocytosis by neutrophils (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Merle et al., 2015</xref>). As terminal step in the pathway, these convertases also convert C5 into pro-inflammatory C5a, which recruits and activates neutrophils, and C5b. C5b, together with C6, C7, C8, and up to 18 copies of C9, assembles a large, ring-shaped membrane attack complex (MAC) pore (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bhakdi and Tranum-Jensen, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">MÃ¼ller-Eberhard, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Menny et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Doorduijn et al., 2019</xref>). MAC pores can efficiently kill Gram-negative bacteria, although some serum-resistant Gram-negative bacteria can survive killing by MAC pores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Joiner, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Merino et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Doorduijn et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abreu and Barbosa, 2017</xref>), and Gram-positive bacteria are intrinsically resistant to MAC-dependent killing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brown, 1985</xref>). Nevertheless, the clinical importance of the MAC in humans is made clear by recurrent infections with Gram-negative bacteria in patients treated with C5 inhibitor eculizumab (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Heesterbeek et al., 2018</xref>) or patients with genetic deficiencies in one of the MAC components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lewis and Ram, 2014</xref>).</p><p>Complement activation products that are released into plasma during complement activation are frequently used as biomarkers for infections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Barnum et al., 2020</xref>). One of these biomarkers is the terminal complement complex (TCC) or soluble MAC (sMAC), which is often increased in plasma of patients suffering from bacterial infections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lin et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Mook-Kanamori et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Westra et al., 2017</xref>). However, since MAC is meant to assemble and insert in bacterial membranes, it is still unclear how sMAC is formed when complement is activated on bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Mook-Kanamori et al., 2014</xref>). sMAC could represent debris of lysed cells, but could also represent improperly inserted MAC pores that are released from bacteria during complement activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Morgan et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Here, we show that sMAC is primarily formed when complement is activated on bacteria that resist killing by MAC pores. A direct comparison revealed that MAC-resistant <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> strains generated more sMAC and converted more C5 than MAC-sensitive strains. More sMAC was also generated compared to MAC-sensitive <italic>E. coli</italic> when complement was activated on intrinsically MAC-resistant Gram-positive bacteria. Our data suggest that MAC did not insert into the bacterial cell envelope of MAC-resistant strains and was released from the bacterial surface. Although the release of sMAC could lyse bystander human erythrocytes in a serum-free model, serum regulators vitronectin (Vn) and clusterin (Clu) can prevent this bystander lysis. Finally, combining size exclusion chromatography (SEC) and mass spectrometry (MS) profiling of serum incubated with bacteria revealed that sMAC is a heterogeneous complex composed of C5b, C6, C7, C8, one to three copies of C9 and several copies of chaperone molecules Vn and Clu. Altogether, our study suggests that sMAC is an inactivated complex released from bacteria that resist killing by MAC.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>sMAC is primarily formed by MAC-resistant Gram-negative bacteria</title><p>To understand how sMAC is formed when bacteria activate complement, we analyzed sMAC formation by different bacteria. A panel of 12 laboratory and clinical <italic>E. coli</italic> strains were incubated with pooled human serum. First, we studied if these <italic>E. coli</italic> strains were sensitive to killing by MAC pores. Bacterial viability was assessed by counting colony forming units (CFUs) and revealed that four strains were killed in serum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). Killing was MAC-dependent because it could be inhibited with C5 inhibitors OmCI and eculizumab (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1a</xref>), indicating that these strains are âMAC-sensitiveâ. The other eight strains survived in serum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). C3 conversion was measured to determine if these serum-resistant strains activated complement at all. Deposition of C3b on the bacterial surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>) and release of C3a in the supernatant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1b</xref>) were similar on three strains compared to the MAC-sensitive strains, indicating that these strains activate complement efficiently. We have previously shown that MAC components bind to these strains after complement activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Doorduijn et al., 2021</xref>), suggesting that they are âMAC-resistantâ strains.

In short, sMAC in serum was captured using an antibody recognizing a neo-epitope of C9 when it is part of sMAC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Mollnes et al., 1985</xref>). Next, C6 was detected with streptavidin-HRP, since we used C6-depleted serum supplemented with biotinylated C6. The specificity of our sMAC ELISA was validated using cobra venom factor (CVF) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1âfigure supplement 2a</xref>), which can form fluid-phase C5 convertases in serum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Vogel and Fritzinger, 2010</xref>). All tested MAC-resistant strains efficiently formed sMAC in serum, whereas MAC-sensitive strains and most complement-resistant strains only generated slightly more sMAC than present in serum alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>). Titration of the supernatant of MAC-resistant 552059.1 suggested that there was at least fivefold more sMAC compared to MAC-sensitive MG1655 or complement-resistant 547654.1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>). sMAC was formed in a complement-dependent manner, since C5 inhibitor OmCI and eculizumab prevented formation of sMAC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1âfigure supplement 2b</xref>).

Gram-positive bacteria are intrinsically resistant to MAC-dependent killing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brown, 1985</xref>), which is thought to be caused by the composition of the bacterial cell envelope. Gram-negative bacteria have a cell envelope containing an outer membrane, periplasmic peptidoglycan layer, and a cytosolic IM, whereas Gram-positive bacteria only have a cytosolic membrane that is shielded by a thick peptidoglycan layer. This thick peptidoglycan layer is thought to be responsible for preventing MAC formation in the cytosolic membrane and bacterial killing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brown, 1985</xref>).

LPS O-Ag is an important constituent of the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria that has frequently been associated with MAC resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Grossman et al., 1987</xref>). We have previously shown that the three tested MAC-resistant strains express O-Ag (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Doorduijn et al., 2021</xref>), whereas only one out of four MAC-sensitive strains (547563.1) does as well (shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1a</xref>, summarized in Table 1). Silver staining of O-Ag for <italic>Klebsiella</italic> strains suggested a comparable trend, showing little detectable O-Ag for MAC-sensitive strains compared to MAC-resistant strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1b</xref>).

We next tested whether complement activation and subsequent release of MAC precursors from MAC-resistant <italic>E. coli</italic> can also cause bystander lysis. Therefore, <italic>E. coli</italic> were labelled with convertases in C5-depleted serum as described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref>. Next, these convertase-labelled bacteria were incubated with purified MAC components and unlabelled human erythrocytes to measure bystander lysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a</xref>). This resulted in lysis of bystander erythrocytes for all MAC-resistant <italic>E. coli</italic> strains and MAC-sensitive 547563.1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5b</xref>), corresponding with the production of sMAC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplement 1</xref>). Lysis was prevented in the presence of C5 conversion inhibitor OmCI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5b</xref>), suggesting that lysis was MAC-dependent. These data show that release of MAC precursors from <italic>E. coli</italic> can result in lysis of bystander human cells. However, when we studied bystander lysis in a human serum environment, we observed that the 552059.1 did not trigger bystander lysis of erythrocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5c</xref>). Serum regulators Vn and Clu are known to scavenge and inactivate sMAC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Zipfel and Skerka, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Schmidt et al., 2016</xref>).

SDS-PAGE revealed that Clu, but not Vn, prevents the formation of polymeric-C9 in the supernatant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5âfigure supplement 2a</xref>). This suggests that Vn and Clu interfere at different stages in the assembly of sMAC. Vn and Clu both specifically prevent lysis of bystander cells by MAC, since Vn and Clu did not inhibit binding of C9 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5âfigure supplement 2b</xref>), or MAC-dependent killing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5âfigure supplement 2c</xref>) when MAC was assembled by local conversion of C5 on convertase-labelled MAC-sensitive MG1655.

Here, we compared the average composition of sMAC generated by MAC-resistant <italic>E. coli</italic> with commercial sMAC by profiling sMAC components with liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). The total amount of sMAC components that were detected with LC-MS/MS in individual fractions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6c</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6âfigure supplement 1b,c</xref>) corresponded with BN-PAGE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6b</xref>), suggesting that most bacterial sMAC eluted later from the SEC column than commercial sMAC. For both bacterial and commercial sMAC, sMAC components C5, C7, and C8 were present in equal amounts in a pooled sample of fractions B5-B12 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6d</xref>). However, C6 and Vn were both twofold more abundant for bacterial sMAC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6d</xref>). The increased ratio of C6 is likely explained by the fact that not all monomeric-C6 could be separated during SEC (as was visible in fraction B9-B12 by BN-PAGE in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6b</xref>). Surprisingly, bacterial sMAC contained on average less C9 per C5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6d</xref>, ratio of 2:1) than commercially available sMAC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6d</xref>, ratio of 3:1). The relative amount of C9 per C5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6e</xref>), but not other sMAC components (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6âfigure supplement 1d</xref>), decreased in fractions that eluted later from the SEC column for bacterial sMAC. This was not observed for commercially available sMAC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6f</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6âfigure supplement 1e</xref>). These data suggest that sMAC generated by bacteria contains more complexes with less C9 compared to commercial sMAC.</p><p>Finally, we assessed the relative abundance of sMAC components for sMAC that was generated by Gram-positive bacteria. <italic>S. aureus</italic> Wood46 was incubated with human serum and the supernatant was separated by SEC (without isolating sMAC via HisTrap beads), using nonactivated serum as control. By profiling sMAC components in individual fractions by LC-MS/MS, we found that in nonactivated serum these components elute later in the SEC profile, corresponding to monomeric or low molecular weight complexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). Upon activation, the profiles of all sMAC components largely co-elute and are shifted to fractions that correspond to the higher mass range. In fact, close to no monomeric MAC components were detected after incubation with bacteria, suggesting that all available MAC components were incorporated into hetero-oligomeric sMAC complexes. We did not observe any sMAC without Vn and Clu in the bacterial activated sample, since these would be located around the 664 kDa molecular weight marker, suggesting that all sMAC complexes were bound to multiple Vn and Clu molecules (corresponding with the relative abundance in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6d</xref>). The complexes correlate with a ratio of one to three C9 molecules and an average of two C9 molecules to C5b-8, with Clu as the most abundant regulator bound to sMAC. Altogether, these data confirm that sMAC released from bacteria is a heterogeneous assembly comprising a single copy of C5b-8 together with multiple copies of C9, Clu and Vn in a mixture of stoichiometries.</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Soluble membrane attack complex (sMAC) that is released from bacteria is a heterogeneous protein complex with different stoichiometries.</title><p>Mass spectrometry (MS) profiling of sMAC components in serum supernatant incubated for 3 hr at 37Â°C with (bottom, activated) and without (top, nonactivated) <italic>Staphylococcus</italic> <italic>aureus</italic> Wood46.

Here, we show that sMAC is an inactivated complex that is released from bacteria during complement activation. We show that sMAC is primarily released from MAC-resistant bacteria, including Gram-positive bacteria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2</xref>). Surprisingly, these MAC-resistant bacteria also potently activate the complement cascade and convert more C5 than MAC-sensitive bacteria.</p><p>These findings suggest that detection of sMAC in human serum indicates potent C5 conversion by MAC-resistant bacteria. Increased C5 conversion has previously been associated with MAC resistance on Gram-negative bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Joiner et al., 1982a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Krukonis and Thomson, 2020</xref>), but this has not yet been directly linked to the detection of sMAC in human serum. Why C5 conversion is increased on bacteria that resist killing by MAC pores remains unclear. On Gram-negative bacteria, we observed that potent C5 conversion by MAC-resistant <italic>E. coli</italic> is linked to the expression LPS O-Ag (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). As Gram-positive bacteria do not express LPS O-Ag and are inherently MAC-resistant, a similar comparison could not be made for Gram-positive bacteria. Nonetheless, this suggests that cell envelope constituents, and in the case of Gram-negative bacteria specifically LPS O-Ag, can affect total C5 conversion. Grossman et al. have previously demonstrated that linking <italic>Salmonella</italic> LPS O-Ag to sheep erythrocyte membranes can increase C3 consumption (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Grossman et al., 1990</xref>). However, in our study, no difference was detected in C3 conversion and C3b deposition, suggesting that initial recognition and complement activation was comparable for MAC-sensitive and MAC-resistant bacteria. For the conversion of C5, however, the density of C3b is known to be important (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Rawal and Pangburn, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Berends et al., 2015a</xref>). Although C3b deposition was comparable for MAC-sensitive and MAC-resistant <italic>E. coli</italic>, we cannot exclude that local densities of C3b might differ, which could affect C5 convertase activity and explain a difference in C5 conversion.</p><p>Our study provides molecular insight into how sMAC is formed when complement is activated on bacteria. Although it was generally believed that sMAC is formed on the bacterial surface and then released (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Morgan et al., 2016</xref>), it was still unclear if the complete complex is formed on the bacterial surface. Our findings suggest that sMAC is initially formed on the bacterial surface, but released as the nascent MAC further assembles. Especially binding of C8 and C9 to C5b-7 triggered release of the nascent MAC from the bacterial surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Our MS data show that most sMAC complexes ultimately contain on average one to three C9 molecules and a varying amount of Vn and Clu copies, which implies that sMAC further assembles in solution. Joiner et al. have previously observed that binding of C8 to C5b-7 on a MAC-resistant <italic>Salmonella minnesota</italic> strain triggered release of C5b-8 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Joiner et al., 1982b</xref>). Although binding of C8 to soluble C5b-7 prevents binding to membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Nemerow et al., 1979</xref>), our data suggest that released MAC precursors can still bind to bystander cells and form lytic MAC pores. It is possible that C5b-8 can immediately bind bystander cells in our assays, which prevents C5b-7 from entering a soluble state. However, we cannot exclude that trace amounts of intermediate MAC precursors, such as C5b6, that are also released from the bacterial surface and can still form enough MAC pores to lyse bystander erythrocytes.</p><p>Since C8 and C9 are the MAC components that insert into membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Menny et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Sharp et al., 2016</xref>), our findings suggest that the nascent MAC is released because it is less capable of inserting into the bacterial cell envelope of MAC-resistant bacteria. Why MAC insertion is impaired on MAC-resistant bacteria remains unclear. On Gram-positive bacteria, it is believed that the dense peptidoglycan layer prevents insertion of MAC into the cytoplasmic membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brown, 1985</xref>). On Gram-negative bacteria, MAC resistance and improper insertion of MAC into the bacterial outer membrane have previously been linked to the expression and length of the LPS O-Ag (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Grossman et al., 1987</xref>). We here show that the expression of LPS O-Ag directly increases the generation and release of sMAC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). LPS O-Ag could prevent MAC proteins from inserting into hydrophobic patches of the bacterial outer membrane, ultimately resulting in release of sMAC. This is in line with our previous study, which demonstrated that expression of O-Ag impairs polymerization of C9 at the bacterial surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Doorduijn et al., 2021</xref>). The presence of LPS O-Ag could also prevent binding of complement-activating antibodies that bind to epitopes close to the bacterial surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Russo et al., 2009</xref>). Instead, antibodies that recognize the O-Ag could activate complement further away from the surface, which prevents insertion of MAC proteins into outer membrane and results in release of sMAC.</p><p>Findings in this study also highlight the importance of Vn and Clu in preventing lysis of bystander host cells when bacteria activate complement. In the absence of Vn and Clu, release of MAC precursors from bacteria resulted in lysis of bystander human erythrocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Importantly, Vn and Clu did not prevent MAC-dependent killing of the target bacterium, suggesting that Vn and Clu specifically inhibit bystander lysis. This bystander lysis has been studied using sensitized and unsensitized erythrocytes in the past (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lachmann and Thompson, 1970</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">GÃ¶tze and MÃ¼ller-Eberhard, 1970</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cooper and MÃ¼ller-Eberhard, 1970</xref>), but relatively few reports have studied bystander lysis in a bacterial context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Geelen et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Verduin et al., 1994</xref>). In these reports, complement activation on <italic>Streptococcus pneumoniae</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Geelen et al., 1992</xref>) and <italic>Moraxella catarrhalis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Verduin et al., 1994</xref>) caused bystander lysis of chicken erythrocytes. We here extend on these findings showing that human erythrocytes are also sensitive to bystander lysis.</p><p>This raises the question if bystander lysis is a clinically relevant process during bacterial infections. Under physiological conditions, Vn and Clu are present in a two- to eightfold molar excess compared to MAC components in serum, favoring inactivation of released MAC over binding to a bystander cell membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Barnum et al., 2020</xref>). Correspondingly, we do not observe bystander lysis in a serum of healthy donors in our study. However, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Willems et al., 2019</xref> have recently reported that Clu is decreased in plasma of children suffering from bacterial infections. Vn and Clu polymorphisms have also been identified that impair their potency in scavenging and inactivating sMAC precursors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">StÃ¥hl et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">van den Heuvel et al., 2018</xref>), which could predispose to host cell damage by bystander lysis. For both polymorphisms, patients suffered from recurrent complement-mediated hemolytic uremic syndrome, and in case of the Vn polymorphism, this was even associated with recurrent <italic>E. coli</italic> infections. Moreover, both Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacterial pathogens are known to recruit Vn to their surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Singh et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Riesbeck, 2020</xref>). For Gram-negative bacteria, this is thought to prevent MAC-dependent killing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">HallstrÃ¶m et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Griffiths et al., 2011</xref>), but for Gram-positive bacteria, the purpose of recruiting Vn and Clu has remained elusive. Altogether, our study therefore suggests a potential role of bystander lysis during bacterial infections that merits further investigation.</p><p>Finally, we demonstrate that sMAC generated by bacteria is a heterogeneous mixture of alike protein complexes with different stoichiometries. sMAC is believed to consist of C5b-7, C8, multiple copies of C9, and several copies of Vn and Clu (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Barnum et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Preissner et al., 1989</xref>). This was recently supported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Menny et al., 2021</xref>, who revealed that sMAC generated by zymosan particles in serum contains at least one to three copies of C9. Our data suggest that sMAC generated by bacteria is present in similar stoichiometries, but on average, contains less C9 molecules, especially for sMAC generated by MAC-resistant <italic>E. coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figures 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7</xref>). This suggests that the stoichiometry of sMAC could depend on the target cell that activates complement. However, it is important to note the possibility that complexes with less C9 are lost during purification of commercially available sMAC. Our data also show the presence of multiple copies of Vn and Clu in sMAC generated by bacteria, with Clu being the most abundant chaperone. These findings suggest that Vn and Clu can efficiently capture all sMAC that is released in serum. This is in line with the recent structure of sMAC by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Menny et al., 2021</xref>, which revealed that Clu binds and traps the terminal C9 in an intermediate conformation, thereby preventing further C9 polymerization. This is also in line with our results showing that Clu, and not Vn, is able to inhibit C9 polymerization. Finally, compared to commercial sMAC, more Vn was detected in sMAC generated by bacteria. It is unclear if this is caused by a difference in the target cell that activates complement, or a difference in the serum that was used to generate sMAC. The concentration of Vn in serum can vary largely between individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Barnum et al., 2020</xref>) and could be responsible for the observed difference.</p><p>Altogether, we show that sMAC represents an inactivated complex that is primarily released from MAC-resistant bacteria that potently activate complement. These findings are clinically relevant as they provide insight into what sMAC as a biomarker could represent during bacterial infections. Future clinical studies could determine if sMAC detection in the plasma of patients that suffer from bacterial infections also correlates with potent complement activation and MAC resistance of the causative bacterial pathogen. These insights could enhance our understanding of the role of complement activation in the pathogenesis of bacterial infections.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Serum and complement proteins</title><p>Pooled human serum was obtained from healthy volunteers as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Berends et al., 2015b</xref>).

We have now fixed the edits suggested by the reviewers, including a better explanation of the mechanism behind sMAC generation. The refereesâ comments made us realize that we did not clearly explain why sMAC is generated for both Gram-positive and -negative bacteria. Our data illustrate that sMAC is primarily formed by bacteria that are resistant to MAC-mediated lysis. For Gram-negative bacteria, we show that sMAC release is associated with the expression of LPS O-Antigen in the bacterial outer membrane, which is one of the key new insights described in this paper. For Gram-positive bacteria, this is presumably because of the thick peptidoglycan layer in the bacterial cell envelope, which is also responsible for their intrinsic MAC-resistance. We therefore hypothesize that cell envelope constituents, even though they differ between Gram-negative and -positive bacteria, are involved in sMAC generation.</p><p>Several modifications were introduced to make the mechanistic link between MAC resistance and sMAC formation more explicit:</p><p>-As suggested by referee #1, we moved data showing sMAC release on Gram-positive bacteria up in the manuscript (first Figure 5, now Figure 2). This allows us to show sMAC formation by Gram-positives and explain more early in the Results section how the cell envelope of Gram-positive bacteria differs from the cell envelope of Gram-negative bacteria and how this is related to MAC-resistance (line 126-133).</p><p>-We have also adapted our discussion to explain that we hypothesize that cell envelope constituents, in the case of Gram-negatives LPS O-Antigen or for Gram-positives the thick peptidoglycan, are involved in both MAC-resistance and sMAC generation (lines 302-306)</p><p>For the suggested clinical correlation data, one would need plasma samples of a cohort of infected patients that are stored in such a way that sMAC formation can be reliably assessed (without in vitro complement activation after blood collection), with suitable controls. Since we have no such samples available, this would require set-up of a well-controlled prospective clinical trial, which we feel is outside the scope of this paper. In line with <italic>eLife</italic>âs policy on revisions in response to COVID-19, (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162) we have therefore decided to slightly limit our claims and mention that such a future study would be necessary to correlate sMAC generation and MAC-resistance in a clinical setting (line 404-406).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>Overall it is a nice paper. The intro may be too short to set up the variety of different topics that are addressed. You may be better served by pulling up elements from the very long discussion into the intro and text to help better understand the context in the various investigations that were done.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that the discussion is relatively long. We have omitted a part of the discussion that goes into depth on C5 convertases (line 315-322), as we agree that this would require more introduction but is out of scope of the main topic of this manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1) The O-antigen is claimed to be responsible for sMAC generation; this section needs to be reconciled with the data on gram positive bacteria.

For example lines 271-272 seem to state the MOA is unclear but then in the discussion a hypothesis is put forward.</p></disp-quote><p>We now emphasize in the beginning of the discussion (lines 299-306) that cell envelope composition of bacteria in general, rather than just the LPS O-Ag, could be responsible for the difference in sMAC release observed in our study. Our data illustrate that sMAC is primarily formed by bacteria that are resistant to MAC-mediated lysis. For Gram-positive bacteria, this is presumably because of the thick peptidoglycan layer in the bacterial cell envelope, which is also responsible for their intrinsic MAC-resistance. For Gram-negative bacteria, we show that sMAC release is associated with the expression of LPS O-Antigen in the bacterial outer membrane, which is one of the key new insights described in this paper. This is why we discuss the LPS O-Antigen in more depth than the potential membrane structures that could cause this in Gram-positives, because we have more direct evidence that links sMAC generation to the expression of LPS O-Antigen in MAC-resistant Gram-negative bacteria.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) In lines 366-367 there is conjecture that this may be used as a biomarker. It would be great if data from positive blood cultures could be correlated with these findings to provide clinical context.</p></disp-quote><p>For the readerâs understanding, we have adapted our phrasing here (lines 402-404) to ensure that the reader understands that sMAC is already used as a biomarker in bacterial infections (reference 16, 17 and 18). Our present study focuses on how this biomarker is formed and what it represents. We also now mention in the discussion that a future study would be necessary to correlate sMAC generation and MAC-resistance in a clinical setting (line 404-406). Such a prospective clinical trial would entail a study on its own, as sMAC will have to be monitored more closely during multiple stages of infection. Patients would have to be specifically included for this study, as samples would also have to be collected in a way that prevents sMAC generation after blood collection.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>Certain aspects of the presentation should be improved as noted below.
