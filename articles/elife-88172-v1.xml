influences whether it drives adaptive or maladaptive behavior in the future. Yet, how mild and strong fear memories differ in underlying biology is not well understood. We hypothesized that this distinction may not be exclusively the result of changes within specific brain regions, but rather the outcome of collective changes in connectivity across multiple regions within the neural network. To test this, rats were fear conditioned in protocols of varying intensities to generate mild or strong memories. Neuronal activation driven by recall was measured using c-fos immunohistochemistry in 12 brain regions implicated in fear learning and memory. The interregional coordinated brain activity was computed and graph-based functional networks were generated to compare how mild and strong fear memories differ at the systems level. Our results show that mild fear recall is supported by a well-connected brain network with small-world properties in which the amygdala is well-positioned to be modulated by other regions. In contrast, this connectivity is disrupted in strong fear memories and the amygdala is isolated from other regions. These findings indicate that the neural systems underlying mild and strong fear memories differ, with implications for understanding and treating disorders of fear dysregulation.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="plain-language-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Remembering the fear that arose during a dangerous experience is important as it teaches us to avoid similar circumstances in the future. The intensity of the initial experience will often influence the strength of the memory. Milder memories often lead to responses that protect individuals from harm (known as adaptive behaviors).

A deeper understanding of fear memory requires identifying changes in the neural mechanisms engaged by fear memories of varying levels of aversiveness. Research on rodent fear conditioning has been mostly conducted in mild protocols and comparisons with strong protocols are scarce. While this approach advances our understanding of normal fear memories, it leaves open questions about specific mechanisms in disorders of fear dysregulation, such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Flores et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Normal fear memories are critical to survival. These memories trigger appropriate responses that are cue-specific and can be attenuated by extinction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fanselow, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Homan et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alexandra Kredlow et al., 2022</xref>). These adaptive representations are flexible and their content may be updated upon recall through reconsolidation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Arellano Pérez et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Forcato et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Haubrich et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Monfils et al., 2009</xref>). Importantly, these fear memories can be disrupted by pharmacological interventions targeting their reconsolidation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Haubrich et al., 2020a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Haubrich et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Nader et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Pigeon et al., 2022</xref>), offering a wealth of clinical possibilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Phelps and Hofmann, 2019</xref>). However, severe aversive events can lead to the formation of strong, maladaptive fear memories that trigger disproportionate and generalized fear responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baldi et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Corchs and Schiller, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Morey et al., 2015</xref>) and tend to be resistant to extinction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Sangha et al., 2020</xref>) and to undergo reconsolidation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Haubrich and Nader, 2018a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Holehonnur et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kindt, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Wang et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>The formation and expression of fear memories are believed to rely on the coordinated activity of a network of brain structures. The amygdala is an integral structure in all aspects of fear memory formation and expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Sears et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Zhang et al., 2021</xref>). Subsequent to severe fear learning, it has been shown that changes take place in the composition of glutamate receptors in the amygdala that are linked to maladaptive memories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Holehonnur et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Wang et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Conoscenti et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Haubrich et al., 2020b</xref>). In the case of contextual fear memories, the involvement of the hippocampus also becomes critical given its role in the processing of context-related information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Frankland et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Suzuki et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Topolnik and Tamboli, 2022</xref>). Other regions, such as the retrosplenial, infralimbic, prelimbic, and cingulate cortices, and the reuniens and paraventricular nuclei of the thalamus, also play important roles in modulating fear memories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alexandra Kredlow et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Barchiesi et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">de Oliveira Alvares and Do-Monte, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Levy and Schiller, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Milton, 2019</xref>). Importantly, the action of stress hormones and the locus coeruleus-noradrenaline system plays a key role in the formation of maladaptive-like fear memories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Haubrich et al., 2020b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dębiec et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gazarini et al., 2014</xref>). It is not clear how the coordinated activity between these regions changes with the severity of fear memories but basic and clinical findings suggest it may be dysregulated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Ressler et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p>The distinctions between adaptive and maladaptive memories may not be solely attributed to changes within isolated structures or altered connectivity between pairs of structures, but rather to collective changes across multiple structures within the neural network. Combining the quantification of immediate-early genes expression linked to neural activation such as c-fos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Terstege and Epp, 2023</xref>) and network-based graph analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bassett et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bullmore and Sporns, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Roland et al., 2023</xref>), it is possible to reveal the brain functional connectivity during active cognitive experiences, such as memory recall (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Silva et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Takeuchi et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Vetere et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Wheeler et al., 2013</xref>). In network models of neural systems, brain regions are represented as nodes, and functional connections between nodes are represented as edges. Multiple measures can be computed to inform the relationship between nodes and the global characteristics of the network, which can elucidate changes in information processing across different conditions.</p><p>In this study, we aimed to shed light on the system mechanisms underlying the recall of mild and strong fear memories. First, we established the behavioral differences triggered by fear conditioning protocols of varying intensities. We then employed c-fos immunohistochemistry to measure brain activation in 12 brain areas critical for fear learning and memory during the recall of mild and strong fear. Subsequently, the interregional coordinated brain activity was computed and functional networks were generated. Our findings indicate that the system mechanisms of fear memories vary based on their intensity as a mild fear recall is supported by a well-connected network while the recall of strong fear is associated with disruptions in network connectivity.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>The effect of varying fear conditioning intensity on behavioral responses</title><p>In order to investigate fear memories of different intensities, animals underwent contextual fear conditioning (CFC) with either 2 (2S) or 10 foot shocks (10S). A control group, in which no shock was administered, was included to provide a baseline behavior (NS). After training, a series of behavioral tests were conducted to determine the characteristics of the resulting memory. One day after training, we assessed the intensity of fear responses triggered by the conditioned context (Test A), and on the following day, fear generalization in a novel context (Test B). In addition, changes in exploratory behavior were assessed in an open-field exploration test conducted 3 d after training.</p><p>During training (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, middle), repeated-measures ANOVA indicated a significant effect of group (F<sub>2,19</sub> = 255.2, p&lt;0.001), bin (F<sub>11,209</sub> = 130.4, p&lt;0.001), and group × bin interaction (F<sub>22,209</sub> = 43.77, p&lt;0.001). Tukey’s post hoc revealed that in the 2S group, freezing levels during the concluding 4 min surpassed all previous time bins (p&lt;0.001). In the 10S group, the first 3 min exhibited lower freezing relative to all other bins (p&lt;0.05), and the last 6 min did not differ from each other (p&gt;0.05). This indicates that freezing behavior increased after shock presentations and showed no decline toward the session’s end.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Behavioral differences triggered by contextual fear conditioning (CFC) using different numbers of foot shocks.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Animals were placed in a fear conditioning box for 10 min and received either no foot shock (NS group), 2 shocks (2S group), or 10 shocks (10S group). One day later, they returned to the same context for 4 min (Test A), and on the following day were placed for 4 min in a new, distinct context (Test B). The next day, rats were placed for 10 min in an open-field arena. During training, freezing behavior increased following shock presentations in both 2S and 10S groups (N = 6/8 per group). In both Tests A and B (left), animals trained with 10 shocks displayed higher freezing levels than other groups, and animals that received no shock displayed the lowest freezing. To assess how animals from the 2S and 10S groups differed regarding fear generalization, an index was calculated (Freezing in Test 2/Freezing in Test 1 + Test 2), revealing that 10S animals expressed higher generalization (center). In the open-field test, there were no differences between groups across parameters of exploratory behavior (right). (<bold>B</bold>) Animals were submitted to the 2S and 10S training protocols, and on the next day were re-exposed to the training context for 30 min to induce extinction learning. The next day, a 4 min test was performed to evaluate extinction retention. Throughout the extinction session, both groups exhibited a decrease in fear expression but 10S animals displayed significantly higher freezing. In the test session, 2S animals displayed extinction retention, with no increase in freezing in comparison to the last 5 min bin of the extinction session, whereas 10S animals displayed a return of fear to the levels of the first bin. (<bold>C</bold>) Animals were submitted to the 2S and 10S training protocols, and the next day the fear memory was reactivated by re-exposing animals to the training context for 4 min. Immediately after the reactivation session, anisomycin or its vehicle was injected i.p. to block memory reconsolidation. The efficiency of the reconsolidation was assessed the next day in a test where animals were again exposed to the conditioned context for 4 min. In the 2S group, anisomycin treatment led to a decrease in fear expression, whereas the same treatment was ineffective in the 10S group. Plots show the mean ± SEM.

Repeated-measures ANOVA indicated a significant effect of group (F<sub>2,21</sub> = 166, p&lt;0.001) and group × session interaction (F<sub>2,21</sub> = 12.86, p&lt;0.001). Tukey’s post hoc indicated that in context A all groups differed from each other (p&lt;0.001), with the 10S displaying the higher freezing levels. During the test in context B, there was no difference between NS and 2S groups (p=0.31) while the 10S group was higher than all others (p&lt;0.001). To compare fear generalization between animals trained with 2 shocks and 10 shocks, a discrimination index was computed and compared, and a Student’s <italic>t</italic>-test revealed that there was a significant difference between groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, bottom center; t(14) = –2.3, p=0.037).</p><p>In the open-field test conducted 1 d after test 2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, bottom right), there were no group differences in the time spent in corners (F<sub>2,24</sub> = 0.987, p=0.4) and total distance moved (F<sub>2,24</sub> = 1.52, p=0.1). There were also no differences in the time spent in the center (F<sub>2,24</sub> = 0.302, p=0.7), number of quadrant crossings (F<sub>2,24</sub> = 1.2, p=0.3), number of crossings on the center (F<sub>2,24</sub> = 0.301, p=0.7), and average speed (F<sub>2,24</sub> = 1.56, p=0.2) (data not shown). Thus, suggesting that differences in freezing performance are due to alterations in memory expression and not in motor abilities.</p><p>We then evaluated the effect of training intensity on fear extinction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Repeated-measures ANOVA indicated a significant effect between groups (F<sub>1,14</sub> = 6.67, p=0.02), bin (F<sub>6,84</sub> = 14.4, p&lt;0.001), and no group × bin interaction (F<sub>6,84</sub> = 1.7, p=0.12). Tukey’s post hoc revealed that the 2S group displayed extinction retention since there was no difference between the last extinction bin and the test session the next day (p=0.9), but in the 10S group there was a significant increase in freezing (p=0.003) that returned to the levels found in the first bin (p=0.72). Furthermore, in the 2S group, freezing during test remained consistent with the levels observed in the final extinction bin (p=0.61) and was lower than the levels in the initial extinction bin (p&lt;0.001), indicating no spontaneous recovery. Conversely, in the 10S group, freezing levels increased from the final extinction bin to the test (p=0.003), reaching levels comparable to those observed in the first extinction bin (p=0.19), indicating complete spontaneous recovery.</p><p>Next, we investigated the effect of training intensity on the ability of memory to change through reconsolidation. One day after the initial training, memory was reactivated by a 5 min re-exposure to the training context, followed immediately by the injection of the protein synthesis inhibitor anisomycin. To verify if reconsolidation was disrupted by the treatment, animals were re-exposed to the context the next day (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Repeated-measures ANOVA indicated a significant effect between groups (F<sub>1,28</sub> = 97.9, p&lt;0.001) and a group × session × treatment interaction (F<sub>1,28</sub> = 8.72, p=0.006). Tukey’s post hoc revealed that in the 2S group, post-reactivation anisomycin led to a decrease in freezing during the test (p&lt;0.001), while the freezing levels of vehicle-treated animals remained constant (p=0.9). In contrast, freezing in the 10S group did not change across sessions in both animals that received vehicle (p=0.36) and anisomycin (p=0.25). This suggests that memories formed with the stronger training protocol (10S group) are resistant to change upon recall.</p><p>These data demonstrate that memories formed with 2- and 10-shock protocols exhibit significant differences at the behavioral level. Secondly, they show that 10-shock training creates maladaptive memories that trigger intense and generalized fear responses, are resistant to suppression by extinction, and are unable to flexibly change through reconsolidation.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Commonalities and differences in brain activation induced by recall of mild and strong fear memories</title><p>To investigate the neural mechanisms underlying the formation of mild and strong fear memories, we trained a new cohort of animals using the same CFC protocol as described in the previous experiments.

The nodes were ranked according to each metric to reveal their relative importance in the respective network. The degree centrality measures the number of connections each node in the network has to other nodes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). The betweenness centrality measures the instances in which a node acts as a bridge along the shortest path between two other nodes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). The nodal efficiency measures the inverse of the average shortest path length between a node and all other nodes in the network and reflects its ability to exchange information with other nodes, whereas the global efficiency reflects how well the network communicates as a whole and is computed as the average nodal efficiency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>).</p><p>In the 2S network, the CeA and the BLA were among the highest-ranked nodes across measurements, indicating a central and well-connected position in the network. In contrast, the amygdala nuclei ranked low in the other groups. In the NS group, this is consistent with the lack of conditioned fear observed in these animals. In the 10S group, however, where conditioned fear was highly expressed during recall, this lower ranking suggests a reduction in the functional interactions between the amygdala and the other brain regions. Therefore, the brain-wide functional integration of the CeA and BLA observed in the mild fear memory network seems to be reduced in the severe fear memory network.</p><p>To gain a better understanding of how each network differed regarding their connectivity patterns, centrality measures were compared using Kruskal–Wallis followed by Mann–Whitney tests. When analyzing degree (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>, right), it was found that there was a significant difference between groups (H = 0.226, df = 2, p=0.009), with the 2S network displaying higher degree values than NS and 10S (p&lt;0.05), which did not differ from each other (p=0.81). Regarding betweenness (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>, right), there was a significant overall group difference (H = 0.272, df = 2, p=0.005) and the mild memory network scored higher than the strong (p=0.009) but not the NS network (p=0.06), and the NS and 10S networks did not differ (p=0.25). The values of global efficiency also differed among the memory networks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>, right; H = 0.605, df = 2, p&lt;0.001). The 2S network displayed higher values than NS and 10S networks (p&lt;0.001), which did not differ from each other (p=0.32).</p><p>A feature of many complex networks, including anatomical and functional brain networks, is a small-world organization, which is characterized by a balance of high local clustering but a small number of steps separating each node (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bullmore and Sporns, 2009</xref>). This balance enables rapid specialized local processing and efficient global communication, resulting in a robust and efficient network structure. To determine whether the memory networks generated in this study display global efficiency comparable to that of small-world networks, random networks were generated using the Watts–Strogatz small-world model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Watts and Strogatz, 1998</xref>). The global efficiencies of the memory and random small-world networks were then compared through the calculation of the confidence interval for the difference between means (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>, right). The 2S memory network matched the global efficiency of its respective random networks (mean difference = 0.012, 95% CI [–0.031, 0.056]). In contrast, the global efficiency of the memory networks was lower than those of the respective random networks in the case of the NS group (mean difference = 0.236, 95% CI [0.161, 0.309]) and of the 10S group (mean difference = 0.288, 95% CI [0.284, 0.327]).</p><p>These results demonstrate that, among the brain structures measured here, the level of aversive intensity of memory has a critical impact on functional connectivity during recall. In comparison to the neutral and severe fear memory networks, the mild fear memory network displayed higher functional connections between brain regions (degree), more nodes connecting different parts of the network (betweenness), and higher efficiency in global information flow that was consistent with that of small-world networks (global efficiency). Overall, this suggests that during mild fear memory recall, fear expression driven by the amygdala is modulated by a large, integrated interregional system, but in strong fear memories this modulation is disrupted.</p><p>This visualization of functional networks shows a closely connected network for the mild memory group, in contrast to the fragmented networks observed for the neutral and strong fear memory groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). Clusters in the networks were identified using a leading eigenvector method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Newman, 2006</xref>). It revealed that in the mild memory network, there is a central cluster composed of the amygdala, Re, PV, and PL. A second cluster included the hippocampus, the IL, and RSC, and a third cluster comprised the cingulate cortex. This suggests that the amygdala is well positioned for interregional communication, potentially allowing for modulatory control of fear expression. This is not the case in the strong memory network where the BLA and CeA are close to each other but isolated from other regions, resulting in less modulatory control of fear.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>This study investigated how functional connectivity during fear memory recall varies depending on fear memory intensity. Utilizing mild and strong fear protocols, we were able to generate memories that exhibit remarkable differences in their behavioral and neuronal signatures. Specifically, we found that mild memories triggered moderate and precise behavioral responses that were susceptible to extinction and reconsolidation, while strong memories triggered robust and generalized responses and were resistant to both extinction and reconsolidation. When comparing the brain activity across 12 regions implicated in fear memory, we found that recall resulted in changes in overall activity in only a subset of these regions. However, when we examined coordinated activity patterns, we discovered striking differences in the functional networks that underlie mild and strong fear memory recall. Mild memories displayed a well-connected network with the amygdala, which was well-positioned to interact with and be influenced by several regions. However, such connectivity was absent in the strong fear memory network, which may underlie the observed high and generalized fear responses that are resistant to attenuation. These findings suggest that abnormal functional connectivity may be a core factor in maladaptive, severe fear memories.</p><p>To study brain differences between mild and strong fear memories, we used conditioning protocols of different intensities that generated fear memories remarkably differently at the behavioral level. Conditioning with 2 shocks resulted in a fear memory eliciting mild and discriminative fear responses, which could be attenuated by extinction, and its recall triggered reconsolidation. In contrast, a 10-foot shock training generated a strong fear memory that can be seen as maladaptive; it elicited high and generalized fear expression, which was resistant to undergo both extinction and reconsolidation. Importantly, our control animals were exposed to the conditioning chamber for an equivalent duration without being subjected to shocks, thus encoding and recalling a nonfearful contextual memory (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). The recall of these distinct memories resulted in differential brain activation in some structures. In line with the role of the amygdala (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bernabo et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gründemann et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Josselyn et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Maddox et al., 2019</xref>) and paraventricular nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Do-Monte et al., 2015b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Padilla-Coreano et al., 2012</xref>) in fear expression, we observed that c-fos counts in these structures increased as a function of the strength of the fear memory. Conversely, in the infralimbic cortex, c-fos expression was decreased in the 10S group, which is in line with its established role in safety learning and fear suppression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bloodgood et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Do-Monte et al., 2015a</xref>). Adding to the known involvement of the RSC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Todd et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Trask et al., 2021</xref>) and the Re (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Ramanathan et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Sierra et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Troyner et al., 2018</xref>) in modulating fear memory formation and expression, our results revealed neural activity in these structures was increased during mild memory recall, but not during strong memory recall, when compared to unshocked controls. Although the hippocampus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gründemann et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Josselyn et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Guo et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Haubrich and Nader, 2018b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Pedraza et al., 2016</xref>), prelimbic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">da Silva et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dixsaut and Gräff, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fernandez-Leon et al., 2021</xref>), and cingulate cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Finnie et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Haubrich et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Ortiz et al., 2019</xref>) are critical to contextual fear memory-related processes, we found no differences in their activation between groups, suggesting that the role of these structures in modulating the expression of fear of different intensities may not reflect in changes in overall activation levels.</p><p>The amygdala is a central hub for the processing of fear memory and fear expression during recall. It receives input from sensory areas and integrates this information with several other brain regions, such as the hippocampus and the prefrontal cortex, to generate adaptive fear responses. The projections to the amygdala from these regions modulate the intensity of fear responses, extinction learning, and the induction of reconsolidation. Consequently, the functional connectivity of the amygdala within a memory network plays a crucial role in determining the level of fear expression. Our initial assessment of mean coordinated activity supports this concept. We found that, in comparison with unconditioned controls, the overall correlation values of the amygdala with other brain regions increase during the recall of a mild fear memory, but not during the recall of a strong fear memory.</p><p>The functional networks analysis further evaluated the system-level interactions of different brain regions during the recall of mild and severe fear memories. Centrality measures were computed to assess the number of functional connections, hub nodes, and information flow throughout the network. These measures were increased during the recall of mild fear memories compared to untrained controls, and such an increase was not observed during the recall of strong fear memories. Moreover, only the mild fear memory network displayed a small-world organization, which allows for both specialized and efficient information processing in the network. These findings suggest that the expression of moderate and flexible fear memories involves an efficient, integrated activation of specific brain regions, which is not present in the recall of strong fear memories.</p><p>Importantly, both the basolateral and the central amygdala ranked high across the centrality measures assessed. Of particular importance is the high nodal efficiency ranking of the amygdala, indicating that it was a main central mediator of information flow throughout the network. Notably, the infralimbic cortex, a region known to suppress fear responses by sending inhibitory projections to the amygdala (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bouton et al., 2021</xref>), displayed the highest betweenness centrality during mild memory recall. However, during the recall of severe fear memory, the amygdala displayed a considerably lower ranking across centrality measures, similar to what was observed in control unconditioned animals. These changes in the network-level integration of the amygdala are apparent in the model depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>. In the 2S graph, the amygdala is at the center of a fully connected network and the IL is a critical bridge connecting the amygdalar module to the one containing the hippocampus and the retrosplenial cortex. In contrast, in the 10S graph, the amygdala is disconnected from the other regions. This indicates that the differences observed behaviorally during severe fear memory recall – high and generalized freezing and resistance to attenuation – coincided with a disruption in the functional connectivity of the amygdala with other regions that are important for regulating fear. To further elucidate the underlying mechanisms of fear memory strength in vivo, understanding the specific roles of individual network elements in fear regulation becomes essential. Future research will be important to probe the causal interplay among distinct nodes and edges, both individually and in combination, in shaping diverse aspects of fear expression.</p><p>To generate mild and strong fear memories, we based our conditioning parameters on methods that have shown distinct behavioral outcomes in prior studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Holehonnur et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Wang et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Poulos et al., 2016</xref>). To ensure a focused comparative analysis, our conditioning protocols differed only in the number of foot shocks and maintained consistent shock intensities and session durations. Yet, the number of shocks is not the only factor that can affect the strength of fear memories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gazarini et al., 2023</xref>). Other conditioning parameters, such as shock intensity, its predictability, and inter-shock intervals, can also play crucial roles. Moreover, different fear measures like freezing behavior, fear-potentiated startle, and inhibitory avoidance might manifest differently following varying conditioning protocols, adding another layer of complexity. A comprehensive understanding of fear memory strength will benefit from further studies scrutinizing these parameters and memory attributes. In addition, a growing body of evidence underscores the differences between males and females concerning fear memories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Fleischer and Frick, 2023</xref>). Given that our study was conducted only with male rats, future studies exploring sex differences will be instrumental in providing a more complete account of the network-level mechanisms underlying fear memory strength.</p><p>In summary, this study investigated the behavioral and neural differences during the recall of memories with varying levels of aversiveness. In contrast to memories formed with a 2-shock fear conditioning protocol, 10 shocks generate maladaptive memories with intense and generalized fear responses, resistance to extinction, and an inability to flexibly change through reconsolidation. The recall of these memories resulted in changes in brain activation across some, but not all, regions where c-fos was measured. Graph-based network analysis uncovered that moderate and flexible fear memory expression involves an efficient integrated activation of particular brain regions, which is absent in strong fear memories. These results provide a deeper understanding of fear memory by showing that functional connectivity during recall varies greatly depending on the level of aversiveness of the memory. It supports the notion that not only local synaptic mechanisms but also broader functional changes play a role in shaping fear memory strength. Moreover, these findings highlight the importance of studying the neural mechanisms involved with fear memory strength, as they may provide insight into the development of maladaptive memories and potential interventions for their treatment.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Subjects</title><p>Male Sprague–Dawley rats (275–300 g at arrival; Charles River, Quebec, Canada) were housed in pairs in plastic cages in a temperature-controlled environment (21–23°C) with ad libitum access to food and water and maintained on a 12 hr light/dark cycle (lights on at 7:00 A.M.).

The shortest path is the length of the path connecting two nodes with the lowest number of edges. The nodal efficiency of each node was calculated as the average inverse of the shortest path length to all other nodes in the network. For the nodal efficiency calculation, the average path distance considered the weight of the edges (i.e., 1/r value). The global efficiency denoted the average nodal efficiency of all nodes within a network. Comparisons of degree, betweenness, and global efficiency were conducted using Kruskal–Wallis tests followed by Mann–Whitney tests. For the small-world analysis, we generated 1000 random networks for each group using the Watts–Strogatz small-world model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Watts and Strogatz, 1998</xref>). To ensure that the random networks had a similar density and could provide a suitable comparison for global efficiency, these networks were generated enforcing a similar clustering coefficient (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Barrat et al., 2004</xref>) to their respective memory network (calculated with 1000 iterations per network). The global efficiency of the networks for the NS, 2S, and 10S groups was compared to their respective random networks by calculating the 95% confidence interval of the difference between means.</p><p>All statistical analysis and plots were generated using RStudio (R version 4.2.2, RStudio version 2022.12.0).</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>All procedures were approved by McGill's Animal Care Committee (Animal Use Protocol #2000-4512) and complied with the Canadian Council on Animal Care guidelines.</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s6"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="mdar"><label>MDAR checklist</label><media xlink:href="elife-88172-mdarchecklist1-v1.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="s7"><title>Data availability</title><p>All data generated and analyzed during this study are available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.280gb5mw3">https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.280gb5mw3</ext-link>.</p><p>The following dataset was generated:</p><p><element-citation publication-type="data" specific-use="isSupplementedBy" id="dataset1"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Haubrich</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name><name><surname>Nader</surname><given-names>K</given-names></name></person-group><year iso-8601-date="2023">2023</year><data-title>Network-level changes in the brain underlie fear memory strength</data-title><source>Dryad Digital Repository</source><pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.5061/dryad.280gb5mw3</pub-id></element-citation></p></sec><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We are grateful to Karine Gamache for technical support and Karine Gamache, Matteo Bernabo, and Isabelle Groves for their insights during the writing of the manuscript.

Mild, 2-shock memory recruits a 'small-world' network in which amygdalar regions are functionally connected to other regions that modulate their activity and behavioral output, whereas strong, 10-shock memory isolates amygdalar nuclei from the rest of the network. These different patterns of correlated neural activity correspond with functional/behavioral differences - the authors confirm that weak, 2-shock memory is more effectively extinguished and is susceptible to reconsolidation relative to strong, 10-shock memory.</p><p>One major drawback of the manuscript is the fact that the data were collected from male subjects only.

One might expect similar behavioral outcomes from male and female rats receiving 2shock and 10-shock training. However, increasing attention to sex as a biological variable has revealed an interesting truth, namely that males and females can engage distinct neural pathways to arrive at the same behavioral destination. It should not be taken for granted that retrieval of aversive contextual associations would reproduce the same networks in females, and, as such, the manuscript does not give a complete accounting of the phenomenon under study.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for highlighting the importance of sex differences in fear memory and for encouraging us to discuss this issue. We agree that males and females can engage different behavioral and circuit mechanisms and that our findings may not be generalizable to female rats. We expanded the discussion section to state this limitation and to suggest future directions for research on sex differences in fear memory:</p><p>“In addition, a growing body of evidence underscores the differences between males and females concerning fear memories (Fleischer and Frick, 2023). Given that our study was conducted only with male rats, future studies exploring sex differences will be instrumental in providing a more complete account of the network-level mechanisms underlying fear memory strength.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The aversive associative memories described by the authors are characterized as mild or strong. More analysis of the meaning of memory strength, and its relationship to conditioning parameters, is needed.</p><p>In particular, the authors should discuss issues such as amount of training, US magnitude, and rate of shock delivery. If amount of training is important, would 2 vs 10 presentations of a milder shock produce the same networks at retrieval? Would a larger shock require fewer presentations to isolate amygdalar regions from the rest of the network? If the shocks were presented at the same rate during training, would you get the same result in both groups? More data examining these questions would be ideal, but, in the absence of that, a discussion of these issues is needed and missing from the manuscript in its current form.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer's feedback on the characterization of the fear memories in our study and agree that the labels &quot;mild&quot; and &quot;strong&quot; could oversimplify the complex nature of fear memories. Our study's main objective was not to delineate how varying conditioning protocols result in 'mild' or 'strong' fear memories, but to employ protocols of different intensities known to produce distinct behaviors, and then discern their brain differences. Our categorization was rooted in the resulting behavioral expressions, classifying 'mild' memories as those triggering sub-maximal fear responses with low generalization and a potential for extinction learning and reconsolidation. Conversely, 'strong' memories were defined by peak or near-peak fear responses, high generalization, and impeded extinction and reconsolidation processes. To isolate the number of foot shocks as the sole variable, we kept both shock intensity and session duration constant. While this decision allowed for a clear comparative analysis, we acknowledge its limitations in exploring other influential factors.</p><p>A more ideal approach would be to reverse this process—first experimenting with several different conditioning parameters and then observing the resulting behaviors and brain mechanisms—but given the additional workload that would entail, particularly when combined with the c-fos and network analyses, we opted for our current approach. Nevertheless, we hope our study will stimulate research that goes deeper into the nuances of fear conditioning protocols, fostering a better understanding of adaptive and maladaptive fear memories. This is now discussed in the discussion session:</p><p>“To generate mild and strong fear memories, we based our conditioning parameters on methods that have shown distinct behavioral outcomes in prior studies (Haubrich et al., 2020, 2015; Holehonnur et al., 2016; Poulos et al., 2016; Wang et al., 2009). To ensure a focused comparative analysis, our conditioning protocols differed only in the number of foot shocks, and maintained consistent shock intensities and session durations. Yet, the number of shocks is not the only factors that can affect the strength of fear memories (Gazarini et al., 2023). Other conditioning parameters, such as shock intensity, its predictability, and inter-shock intervals, can also play crucial roles. Moreover, different fear measures like freezing behavior, fear-potentiated startle, and inhibitory avoidance might manifest differently following varying conditioning protocols, adding another layer of complexity. A comprehensive understanding of fear memory strength will benefit from further studies scrutinizing these parameters and memory attributes.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2</bold></p><p>One alternative account to the weak vs. strong memory distinction made in the paper is the opportunity for extinction in the 2S compared to the 10S group. In the 2S group, the last shock occurs in the 3rd minute, leaving 9 minutes of context exposure without reinforcement to follow. This is not the case for the 10S group. If context fear extinction is engaged during this time, then this would mean that two memories (acquisition and extinction) are taking place in the 2S group, weakening the fear memory in this group, setting up the ground for stronger effects of extinction, less generalization and of course potential greater connectivity required for representing and linking these memories. Indeed, the IL, a brain area linked to extinction, is more predominant in the connectivity map of the 2S compared to the 10S group. While testing this alternative is beyond the scope of this paper, it will need to be discussed.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for raising this interesting point. We agree that the structure of the 2S protocol might inadvertently provide an opportunity for within-session extinction. However, we would like to clarify that we made a mistake in the description of the 2S training protocol. The timing of the shock deliveries was not at the second and third minutes as stated (a usual protocol in the literature), but at the sixth and seventh minutes. We apologize for this mistake and are thankful for your help in identifying this discrepancy which had unfortunately persisted despite multiple proofreading rounds. We have amended this detail in the methods section of our manuscript.</p><p>Nevertheless, we recognize that the subsequent minutes post-shock in the 2S group may still provide a window for potential extinction. To address this possibility, we scored the freezing expression during the training session minute by minute. In the 2S group, two videos were corrupted, and it was only possible to score freezing in six out of eight animals (this is acknowledged in the methods section). As presented in Figure 1.A (middle plot), freezing behavior increased post-shocks and showed no decline towards the session's end. These findings suggest that within-session extinction did not occur during our conditioning session. This analysis is now integrated into the relevant results subsection.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Methodological detail is lacking re the timeline of study, and connectivity analyses.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your feedback. The formula for the discrimination index is now explained in the methods section. The new plot showing freezing behavior during training shows the exact time bin when shocks were delivered. We have expanded the description of the connectivity analysis.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Major concerns)</bold></p><p>1. Previous studies including Karim's lab have shown that protein synthesis in the hippocampus is required for the reconsolidation of contextual fear memory and that the retrieval of contextual fear memory activates gene expression such as c-fos in the hippocampus. However, the authors failed to confirm this observation. This may be due to the small number of rats or some technical problems.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this insightful observation. We believe that the absence of the expected increase in hippocampal c-fos activation is due to the unique experimental design employed for our control group. In our study, control rats were subjected to an equivalent duration of context exposure without receiving shocks. As a result, these animals formed and retrieved a neutral, rather than fearful, contextual memory. This likely elevated cfos levels in the hippocampus in comparison to the more traditional home-cage condition frequently used in earlier studies. We used the NS (no shock) protocol for our control group to specifically elucidate the impact of the number of shock presentations on memory formation, therefore the context exposure was kept the same across groups. Importantly, this aspect did not affect our connectivity analysis, since it is influenced by the relative variance across structures than on the absolute magnitude of c-fos expression. We now emphasize the nature of our control group in the discussion:</p><p>“Importantly, our control animals were exposed to the conditioning chamber for an equivalent duration without being subjected to shocks, thus encoding and recalling a non-fearful contextual memory.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. The author's computation analyses suggested differences in neural networks activated by the retrieval of mild and strong fear memories. The results of computer analysis are interesting. However, it is not clear whether such results are actually occurring in vivo. At this moment, the author's findings are not a conclusion, but rather a suggestion or hypothesis. Therefore, it is also important to conduct interventional experiments to evaluate the validity of the authors' findings. Specifically, the authors' results could be validated by analyzing the effects of inhibition of specific brain regions on mild and strong fear memories retrieval using such as DREADD and other methods. These experiments seem hard, but would greatly improve the quality of the manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer's perspective and acknowledge the limitations of our current findings. While our data based on c-fos expression suggests functional connections reflective of neural activity during fear memory recall, we agree that it is not possible to deduce causality from this alone. Instead, our study aimed to uncover the network-level distinctions between mild and strong memories, laying the groundwork for subsequent, in-depth investigations of the causal relationships within these identified pathways. We agree that corroborating our findings with interventional experiments, such as using DREADDs, is an important next step. We also agree that such experiments would enhance our study and hope future research will address these points. These points were included in the discussion session:</p><p>“To further elucidate the underlying mechanisms of fear memory strength in vivo, understanding the specific roles of individual network elements in fear regulation becomes essential. Future research will be important to probe the causal interplay among distinct nodes and edges, both individually and in combination, in shaping diverse aspects of fear expression.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>Methodological detail is lacking:</p><p>How is the discrimination index calculated?</p></disp-quote><p>We have included this information in the methods section: “The generalization index was calculated as Freezing in Test B / (Freezing in Test A + Freezing in Test B).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>A distinction between complete spontaneous recovery (10S group) vs. partial spontaneous recovery (2S group) vs. extinction retention needs to be considered in discussing the extinction data.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this suggestion. To address this point, we now include Tukey’s post hoc comparisons between the first and last bins of extinction and the test session. The results show that in the 2S group, freezing during test remained consistent with the levels observed in the final extinction bin and was lower than the levels in the initial extinction bin. Conversely, in the 10S group, freezing levels increased from the final extinction bin to the test, reaching levels comparable to those observed in the initial extinction bin.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Detail regarding the connectivity analyses is missing from the methods. For example the calculation of the r value distractions should be detailed in the methods not just the results, more detail regarding calculations is needed for the degree of centrality, betweenness centrality, nodal efficiency, small world analyses etc.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer’s feedback. We have expanded the description of the connectivity analysis.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Justification for 'excluding edges with r values lower than the average plus one standard deviation of all 292 networks (Figure 4.B; r &lt; 0.61)' is needed.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your encouraging us to elaborate on the rationale behind our thresholding method. We acknowledge that there is no consensus in the literature on the optimal thresholding method for functional networks. Our primary objective with thresholding was to retain the most robust connections while minimizing potential noise from weakly correlated regions. Instead of opting for an arbitrary threshold, we determined our cut-off based on the average plus one standard deviation across all networks. Theoretically, this retains approximately the top 16% of connections. Given our 12 regions of interest, this translates to roughly 10 connections per network. This count is sufficient for a nuanced analysis of the network structures and between group comparisons.Importantly, our method inherently accounts for variations in interregional correlations across groups. Groups with a distribution skewed towards higher r values will naturally have more edges, highlighting the enhanced synchronized activity between certain regions. On the other hand, networks with tendencies towards lower r-values will exhibit fewer connections. Thus, our thresholding method is rooted in the data’s distribution and result in networks that reflect the differences across groups.</p><p>We added the following sentence to the methods session summarizing this rationale:</p><p>“This thresholding approach was used to provide a cut-off based on the data’s inherent distribution, therefore retaining the top edges according to the data variance. “</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 81 - 'brain areas' is missing after '12'.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you, this is now fixed.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Tile for 2. is somewhat odd.
