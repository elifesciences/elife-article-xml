ADHD is the most prevalent neurodevelopmental disorder in children worldwide and is characterized by atypical levels of inattention, hyperactivity, and/or impulsivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">American Psychiatric Association, 2013</xref>). Structural magnetic resonance imaging studies have highlighted that children with ADHD show widespread morphological differences, such as in the basal ganglia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Nakao et al., 2011</xref>), subcortical areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hoogman et al., 2017</xref>), and frontal, cingulate, and temporal cortices, compared to children without the disorder (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hoogman et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Shaw et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Consistently identifying the neuroanatomical substrate of ADHD, however, remains challenging. A recent meta-analysis did not find convergence across the literature on brain differences in children and adolescents with ADHD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Samea et al., 2019</xref>). One possible explanation for this inconsistency is the multifaceted nature of ADHD, in which children with the disorder have heterogeneous presentations on several cognitive and emotional domains, which could stem from distinct brain structural substrates. Other explanations regard study design. If suboptimal, it may lead to biased estimates and lack of generalizability, thus potentially concealing robust and replicable relations of brain morphology with ADHD. The present study focuses on confounding, a common source of bias in etiological studies.</p><p>Confounding bias arises when a third variable affects both the determinant (independent variable) and outcome (dependent variable) of interest (i.e., is a common cause) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">VanderWeele, 2019</xref>). Confounding leads to over- or underestimation of the true effect between determinant and outcome and can even change the direction of an association. To minimize confounding bias, appropriate confounder control is paramount, although it is challenging, especially in observational studies like most neuroimaging studies of ADHD. Previous literature and expert knowledge can guide the identification of potential confounders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hernan and Robins, 2020</xref>), which can then be appropriately adjusted for in regression models or using methods such as restriction, standardization, or propensity scores.</p><p>Within neuroimaging studies of ADHD, except for a few large investigations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hoogman et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Mous et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bernanke et al., 2022</xref>), studies have generally matched or adjusted for a few demographic variables (e.g., age and sex) and neuroimaging metrics or parameters. Of the 19 studies included in a systematic review of neuroimaging studies on ADHD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Saad et al., 2020</xref>), 17 adjusted or matched for age in their analyses, 14 for sex, 9 for neuroimaging-related variables like head motion during scanning, and 8 for the intelligence quotient (IQ) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1a</xref>). Further potential confounders should, however, be considered. For instance, socioeconomic status (SES) is related to both higher risk for ADHD and variation in cortical brain structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Russell et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Noble et al., 2015</xref>). Thus, it is likely a confounder. Lack of adjustment for SES may have therefore concealed key relations between ADHD and brain structure. Adjustment choices are dependent on the availability of large samples with data on a wide variety of covariates, which has to date been limited for psychiatric neuroimaging studies. Yet, this is rapidly changing with the advent of population neuroscience, which entails large-scale studies with neurobiological data. This lends new opportunities for further confounder adjustments to be considered in neuroimaging studies of ADHD. Conversely, previous studies have adjusted for IQ and head motion, which may not be confounders in the association between ADHD symptoms and the brain, and may thus have led to further bias in the results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dennis et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>In this study, we examined the association between brain structure and ADHD symptoms and how the selection and control for potential confounders may affect results (aim 1). Moreover, we discussed the complex role of IQ and head motion in brain structure–ADHD associations and the potential consequences of adjusting for them (aim 2). We leveraged two large, population-based cohorts: the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) and the Generation R Studies. In line with most neuroimaging studies, we adopted a cross-sectional design.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Associations between ADHD symptoms and brain morphology are widespread</title><p>We analyzed data from 10-year-old children from the ABCD (<italic>N</italic> = 7722, multisite) and Generation R (<italic>N</italic> = 2531, single-site) Studies (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1b</xref>).

We ran vertex-wise linear regression models for ADHD with cortical surface area, volume, and thickness. Results for surface area, which constituted the main findings here, are presented in-text, while findings for volume and thickness in the figure supplements. We adjusted for demographic and study characteristics which have been generally considered by previous literature (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1a</xref>): age, sex, ethnicity, and study site (ABCD only).

Across both cohorts, we consistently identified clusters for surface area in the lateral occipital, postcentral, rostral middle and superior frontal, and superior parietal cortices. For cortical thickness, we found two small frontal clusters in the ABCD Study (16.1 cm<sup>2</sup>) and no clusters in the Generation R Study, which suggests that cortical thickness does not relate or does not relate strongly to ADHD, in line with prior literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hoogman et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Significant clusters in the association of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) symptoms with cortical surface area based on the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) and Generation R Studies, for model 1.</title><p><italic>Note</italic>.

Thus, confounding by socioeconomic factors in the relation between ADHD and brain morphology is likely. We therefore additionally adjusted for a second set of confounders (model 2) related to SES: household income, maternal education, and maternal age at childbirth.</p><p>Moreover, several factors concerning maternal behavior, pre- and postnatally, have been associated with both ADHD and brain morphology. For instance, prenatal exposure to substances is known to increase the risk of developing ADHD symptoms and has been associated with variation in cerebral volume and surface area (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Eilertsen et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lees et al., 2020</xref>).

While we used the same processing pipelines and similar quality control procedures and measures across cohorts, potential reasons for discrepancies in results must be discussed. First, the larger sample size of the ABCD Study allows for greater power to detect smaller effects, which led to larger associated areas. Second, the multisite structure of the ABCD Study may have introduced noise in the results (e.g., by different scanners, demographic differences), and determined the identification of associations which are not replicable in the Generation R Study. Third, the two studies include children from different populations. While both are very diverse samples, the ABCD Study is comprised of a more heterogeneous sample from the US population, which, for instance, is characterized by a wider variety of ethnicities and cultures, potentially permitting the discovery of more associations.

This could indicate that IQ is a confounder, in which case adjustments would be necessary, or that IQ is a mediator or collider, in which case adjustments must be avoided.</p><p>First, based on previous literature and this study, the association between ADHD and IQ is relatively weak (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dennis et al., 2009</xref>) (<italic>r</italic><sub>ABCD</sub> = −0.11, <italic>r</italic><sub>GENR</sub> = −0.14), but this does not necessarily make it a weak confounder as the strength of confounding is due to a variable’s relation with the exposure <italic>and</italic> outcome.

However, head motion, rather than inducing confounding bias, creates measurement error (information bias). When adjusting for head motion during scanning, we observed increases in the spatial extent of the clusters. This might indicate a reduction or an increase in bias. First, bias might have been reduced by adjusting for the fact that children with ADHD will have more error in their cortical measures. Second, bias might have also been increased because we conditioned for head motion, which is a consequence of ADHD.</p><p>Overall, the role of head motion in the relation between brain structure and ADHD is complex and warrants the utmost care.

However, this was not possible for the ABCD Study, which started sampling at child ages 9–10 years. Future research on the temporal relations between potential confounders, ADHD, and brain structure will aid the minimization of confounding bias when investigating the structural substrates of ADHD.</p><p>Third, while we leveraged both symptom-level and diagnostic data for ADHD, this was done within population-based studies. Our results cannot, therefore, be generalized to a clinical population. Future research could examine the extent to which associations between brain structure and ADHD change after adjustments for likely confounders in clinical samples.</p><p>In conclusion, leveraging an empirical example from two large studies on neuroanatomy and ADHD symptoms, we highlighted the opportunity for future studies to consider further key confounders. These can be identified based on prior literature and causal diagrams as well as be readily collected, offering a feasible venue for future research. Adjusting for these potential confounders helped identify more refined cortical associations with ADHD symptoms, robust to the influence of demographic and socioeconomic factors, pregnancy exposures, and maternal psychopathology. We also evaluated the potential role of IQ, which could be a mediator, collider, and/or confounder. While adjusting for IQ led to reductions in associations, these would, however, likely not be attributable to reduced confounding bias. Lastly, we explored how head motion reflects information, rather than confounding bias. We discussed the generalizability of these considerations on confounding bias to psychiatric neuroimaging, and suggest a workflow that can be followed to minimize confounding bias in future studies.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Participants</title><p>We analyzed data from two independent population-based cohorts: the ABCD Study and the Generation R Study. The ABCD Study is conducted across 21 study sites in the US and recruited since 2015 children aged 9–10 at baseline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Garavan et al., 2018</xref>). The Generation R Study is based in Rotterdam, the Netherlands, with data collection spanning from fetal life until early adulthood, and started in 2002 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kooijman et al., 2016</xref>). Details of the sampling rationale, recruitment, methods, and procedures have been described elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kooijman et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Garavan et al., 2018</xref>). Research protocols for the ABCD Study were approved by the institutional review board of the University of California, San Diego (#160091), and the institutional review boards of the 21 data collection sites, while the design of the Generation R Study was approved by the Medical Ethics Committee of the Erasmus MC (METC-2012-165). For both studies, written informed consent and assent from the primary caregiver or child were obtained.</p><p>In this cross-sectional study, we leveraged data from the baseline assessment of the ABCD Study (release 2.0.1) and the 10-year assessment of the Generation R Study. Both waves included behavioral and neuroimaging measures. We included children with data on ADHD symptoms and T<sub>1</sub>-weighted MRI images. Participants were excluded if (1) they had dental braces, (2) incidental findings, (3) their brain scans failed processing or quality assurance procedures, or (4) they were twins or triplets. Of note, excluding children with dental braces is unlikely to determine selection bias by SES in either the ABCD or the Generation R Study as the former cohort covered the costs of dental braces removal for all children who enrolled, while dental care is insured for all children in the Netherlands. Within the Generation R Study, a small set of participants were additionally excluded because they had a different scan sequence. Finally, for each non-twin sibling set, one was randomly included to minimize shared method variance bias. Flowcharts for participant inclusion and exclusion are available in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>.

The attention problem syndrome scale (20 items) measures inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity and has been previously shown to have clinical utility and to discriminate between ADHD cases and controls (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Eiraldi et al., 2000</xref>). Attention problems were analyzed on a discrete scale (range 0–19). For the ABCD Study, we repeated the analysis using present ADHD diagnosis from a parent-reported and computerized version of the KSADS-5. This is a dimensional and categorical assessment used to diagnose current and past psychiatric disorders according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (Fifth Edition) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kaufman et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kobak, 2020</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-2-2"><title>Image acquisition</title><p>T<sub>1</sub>-weighted data were obtained on multiple 3T scanners in the ABCD Study (Siemens Prisma, General Electric (GE) 750 and Philips) and one scanner in the Generation R Study (GE 750). Standard adult-sized coils were used for the ABCD Study and an eight-channel receive-only head coil for the Generation R Study. To acquire T<sub>1</sub>-weighted structural images, the ABCD Study used an inversion prepared RF-spoiled gradient echo scan with prospective motion correction while the Generation R Study used an inversion recovery fast spoiled gradient recalled sequence (GE option = BRAVO, TR = 8.77 ms, TE = 3.4 ms, TI = 600 ms, flip angle = 10°, matrix size = 220 × 220, field of view = 220 × 220 mm, slice thickness = 1 mm, number of slices = 230, ARC acceleration factor = 2).

Cortical surface maps were smoothed with a full width of a half-maximum Gaussian kernel of 10 mm. Within the ABCD Study, quality assessment was based on manual and automated quality control procedures and recommended inclusion criteria for structural data from the ABCD team (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hagler et al., 2019</xref>).

Household combined net income (&lt;$50,000, ≥$50,000 and &lt;$100,000, ≥$100,000) and highest parental education (&lt;high school, high school diploma/GED, some college, bachelor degree, postgraduate degree) were self-reported by the primary caregiver in the Parent Demographics Survey. Maternal age at childbirth was measured in the Developmental History Questionnaire. Tobacco and cannabis use during pregnancy were retrospectively reported by the mother (yes, no, I do not know) in the Developmental History Questionnaire. Caregiver psychopathology was obtained from the Total Problems Adult Self Report Syndrome Scale. The Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-6 Matrix Reasoning total scaled score was used as a proxy for IQ.

Family income and highest maternal education were obtained through prospective self-reports by the mother and/or father at child age 5 years. Maternal education was coded into low (no/primary education), intermediate (secondary school, vocational training), and high (Bachelor’s degree/University). Household net monthly income was classified as low (&lt;2000 euros), middle (2000–3200 euros), and high (&gt;3200 euros). Maternal postnatal psychopathology, measured at child age 6 months, was prospectively reported by the mother based on the Brief Symptom Inventory questionnaire global severity index. Mothers prospectively reported smoking (never used, used) and cannabis use during pregnancy (no use vs. use during pregnancy). Non-verbal child IQ was measured at child age 5 years, based on the Snijders-Oomen Niet-Verbale Intelligentie Test (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Tellegen and Laros, 1998</xref>), a validated Dutch non-verbal intelligence test.

While we used the same processing pipelines and similar quality control procedures and measures across cohorts, potential reasons for discrepancies of results must be discussed. First, the larger sample size of the ABCD Study allows for greater power to detect smaller effects, which led to larger associated areas. Second, the multi-site structure of the ABCD Study may have introduced noise in the results (e.g., by different scanners, demographic differences), and determined the identification of associations which are not replicable in the Generation R Study. Third, the two studies include children from different populations. While both are very diverse samples, the ABCD Study sample is comprised of a more heterogeneous sample from the U.S. population, which, for instance, is characterized by a wider variety of ethnicities and cultures, potentially permitting the discovery of more associations. Nevertheless, there was considerable overlap in the findings from the ABCD and Generation R Studies, with consistencies across cohorts indicating the most robust and generalizable associations.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Given the nature of ADHD, it is important to evaluate the influence of preprocessing pipeline (quality control steps), motion parameters, and even time of day.

To address it, we further specified the similarities and differences in the pipelines across the two cohorts. First, we clarified the text to better emphasize that many of the processing steps, including the manual quality control, were performed similarly between the two cohorts, with the processing in FreeSurfer being identical. Second, we further aligned the steps in the procedures that we were able to, i.e., applying the inclusion/exclusion criteria in the same order and adding an additional step to exclude incidental findings consistently across the two studies. Third, we mentioned the potential influence of neuroimaging related information, such as head motion and time of the day, in the Discussion section (for in-depth information see Reviewer #2, comment 2).</p><p>Changes are shown below:</p><p>Methods (page 19):</p><p>“FreeSurfer (version 6.0.0) was used for both cohorts for image processing, which was run in-house to maximize comparability across cohorts.”</p><p>Methods (page 19):</p><p>“Within the ABCD Study, quality assessment was based on manual and automated quality control procedures and recommended inclusion criteria for structural data from the ABCD team (1).

We have also clarified why all findings are reported as cm<sup>2</sup> (for in-depth information see Reviewer #1, comment 2). Manuscript changes are shown below, in-text and in the Supplement.

To address it, we have focused on surface area, which, as the Reviewer rightly pointed out, provides the main finding of this project. More specifically, the main text is now built around the results of the analyses of surface area. At the same time, results for volume and thickness (analyses run to address <italic>Essential revisions</italic>, <italic>comment 3</italic>) are also described, partly in-text and in the <italic>Supplementary Figures</italic>.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It's also completely unclear why both surface area and volume measures are given in units of cm2. That unit is appropriate for area, but volume is a 3-dimensional measure, so it should be reported in cm3 (or mm3).</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the Reviewer that this comes across as incorrect. For completeness: The clusters relate to the surface of the cerebral cortex, and the clusters reflect the surface that associates with ADHD symptoms. That surface is expressed in cm<sup>2</sup>. At the level of the vertex we indeed consider different characteristics, such as thickness (mm/cm), area (mm<sup>2</sup>/cm<sup>2</sup>), and volume (mm<sup>3</sup>/cm<sup>3</sup>). The vertices that reach statistical significance cover a certain area, and it is this area that we report in the results. We have clarified the text of the <italic>Methods</italic> section and the <italic>Results section</italic> (to explicitly state it at first occurrence):</p><p>Methods (page 21):</p><p>“For the results we primarily reported cluster sizes, i.e., the area of the cerebral cortex that was statistically significantly associated with ADHD symptoms.

However, the significant clusters were different (ABCD showed more widespread regions while GenR showed more localized regions).

Please discuss the possible reasons.</p></disp-quote><p>We addressed this important comment by specifying the use of the same processing pipelines and similar motion quality control as well as including a paragraph in the <italic>Discussion section</italic> highlighting potential reasons for inconsistencies across cohorts. Such changes have been aforementioned in Essential Revisions, comment 1. Furthermore, the differences in widespread versus localized findings could reflect greater power in the ABCD Study (due to large sample size) to detect smaller effects. On top of the aforementioned changes (<italic>Essential Revisions, comment 1</italic>), we added a sentence about power as a possible explanation for the differences in the <italic>Discussion section</italic>, as shown below.</p><p>Discussion (pages 21-22):</p><p>“First, the larger sample size of the ABCD Study allows for greater power to detect smaller effects, which led to larger associated areas.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Although the authors have discussed why this study did not consider head motion, it is interesting to see how the scanner acquisition protocol processing parameters and head motion confounds affect the brain morphology-ADHD associations for these two datasets.

We have therefore examined the potential role of head motion in the relations between brain structure and ADHD by using causal diagrams and have additionally adjusted for it in another model. Briefly, head motion, rather than inducing confounding bias, induces measurement error (information bias) in the brain morphology values. Head motion during scanning often results from ADHD symptoms, determining a non-causal path from ADHD to brain structure through motion. In this case, adjustments for head motion can cause both increases or decreases in bias. Increases in bias can occur because head motion is a consequence of ADHD, and consequences of outcomes should not be adjusted for. Decreases in bias can occur because the non-causal path through head motion would be closed with adjustments. Further information is shown in-text and reported below:</p><p>Introduction (page 4):</p><p>“Of the 19 studies included in a systematic review of neuroimaging studies on ADHD (5), 17 adjusted or matched for age in their analyses, 14 for sex, 9 for neuroimaging-related variables like head motion during scanning, and 8 for the intelligence quotient (IQ)</p><p>(Supplementary File 1a).</p><p>[…]</p><p>Conversely, previous studies have adjusted for IQ and head motion, which may not be confounders in the association between ADHD symptoms and the brain, and may thus have led to further bias in the results (6).</p><p>In this study, we examined the association between brain structure and ADHD symptoms and how the selection and control for potential confounders may affect results (aim 1). Moreover, we discussed the complex role of IQ and head motion in brain structure – ADHD associations and the potential consequences of adjusting for them (aim 2).”</p><p>Results (pages 9-10):</p><p>Head motion does not induce confounding bias, but information bias</p><p>A final scenario was also included, to reflect the commonly used adjustments for head motion during scanning (Supplementary File 1a). Motion can be a large source of bias in neuroimaging studies which is important to address. While it does not meet the criteria for confounding as it is not a common cause of ADHD problems and brain morphology (7), head motion can induce measurement error of brain morphology (8) (Figure 7). This is also referred to as information bias and can distort estimates from their true value.</p><p>The amount of measurement error in brain morphology may differ across children with vs without ADHD. In fact, children with impulsivity and inattention have been shown to move more during MRI scanning (9,10), determining different levels of error in the brain morphology assessments (Figure 7, path from ADHD symptoms to motion to error in MRI measurement). In this scenario, adjusting for motion might lead to two situations. On one hand, since motion is a consequence of the outcome (ADHD), adjustments would lead to bias (11). On the other hand, not adjusting for motion would also lead to bias because part of the observed relation between ADHD symptoms and brain structure would be due to the higher head motion (and thus the underestimation of the cortical values) of children with ADHD. In this study, we explored the effect of adjusting for motion during scanning in the relation between brain morphology and ADHD (model 5).</p><p>Adjustments for motion led to increases in clusters</p><p>After additional adjustments for head motion, the spatial extent of the clusters generally increased. For surface area, compared to model 3, clusters increased from 760.2 cm<sup>2</sup> to 936.4 cm<sup>2</sup> ( = +23.2%) for the ABCD Study and from 208.6 cm<sup>2</sup> to 239.7 cm<sup>2</sup> ( = +14.9%) for the Generation R Study (Figure 8). Clusters of associations consistently found across cohorts were highly similar to the ones identified in model 3. Results for cortical volume and thickness are shown in Figure 8 – Supplement 1.</p><p>Discussion (pages 13-14):</p><p>There is no easy fix for dealing with head motion in brain morphology – ADHD associations</p><p>Adjustments for neuroimaging covariates, such as head motion, are often run to reduce confounding bias. However, head motion, rather than inducing confounding bias, creates measurement error (information bias). When adjusting for head motion during scanning, we observed increases in the spatial extent of the clusters. This might indicate a reduction or an increase in bias. First, bias might have been reduced by adjusting for the fact that children with ADHD will have more error in their cortical measures. Second, bias might have also been increased because we conditioned for head motion, which is a consequence of ADHD.</p><p>Overall, the role of head motion in the relation between brain structure and ADHD is complex and warrants the utmost care. Adjusting or not could both lead to bias, meaning that considering which bias might be strongest is necessary. Moreover, methods aiming to reduce information bias should be leveraged (12); however, further developments are needed for their application to the neuroimaging field.</p><p>Similar considerations should be applied to other neuroimaging parameters which often are indicators of information bias rather than confounders in brain structure – ADHD relations (e.g., time of the day, scanner). For instance, time of the day has been shown to influence morphometric values (13,14), leading to information bias. If we expect for ADHD symptoms to influence the time of the day in which children with ADHD vs. without come to the scanner (differential information bias), the same considerations as for head motion would apply. If instead, children with ADHD and without will come to the MRI at similar times of the day (non-differential information bias), then adjustments for time of the day would be appropriate and reduce the measurement error.”</p><p>Discussion (page 14):</p><p>“Our considerations on confounding likely generalize to the psychiatric neuroimaging field, as several confounders considered here (e.g., SES) also relate to brain function and other psychiatric disorders (15–17). Similarly, other psychiatric disorders are also characterized by complex relations with IQ (18). Moreover, mental health problems featuring state anxiety, like internalizing and externalizing symptoms, have also been related to increased head motion during scanning (19).”</p><p>Methods (pages 19-20):</p><p>For The ABCD Study:</p><p>“We used the Euler number obtained from FreeSurfer as a proxy for head motion during the acquisition.
