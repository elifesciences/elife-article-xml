Our group has previously reported that sclerostin in expressed locally at high levels throughout a developing spinal fusion. However, the role of sclerostin in controlling bone fusion remains to be established.</p></sec><sec id="abs2"><title>Methods:</title><p>We computationally identified two FDA-approved drugs, as well as a single novel small-molecule drug, for their ability to disrupt the interaction between sclerostin and its receptor, LRP5/6. The drugs were tested in several in vitro biochemical assays using murine MC3T3 and MSCs, assessing their ability to (1) enhance canonical Wnt signaling, (2) promote the accumulation of the active (non-phosphorylated) form of β-catenin, and (3) enhance the intensity and signaling duration of BMP signaling. These drugs were then tested subcutaneously in rats as standalone osteoinductive agents on plain collagen sponges. Finally, the top drug candidates (called VA1 and C07) were tested in a rabbit posterolateral spine fusion model for their ability to achieve a successful fusion at 6 wk.</p></sec><sec id="abs3"><title>Results:</title><p>We show that by controlling GSK3b phosphorylation our three small-molecule inhibitors (SMIs) simultaneously enhance canonical Wnt signaling and potentiate canonical BMP signaling intensity and duration. We also demonstrate that the SMIs produce dose-dependent ectopic mineralization in vivo in rats as well as significantly increase posterolateral spine fusion rates in rabbits in vivo, both as standalone osteogenic drugs and in combination with autologous iliac crest bone graft.</p></sec><sec id="abs4"><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Few if any osteogenic small molecules possess the osteoinductive potency of BMP itself – that is, the ability to form de novo ectopic bone as a standalone agent. Herein, we describe two such SMIs that have this unique ability and were shown to induce de novo bone in a stringent in vivo environment. These SMIs may have the potential to be used in novel, cost-effective bone graft substitutes for either achieving spinal fusion or in the healing of critical-sized fracture defects.</p></sec><sec id="abs5"><title>Funding:</title><p>This work was supported by a Veteran Affairs Career Development Award (IK2-BX003845).</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>sclerostin</kwd><kwd>small molecules</kwd><kwd>osteogenesis</kwd><kwd>spinal fusion</kwd><kwd>canonical Wnt</kwd><kwd>rabbit - other organism</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Rat</kwd><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000738</institution-id><institution>U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>IK2-BX003845</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Fernandes</surname><given-names>Lorenzo M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000738</institution-id><institution>U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>I01BX001516</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Beck</surname><given-names>George R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000738</institution-id><institution>U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>I01 BX004708</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Drissi</surname><given-names>Hicham</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000738</institution-id><institution>U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>I01 BX004878</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Drissi</surname><given-names>Hicham</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Locally delivered small-molecule sclerostin inhibitors are able to promote local osteogenesis in vitro and in clinically relevant in vivo models by simultaneously activating the canonical Wnt and BMP signaling pathways.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The current bone grafting options available to aid orthopedic surgeons in either the repair of fractures with significant bone loss or in the achievement of spinal fusions continue to have serious limitations. Thus, autologous iliac crest bone graft (ICBG) remains the gold standard in both settings, but its harvest has been associated with long-term donor site pain in up to 25% of patients and its use in the posterolateral spine has a non-union rate nearing 40% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Noshchenko et al., 2014</xref>). A variety of alternative bone graft options are currently available (i.e. allograft, demineralized bone matrix); however, none have been clinically proven to be suitable as effective autograft substitutes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Boden, 2000</xref>). Based on this clinical need, we sought to develop a novel osteogenic treatment strategy that targets the established osteogenic capacity of the canonical Wnt signaling to safely and cost-effectively promote spinal fusion.</p><p>The canonical Wnt signaling pathway stands out as a promising pathway to target for bone regenerative therapies given that it is central to the development and homeostasis of bone and because it has complex crosstalk with canonical BMP signaling. Upon the binding of Wnt ligands to the LRP5/6 (low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 5/6) receptor, β-catenin accumulates and translocates into the nucleus where it forms complexes with TCF/Lef1 (T-cell factor/lymphoid enhancer factor) transcription factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Baron and Rawadi, 2007</xref>). This complex then initiates the transcription of various osteogenic target genes. In osteoblasts, these genes enhance proliferation, expansion, and survival, significantly increasing osteogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Boden et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Nusse, 2005</xref>). The regulation of intracellular canonical Wnt signaling is ensured physiologically by the Wnt antagonist, sclerostin, which, upon binding the LRP5/6 receptor, disrupts the interaction between extracellular Wnts and their receptor. This potent inhibitor of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway is secreted primarily by osteocytes and functions to inhibit bone formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Li et al., 2005</xref>). Sclerostin inhibition therefore remains an attractive target for novel anabolic therapeutics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gamie et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Suen and Qin, 2016</xref>).</p><p>Most of the previously explored sclerostin-blocking strategies have focused on systemic delivery of anti-sclerostin monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). Anti-sclerostin mAbs have been shown to enhance bone healing in ovariectomized rats and bone mineral density in humans by increasing bone formation and mass due to enhanced osteoblast function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Suen et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">McDonald et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Recker et al., 2015</xref>). Systemic delivery is far from ideal in local bone-healing applications like fractures and spinal fusions, however. Systemic administration often requires relatively high and sustained dosing regimens to obtain the desired therapeutic effect in the local target environment. These non-local delivery strategies also raise concerns over unnecessary systemic exposure and the potential for off-target side effects.</p><p>Building upon the proven success of systemic anti-sclerostin mAbs to enhance bone formation, we utilized a validated in silico strategy to computationally identify multiple locally deliverable small-molecule drugs with the ability to disrupt the interaction between extracellular sclerostin and LRP5/6. We hypothesized that using a small drug-like molecule to selectively prevent sclerostin from binding to LRP5/6 would enhance intracellular Wnt signaling and the efficacy of endogenous BMPs to promote osteogenesis. Herein, we show that treatments with these sclerostin small-molecule inhibitors (SMIs) resulted in significant enhancement of both canonical Wnt and BMP signaling in vitro. We also explore the possible mechanisms by which these SMIs enhance both canonical Wnt and BMP signaling, showing that crosstalk between these two pathways is partially mediated by the effect of GSK3b on the duration of Smad1 phosphorylation. We also show that these SMIs can significantly increase de novo bone formation as standalone osteogenic agents in vivo, both in a biologically stringent subcutaneous rat ectopic model and in a posterolateral spine fusion model in rabbits. Collectively, our reported findings constitute a first step toward exploring the potential use of anti-sclerostin SMIs as a novel cost-effective biological bone graft-enhancing strategy for future clinical applications such as fracture repair or spinal fusion.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>In silico drug design</title><p>Sclerostin, belonging to the DAN protein family, has a cysteine knot that divides its intervening sequences into three loops, with the first and the third loops protruding to either side of the central knot. The loop 2 region, specifically, is the known binding site for functional anti-sclerostin antibodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and B</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Veverka et al., 2009</xref>). Mutational analyses have shown that mutations in the Leu-90 to Asn-103 residues of the loop 2 region resulted in the inability for sclerostin to bind to LRP5/6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Boschert et al., 2016</xref>). Similarly, a mutation of single amino acids in the loop 2 region (Asp-92 or Ile-94) is known to affect the binding of sclerostin to LRP6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Boschert et al., 2013</xref>). Other studies, however, have shown that a murine sclerostin mutant with Cys-84 and Cys-142 exchange (resulting in the removal of the third disulfide bond of the cystine knot) has reduced binding affinity to LRP5/6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Boschert et al., 2013</xref>), suggesting that elements outside the flexible loop 2 region are also important for proper sclerostin function. Therefore, both of these regions on sclerostin were thought to provide strong candidates to target for the development of anti-sclerostin SMIs. Virtual screening results for AutoDock Vina were visualized using PyMOL (The PyMOL Molecular Graphics System, version 2.0, Schrödinger, LLC) and for FRED using Omega. Receptor-structure-focused docking was performed using the available PDB (protein data bank) nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy structure of sclerostin (ID 2K8P) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Veverka et al., 2009</xref>) to analyze binding modes and their estimated affinities. Out of the 36 conformers of this structure, conformer 1 was chosen as it was the best representative conformer in the ensemble (as mentioned in the remarks of the PDB structure of sclerostin). For this task, we used the chemical library ‘Diversity Set IV’ from the National Cancer Institute (NCI), which contains 1596 compounds. Corina software was used to generate 3D coordinates of the ligands in the library (3D Structure Generator CORINA Classic, Molecular Networks GmbH; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Schwab, 2010</xref>). The translational, rotational, and vibrational entropies of protein–drug complexes were estimated using additional modules within Discovery Studio (Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA, Discovery Studio Modeling Environment, Release 2017, San Diego), including CHARMm, GLIDE, and GOLD.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>In silico design of sclerostin small-molecule inhibitors (SMIs).</title><p>Structural representation of sclerostin (PDB ID 2K8P) is shown (<bold>A</bold>).

Surgery was performed with the animal positioned supine on a circulating-water heating pad. Four 1-cm transverse incisions were made about 3 cm apart on the chest of each rat, and subcutaneous pockets were created by blunt dissection with scissors. The implants were inserted into the pockets and closure was accomplished with closely spaced interrupted absorbable polyglactin-910 sutures (Vicryl; Ethicon, Johnson &amp; Johnson, Somerville, NJ). Each SMI was tested for its ability to produce de novo ectopic mineralization as a standalone factor at the following concentrations: 0, 10, 25, 50, and 100 mM. These were compared to the results obtained with two doses of rhBMP-2 that are known to produce consistent ectopic mineralization in this model (5 and 10 µg).

In short, a dorsal midline skin incision was made in the lumbar region extending from L4–S1 using bony landmarks, followed by two paramedian fascial incisions. The intermuscular plane between the multifidus and longissimus muscles was developed to expose the transverse processes of L5 and L6 as well as the intertransverse membrane. In the rabbits in which ICBG was to be harvested, an additional fascial incision was made overlying each iliac crest to harvest ~1.5–2.0 ml corticocancellous autologous bone graft. The exposed TPs were then decorticated with an electric burr. The SMIs (either 300 or 500 mM) were then loaded onto a plain collagen sponge. These sponges ±ICBG were then placed between the decorticated TPs in the paraspinal bed. Fascial incisions were approximated using 3–0 absorbable suture and the skin was closed with staples. Ceftiofur sodium (Naxcel), 5 mg/kg, was injected subcutaneously as a preoperative antibiotic and an epidural block with morphine (0.01 µg/kg) was used in rabbits who had ICBG harvested.

We hypothesized that this increase in signaling duration may occur because the termination of intracellular BMP response to a given stimulus is typically determined by the activity of GSK3b, which itself is determined by phosphorylations that mark it for degradation in the proteasome. To test our hypothesis, we performed a BMP-2 pulse-chase experiment in which we assessed the levels of C-terminal phosphorylation of Smad1/5 (pSmad1/5<sup>Cter</sup>) at different time points in murine BMSCs and MC3T3-E1 cells in the presence or absence of sclerostin SMIs. The GSK3b inhibitor SB415286 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">MacAulay et al., 2003</xref>) was used as a positive control.

These results suggest that after phosphorylation by the BMP receptor, the duration of the pSmad1/5<sup>Cter</sup> signal is controlled by canonical Wnt-mediated phosphorylation GSK3b. Taken together, out data suggests that the intensity of the Smad1/5/8 response is determined mostly by BMPs, but also canonical Wnt activation, while the duration of the Smad1/5/8 response is at least partially controlled by Wnt/β-catenin signaling via GSK3b phosphorylation.</p></sec><sec id="s3-8"><title>Gene expression with sclerostin SMI treatment</title><p>Next, the effect of the three sclerostin SMI candidates on the expression levels of specific genes that are important to canonical Wnt and BMP signaling were tested using RT-qPCR.

Building on the pioneering work of systemic delivery of anti-sclerostin mAbs, we report a novel biological strategy to stimulate osteogenesis based on the local delivery of sclerostin SMIs. Herein, we have formally demonstrated that our sclerostin SMIs have the ability to enhance Wnt/β-catenin and canonical BMP signaling in vitro (in both BMSCs and pre-osteoblasts) and in vivo, resulting in increased osteogenesis while simultaneously decreasing bone resorption activity. This data is consistent with what has been previously been reported in multiple preclinical and clinical studies with the use of SOST gene knockout and anti-sclerostin mAbs, including (1) increased lineage commitment of BMSCs toward osteogenic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Rawadi et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Ross et al., 2000</xref>), (2) increased osteoblast bone deposition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Padhi et al., 2011</xref>), and (3) simultaneous potentiation of BMP signaling intensity and duration,(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Eivers et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hussein et al., 2003</xref>) and inhibition of osteoclast activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Delgado-Calle et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">McClung et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>The evolutionarily conserved canonical BMP and Wnt pathways are independent signaling mechanisms with different ligands, receptors, and intracellular signal transducers. However, these two pathways cooperatively control bone formation. Molecular studies have shown that functional communication between the canonical BMP and Wnt pathways involves multiple mechanisms. For example, BMP receptor 1A (BMPR1A) signaling directly upregulates the expression of sclerostin, leading to an inhibition of canonical Wnt signaling and a decrease in bone mass by the upregulation of osteoclastogenesis through the RANKL-OPG pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kamiya et al., 2008</xref>).

It is known that BMP signaling triggers sequential Smad1 phosphorylation by BMPR and GSK3b, followed by polyubiquitination as part of BMP’s own negative feedback loop (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Eivers et al., 2009</xref>). Once Smad1 is targeted for degradation, it is transported to the centrosome, where it is degraded by proteasomes. Interestingly, this process of Smad1 phosphorylation by GSK3b appears to be regulated directly by Wnt signaling, as demonstrated herein. We were also able to demonstrate that canonical Wnt signaling inhibits Smad1 phosphorylation by GSK3b and therefore stabilizes pSmad1<sup>Cter</sup>, which is the active form of Smad1 that is phosphorylated at its C-terminal end by BMPR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Eivers et al., 2009</xref>). This suggests that the inhibition of GSK3b phosphorylation via canonical Wnt activation directly regulates the duration of the Smad1/5/8 signal (canonical BMP signaling) in a positive manner. Our data therefore confirm that sclerostin inhibition and canonical Wnt activation can simultaneously increase the signaling intensity and duration of the Smad1/5/8 response in osteoblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kamiya et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>Thirdly, and perhaps the most compelling mechanism highlighting the cooperation between the canonical BMP and Wnt pathways, is the transcriptional regulation of their common target genes, which harbor both Smad and TCF/Lef1 response elements. Smads can form a transcriptional complex with β-catenin/TCF/Lef1 and co-activate transcription of many target genes through these binding elements in response to both BMP and Wnt signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hussein et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Labbé et al., 2000</xref>). More recently, Zhang and colleagues demonstrated that the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway is a direct upstream activator of BMP-2 expression in MC3T3-E1 cells in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Zhang et al., 2013</xref>). Our data confirmed this finding in multiple ways. In the presence of the three sclerostin SMIs tested, we found a significant (p&lt;0.05) increase in BMP reporter activity and a significant (p&lt;0.05) overexpression of BMP-2 and Id1. These results provide further insight into the nature of the functional crosstalk between these pathways with respect to skeletal homeostasis. Taken together, our data suggest that sclerostin inhibition can result in a multipronged push toward osteogenesis as it blocks the RANKL-mediated osteoclastogenic response to endogenous BMP-2 while simultaneously enhancing both canonical Wnt and BMP signaling.</p><p>Another noteworthy finding in this study is the location of the de novo mineralization seen in vivo using the sclerostin SMIs. Given that sclerostin is mostly produced by osteocytes, one could wonder how anti-sclerostin SMIs produce local mineralization in a subcutaneous environment. One possibility is that sclerostin is not solely produced by osteocytes and does not just effect bone; rather, other cell types are increasingly being found to be affected by sclerostin through the systemic circulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Battaglino et al., 2012</xref>). For example, there is increasing evidence of sclerostin’s effects on skeletal muscle, which is strengthened by the fact that LRP5/LRP6 are expressed in human muscle and that the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway is anabolic in muscle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Tagliaferri et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Karczewska-Kupczewska et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Takeda et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Rudnicki and Williams, 2015</xref>). Interestingly, Huang and colleagues recently reported that Wnt3a, an osteocyte-derived Wnt-signaling agonist, promoted C2C12 cell differentiation in vitro and that sclerostin co-incubation (100 ng/ml) prevented this effect, demonstrating that sclerostin negatively regulates Wnt-signaling in a mouse skeletal muscle cell line, at least when present in relatively high concentrations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Huang et al., 2017</xref>). Likewise, we show herein that sclerostin is also produced in C2C12 cells.</p><p>Although several small molecules that are capable of enhancing bone formation (and even BMP activity) have been described in the literature, few if any possess the osteoinductive potency of BMP itself – that is, the ability to form de novo ectopic mineralization as a standalone agent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Wong et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Montgomery et al., 2014</xref>). Our observation that VA1 and C07 are able to leverage the complex crosstalk between canonical Wnt and BMP signaling on multiple levels and produce de novo ectopic mineralization in a non-bone environment as standalone osteoinductive agents in vivo makes them highly attractive as potential novel biologics for the induction of local bone healing in various clinical settings. This is particularly true for VA1 because it is an FDA-approved compound (for a different use) and already has an established safety profile in humans.</p><p>A strategy of locally delivered sclerostin SMIs has many important advantages for local bone formation over current existing systemically delivered mAb strategies. For example, non-local delivery strategies raise concerns over systemic exposure and the potential for off-target side effects. In addition, mAb-based strategies have other limitations for routine clinical use, including (1) limited mAb stability and shelf-life make storage of a commercially available product difficult, (2) increased difficulty with engineering mAbs into carriers or implants for local delivery, and (3) difficult production that is vulnerable to batch-to-batch variation and contamination. Monoclonal antibodies also have a very high manufacturing cost, which is not to be understated as we move toward a more value-based healthcare economy. As an alternative to mAbs, small-molecule drugs address each of these concerns. In addition, the relatively small size of SMIs compared to mAbs is thought to afford them immunoprivilege (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Blaich et al., 2010</xref>). We believe that these factors significantly increase the attractiveness of using pharmacological sclerostin SMIs over existing mAb strategies.</p><p>Despite these encouraging early results, several limitations of this study merit mention. First, a significant limitation of this study is unpredictable translation of in vivo data from rats and rabbits to more clinically relevant models. However, we are actively exploring the use of these sclerostin SMIs in animal models of critically sized fracture defects as well. Another limitation of this study is that we did not definitively confirm that the SMIs were having their biological effect through their intended local mechanism and not via some unknown off-target effect. Future studies measuring systemically circulating sclerostin could answer this question. That being said, all of the in vitro data presented here confirm that all SMIs work via interrupting the interaction between sclerostin and its receptor, LRP5/6, thereby promoting canonical Wnt and BMP signal intensity and duration.</p><p>In conclusion, we identified several small molecules (VA1 and C07) that function by blocking the interaction of extracellular sclerostin and its receptor, LRP5/6. We show that these sclerostin SMIs strongly enhance both local canonical Wnt and BMP signaling and that they are able to drive osteogenesis in vitro and in vivo as standalone agents, which is a rare attribute for proteins or small molecules. We further show that this osteogenic effect is accomplished via enhancement of both Wnt/β-catenin signaling and canonical BMP signaling through a GSK3b-mediated effect on the duration of Smad1 phosphorylation. Our data indicate that these sclerostin SMIs may have potential as novel cost-effective biological bone graft enhancers or substitutes for either the repair of large critical-sized fracture defects and/or spinal fusions.</p></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Data curation, Investigation, Methodology, Writing - original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Data curation, Investigation, Methodology, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Supervision, Methodology, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Resources, Data curation, Formal analysis, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Methodology, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Resources, Data curation, Formal analysis, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Methodology, Writing - original draft, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Resources, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Methodology, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Resources, Data curation, Formal analysis, Funding acquisition, Methodology, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con8"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Data curation, Software, Formal analysis, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing - original draft, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>This study was performed in strict accordance with the recommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the National Institutes of Health.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, including Carlos Isales as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Mone Zaidi as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Fayez Safadi (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>In the manuscript by Sangadala et al. the authors examine the use of small molecule sclerotin inhibitors as alternatives for other biologicals currently used (BMP) for clinical approaches such as spinal fusion. The authors also examine the roles of the WNT and BMP pathways as mediators of this effect. Small molecule sclerotin inhibitors used were selected based on potency (F1, VA1 and C07) and were able to inhibit sclerostin/LRP5/6 interactions. in vivo effectiveness was demonstrated using ectopic mineralization in rats and spinal fusion rates in rabbits</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The authors presented convincing data on identifying three potentials targets for inhibiting sclerostin function by regulating both Wnt and BMP2 pathways, the authors stated that these inhibitors are FDA approved. There is not information on these inhibitors in term what are they FDA approved for and the indications. This will clearly dictate how these inhibitors will affect bone metabolism and homeostasis. Hence, please add more information on each inhibitor in term of FDA approval indication, etc. The FDA-approved drugs used in the study need to be cited by their generic names.</p><p>2) As this paper is a drug discovery study, the data in Figure 2 need to derive avidity and/or affinity constants for each molecule. Figure 2B is an incomplete dose response, and the celling was not determined. This is important because the highest concentration (10um) was used in the subsequent experiments, but this dose was not determined to have the maximum effect.</p><p>3) Figure 4 should include a time course of the induced gene expression. It would be very helpful in the authors show the level of sclerostin mRNA or protein levels. It would also be helpful if the authors consider providing some evidence on osteoclast (TRAP staining from the in vivo experiment) or assessing the level of CTx in circulation. Given RANKL expression and production is highly expressed by osteocytes. Is there any assessment of osteocytes from the in vivo samples? If the osteoclast data is not available, then please provide more discussion on BMP2, SMI, Wnt, Slecrotsin cross-talk and osteoclasts.</p><p>4) In Figure 5, changes in mineralization assay are visually striking but would be helpful if this was also quantitated and presented in graph format, include number of times experiment done. Figure 5 could also include a time course to see if the SMIs accelerate mineralization.</p><p>5) In Figure 6, I’m curious if the inflammatory reaction differed between BMP and the analogs, either locally or systemically. For consistency, the 3D renderings of the C07 induced bone in Figure 6B should be presented without the blue background like VA1 and rhBMP-2.</p><p>6) Figure 7 does not use BMP as a positive control, how do those results compare? Any assessment of bone quality, what about biomechanics? Figure 7 should contain histology of the new bone formation.</p><p>7) The claim that &quot;Sclerostin SMIs are non-toxic&quot; needs to be supported with formal studies or removed.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.63402.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The authors presented convincing data on identifying three potentials targets for inhibiting sclerostin function by regulating both Wnt and BMP2 pathways, the authors stated that these inhibitors are FDA approved.
