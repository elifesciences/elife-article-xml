sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Cell-cycle progression is a vital cellular process, subject to stringent control, as aberrant cell-cycle progression usually results in genome instability, contributing to cancer progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Robertson et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cho et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr"

The eukaryotic cell cycle is controlled by a regulatory network, which proceeds through tightly regulated transitions to make sure that specific events occur in an orderly fashion. The activity of genes that control cell proliferation is strictly regulated through the cell-cycle-dependent oscillation of their expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Robertson et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cho et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dyson, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Frolov and Dyson, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Sánchez and Dynlacht, 1996</xref>). Such dynamic changes in gene expression during cell cycle are essential for efficient cell-cycle progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Robertson et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cho et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dyson, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Frolov and Dyson, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Sánchez and Dynlacht, 1996</xref>). For example, studies have established the role of transcription factors (TFs) such as the E2F and TEAD family of proteins in regulating the transcription of genes controlling cell cycle and cell proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Frolov and Dyson, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chen et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Harbour and Dean, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Meng et al., 2016</xref>). Extensive studies on the identification of protein-coding genes exhibiting periodic expression patterns during cell cycle have led to improved understanding of the basic cell-cycle process and its regulatory mechanism, exemplified by studies on cyclins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Pines and Hunter, 1989</xref>). Understanding the mode of cell cycle-regulated gene expression is also central to the study of many diseases, most prominently cancer. Thus, characterization of the genome-wide changes in the transcriptional program during the cell cycle is a critical step toward a deeper mechanistic understanding of the cell proliferation process and its role in cancer.</p><p>One of the most unexpected discoveries in the genomics era of biology is the extensive transcription of RNA from non-protein-coding regions of the genome (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.gencodegenes.org">www.gencodegenes.org</ext-link>). Tens of thousands of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs), defined as transcripts larger than 200 nt with no or low protein-coding potential, have been identified in mammalian cells. Pioneering studies on a small proportion of lncRNAs revealed that lncRNAs are an integral part of the cellular control network that co-exists along with proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Goff and Rinn, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Yao et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kopp and Mendell, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Sun et al., 2018a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Quinn and Chang, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Rinn and Chang, 2012</xref>) and play important roles in cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gutschner et al., 2013</xref>). Mechanistically, the RNA sequence and structure offer lncRNAs two inherent functional properties: (1) sequence-mediated interaction with genomic DNA or other RNA, and (2) secondary/tertiary structure-mediated interaction with RNA-binding proteins. With these properties, lncRNAs modulate the recruitment of TFs, cofactors or chromatin modifiers to specific genomic locus, to regulate gene expression transcriptionally or epigenetically; or to regulate the binding of RNA processing factors or microRNAs to pre-mRNAs or mRNAs, thereby influencing gene expression at the post-transcriptional level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Batista and Chang, 2013</xref>). Functionally, lncRNAs control several biological functions, including but not limited to processes such as dosage compensation, genomic imprinting, cell metabolism, differentiation and stem cell pluripotency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Goff and Rinn, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kopp and Mendell, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Sun et al., 2018a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Quinn and Chang, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Rinn and Chang, 2012</xref>).</p><p>In contrast to the wealth of knowledge of proteins involved in the regulation of the cell cycle, and associated with oncogenic mutations, very little is known about the molecular role of cell-cycle phase-regulated lncRNAs.

Also, elegant studies have demonstrated that a subset of lncRNAs transcribed from or near the promoters of cell-cycle-regulated protein-coding genes were shown to have coordinated transcription with their respective protein-coding genes, in response to diverse perturbations, including oncogenic stimuli, stem cell differentiation or DNA damage, suggesting their potential biological functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Schmitt et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hung et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Goyal et al., 2017</xref>).

In order to determine if the accumulation at G1 or G1/S observed upon <italic>SUNO1</italic> depletion is a result of enhanced DNA damage, we determined whether <italic>SUNO1</italic>-depleted cells were more prone to DNA damage. We found that <italic>SUNO1</italic>-depleted asynchronous cells showed significant increase in the levels of DNA damage as observed by DNA comet assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2Aa-b</xref>). <italic>SUNO1</italic>-depleted cells also showed increased number of RPA32- (+ve cells, control = 7.2%; si<italic>SUNO1</italic>-a = 65.8%; si<italic>SUNO1</italic>-b 36.5%; n ≥ 75) and 53BP1- (+ve cells, control = 26.6%; si<italic>SUNO1</italic>-a = 53.5%; si<italic>SUNO1</italic>-b 64.5%; n ≥ 70) decorated nuclear foci, indicative of DNA damage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2B</xref>). Finally, <italic>SUNO1</italic>-depleted cells also showed increased levels of p53 as well as phospho-Chk2, consistent with increased DNA damage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2C</xref>). To specify whether the induction of p53 upon <italic>SUNO1</italic> depletion contributes to G1 or G1/S arrest, we determined the extent of G1 or G1/S arrest in <italic>SUNO1</italic>-depleted <italic>p53<sup>+/+</sup></italic> or <italic>p53<sup>-/-</sup></italic> HCT116 cells. PI-flow cytometry analyses revealed that unlike <italic>p53</italic> wild-type cells, <italic>SUNO1</italic>-depleted <italic>p53 <sup>-/-</sup></italic> HCT116 cells failed to arrest in G1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2D</xref>) but showed increase in G2/M population. This result indicates that the G1 or G1/S arrest observed in <italic>SUNO1</italic>-depleted cells requires functional p53, implying <italic>SUNO1</italic>-depleted cells elicit intra-G1 or G1/S checkpoint.</p><p>The increased DNA damage observed in <italic>SUNO1</italic>-depleted cells prompted us to investigate whether <italic>SUNO1</italic> levels were sensitive to DNA damage. Cells treated with drugs that induced double-strand breaks such as doxorubicin (DNA intercalator and topoisomerase II inhibitor), or Etoposide (topoisomerase II inhibitor), or hydroxyurea (HU; 2 mM for 24 hr for inducing replication fork collapse) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Petermann et al., 2010</xref>) showed pronounced induction of <italic>SUNO1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1F</xref>). Several lncRNAs participate in the p53-mediated stress response, and their induction upon DNA damage is dependent on the integrity of the p53 pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Huarte et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hung et al., 2011</xref>). However, we observed a significant induction of <italic>SUNO1</italic> in both wild-type (WT; <italic>p53</italic> <sup>+/+</sup>) and <italic>p53</italic> <sup>-/-</sup> HCT116 cells upon DNA damage (data not shown). In addition, treatment of cells with Nutlin-3, a stabilizer of p53 did not induce <italic>SUNO1</italic>, further indicating that <italic>SUNO1</italic> activation was not mediated by p53 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2E</xref>).</p><p>We demonstrated that <italic>SUNO1</italic> was upregulated during S-phase and upon DNA damage, and loss of <italic>SUNO1</italic> led to cell-cycle arrest with increased DNA damage, resulting in cell-cycle checkpoint activation. One likely scenario is that <italic>SUNO1</italic> is required for entry into S-phase and perhaps for S-phase progression as well. Without <italic>SUNO1</italic>, the cells have difficulty entering S-phase and hence arrest at the G1/S boundary.</p><p>To gain molecular insights into why G1 accumulation is observed in <italic>SUNO1</italic>-depleted cells, we performed chromatin fractionation of pre-replicative complex proteins in control cells and in ones lacking <italic>SUNO1</italic>. It is known that defects in the pre-RC complex levels or their chromatin loading could compromise the origin assembly and/or firing. We observed reduced chromatin loading of the Mini Chromosome Maintenance 3 (MCM3), core component of the MCM helicase complex but not (Origin recognition complex 2) ORC 2, member of the ORC complex in <italic>SUNO1</italic>-depleted cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>), supporting the model that aberrant G1 or G1/S arrest observed upon <italic>SUNO1</italic> depletion could be partially due to defects in pre-RC assembly. This is consistent with our results that fewer origins are licensed in the absence of <italic>SUNO1</italic> leading to an accumulation in G1 phase.</p><p>To address why there was increased DNA damage in the absence of <italic>SUNO1</italic>, we addressed if <italic>SUNO1</italic> is involved in sensing and/or repairing DNA damage or the phenotype is a consequence of fewer licensed origins. To test this, we treated control and <italic>SUNO1</italic>-depleted or <italic>SUNO1</italic>-KO cells with HU for 24 hr, a condition that elicits strong replication stress by causing replication fork collapse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Petermann et al., 2010</xref>), and analyzed the recovery of cells post-HU-release (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3Fa</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3A</xref>). By PI-flow cytometry, we observed that control cells, post-HU-release, resumed DNA replication, with majority of them reaching G2/M phase by 12 hr post- HU-release (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3Fb</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3A</xref>). However, <italic>SUNO1</italic>-depleted and knockout cells showed slow S-phase progression, as observed by the accumulation of a significant fraction of cells in S-phase 12 hr (hr) post-HU-release (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3Fb</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3A</xref>). Reduced S-phase progression upon <italic>SUNO1</italic> deletion could be due to the inability to repair DNA damage or due to defective fork progression. To test this, we performed a DNA fiber combing assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>). Control and <italic>SUNO1</italic>-depleted cells were first incubated with the thymidine analog 5-chloro-2'-deoxyuridine (CldU) for 30 min to label the replicating DNA strands. CldU was then washed off, and cells were treated with HU for 24 hr to induce replication fork collapse and double strand breaks. Then, cells were released into fresh medium containing another thymidine analog, 5-iodo-2'-deoxyuridine (IdU) for 30 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3Ga</xref>). By this, the newly synthesized DNA strands will be labeled with IdU. The DNA Fiber assay revealed that <italic>SUNO1</italic>-depleted cells showed reduced number of tracks that incorporated only IdU (red) post-HU treatment, implying a reduced number of dormant replication origins firing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3Gb-c</xref>). At the same time, both control and <italic>SUNO1</italic>-depleted cells showed comparable length in the CldU-labeled fibers (green), indicating a normal rate of replication fork progression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3Gb and d</xref>), suggesting that <italic>SUNO1</italic> is not required for S-phase progression, once the replication is initiated. Based on the results from the DNA fiber assay, we conclude that the defects in the S-phase progression observed in <italic>SUNO1</italic>-depleted cells post-HU-release are due to inefficient firing of dormant replication origins.</p><p>Interestingly, <italic>SUNO1</italic>-depleted cells failed to elicit some of the key DNA damage-induced checkpoint responses. For example, compared to control cells, <italic>SUNO1</italic>-depleted cells post-HU treatment (2 mM for 24 hr) showed reduced Chk1 phosphorylation at Ser345, BRCA1 phosphorylation at Ser1524, RPA32 phosphorylation and γH2AX induction, indicative of defective ATR-mediated check-point activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3B</xref>). Furthermore, cell viability (MTT assay) and long-term cell survival assays (clonogenic assay) with and without DNA damage (Doxorubicin) revealed that <italic>SUNO1</italic> acted as a pro-survival gene. <italic>SUNO1</italic>-depleted cells showed reduced cell growth/survival under both normal and after DNA-damage conditions. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3BCa-b</xref>; data not shown), These data revealed that <italic>SUNO1</italic>-depleted cells are more sensitive to drug-induced DNA damage, implying that <italic>SUNO1</italic> is involved in DNA-damage response (DDR), and its loss causes defects in the cells’ ability to recover from DNA damage. Our results demonstrate that <italic>SUNO1</italic> is required for entry into S-phase, and its depletion renders cells to become more sensitive to DNA damage, resulting in the inability to reinitiate DNA replication upon replicative stress.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title><italic>SUNO1</italic> regulates cell proliferation by promoting the expression of YAP1-target genes</title><p>In order to understand the underlying molecular mechanism by which nuclear-enriched <italic>SUNO1</italic> regulates cell proliferation, we analyzed the gene expression changes at the steady state levels in control and <italic>SUNO1</italic>-depleted cells.

YAP1 is a transcription co-activator that positively regulates TEAD- or FOS-mediated transcription of genes, thereby promoting cell proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ehmer and Sage, 2016</xref>).

In addition, another potential YAP1 target, p15/PAF, a PCNA-associated factor that plays crucial roles in S-phase progression and DNA-damage repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Xie et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chang et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">De Biasio et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Povlsen et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Jung et al., 2013</xref>), also showed reduced expression in <italic>SUNO1</italic>-depleted control and DNA-damaged cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A–B</xref>).

A recent study indicated that YAP1 positively autoregulates its own expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Vázquez-Marín et al., 2019</xref>).

It is established that phosphorylated LATS1 (at serine-909) kinase by phosphorylating YAP1, inhibits its nuclear import, ultimately resulting in the YAP1 degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Meng et al., 2016</xref>).

For example, DDX5 has been reported to promote E2F1-, p53-, Androgen receptor- and β-catenin-mediated transcription of genes controlling cell-cycle progression and DDR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Nicol et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Clark et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Wagner et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bates et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Mazurek et al., 2012</xref>). In addition, studies have reported the involvement of ncRNAs in regulating the co-activator activity of DDX5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Caretti et al., 2006</xref>). Based on this, we hypothesized that <italic>SUNO1</italic> may facilitate the DDX5-mediated transcription of <italic>WTIP</italic> during the cell cycle. Cells depleted of DDX5 showed reduced levels of <italic>WTIP</italic> mRNA, indicating that DDX5 positively regulates <italic>WTIP</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). DDX5 ChIP-qPCR in control cells revealed the association of DDX5 to the <italic>WTIP</italic> and <italic>β-globin</italic> (positive control) promoters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). However, DDX5 continued to associate with both <italic>WTIP</italic> and <italic>β-globin</italic> promoters even in <italic>SUNO1</italic>-depleted cells, implying that <italic>SUNO1</italic> did not recruit/stabilize DDX5 to <italic>WTIP</italic> regulatory elements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). Recent studies have reported that DDX5 promotes the transcription of cell-cycle genes by recruiting or stabilizing RNA polymerase II (RNA pol II) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Clark et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Mazurek et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Rossow and Janknecht, 2003</xref>). We therefore quantified the RNA pol II association to <italic>WTIP</italic> promoter in the presence or absence of <italic>SUNO1</italic>. Initially, we determined the association of RNA pol II in the <italic>SUNO1</italic> gene body of cells treated with control siRNA as well as siRNA targeting the 3’end of <italic>SUNO1</italic>. ChIP-qPCR assay revealed that RNA pol II showed comparable levels of binding to the <italic>SUNO1</italic> gene body in control and <italic>SUNO1</italic> siRNA-treated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5Fa</xref>). These results imply that siRNA targeting the 3’end of the <italic>SUNO1</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3A</xref> for si<italic>SUNO1</italic>a position) only degraded <italic>SUNO1</italic> lncRNA and did not affect the transcription from the <italic>SUNO1</italic> locus. In support of this, a recent study demonstrated that antisense oligonucleotides targeting the 3’end of the gene normally degrade only the transcript without impacting the transcription from the locus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lee and Mendell, 2020</xref>). On the other hand, we observed significantly reduced association of RNA pol II to <italic>WTIP</italic> promoter in <italic>SUNO1</italic>-depleted cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5Fb</xref>), compared to the control <italic>GAPDH</italic> promoter, which showed comparable levels of RNA pol II in control and <italic>SUNO1</italic>-depleted cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5Fc</xref>). Nascent RNA capture followed by RT-qPCR revealed that <italic>SUNO1</italic>-depleted cells showed a significant reduction in the levels of nascent <italic>WTIP</italic> pre-mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>), further supporting the earlier result that <italic>SUNO1</italic> depletion reduced RNA pol II activity at <italic>WTIP</italic> locus. Increased levels of <italic>p21</italic> pre-mRNA observed in <italic>SUNO1</italic>-depleted cells, due to p53-mediated G1 checkpoint activation, was used as a positive control. We then examined whether <italic>SUNO1</italic> influenced the DDX5-mediated recruitment/stabilization of RNA pol II to gene promoters. Towards this, we tested the DDX5-RNA pol II interaction on chromatin in control versus <italic>SUNO1</italic>-depleted cells by DDX5-chromatin-IP in formaldehyde-crosslinked cell lysate followed by immunoblot assays. Control cells showed specific interaction between DDX5 and RNA pol II on chromatin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H</xref>). However, <italic>SUNO1</italic>-depleted cells significantly compromised the interaction between DDX5 and RNA pol II on chromatin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H</xref>). Based on this, we conclude that <italic>SUNO1</italic> lncRNA influences DDX5-mediated recruitment/stabilization of RNA pol II on the promoter in cis, thereby enhancing <italic>WTIP</italic> transcription (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5I</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title><italic>SUNO1</italic> promotes tumorigenicity in colon cancer cells</title><p>Our results indicate a pro-proliferative function of <italic>SUNO1</italic>. Since we demonstrated that <italic>SUNO1</italic> facilitates the well-established oncogene YAP1-mediated transcription of genes promoting cell proliferation in colon carcinoma cells (HCT116), we wondered whether <italic>SUNO1</italic> contributes to tumor progression. Patient survival analyses using the colon adenocarcinoma samples from the TCGA data set revealed that patients with higher <italic>SUNO1</italic> levels displayed significantly shorter survival compared to patients with lower <italic>SUNO1</italic> expression, indicating that a high <italic>SUNO1</italic> level is associated with poor prognosis in colon adenocarcinoma (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). Next, we tested whether the ~149 genes that showed reduced expression in <italic>SUNO1</italic>-depleted cells also exhibited synchronous change in expression patterns in the TCGA colon cancer patient cohort. Interestingly, a major fraction of these genes (71%), including <italic>WTIP</italic>, showed positive correlation in expression with SUNO1 across colon cancer patients, implying that <italic>SUNO1</italic> potentially regulates the expression of these genes even in cancer tissue samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>).

These data collectively support the model that <italic>SUNO1</italic> participates in tumorigenesis.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In this study, we performed a comprehensive analysis to understand human lncRNA expression during the cell cycle. We identified &gt;2000 lncRNAs with periodic expression patterns peaking at a specific cell-cycle phase. To demonstrate that the cell-cycle phase-specific expressed lncRNAs regulate vital cellular processes, we characterized the function of <italic>SUNO1</italic>, an S-phase-enriched lncRNA in cell proliferation. We observed that <italic>SUNO1</italic> regulated the expression of <italic>WTIP</italic>, a member of AJUBA family of proteins that repress Hippo signaling pathway. Furthermore, we have provided evidence indicating that <italic>SUNO1</italic> promoted transcription by facilitating the co-activator, DDX5-mediated recruitment/stabilization of RNA pol II on chromatin.</p><p>DDX5 is an established RNA helicase involved in multiple processes of RNA metabolism, including pre-mRNA splicing, rRNA and miRNA processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fuller-Pace, 2013</xref>). In addition, it is becoming increasingly clear that DDX5 also acts as transcription co-activator or co-repressor in a context-dependent manner <italic>vi</italic>a interacting with specific TFs or RNA pol II (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fuller-Pace, 2013</xref>). For example, in response to DNA damage, it interacts with and co-activates p53 to mediate cell-cycle arrest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Nicol et al., 2013</xref>). However, during normal cell-cycle progression, DDX5 stimulates the recruitment/stabilization of RNA pol II to the promoters of E2F1-regulated DNA replication factor genes, thereby promoting cell proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Mazurek et al., 2012</xref>). Several other studies have also demonstrated the involvement of DDX5 in regulating RNA pol II activity, though the exact mechanism is yet to be established (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Clark et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Rossow and Janknecht, 2003</xref>). Interestingly, DDX5 is known to interact with ncRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Caretti et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Das et al., 2018</xref>). DDX5 facilitates the transcriptional activity of MyoD by forming a complex with the ncRNA <italic>SRA</italic> in muscle cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Caretti et al., 2006</xref>). In the present study, we demonstrated that early S-phase- upregulated <italic>SUNO1</italic>, by forming a complex with DDX5, promotes the association between DDX5 and RNA pol II on chromatin, thereby promoting transcription of genes such as <italic>WTIP</italic>. Reduced <italic>WTIP</italic> mRNA level in DDX5-depleted cells further support the role of DDX5 as a regulator of <italic>WTIP</italic> transcription. Future studies will address how <italic>SUNO1</italic> influences the DDX5-mediated recruitment of RNA pol II specifically at the <italic>WTIP</italic> or other gene promoters. It is possible that the <italic>SUNO1</italic>-DDX5 RNP complex at <italic>WTIP</italic> promoter may either confer specificity in recruiting RNA pol II to <italic>WTIP</italic> promoter, and/or stimulate the transcriptional co-activator activity of DDX5. Earlier studies, demonstrating the role of the ncRNA, <italic>SRA</italic> in promoting DDX5 activity support such a model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Caretti et al., 2006</xref>). In addition, a recent study showed that the <italic>CONCR</italic> lncRNA interacts with another helicase, DDX11, and regulates its enzymatic activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Marchese et al., 2016</xref>). We therefore speculate that the mode of action of <italic>SUNO1</italic> may represent a wider spread mechanism in which lncRNAs interact with DEAD box family DNA/RNA helicases to modulate their location and activity.</p><p>The Hippo pathway controls organ size and tissue homeostasis in diverse species through regulating cell proliferation, apoptosis and stemness, whereas its deregulation contributes to tumor progression in a broad range of human carcinomas. Despite the fact that Hippo pathway activity is frequently deregulated in different human cancers, somatic or germline mutations in Hippo pathway genes are uncommon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Harvey et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Yu et al., 2015</xref>). Here, by identifying the lncRNA <italic>SUNO1</italic> as a <italic>cis</italic> activator of <italic>WTIP</italic>, that positively regulates YAP1, we hypothesize that <italic>SUNO1</italic> acts as an oncogene <italic>via</italic> inhibiting the Hippo pathway. Our hypothesis is supported by the observation that elevated expression of <italic>SUNO1</italic> correlates with poor prognosis in colon adenocarcinoma, and further tumor assays revealed that <italic>SUNO1</italic> is required for the tumorigenicity of colon cell lines.</p><p>We observed that <italic>SUNO1</italic> was induced upon DNA damage. Furthermore, <italic>SUNO1</italic>-depleted cells showed slow S-phase progression post release from HU-mediated DNA damage, due to defects in replication origin re-activation. Also, <italic>SUNO1</italic>-depleted cells showed enhanced sensitivity to DNA damage. At present, the role of <italic>SUNO1</italic> in DDR is unclear. Interestingly, <italic>SUNO1</italic>-depleted cells failed to activate ATR-mediated DNA-damage checkpoint during HU treatment, as observed by reduced phosphorylation of several of ATR and CHK1 substrates. This could be due to the fact that <italic>SUNO1</italic>-depleted cells fail to enter S-phase as the ATR-mediated check point is active during S and G2 phase of the cell cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Buisson et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Zeman and Cimprich, 2014</xref>). We propose that <italic>SUNO1</italic> contributes to DDR by modulating the expression of genes that regulate DDR. In support of this, <italic>SUNO1</italic>-depleted cells showed reduced expression of several genes (<italic>GADD45B, CEBPA, UHRF1, P51/PAF</italic>) that contribute to DDR (data not shown) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp6">Supplementary file 6</xref>), though the mode of action is yet to be determined. Alternatively, the above-described phenotypes observed in <italic>SUNO1</italic>-depleted cells could be a consequence of aberrant replication stress. Dormant replication origins are activated following replication stress to ensure completion of DNA replication at stalled forks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Zeman and Cimprich, 2014</xref>). However, <italic>SUNO1</italic>-depleted cells showed reduced number of new origins firing post-HU treatment, and this could result in delayed S-phase progression. Future studies will test whether <italic>SUNO1</italic> actually plays a role in DDR or the aberrant DNA-damage phenotype observed in <italic>SUNO1</italic>-depleted cells is a consequence of error in origin licensing.</p><p>LncRNAs regulate cell proliferation and survival, by regulating the expression of cell-cycle-regulated protein-coding genes, such as cyclins or CDKs or CDK inhibitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kitagawa et al., 2013</xref>). Also, lncRNAs that are transcribed from the promoters of cell-cycle regulators have coordinated transcription of their respective protein-coding gene partners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hung et al., 2011</xref>). A recent study using nascent DNA strand sequencing, identified &gt;1000 s of lncRNAs to be induced during S-phase, and a significant number of these RNAs showed differential expression in pan-cancer samples (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ali et al., 2018</xref>). Further, loss-of-function studies revealed that several of the lncRNAs contribute to cancer progression, underpinning the important roles played by cell-cycle-regulated ncRNAs in cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ali et al., 2018</xref>). Similarly, an independent study from the RIKEN group reported that depletion of a significant number of lncRNAs resulted in cell-cycle defects, further supporting the involvement of lncRNAs in cell-cycle progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Ramilowski et al., 2020</xref>). These individual examples, though strengthened the argument about the importance of lncRNAs in cell cycle, failed to provide a genome-wide understanding of the crucial roles played by thousands of uncharacterized lncRNAs in cell proliferation. We have identified several hundreds of lncRNAs that displayed cell-cycle phase-specific expression. As a proof of principle, we have demonstrated the vital role for <italic>SUNO1</italic> in promoting YAP1-mediated expression of genes controlling cell proliferation. It is evident that similar to proteins, lncRNAs could constitute organized programs of biological activities that are required for efficient cell proliferation. Our study would be the first step in the continuum of research that is expected to lead to the functional characterization of a large number of cell-cycle-regulated lncRNAs.</p></sec><sec id="s4"

the lncRNA <italic>SUNO1</italic> as an important mediator of cell cycle progression. <italic>SUNO1</italic> is expressed during S phase of the cell cycle and promotes expression of <italic>WTIP</italic>, a positive regulator of the transcription factor YAP1. Importantly, dysregulated <italic>SUNO1</italic> expression is associated with poor cancer prognosis.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;The S phase-induced <italic>SUNO1</italic> lncRNA promotes cell proliferation by controlling YAP1/Hippo signaling pathway&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Kevin Struhl as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This is a study of cell cycle-dependent lncRNAs. One S-phase lncRNA (<italic>SUNO1</italic>) was chosen for further analysis. The authors conclude the <italic>SUNO1</italic> is required for S phase entry and that <italic>SUNO1</italic> deficient cells are more sensitive to DNA damage. The authors conclude that <italic>SUNO1</italic>, by modulating the functional interaction between DDX5 and RNA pol II, regulates pro-survival pathways such as Hippo/YAP1 cell signaling thereby affecting cell proliferation. These are interesting conclusions, but the data provided fall short of fully validating these conclusions.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The authors did not perform qPCR-based validation for the obtained RNA-seq data. Among thousands of identified lncRNAs in this study, the authors also did not rationalize the selection of S phase specific lncRNA <italic>SUNO1</italic> given its very low abundancy as evidenced by the RNA-FISH. The quality of the northern blot presented in Figure 2—figure supplement 3C is very poor and there is a possibility of DNA cross-contamination induced by the DNA probes. The authors do not provide details on the probes used in the northern blotting. Moreover, the northern blotting suggests the presence of two distinct isoforms. <italic>SUNO1</italic>, according to hg38, is a monoexonic, measuring 2040 bp. However, according to Figure 2A, read distribution is very uneven across 2 kb region, including S-phase. In particular, the read distribution in S phase exceeds more than 2 kb, covering close to 3 kb region. However, the authors predict two bands at 2 kb and 5 kb in northern blots provided in Figure 2G. Thus, the bands in northern blots are not consistent with the RNA-seq data. The lack of proper isoform characterization is compounded by the absence of knowledge concerning which isoform they are investigating or silencing.</p><p>2) Based on Figure 2C, the authors suggest that nuclear puncta represent <italic>SUNO1</italic>, and they justify this due to lack of signal in CRISPR/Cas9 KO cells. However, according to Figure 3—figure supplement 1E CRISPR deletion spans more than 1.5 kb of 2 kb <italic>SUNO1</italic> transcriptional unit. Considering the extent of SUNO deletion, the authors should explain the location of probe (details in the Materials and methods section are not apparent) used for northern blotting, and also probes used for RNA-FISH.</p><p>3) The CRISPR-mediated <italic>SUNO1</italic> KO cells express Cas9. However, it is not clear that the WT cells express Cas9. Is it possible that the PI FACS phenotype is caused by Cas9-induced DNA damage? It is stated in many places in the text that <italic>SUNO1</italic> is required for S-phase entry. If so, what explains the apparent S-phase population of <italic>SUNO1</italic> depleted and SUNO KO cells? The reported proliferation assays are restricted to PI FACS assays. These studies should be complemented by measurement of cell number over time and by studies of DNA synthesis (e.g. EdU incorporation). Does expression of <italic>SUNO1</italic> have &quot;gain-of-function&quot; phenotype in cell cycle regulation, as well as downstream target transcription? Does <italic>SUNO1</italic> expression rescue the proliferation phenotype of <italic>SUNO1</italic> knockout cells?</p><p>4) The intrinsic DNA damage caused by <italic>SUNO1</italic> depletion alone is supported by a DNA comet assay (Figure 3—figure supplement 2A) and to a certain extent by p53 activation (Supplementary Figure 3H). The authors should provide γH2AX Western for <italic>SUNO1</italic> depleted cells following siRNA and CRISPR/Cas9 clones. Does expression of <italic>SUNO1</italic> rescue the DNA damage phenotype in CRISPR KO clones?</p><p>5) The authors refer to the syntenic homology with the mouse <italic>SUNO1</italic> without characterizing or providing further information on the mouse lncRNA. Authors should show that mouse <italic>SUNO1</italic> rescues the functions of its human homolog. Otherwise, the current data on the mouse homolog becomes irrelevant to the manuscript.</p><p>6) The DNA fiber assay experiment was used to investigate the effect of <italic>SUNO1</italic> in combination with HU treatment. However, this technique should be used to examine the role of <italic>SUNO1</italic> in DNA replication (not solely post-HU treatment). The authors conclude that <italic>SUNO1</italic> modulation affects origin licensing – thus conclusion needs to be supported by examining status of pre-replication and replication complexes such as ORC and MCMs loading.</p><p>7) The interpretation of the HU study presented in Figure 3 is confusing. Since HU causes replication fork collapse and <italic>SUNO1</italic> is required for S phase entry, HU would not be expected to cause replication fork collapse in <italic>SUNO1</italic> knockout cells. How do these experiments demonstrate a role for <italic>SUNO1</italic> in a DNA damage check point?</p><p>8) The 3C experiment (Figure 5A) lacks control. Primers spanning <italic>SUNO1</italic> and <italic>WTIP</italic> are used. Primers spanning intervening genes (which seem not controlled by <italic>SUNO1</italic> as negative controls) are also needed. Moreover the experiment shown also indicates that the <italic>SUNO1</italic> genomic locus may be more crucial to the physical association with <italic>WTIP</italic> promoter than the transcript per se. Do the authors rule out the act of <italic>SUNO1</italic> transcription in the regulation <italic>WTIP</italic>?</p><p>9) The <italic>WTIP</italic> studies are poorly described. Why were the microarray studies done using <italic>SUNO1</italic> siRNA rather than <italic>SUNO1</italic> KO cells? What time point is the immunoblot (Figure 4C). There appears to be no description of siRNA sequences. It appears that two siRNA were used in Figure 4—figure supplement 1D, but the sequences and time are not described. Only a single siRNA was used to deplete <italic>WTIP</italic> (Figure 4—figure supplement 1G). The peak of <italic>SUNO1</italic> expression is in S phase (Figure 2—figure supplement 1C) while <italic>WTIP</italic> peaks in G1/S (Figure 4—figure supplement 1F) – if <italic>SUNO1</italic> increases <italic>WTIP</italic> expression, what accounts for this? The PI FACS analysis of siWTIP (Supplementary Figure 4D) is not sufficient to support the conclusions presented (see point 3, above).</p><p>10) Figure 4C shows that si<italic>SUNO1</italic> decreases YAP expression – what is the mechanism? This decrease could be sufficient to explain the loss of YAP transcriptional activity. Does <italic>SUNO1</italic> affect YAP localization? Is this caused by <italic>SUNO1</italic> deficiency or <italic>WTIP</italic> deficiency – can be tested by complementation analysis?</p><p>11) The authors should strengthen the functional connection between <italic>SUNO1</italic> and WTIP/YAP1. Does WTIP or YAP1 rescue <italic>SUNO1</italic> mediated functions? The significance of interaction between <italic>SUNO1</italic> and DDX5 in target gene regulation is unclear if DDX5 recruitment to target gene promoters is not dependent on <italic>SUNO1</italic>. How does <italic>SUNO1</italic> affects the interaction between DDX5 and RNA pol II?</p><p>12) The authors should provide further evidence to strengthen the connection to Hippo signaling. For example, does <italic>SUNO1</italic> deletion affect YAP cellular localization, in addition to its expression level? Does it also affect the TAZ level? Expression of other bona fide YAP/TAZ target genes, such as <italic>CYR61</italic> and ANKRD1, should be included in the analysis. In addition, they should examine whether <italic>SUNO1</italic> affects phosphorylation of the upstream Hippo kinases, Mst and LATS.</p><p>13) It was recently reported that expression of the components of the Hippo pathway, including YAP/TAZ, oscillate during mitotic cell cycle (Kim et al., 2019). Thus, it is important to test whether cell cycle regulation of YAP/TAZ is indeed dependent on <italic>SUNO1</italic> or WTIP in this context.</p><p>14) The authors state that &quot;Interestingly, a major fraction of these genes (71%), including WTIP, showed a positive correlation in expression with <italic>SUNO1</italic> across colon cancer patients&quot; However the statistical significance of the correlated genes is not provided.</p><p>15) The soft agar assays cannot be interpreted without studies of 2D cultures. Is the loss of growth in agar simply because the <italic>SUNO1</italic> KO cells do not grow?</p><p>16) Many experiments use a single siRNA. At least two siRNAs or siRNA/CRISPR strategies should be used to strengthen their conclusions. In addition to qRT-PCR validation of target genes, Western blot analyses should be included.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.55102.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The authors did not perform qPCR-based validation for the obtained RNA-seq data.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for not presenting the RT-qPCR validation data of other lncRNA candidate genes in the earlier version of the manuscript.

In addition, <italic>SUNO1</italic> shows S phase expression in multiple cell lines, based on studies from our laboratory in HeLa as well as recent independent RNA-seq studies from other laboratories in MCF-7 (Liu et al., 2017) and hTERT-RPE1 (Yildirim et al., 2020) (Figure 2—figure supplement 1D-F). We agree with the reviewer that it is difficult to study the function of low abundant lncRNAs. However, most of the lncRNAs in cells are expressed with low abundance (in comparison to protein-coding genes) and display cell type-specific expression. Several earlier studies have demonstrated the involvement of low copy lncRNAs, such as <italic>lincRNA-p21</italic> in cell cycle functions (Dimitrova et al., 2014; Seiler et al., 2017). As a matter of fact, lncRNAs that regulate gene expression in <italic>cis</italic> tend to express in low copy numbers (Dimitrova et al., 2014).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The quality of the northern blot presented in Figure 2—figure supplement 3G is very poor and there is a possibility of DNA cross-contamination induced by the DNA probes.</p></disp-quote><p>Weak <italic>SUNO1</italic> northern blot (NB) bands observed in HCT116 poly A<sup>+</sup> RNA was because of its low abundance. However, lack of the specific signal in the <italic>SUNO1</italic> KO cells confirms the specificity of the signal observed in the wild type cells (please also see the response to critique 1-5). To further confirm the specificity of the bands, we performed NB in BT20 human breast cancer cells (Figure 2—figure supplement 3B). BT20 cells showed &gt;70 fold of <italic>SUNO1</italic> expression compared to HCT116 cells (Figure 2—figure supplement 1G). Based on the NB data in BT20 cells, it is evident that &gt;2.1 kb isoform of <italic>SUNO1</italic> represents the major isoform. In addition, <italic>SUNO1</italic> is also presented as a low abundant long isoform (&gt;5 kb) in both HCT116 and BT-20 cell lines.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors do not provide details on the probes used in the northern blotting.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for not providing this essential information in the manuscript.

However, the RNA-seq data from BT-20 cells (Ghandi et al., 2019; Varley et al., 2014) clearly demonstrated enhanced reads within an ~2 kb region, which matched with the annotated <italic>SUNO1</italic> region (Figure 2—figure supplement 3A). We named this isoform <italic>SUNO1</italic>-s. In addition, we observed reads expanding through a &gt;5 kb long region downstream of the CpG island. We named this long isoform <italic>SUNO1</italic>-l. <italic>SUNO1</italic>-l shows much less expression level compared to <italic>SUNO1</italic>-s. Both of the bands are labeled in the revised manuscript Figure 2—figure supplement 3B-C.</p><p>Moreover, we analyzed the publicly available GRO-seq datasets in HCT116 and MCF7 cells (Andrysik et al., 2017) (Figure 2—figure supplement 3D). We observed a distinct transcription starting from the annotated TSS of <italic>SUNO1</italic>. Because of the bidirectional feature of the CpG island, there is transcription activity on the opposite strand of <italic>SUNO1</italic> but the RNA produced from the reverse strand shows a much lower level than <italic>SUNO1</italic>. The CAGE as well as poly A-seq datasets further confirm the 5’ and 3’ of the <italic>SUNO1</italic> transcript (Figure 2—figure supplement 3D).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Based on Figure 2C, the authors suggest that nuclear puncta represent SUNO1, and they justify this due to lack of signal in CRISPR/Cas9 KO cells.

We have now included this information in the revised manuscript (Figure 2—figure supplement 3A).</p><p>Please note that the DNA region corresponding to the probe that was used in NB to detect <italic>SUNO1</italic>, (located within the 3’end of <italic>SUNO1</italic> gene) is <italic>intact</italic> even in the CRISPR-KO cells (Figure 2—figure supplement 3A). The lack of bands (2kb and &gt;5 kb) in the NB of <italic>SUNO1</italic> KO cells indicates that <italic>SUNO1</italic> probe specifically detects only the <italic>SUNO1</italic> isoforms.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The CRISPR-mediated SUNO1 KO cells express Cas9. However, it is not clear that the WT cells express Cas9. Is it possible that the PI FACS phenotype is caused by Cas9-induced DNA damage?</p></disp-quote><p>The control (WT) cells that were used to compare with CRISPR KO cells were also generated by transfecting all of the plasmids (including Cas9) except the gRNAs followed by the same drug selection procedure as of the KO clones. Cas9 was transiently transfected into the WT and KO cells. We have now included this information in the manuscript. We therefore believe that the specific DNA damage defect observed in the <italic>SUNO1</italic> knock down cells are unlikely due to the nonspecific activity of transiently expressed Cas9. Furthermore, the DNA damage phenotype is also observed upon depletion of <italic>SUNO1</italic> using siRNA approach.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It is stated in many places in the text that SUNO1 is required for S-phase entry. If so, what explains the apparent S-phase population of SUNO1 depleted and SUNO KO cells?</p></disp-quote><p>S-phase entry is a critical biological process that is regulated tightly by several parallel gene regulatory mechanisms (E2F-, YAP/TEAD-, Myc-, FOS/Jun-mediated transcription). We argue that <italic>SUNO1</italic>-regulated YAP signaling is one of the mechanisms that control the expression of genes required for cell cycle S phase progression. We observed a decrease in the S-phase population in <italic>SUNO1</italic> KO cells and a concomitant accumulation in G1 phase, supporting our argument. This type of parallel gene regulatory processes is not unique to lncRNAs. For example, depletion of key pre-replication proteins (including Orc2 and ORCA/LRWD1) in cancer cells, causes the cells to accumulate in G1 with fewer cells progressing into S-phase of the cell cycle, consistent with licensing of fewer origins (Prasanth, Prasanth, and Stillman, 2002; Shen et al., 2010).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The reported proliferation assays are restricted to PI FACS assays. These studies should be complemented by measurement of cell number over time and by studies of DNA synthesis (e.g. EdU incorporation).</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer/s for their suggestion. We have now performed multiple assays to confirm the S phase progression and proliferation defects observed upon SUNO depletion or deletion. We performed BrdU incorporation assay (Figure 3—figure supplement 1D), EdU incorporation assay (Figure 4D) to demonstrate decrease in S phase cells after <italic>SUNO1</italic> depletion. In addition, BrdU-PI-flow cytometry (Figure 3B) analyses also confirmed decrease of S-phase population with a concomitant increase in G1 population in cells depleted of <italic>SUNO1</italic>. Finally, the growth curve assays showed defects in cell proliferation in <italic>SUNO1</italic>-depleted cells (Figure 3C).</p><p>In addition, we also performed BrdU-PI flow (Figure 3—figure supplement 1G) as well as growth curve analyses (Figure 3—figure supplement 1H) in <italic>SUNO1</italic>-knock out (KO) cells. <italic>SUNO1</italic>-KO cells also showed significant reduction of S-phase population and slower growth.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Does expression of SUNO1 have &quot;gain-of-function&quot; phenotype in cell cycle regulation, as well as downstream target transcription?

We have now performed DNA fiber assay in asynchronous control and <italic>SUNO1</italic>-depleted HCT116 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref>). Our results suggest that once the replication initiates, the fork progresses at a normal pace in <italic>SUNO1</italic>-depleted cells.

Furthermore, our experiments revealed that <italic>SUNO1</italic>-depleted cells showed slow S phase progression post HU release compared to control cells. Our results show that in the <italic>SUNO1</italic>-depleted cells, not only there are fewer licensed origins, but also a defect in firing of dormant origins in the vicinity of stalled forks. Dormant origins and the S-phase checkpoint are critical for rescuing stalled forks and therefore needed for the completion of DNA replication under replication stress (Yekezare, Gomez-Gonzalez, and Diffley, 2013).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) The 3C experiment (Figure 5A) lacks control. Primers spanning SUNO1 and WTIP are used. Primers spanning intervening genes (which seem not controlled by SUNO1 as negative controls) are also needed.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for his/her suggestions. Unfortunately, we could not do the experiment suggested by the reviewer. The collaborator (Prof. Tae Hoon Kim, UT Dallas) who performed the 3C analyses in the manuscript has closed down his lab in order to take up an administration position. Due to the Covid19 situation, we could not initiate a new collaboration with another lab to do the 3C analyses.</p><p>We looked at the ENCODE Hi-C datasets to see potential interactions between <italic>WTIP</italic> and <italic>SUNO1</italic> genes. We observed that both the genes (and several genes that are located in proximity) are part of the same TAD based on Hi-C data of multiple cell lines including HCT116 (Rao et al., 2017) (Figure 5—figure supplement 1). Thus, the public Hi-C data supports our 3C results. The negative control primer amplifies a genic region that is located ~156 kb upstream of <italic>SUNO1</italic>. These two genomic regions are not part of the same TAD (Figure 5—figure supplement 1) and as expected, they showed no interaction by 3-C (Figure 5A).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Moreover the experiment shown also indicates that the SUNO1 genomic locus may be more crucial to the physical association with WTIP promoter than the transcript per se. Do the authors rule out the act of SUNO1 transcription in the regulation WTIP?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this comment. It has been very difficult to separate the role of transcription/chromatin versus transcript when it comes to characterizing lncRNA-mediated <italic>cis</italic>-gene regulation. 3C analyses indicated that <italic>SUNO1</italic> gene locus is located in close proximity to <italic>WTIP</italic> locus even in the presence or absence of <italic>SUNO1</italic> lncRNA. We interpret that proximity-association between <italic>SUNO1</italic> and <italic>WTIP</italic> genes helps the low copy number <italic>SUNO1</italic> RNA to associate with the regulatory elements within the <italic>WTIP</italic> gene locus, to potentially recruit and/or stabilize DDX5/RNA pol II at the <italic>WTIP</italic> locus.</p><p>To test whether the knock down of <italic>SUNO1</italic> using siRNA (that displayed specific phenotype) compromises SUNO1 transcription, we determined RNA pol II occupancy on the <italic>SUNO1</italic> gene body in control and <italic>SUNO1</italic> siRNA-treated (siRNA targeting the 3’end of the gene). Recent study from Mendell laboratory indicated that antisense oligos targeting the 3’end of the gene does not compromise the transcription of the gene of interest, but preferentially degrades only the RNA (Lee and Mendell, 2020). ChIP-qPCR revealed that RNA pol II showed similar occupancy in the body of <italic>SUNO1</italic> gene in control and <italic>SUNO1</italic>-depleted cells (Figure 5Fa). This result suggested that the phenotype caused by <italic>SUNO1</italic> depletion was not due to reduced transcription activity of <italic>SUNO1</italic> but due to the loss of <italic>SUNO1</italic> RNA. In addition, unlike the known unstable and poly A- eRNAs (enhancer RNAs), <italic>SUNO1</italic> is a relatively stable poly A<sup>+</sup> RNA (Figure 2—figure supplement 2B and Figure 2—figure supplement 3F).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) The WTIP studies are poorly described.

We wanted to distinguish primary (directly) targets from secondary (probably caused by cell cycle arrest) targets of <italic>SUNO1</italic>, the expression of which are altered immediately upon <italic>SUNO1</italic> depletion, even before the occurrence of cell cycle defects. Therefore, a transient knockdown of <italic>SUNO1</italic> (an early as well as late time point) is better to serve the purpose than a stably knocked-out cell line.

Earlier studies reported that DDX5 facilitates the recruitment/stabilization of RNA pol II to the promoters of cell cycle genes (Mazurek et al., 2012). Several other studies have also demonstrated the involvement of DDX5 in regulating RNA pol II activity, though the mechanism by which DDX5 controls RNA pol II loading remained to be established (Clark et al., 2013; Rossow and Janknecht, 2003).</p><p>Based on our results, we propose that <italic>SUNO1</italic>-DDX5 RNP complex at <italic>WTIP</italic> promoter may either confer specificity in recruiting RNA pol II to <italic>WTIP</italic> promoter, and/or stimulate the transcriptional coactivator activity of DDX5. Earlier studies, demonstrating the role of the SRA lncRNA in promoting DDX5 activity, support such a model (Caretti et al., 2006). In addition, a recent study showed that the <italic>CONCR</italic> lncRNA interacts with another helicase, DDX11, and regulates its enzymatic activity (Marchese et al., 2016). We therefore speculate that the mode of action of <italic>SUNO1</italic> may represent a wider spread mechanism in which lncRNAs interact with DEAD box family DNA/RNA helicases to modulate their location and co-transcriptional activity.</p><p>However, experiments to determine the molecular mechanism will include several large-scale experiments, such as in vitro RNA: protein reconstitution experiments.

We therefore intend to take up this task for future investigations.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>12) The authors should provide further evidence to strengthen the connection to Hippo signaling.

Studies have demonstrated that YAP1 promotes S phase entry by positively regulating the expression of genes, controlling replication and S phase entry (Shen and Stanger, 2015). Reduced levels of WTIP, YAP1, YAP1 targets such as CTGF, Cyclin D1 and increased levels of the inhibitor of YAP1, pLATS1 in <italic>SUNO1</italic>-depleted cells further support the model that <italic>SUNO1</italic> regulates the S phase expression of YAP1, potentially by promoting the expression of <italic>WTIP</italic> in <italic>cis</italic>.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>14) The authors state that &quot;Interestingly, a major fraction of these genes (71%), including WTIP, showed a positive correlation in expression with SUNO1 across colon cancer patients&quot; However the statistical significance of the correlated genes is not provided.</p></disp-quote><p>All of the reported positively correlated genes with <italic>SUNO1</italic> exhibited a p-value &lt; 0.01 at a 5% FDR.

In the soft agar anchorage independent assay (Figure 6D), we seeded equal number of control and <italic>SUNO1</italic>-KO cells.

In this sense, <italic>SUNO1</italic> KO cells showed reduced colony number (because of <italic>SUNO1</italic>’s role in cell proliferation) as well as colony size (its involvement in anchorage-independent growth). In addition, we have performed 2D growth curve analyses in WT and <italic>SUNO1</italic> KO cells. The <italic>SUNO1</italic> KO cells showed a much slower growth compared to the WT control cells (Figure 3—figure supplement 1H).
