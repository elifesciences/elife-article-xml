Matriglycan is an elongated polysaccharide of alternating xylose (Xyl) and glucuronic acid (GlcA) that binds with high affinity to ECM proteins with LG domains and is uniquely synthesized on α-dystroglycan (α-DG) by like-acetylglucosaminyltransferase-1 (LARGE1). Defects in the post-translational processing or <italic>O</italic>-glycosylation of α-DG that result in a shorter form of matriglycan reduce the size of α-DG and decrease laminin binding, leading to various forms of muscular dystrophy. Previously, we demonstrated that protein <italic>O</italic>-mannose kinase (POMK) is required for LARGE1 to generate full-length matriglycan on α-DG (~150–250 kDa) (Walimbe et al., 2020). Here, we show that LARGE1 can only synthesize a short, non-elongated form of matriglycan in mouse skeletal muscle that lacks the DG N-terminus (α-DGN), resulting in an ~100–125 kDa α-DG. This smaller form of α-DG binds laminin and maintains specific force but does not prevent muscle pathophysiology, including reduced force production after eccentric contractions (ECs) or abnormalities in the neuromuscular junctions. Collectively, our study demonstrates that α-DGN, like POMK, is required for LARGE1 to extend matriglycan to its full mature length on α-DG and thus prevent muscle pathophysiology.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>LARGE1</kwd><kwd>dystroglycan</kwd><kwd>muscular dystrophy</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Paul D.

Skeletal muscle cells are bound to the basement membrane through transmembrane receptors, including dystroglycan (DG) and integrins, which help maintain the structural and functional integrity of the muscle cell membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Ibraghimov-Beskrovnaya et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Han et al., 2009</xref>). DG is a central component of the dystrophin-glycoprotein complex (DGC). It is encoded by a single gene, <italic>DAG1</italic>, and cleaved into α- and β-subunits (α-DG and β-DG, respectively) by post-translational processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Ibraghimov-Beskrovnaya et al., 1992</xref>). Extensive <italic>O</italic>-glycosylation of α-dystroglycan (α-DG) is required for normal muscle function, and defects in this process result in various forms of muscular dystrophy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Michele et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Ohtsubo and Marth, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Yoshida-Moriguchi and Campbell, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Praissman et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Sheikh et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>α-DG binds to ECM ligands containing laminin-G (LG) domains (e.g., laminin, agrin, perlecan) which are essential components of the basement membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Michele et al., 2002</xref>). DG, thereby, physically links the cell membrane to the basement membrane. This process requires the synthesis of matriglycan, a heteropolysaccharide [-GlcA-β1,3-Xyl-α1,3-]<sub>n</sub>, on α-DG by the bifunctional glycosyltransferase, like-acetylglucosaminyltransferase-1 (LARGE1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Inamori et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Yoshida-Moriguchi and Campbell, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hohenester, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Ohtsubo and Marth, 2006</xref>). Structural studies have shown that a single glucuronic acid-xylose disaccharide (GlcA-Xyl) repeat binds with high-affinity to laminin-α2 LG4,5, and there is a direct correlation between the number of GlcA-Xyl repeats on α-DG and its binding capacity for ECM ligands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Briggs et al., 2016</xref>). During skeletal muscle differentiation, LARGE1 elongates matriglycan, thereby increasing the binding capacity of matriglycan for ECM ligands and allowing matriglycan to serve as a matrix scaffold that is required for skeletal muscle function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Goddeeris et al., 2013</xref>). Matriglycan synthesis requires the addition of core M3 trisaccharide (GalNAc-β1,3-GlcNAc-β1,4-Man) onto specific threonine residues on α-DG in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Sheikh et al., 2017</xref>). Once core M3 is synthesized, the glycosylation-specific kinase, protein <italic>O</italic>-mannose kinase (POMK) phosphorylates mannose of core M3, and this is required for the subsequent addition of full-length, high-molecular weight forms of matriglycan onto the <italic>O</italic>-mannose linked modification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Yoshida-Moriguchi and Campbell, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hohenester, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Jae et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Yoshida-Moriguchi et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Zhu et al., 2016</xref>). In the absence of core M3 phosphorylation by POMK, LARGE1 synthesizes a short, non-elongated form of matriglycan on α-DG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Walimbe et al., 2020</xref>). Notably, a loss of function in the post-translational addition of matriglycan leads to a group of disorders known as dystroglycanopathies, congenital and limb-girdle muscular dystrophies with or without brain and eye abnormalities. Disease severity is dependent on the ability of matriglycan to bind ECM ligands, which is dictated by its length and expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Goddeeris et al., 2013</xref>): matriglycan that is of low molecular weight (e.g., short) can cause muscular dystrophy, even if its capacity to bind LG domains is not completely lost (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Puckett et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hara et al., 2011a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hara et al., 2011b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Carss et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cirak et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dong et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Walimbe et al., 2020</xref>). However, how matriglycan elongation is regulated by factors other than POMK is still unknown.</p><p>α-DG is composed of three distinct domains: the N-terminal (α-DGN) domain, a central mucin-like domain, and the C-terminal domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Ibraghimov-Beskrovnaya et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Brancaccio et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Brancaccio et al., 1997</xref>). α-DGN serves as a binding site for LARGE1 in the Golgi and is required for the subsequent functional glycosylation of the mucin-like domain of α-DG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kanagawa et al., 2004</xref>). We, therefore, hypothesized that α-DGN must be involved in regulating the production and elongation of matriglycan. Here, we have used a multidisciplinary approach to show that LARGE1 synthesizes a non-elongated form of matriglycan on DG that lacks α-DGN (i.e., α-DGN-deleted DG) resulting in ~100–125 kDa α-DG. This short form of matriglycan binds laminin and maintains muscle-specific force. However, it fails to prevent lengthening contraction-induced reductions in force, neuromuscular junction (NMJ) abnormalities, or dystrophic changes in muscle. Collectively, our study shows that LARGE1 requires α-DGN to generate full-length matriglycan in skeletal muscle, but the synthesis of a shorter form of matriglycan can proceed independently of this domain.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Domain structure of dystroglycan (DG) and Δ-α-DGN.</title><p>Wild-type DG is a pre-proprotein with an N-terminal signal peptide (light green) that is translated in the rough endoplasmic reticulum.

The junction between α-DGN and the mucin-like domain (light teal) contains a furin convertase site.

M-α-DGN KO mice showed characteristic features of muscular dystrophy, including an increase in centrally nucleated fibers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Immunofluorescence analyses of M-α-DGN KO muscle showed reduced levels of matriglycan relative to controls, but a similar expression of β-DG, the transmembrane subunit of DG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>).</p><p>Immunoblot analysis demonstrated that skeletal muscle from M-α-DGN KO mice expresses a shorter form of matriglycan which results in an ~100–125 kDa α-DG, a decrease in the molecular weight of the core α-DG, and no change in β-DG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). No matriglycan is seen in <italic>Large<sup>myd</sup></italic> mice which have a deletion in <italic>Large1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). To investigate how the loss of α-DGN affects ligand binding, we performed a laminin overlay using laminin-111. Skeletal muscle from control mice showed a broad band centered at ~100–250 kDa, indicative of α-DG-laminin binding; in contrast, we observed laminin binding at ~100–125 kDa in M-α-DGN KO skeletal muscle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). To further confirm that the ~100–125 kDa band seen with anti-matriglycan antibodies in M-α-DGN KO muscle is matriglycan-positive α-DG, we digested it overnight with β-glucuronidase (<italic>Thermotoga maritima</italic>) and α-xylosidase (<italic>Sulfolobus solfataricus</italic>). Immunoblot analysis with anti-matriglycan antibodies and laminin overlay revealed that ~100–125 kDa was completely lost after enzymatic digestion, indicating that the ~100–125 kDa band is indeed matriglycan-positive α-DG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>)<italic>.</italic> The sensitivity of ~100–125 kDa α-DG to enzymatic digestion also demonstrates that matriglycan is not capped like brain α-DG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Sheikh et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>The NMJs in adult control mice demonstrate a normal pretzel-like morphology whereas NMJs from M-α-DGN KO mice display a variety of abnormalities, including a granular appearance and AChR-rich streaks extending beyond the pre-synaptic terminal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>).

Specifically, we measured muscle mass, muscle cross-sectional area (CSA), production of absolute isometric tetanic force, specific force, and lengthening contraction-induced reduction in force. Muscle mass and CSA were comparable between control and M-α-DGN KO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A and B</xref>). Although the production of absolute isometric tetanic force was significantly lower in M-α-DGN KO mice compared to control mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>), specific forces were comparable between the two groups when normalized to muscle CSA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). Lengthening contraction-induced force reduction in M-α-DGN KO EDL remained greater than those from control EDL for the entire 60 min that muscles were assessed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). These results suggest that the short form of matriglycan on α-DG in M-α-DGN KO EDL enables force production but cannot prevent force reduction caused by lengthening contractions. POMK KO skeletal muscle also expresses a short form of matriglycan, similar to M-α-DGN KO muscle.

Immunoblot analysis of these mice showed that α-DG had a molecular weight of ~100–125 kDa, whereas β-DG remained unchanged (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). Laminin binding was observed at ~100–125 kDa in M-α-DGN KO skeletal muscle infected with AAV-CMV α-DGN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). Collectively, this phenotype is similar to that observed in the skeletal muscles of M-α-DGN KO mice. Expressing α-DGN in M-α-DGN KO mice did not alter specific force or improve force deficits induced by lengthening contractions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C and D</xref>). Thus, supplementing M-α-DGN KO skeletal muscle with α-DGN fails to produce full-length matriglycan.

During skeletal muscle differentiation, matriglycan is elongated by LARGE1, increasing its binding capacity for ECM ligands, which allows it to serve as a matrix scaffold that is required for skeletal muscle function. Consequently, defects in matriglycan synthesis led to dystroglycanopathies, such as congenital and limb-girdle muscular dystrophies that can be accompanied by structural brain and eye abnormalities. Notably, there is a direct correlation between the number of GlcA-Xyl repeats on α-DG and its binding capacity for ECM ligands. Indeed, patients with increased clinical severity of dystroglycanopathy have few GlcA-Xyl repeats and a shorter form of matriglycan. Despite the importance of mature, full-length matriglycan for proper muscle structure and function, little is known about mechanisms that control its elongation.</p><p>We now show that LARGE1 synthesizes a non-elongated form of matriglycan on α-DG lacking α-DGN (i.e., α-DGN-deleted DG). This short form of matriglycan binds laminin and maintains specific force. However, it fails to prevent reduced force production after ECs, NMJ abnormalities, or dystrophic changes in muscle. Collectively, our study shows that LARGE1 requires α-DGN to generate full-length matriglycan in skeletal muscle and thus prevents muscle pathophysiology. However, synthesis of a shorter form of matriglycan can proceed independently of the α-DGN domain.</p><p>Our results suggest that the interaction between LARGE1 and α-DGN holds the enzyme-substrate complex together over multiple cycles of sugar addition. These findings build on our previous study demonstrating that phosphorylation of the core M3 trisaccharide by POMK is also necessary for matriglycan elongation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Walimbe et al., 2020</xref>). Thus, the generation of full-length matriglycan on α-DG (~150–250 kDa) by LARGE1 requires both POMK and α-DGN; in the absence of either, LARGE1 synthesizes a shorter form of matriglycan. Thus, the interaction between LARGE1 and α-DGN is essential for efficient matriglycan polymerization. Although deep-learning tools could be used to predict protein-protein interactions, it is unlikely that these tools will be able to predict the interaction between LARGE1 and DG as this requires post-translational modifications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Walimbe et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>In our study, muscle-specific deletion of α-DGN resulted in the production of short forms of matriglycan on α-DG (~100–125 kDa). Mice lacking α-DGN exhibited low body weight and grip strength, and histological characterization of quadriceps muscles revealed mild muscular dystrophy and a lack of homogeneous matriglycan expression. Physiological examination revealed that M-α-DGN KO muscle was susceptible to lengthening contraction-induced force decline, although specific force was maintained. These results are consistent with those obtained when α-DGN-deleted DG was expressed in muscle-specific DG null mice and confirm that α-DG lacking α-DGN produces short forms of matriglycan, which do not prevent dystrophic muscle changes in this mouse model. Furthermore, DG in the post-synaptic membrane is known to play a key role in synaptic maturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Nishimune et al., 2008</xref>). However, the NMJs in M-α-DGN KO mice in our study were abnormal and irregularly shaped. This indicates both that DG and full-length matriglycan are required for synaptic maturation.</p><p>If LARGE1 binding to α-DGN enables its ability to elongate matriglycan, then we would expect that rescuing M-α-DGN KO skeletal muscle with α-DGN would restore the expression of full-length matriglycan. However, this failed to occur and suggests that restoring α-DGN expression alone is not sufficient for LARGE1 to elongate matriglycan. These results indicate that the ability of LARGE1 to elongate matriglycan requires α-DG with α-DGN. This finding is consistent with data showing that matriglycan is not elongated when α-DGN is deleted, even when LARGE1 is overexpressed. Therefore, α-DGN acts as a recognition site for the glycosyltransferase LARGE1 and establishes a model where α-DGN, together with phosphorylated core M3, anchors LARGE1 to the matriglycan production site to enable its synthesis and elongation. Notably, although the molecular recognition of α-DGN by LARGE1 is considered essential for the expression of functional α-DG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kanagawa et al., 2004</xref>), our results show that LARGE1 can synthesize a short non-elongated form of matriglycan in the absence of α-DGN, indicating that LARGE1 does not need to interact with α-DGN to function.</p><p>To determine how much matriglycan is needed to prevent lengthening contraction-induced reductions in force, we studied mice that express different sizes of matriglycan. Muscle from M-α-DGN KO mice showed an increased force deficit and a 7.6-fold increase in centrally nucleated fibers compared to muscle from C57 mice, indicating that the short form of matriglycan does not prevent dystrophic changes. However, despite the lower amount of matriglycan in muscle from <italic>Dag1<sup>T190M</sup></italic> mice compared to that from C57 mice, the force deficit was not different between the two groups, and centrally nucleated fibers were increased in α-DGN mutant (<italic>Dag1<sup>T190M</sup></italic>) mice by only 1.4-fold. This indicates that a matriglycan-positive α-DG over 150 kDa can prevent muscular dystrophy.</p><p>Muscular dystrophy is not observed in a mouse model of Fukuyama congenital muscular dystrophy, which occurs due to a retrotransposition insertion in the mouse <italic>fukutin</italic> ortholog and leads to laminin binding at 50% of normal levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kanagawa et al., 2009</xref>). In <italic>Dag1<sup>T190M</sup></italic> mice, the laminin-binding level is about 45% of normal, which likely explains the mild increase in centrally nucleated fibers compared to muscle from C57 mice. However, in muscle from M-α-DGN KO mice, the laminin-binding level is only 9% relative to that of C57 mice and leads to a marked increase in centrally nucleated fibers and force deficit induced by lengthening contractions. This indicates that matriglycan length is critical for regulating damage induced by lengthening contractions and that the production of ~120–150 kDa α-DG significantly prevents dystrophic change, suggesting that this pathologic effect can be prevented without the expression of full-length matriglycan. Thus, our results describe a relationship between matriglycan size, damage induced by lengthening contractions, and the degree of dystrophic change.</p><p>α-DGN is cleaved by the proprotein convertase furin at the sequence RVRR (amino acids 309–312) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Singh et al., 2004</xref>). It has a globular structure that is organized into two subdomains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Brancaccio et al., 1997</xref>). The first subdomain is a typical Ig-like domain; the second subdomain resembles ribosomal RNA-binding proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bozic et al., 2004</xref>). α-DGN is secreted by cells in culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Saito et al., 2011</xref>) and has been detected in a wide variety of human bodily fluids, including serum and plasma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Saito et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Saito et al., 2011</xref>).

Finally, we have also studied the protective role of secreted α-DGN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">de Greef et al., 2019</xref>) on influenza A virus proliferation.</p><p>Collectively our study demonstrates that synthesis of full-length matriglycan on α-DG (~150–250 kDa) requires α-DG containing α-DGN. In the absence of α-DGN, LARGE1 can synthesize a short non-elongated form of matriglycan on α-DG (~100–125 kDa) in skeletal muscle in a process that does not require that LARGE1 interacts with α-DGN. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that matriglycan length regulates the severity of muscular dystrophy. Interestingly, α-DG of approximately 100–125 kDa was seen in muscle from mild FKRP patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brockington et al., 2001</xref>). Our work, thereby, enhances our understanding of the mechanisms underlying matriglycan synthesis and further identifies this pathway as a possible therapeutic target for the treatment of α-dystroglycanopathy.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals</title><p>All mice were maintained in a barrier-free, specific pathogen-free grade facility and had access to normal chow and water ad libitum.

Your article has been reviewed by 2 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Suzanne Pfeffer as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission. Please address these comments in a revised manuscript, either with direct experimentation or modifications to the text.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The reviewers judged that the work would be improved with further clarification of the nature of the interaction between aDGN and LARGE1. If this cannot be tested directly, in the revision then at least the point should be mentioned in the discussion. One of the possible interpretations is that aDGN interacts with LARGE1 for matriglycan synthesis. Given the availability of recent structural information on LARGE1 domains, including one crystal structure in BioRxiv, has any molecular docking with the available structures (see PDB: 1U2C for example, or 4WIQ reporting the structure of the T190M mutant) of the aDGN domain been attempted?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>One important and initial overall comment: this work indeed suggests that LARGE1 can be recognized by aDGN, but could also other sections of the dystroglycan core protein act as LARGE1 chaperones, for example, the mucin-like central region on itself, where the Thr residues on which the M3 glycoepitope is built? In fact, the matriglycan can still be partially elongated or modified when the N-terminal domain is fully depleted. The absence of aDGN must be thus certainly detrimental to the overall affinity displayed by α-DG towards LARGE1, but it does not seem to be a &quot;conditio sine qua non&quot; of glycosylation, for at least some LARGE1 enzymatic activity towards α-dystroglycan does still take place (as stated by the Authors in the Discussion). In this respect, it cannot be ruled out that aDGN, rather than binding LARGE1 directly (see the next point) could be important for the folding and stability of a downstream subdomain/sequence of α-dystroglycan representing the real recognition site for LARGE1. A possible interpretation that the Authors have not mentioned.</p><p>As previously discussed, one of the possible interpretations of data is that aDGN would need to interact at some level with LARGE1 for the synthesis of matriglycan. Given the availability of recent structural information on LARGE1 domains, including one crystal structure (see the papers recently deposited as preprints in BioRxiv, one actually deposited by some of the Authors of the paper under review here), has any molecular docking with the available structures (see PDB: 1U2C for example, or 4WIQ reporting the structure of the T190M mutant) of the aDGN domain been attempted?</p><p>Figure 2: can the exact number of mice analyzed be reported? Was any difference due to the gender of M-α-DGN KO mice observed? If possible, it would be interesting to report in the figure the gender of the analyzed mice. Lines 115-116: I would suggest amending &quot;M-α-DGN KO mice were lower in weight than WT littermate&quot; to &quot;M-α-DGN KO mice were slightly lower in weight than WT littermate&quot;, at least at 12 weeks of age.</p><p>Overlay assays (Figure 2C – right panel). Murine laminin-1 was used at 7.5 nM, maybe some lower concentrations could be tried to check whether &quot;shorter&quot; matriglycan might show a reduced affinity for laminin?</p><p>Mice aged 12 weeks were analyzed in Figure 2 (in Figure 4 and Figure 5 as well, while in Figure 6, 17-week old and figure 7, 12 to 19 weeks old). Were the mice checked at an older age? Is the observed muscular dystrophy phenotype actually getting worst with age? Histological and immunoblotting data in Figure 2 are reported for quadriceps muscle: was any other muscle analyzed? In Figure 3 (NMJs analysis), for example, tibialis anterior (TA), extensor digitorum longus (EDL), and soleus (SOL) muscles were analyzed in 35-39 weeks old mice, therefore it is reasonable to assume that histology and immunoblot data for the 'old' mice would be available as well.</p><p>Figure 5. I agree that it is very interesting to learn that the AAV-driven DGE (lacking aDGN) is matured and shortened similarly to what was observed in M-Dag1-KO muscle. It might sound like an obvious point/suggestion and further control, but is AAV-wt DG able to rescue the phenotypes observed in M-Dag1-KO mice muscle? Figure 5, supplement-1: in the bottom panel of A (M-Dag1-KO), is β-DG staining missing?</p><p>Figure 6. Very interesting experiment. The data show that overexpression of isolated aDGN cannot prevent muscular dystrophy in M-α-DGN KO mice. Therefore, I would suggest the authors slightly amend the title of their work because it can lead to the wrong suggestion that aDGN per se can prevent muscular dystrophy. In addition, was aDGN overexpressed in wt animals as well? I think that this would be an important control experiment that must be added, not least because one of the outcomes could be that isolated aDGN interferes with the whole elongation process and somehow &quot;compete&quot; for LARGE1 recognition. Shall we in case expect this to be detrimental to the resulting matriglycan length? In such a scenario, aDGN (the isolated domain) would be a factor inducing muscular dystrophy rather than preventing it.</p><p>Figure 6 data again. A technical and important question: how can one be sure that aDGN is overexpressed, and overrepresented, within the Golgi of cells?</p><p>The Data in Figure 7 are really interesting because they help establish a direct relationship between the length of matriglycan and the observed dystrophic phenotype. From what is reported, also in Figure 2, it seems that matriglycan reaches some degree of extension in the aDGN KO mice. However, the aDGN KO mice seem to be much more similar to the myd mice in Figure 7, suggesting the idea that under a certain &quot;threshold length&quot; matriglycan would be largely ineffective (i.e. it would not be sufficient for binding). Based also on previously available data on the myd phenotype, can one say that the aDGN KO mice are phenotypically similar to the myd mice or not?</p><p>Related to the previous point. In Figure 7, while they are reported in panels D and E, in panels A, B and C no data are reported for myd mice. Can the figure be further updated with these myd mice data? Of course, the myd mice analysed should be of similar age to aDGN KO ones (the age for the analyzed myd mice is not reported, it seems). Panel E is reported in the Figure 7 caption as &quot;I&quot;.</p><p>One interesting (I believe) question/point of discussion is: are similar binding mechanisms taking place with other dystroglycan modifying enzymes? Indeed, some of the enzymes that are initially involved in the fabrication of the M3 glycoepitope reside in the ER, and they might also need to interact and be correctly positioned towards the DG core protein/mucin-like region for the enzymatic steps they catalyze to be possible. The evidence here reported points instead to aDGN being a &quot;specific chaperone&quot; only for the synthesis of the matriglycan, thus implying that the previous steps in M3 glycoepitope fabrication would be aDGN-independent. Can the Authors discuss this point?</p><p>Another interesting question that could become a matter for discussion is &quot;how is aDGN processed/scavenged or transferred to the extracellular space and body fluids (including plasma)?&quot; Can the Authors speculate, or refer to their or perhaps also previously available data, on the presence of a specific protein transfer system for removal of aDGN from the Golgi and then off the cells? Is some internal proteasome-dependent process involved? Or perhaps, the aDGN is processed (by furin) in the Golgi but only removed after α-dystroglycan is transferred to the plasma membrane? In any case, the presence of very limited amounts of aDGN in the plasma seems to suggest that not all the aDGN produced in the cell would be processed through internal degrading pathways, which in itself should be ground for discussion.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1) The authors may consider exogenously expressing full-length DG (containing α-DGN) n M-Dag1 KO mice to see if matriglycan length and functions are restored. This may strengthen the conclusion that LARGE1 requires α-DGN to synthesize full-length matriglycan.</p><p>2) It is not clear why neuromuscular junction immunohistochemistry in Figure 3 was done in markedly older animals (35-39-week-old) animals when all the other assays were carried out in younger animals.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.82811.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The reviewers judged that the work would be improved with further clarification of the nature of the interaction between aDGN and LARGE1.

Our current paper shows that a similar short matriglycan is synthesized by LARGE1 in the absence of αDGN. Thus, our working hypothesis is that anchoring LARGE1 to dystroglycan via a core M3 phosphate or α-DGN allows the synthesis of a short matriglycan but that elongation of matriglycan requires both a core M3 phosphate and α-DGN (proof of this hypothesis will require detailed cryo-EM studies).</p><p>To address the reviewer’s concern, we have made a transgenic mouse that overexpresses αDGN (α-DGN Tg) and showed that free α-DGN interferes with the elongation of matriglycan, but that LARGE1 can still synthesize a short matriglycan on α-DG (new Figure 5—figure supplement 2). This new data supports our hypothesis and partially addresses the reviewer’s concern.</p><p>We have added the following paragraphs and figure to the manuscript to address this comment.</p><p>Addition to Methods:</p><p>Generation of α-DGN transgenic (α-DGN Tg) mice</p><p>“Transgenic mice, which overexpressed only the α-DGN domain of dystroglycan, were generated using C57BL/6NJ mice. First, total RNA was extracted from mouse skeletal muscle to prepare a construct, and RT-PCR obtained the fulllength cDNA of the Dag1 gene containing the Kozak sequence. Using this template, we amplified bases 1-930 of Dag1 corresponding to α-DGN by PCR and inserted a stop codon at the 3' end. The PCR product was cut with restriction enzymes and cloned into an EcoR I / Not I site of plasmid pCAGGS (Unitech). In addition, a fragment containing the CAG promoter and Dag1 1-930 was cut out from the same vector using Sal 1/Hind III and inserted into a vector for microinjection. The vector was microinjected into a pronuclear stage of zygotes of wild-type mice and transferred to pseudopregnant females. Offspring were screened for genomic integration of this fragment by PCR of tail DNA, using the following unique sequence of the vector: forward <named-content content-type="sequence">5′-CCTACAGCTCCTGGGCAACGTGCTGGTT-3′</named-content>, reverse <named-content content-type="sequence">5′-AGAGGGAAAAAGATCTCAGTGGTAT-3′</named-content>. Mice were generated by breeding F1 heterozygous transgenic males to wild-type females.”</p><p>Addition to Results:</p><p>“To test if excessive free α-DGN interferes with the binding of endogenous α-DGN to LARGE1, we analyzed immunoblots of skeletal muscle from control mice and those overexpressing free α-DGN (α-DGN Tg). Immunoblot analysis of these mice showed that α-DG had a reduced molecular weight of ~100-125 kDa, whereas β-DG remained unchanged (Figure 5—figure supplement 2). This biochemical phenotype is similar to that observed in the skeletal muscles of M-αDGN KO mice and demonstrates that free α-DGN interferes with the elongation of matriglycan, but LARGE1 can still synthesize the short matriglycan on α-DG.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>As previously discussed, one of the possible interpretations of data is that aDGN would need to interact at some level with LARGE1 for the synthesis of matriglycan.
