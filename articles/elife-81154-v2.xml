fundamental knowledge about meningeal biology. Here, we utilized high-throughput RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) techniques to investigate the transcriptional response of the meninges to traumatic brain injury (TBI) and aging in the sub-acute and chronic time frames. Using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), we first explored how mild TBI affects the cellular and transcriptional landscape in the meninges in young mice at one-week post-injury. Then, using bulk RNA-seq, we assessed the differential long-term outcomes between young and aged mice following TBI. In our scRNA-seq studies, we highlight injury-related changes in differential gene expression seen in major meningeal cell populations including macrophages, fibroblasts, and adaptive immune cells. We found that TBI leads to an upregulation of type I interferon (IFN) signature genes in macrophages and a controlled upregulation of inflammatory-related genes in the fibroblast and adaptive immune cell populations. For reasons that remain poorly understood, even mild injuries in the elderly can lead to cognitive decline and devastating neuropathology. To better understand the differential outcomes between the young and the elderly following brain injury, we performed bulk RNA-seq on young and aged meninges 1.5 months after TBI. Notably, we found that aging alone induced upregulation of meningeal genes involved in antibody production by B cells and type I IFN signaling. Following injury, the meningeal transcriptome had largely returned to its pre-injury signature in young mice. In stark contrast, aged TBI mice still exhibited upregulation of immune-related genes and downregulation of genes involved in extracellular matrix remodeling. Overall, these findings illustrate the dynamic transcriptional response of the meninges to mild head trauma in youth and aging.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Traumatic

<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Frost et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Alexis et al., 2014</xref>). While TBI affects individuals of all ages, the elderly experience more severe consequences than younger individuals with similar injury severity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Susman et al., 2002</xref>). The reason for this differential age-related response to brain injury is not fully understood. Multiple findings have indicated that prolonged activation of the immune system following TBI may contribute to some of the negative TBI-associated sequelae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Ertürk et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib114">Winston et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Corps et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Johnson et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Schimmel et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Chou et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">McKee and Lukens, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib116">Witcher et al., 2021</xref>). Interestingly, several studies point to differences in the immune response in elderly individuals that may contribute to more severe consequences following injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Chou et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Morganti et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Ritzel et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib111">Webster et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Androvic et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Ritzel et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Kumar et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Krukowski et al., 2018</xref>). However, our understanding of the disparate CNS responses between elderly and young individuals following TBI is still in its infancy.</p><p>Recent findings have implicated the meninges, a tri-layered tissue that resides between the brain parenchyma and skull, as an early responder to TBI and as a pivotal contributor to the CNS immune response following injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Russo et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Roth et al., 2014</xref>). Meningeal enhancement with post-contrast fluid attenuated inversion magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can be seen in 50% of patients with mild TBIs and no apparent parenchymal damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Roth et al., 2014</xref>). This enhancement has been shown to occur within minutes of injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">Turtzo et al., 2020</xref>). Moreover, many individuals who experienced mild TBIs still exhibited extravasation of contrast into the sub-arachnoid space, indicating that the blood-brain-barrier was compromised (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">Turtzo et al., 2020</xref>). While most patients experienced resolution in meningeal enhancement 19 days after injury, about 15% had persistent enhancement three months post-injury, indicating that some patients experienced prolonged periods without complete meningeal repair following mild TBI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Russo et al., 2018</xref>). These protracted periods of meningeal enhancement likely represent ongoing inflammation within the compartment, yet the different cellular and molecular components that drive this inflammation have not been fully investigated.</p><p>The meningeal response to brain injury can be divided into several phases: acute, sub-acute, and chronic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Roth et al., 2014</xref>). Initial studies of the acute phase response after a mild TBI detail a meningeal response that consists of rapid meningeal cell death due to vascular leakage and reactive oxygen species release, which results in secondary parenchymal damage within the first several hours of injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Russo et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Roth et al., 2014</xref>). The initial injury is followed by meningeal neutrophil swarming (present within an hour of injury) that is essential for regeneration of the initially damaged glial limitans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Roth et al., 2014</xref>). Disrupted meningeal vasculature is then repaired during the week following injury by non-classical monocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Russo et al., 2018</xref>). While these acute meningeal responses have been investigated, much less is understood about how brain injury shapes the meningeal environment more chronically, and if this response is affected by aging. Furthermore, it is unknown whether chronic meningeal changes following brain injury in aged individuals can contribute to neurodegenerative processes.</p><p>In addition to housing lymphatic vessels that drain molecules and cells to peripheral lymph nodes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Aspelund et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Louveau et al., 2015</xref>), the meninges also contain a full array of innate and adaptive immune cells that are in constant communication with neurons and glia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Alves de Lima et al., 2020b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Alves de Lima et al., 2020a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Rustenhoven et al., 2021</xref>). In homeostasis, cytokine signaling from meningeal immune cells has been shown to be critical for shaping cognition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Alves de Lima et al., 2020a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Filiano et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Derecki et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Ribeiro et al., 2019</xref>). For instance, IFN-γ is important in maintaining social behavior networks, whereas IL-4 production by meningeal T cells has been shown to influence learning and memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Filiano et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Derecki et al., 2010</xref>). Recent studies also suggest that IL-17a secretion by γδ T cells in the meninges can impact anxiety-like behaviors and memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Alves de Lima et al., 2020a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Ribeiro et al., 2019</xref>). Of particular relevance, recent work has shown that an age-related decline of CCR7 expression by meningeal T cells may contribute to cognitive impairment, brain inflammation, and neurodegenerative disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Da Mesquita et al., 2021</xref>). In addition to meningeal T cell production of cytokines, it is known that immune cells within the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in the subarachnoid space can also produce signaling molecules and interact with brain-derived products and antigens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Gate et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Lepennetier et al., 2019</xref>). Brain interstitial fluid (ISF) and CSF intermix in the subarachnoid space and both recirculate throughout the brain via the glymphatic system and drain through the meningeal lymphatic network to the periphery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Aspelund et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Louveau et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Plog et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Ringstad and Eide, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Louveau et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Goodman and Iliff, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Antila et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Iliff et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Iliff et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Iliff et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Jessen et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Peng et al., 2016</xref>). This system provides meningeal cells and cells within the CSF with access to brain antigens and proteins. Despite mounting evidence demonstrating that meningeal cells can impact various aspects of neurobiology, we still lack a complete picture of how the meninges respond to processes that have been broadly linked to neurological disease, such as brain injury and aging. Likewise, little is known in regards to how aging impacts meningeal biology both under steady-state conditions and in response to TBI.</p><p>Here, we investigated how the meningeal transcriptional environment is altered following TBI and in aging utilizing high-throughput sequencing techniques, namely single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and bulk RNA sequencing (bulk RNA-seq). We focused on sub-acute (one week post-TBI) and chronic (1.5 months post-TBI) time points after brain injury to better understand how the cellular makeup and gene expression profiles in the meninges change with time and with age. We found that the heterogeneous cellular makeup of the meninges was altered one week following TBI with an increase in the frequency of macrophages and fibroblasts. Moreover, we further showed that the meningeal transcriptional environment was significantly altered in aging, including a broad upregulation of genes involved in antibody production and type I interferon (IFN) signaling. When examining the genes that were differentially expressed in aged mice as compared to young mice 1.5 months following TBI, we found that there was downregulation of genes important for extracellular matrix remodeling and collagen production, and an overall activation of immune system-related genes. This prolonged activation of the immune system was unique to the aged TBI mice, as the young mice exhibited few alterations in the meningeal transcriptome 1.5 months following injury. In order to identify subacute transcriptional changes that may persist chronically after injury in aging, we identified the shared differentially expressed genes between the bulk RNA-seq and scRNA-seq datasets. We found genes that are critical for maintaining an immune response that were initially upregulated one week after injury in young mice, remained upregulated in the chronic setting 1.5 months after injury. Genes important for connective tissue maintenance and wound healing that were downregulated one week after injury, remained downregulated 1.5 months after injury. These findings help reveal chronic dysregulated transcriptional response patterns seen in aging after brain injury. Overall, this study highlights the dynamic nature of the meningeal transcriptome in response to TBI and aging, and sheds light on some of the differences between young and aged individuals in responding to brain injury.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Mild TBI incites alterations in the cellular composition of the meninges</title><p>To gain insights into how TBI impacts meningeal biology, we subjected mice to a mild closed-skull injury and then performed scRNA-seq on the meninges one week post-injury (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>).

Therefore, the sequencing data generated from these studies should better reflect the global meningeal changes that result from a localized injury site rather than the tissue damage and response at the immediate injury site. Joint clustering of both the Sham and TBI meninges revealed 21 unique cell populations including endothelial cells, fibroblasts, Schwann cells, and ciliated ependymal cells from the pia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b and c</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). Additionally, the meninges contained a full repertoire of immune cells including macrophages, B cells, T cells, NK cells, dendritic cells, plasmacytoid dendritic cells, and neutrophils (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b and c</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). Other cell populations were less well-defined and included cells expressing genes important for clotting and proliferating cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b and c</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). When separated out by Sham and TBI treatments, all 21 populations were still present in both groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>), however the frequencies were varied (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1e</xref>). Following brain injury, there was a higher frequency of one group of macrophages which we denoted as ‘Activated Macrophages 1’ as they exhibit high expression of complement-related genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c and e</xref>). Moreover, the frequency of fibroblasts was substantially increased following head trauma (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1e</xref>). While there was a reduction in frequency of some other cell types, namely the B cell populations, it is unclear whether this was relative to the expansion of the other subsets or an actual decrease in number (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1e</xref>). In order to ensure the short digestion and processing steps of the sample preparation did not result in significant upregulation of stress-related genes in both Sham and TBI samples, we examined a collection of genes that have been known to be upregulated after tissue processing and in stress-related conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Haimon et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Marsh et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">Van Hove et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>).

Differential gene expression analysis of the ‘Activated Macrophage’ populations (Activated Macrophages 1 &amp; 2) revealed 321 upregulated genes and 369 downregulated genes following head injury when using a false discovery rate of &lt;0.1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>).

The largest population of macrophages expressed high levels of ferritin (‘Ferritin Expressing’) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2i</xref>). The top two cluster-defining genes within the ‘Ferritin Expressing’ macrophages were ferritin light chain (Ftl1) and ferritin heavy chain (Fth1) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2i</xref>). There were two additional populations, deemed ‘Anti-Inflammatory’ and ‘Resolution Phase’ macrophages, that appeared to be alternatively activated, anti-inflammatory macrophages that are likely implicated in the healing response following injury. The top cluster-defining gene in the ‘Anti-Inflammatory’ macrophage cluster was <italic>Mrc1</italic> (also referred to as CD206), which is known to be present on macrophages that play a role in the healing response after TBI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Russo et al., 2018</xref>). Other highly significant subcluster-defining genes in the ‘Anti-Inflammatory’ macrophage population included <italic>Stab1, Nrros</italic>, and <italic>Dab2</italic>, which are known to be expressed on healing macrophages, and are important for repressing reactive oxygen species and limiting type I IFN responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Park et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Noubade et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Hung et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1a</xref>). ‘Resolution Phase’ macrophages do not fall into either the M1 classically activated or M2 alternatively activated macrophage categories and are believed to play a regulatory role following an inflammatory event (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Stables et al., 2011</xref>). They tend to be enriched for antigen presenting genes, chemokine genes, and proliferation-related genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Stables et al., 2011</xref>). Indeed, the meningeal macrophages in the ‘Resolution Phase’ cluster were defined by their expression of antigen presentation-related genes (<italic>H2-Eb1, H2-Ab1, H2-Aa, Cd74, Ctss</italic>) and anti-inflammatory genes such as <italic>Lair1</italic>, an inhibitory receptor that prevents over-activation of cytokine production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Meyaard et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1b</xref>). In contrast to these ‘Anti-Inflammatory’ and ‘Resolution Phase’ clusters, the final two macrophage populations exhibited gene signatures more commonly associated with inflammatory macrophages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2i</xref>). The ‘Inflammatory 1’ macrophage cluster was defined by its differential expression of <italic>Ccr2</italic> and adhesion molecules such as <italic>Alcam</italic> and <italic>Lgals3</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1c</xref>). The second inflammatory macrophage subset ‘Inflammatory 2’ was defined by its expression of genes important for chemotaxis including <italic>Ccr7, Ccl22</italic>, and <italic>Ccl5</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Kwiecień et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Martinez and Gordon, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1d</xref>).</p><p>To determine how injury affected these distinct meningeal macrophage populations, we separated the cells into Sham and TBI groups and examined their frequencies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2j and k</xref>). Interestingly, there was an overall relative increase in the ‘Anti-Inflammatory’ and ‘Resolution Phase’ macrophages in the TBI group, indicating that one week after injury, the response of the meningeal macrophages appears to shift towards wound healing and inflammation resolution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2j and k</xref>). There was also a relative reduction in the ‘Ferritin Expressing’ macrophages following injury (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2j and k</xref>). Overall, these findings demonstrate that although the macrophages collectively upregulated genes essential for inflammation following TBI, the frequencies of ‘Resolution Phase’ and ‘Anti-Inflammatory’ macrophages also increased and may play a role in the wound healing process.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Mild TBI induces the upregulation of neurological disease-associated genes in meningeal fibroblasts</title><p>Next, we wanted to further investigate the ‘Fibroblast’ population, as it was expanded 1 week following injury in the single cell dataset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d and e</xref>). After head injury, the ‘Fibroblast’ population exhibited 368 activated genes and 320 repressed genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>). There were several patterns in the activated genes following injury, including genes important for collagen production and extracellular matrix remodeling (<italic>Nisch, Ppib, Pmepa1, Ddr2</italic>) and genes critical for cell motility and growth (<italic>Ptprs, Pfn1, Cd302, Tpm3</italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>). To validate these sequencing findings, we utilized immunohistochemical staining for collagen, which is produced by fibroblasts, in meningeal whole mounts. Consistent with the sequencing results, we observed a significant increase in collagen density 1 week after TBI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c, d and e</xref>). Furthermore, we were also interested in determining whether the fibroblast population was contributing to the inflammatory response following TBI.

To accomplish this, we examined the expression of molecules that are commonly used to identify the distinct layer of the meninges in which the fibroblast population is likely to reside (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">DeSisto et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Doro et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Cooper et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib118">Zarbalis et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Kalamarides et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Siegenthaler et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Caglayan et al., 2014</xref>).

Fewer pia- or arachnoid-resident fibroblasts were present, as anticipated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3h</xref>). When we looked at the expression level of dural fibroblast genes before and after TBI, we saw that several of the markers (e.g. <italic>Foxc2</italic>, <italic>Fxyd5</italic>) were significantly upregulated following injury, and other dural markers, while not expressed at significantly higher levels, were clearly expressed by a higher proportion of total cells (e.g. <italic>Alpl, Mgp</italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3i</xref>).

Concomitantly, the T cells also upregulated various genes that are known to be involved in the dampening of immune responses such as <italic>Socs1</italic> (Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling-1) and <italic>Cd52</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4f</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Liau et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Toh et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Investigating the genes that were upregulated in the B cell populations following injury, we found that many of these genes fell into the category of ‘B Cell Maturation’, including <italic>Cd83, Ube2d3</italic>, and <italic>Doc3</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4g</xref>). Other upregulated genes included those important for B cell activation and signaling (<italic>Blnk, Cd19</italic>), antigen presentation (<italic>Cd79b, H2-D1</italic>), and inflammation (<italic>Ppia, Hmgb1</italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4g</xref>). The upregulation of these genes suggests that TBI drives the activation and maturation of B cell populations in the meningeal compartment. Overall, these data demonstrate that both T and B cells upregulate genes involved in activation of adaptive immune responses following head trauma. This upregulation seems to be controlled, as multiple regulatory genes are also simultaneously activated.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Predicted ligand-target interactions highlight a pro-growth and controlled pro-inflammatory meningeal environment after TBI</title><p>Cell-cell interactions may partly dictate the gene expression dynamics observed following TBI. We used Nichenet to explore how intercellular communication may influence the post-injury transcriptional environment. Nichenet is a tool that integrates gene expression data from interacting cells to infer the effects of sender-cell ligands on receiver cell expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Browaeys et al., 2020</xref>). Since both macrophage and fibroblast populations exhibited significant transcriptional alterations post-TBI we focused our analysis on how signaling of these large populations affects other meningeal cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1e</xref>).</p><p>We first examined how the macrophage cell populations might influence the gene expression patterns of the other major cell populations in the scRNA-seq dataset (T cells, B cells, Dendritic Cells, NK cells, Fibroblasts, and Endothelial Cells) through inferred ligand-target interactions. Of all macrophage ligands, <italic>Tgfb1</italic> best predicted the gene expression patterns seen in other cell populations, suggesting the observed transcriptional dynamics reflect an environment of cell growth, differentiation, and alternative macrophage activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2a and b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Gong et al., 2012</xref>). Furthermore, other top-predicted macrophage ligands including <italic>Itgam</italic>, <italic>Apoe</italic>, <italic>Vcam1</italic>, <italic>Selplg</italic>, <italic>Nectin1</italic>, and <italic>Itgb1</italic> play critical roles in cell adhesion and phagocytosis, both necessary for mounting an inflammatory response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2a and b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Grainger et al., 2004</xref>). Other top-ligands with pro-inflammatory properties include <italic>Adam17</italic>, which is involved in the processing of TNF at the surface of the cell, <italic>Tnfsf13b</italic>, which promotes activation and proliferation of B cells, and <italic>C3</italic>, which is part of the complement cascade (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Black et al., 1997</xref>). We observe gene expression changes and cellular phenotypes consistent with predicted ligand effects on target cells. For example, <italic>Tgfb1</italic> signaling is predicted to activate multiple genes that affect collagen production including <italic>Col1a1</italic>, <italic>Col1a2</italic> and <italic>Col3a1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2c</xref>), aligning with our finding of increased collagen production following TBI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c–e</xref>). Predicted target genes of other pro-inflammatory ligands such as <italic>Adam17</italic> and <italic>Tnfsf13b</italic> include B cell response genes (<italic>Cd19, Cd79a,</italic> and <italic>Ighm</italic>) and genes related to immune cell activation and antigen-presentation (<italic>Cd38</italic> and <italic>Cd40</italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2c</xref>). Finally, when we examined how ligands from other cells in the meninges may impact the macrophage gene signature, we saw that ligands from multiple cell populations (Endothelial Cells, Dendritic Cells, T cells, and B cells) are likely responsible for shaping this signature (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2d</xref>). This is not surprising given that monocytes and macrophages likely interact with all of the meningeal cell populations and play very important roles in shaping the overall gene expression signatures seen after TBI. Overall, the predicted ligand-target interactions between the macrophage population and other major meningeal cell populations after brain injury illustrate a proliferative, pro-inflammatory state.</p><p>Next, we examined how the meningeal fibroblast population might influence local gene expression through ligand-target interactions. As with the macrophage ligands, we found the top ligand signaling pathways in fibroblasts were essential for cellular growth and differentiation. More specifically, many top ligands were essential for promoting angiogenesis (<italic>Vegfa</italic>, <italic>Cxcl12</italic>, <italic>Pgf</italic>), growth and inflammation (<italic>Apoe</italic>, <italic>Csf1</italic>, <italic>Cxcl12</italic>, <italic>Tgfb3</italic>), and extracellular matrix development and wound healing (<italic>Col4a1</italic>, <italic>Hspg2</italic>, <italic>Nov</italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1a and b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Solé-Boldo et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Buechler et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Lin et al., 2005</xref>). Interestingly, we found anti-inflammatory pathways among the top predicted ligands including <italic>Anxa1,</italic> which is known for its inhibitory effects on adhesion and migration<italic>,</italic> and <italic>Serping1</italic>, which is responsible for production of C1 inhibitor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1a and b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Gavins and Hickey, 2012</xref>). Predicted targets of the top ligand, <italic>Apoe</italic>, include complement cascade genes such as <italic>C1qb</italic> and <italic>C1qc</italic>, both of which were upregulated in the meningeal macrophage population after injury. Other ligands, such as <italic>Csf1</italic>, also likely potentiate the immune response by activating genes such as <italic>Cd14</italic> and <italic>Cd68</italic>, which are important for macrophage/monocyte responses in inflammation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1c</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Buechler et al., 2021</xref>). Other ligands, such as <italic>Vegfa</italic>, likely activate endothelial cells, which results in upregulation of genes important for cellular growth and division including <italic>Fos</italic> and <italic>Id1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1c</xref>). Upon performing the inverse analysis, we find that endothelial cells and macrophages strongly influence the fibroblast transcriptome as evidenced by high expression of influential ligands in a significant proportion of the cell population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1d</xref>). Altogether, meningeal fibroblasts likely influence gene expression signatures after TBI to promote pro-growth and angiogenic signaling cascades in addition to a balanced upregulation of the immune system. Together with macrophages, these predicted ligand-target interactions highlight the highly complex but coordinated and controlled response to injury that occurs in young mice.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Prominent effects of aging and mild TBI on the meningeal transcriptome</title><p>Given the considerable brain injury-induced alterations in the meningeal transcriptional and cellular landscape that we observed in young mice, we were next interested in investigating whether these changes were preserved or altered with age. It has previously been suggested that inability to properly resolve inflammatory responses in the brain after head trauma contributes to the aggravated disease course commonly seen in the elderly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Chou et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib116">Witcher et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib115">Witcher et al., 2018</xref>). Therefore, we were also particularly interested to explore potential differences in the resolution of meningeal immune responses following TBI between young and aged mice. To this end, we performed bulk RNA-seq on the meningeal tissue at 1.5 months post TBI or Sham treatment in both young (10 weeks of age) and aged (20 months of age) mice, as we predicted that the meningeal injury would have largely resolved 1.5 months post-TBI in young mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a</xref>). Principal component analysis (PCA) revealed that age was the main driver of differential gene expression, as young and aged groups clustered furthest apart (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5b</xref>). However, while the young mice that had received either Sham or TBI clustered together in the PCA plot, the aged Sham and TBI mice clustered further apart, indicating that the effects from TBI may have more long-lasting effects on gene expression in aged mice when compared to young mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5b</xref>). Indeed, when we looked at the number of differentially expressed genes between all four experimental groups, we saw that there were only a total of 22 differentially expressed genes when comparing Young Sham with Young TBI, while there were a total of 364 differentially expressed genes when comparing Aged Sham with Aged TBI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5c and d</xref>). Interestingly, 1772 differentially expressed genes were identified when comparing Young Sham mice with Aged Sham mice, and 2936 differentially regulated genes were identified when comparing Young TBI mice with Aged TBI mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5c and d</xref>). Furthermore, we looked at which genes were shared between comparison groups to determine if the TBI signature in aging was unique or largely shared with the uninjured aged mice. Interestingly, there were 917 downregulated genes and 639 upregulated genes that were unique to the Young TBI vs. Aged TBI comparison and not shared with any other comparison, including the Young Sham vs. Aged Sham comparison. There were 595 downregulated genes and 592 upregulated genes that were shared between these two comparisons, indicating that while a portion of the transcription changes seen in the Young TBI vs. Aged TBI group may be attributed to aging, a significant number of the affected genes were uniquely identified in the setting of trauma in aged mice. Overall, this indicates that aging profoundly affects meningeal gene expression and that mild head trauma in aging results in even larger changes in gene expression. Moreover, while the young mice exhibit very few gene expression changes 1.5 months following TBI, the aged mice experience many more alterations in gene expression that last for a longer period of time, which suggests that recovery post-TBI may be delayed with aging.</p><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Effects of aging and mild TBI on the meningeal transcriptome.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Schematic depicting experimental layout.

We found highly significant upregulations in genes related to the immunoglobulin heavy chain (<italic>Ighm, Ighg2b, Igha</italic>), light chain (<italic>Igkc</italic>), and components of IgA or IgM antibodies (<italic>Jchain</italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6c</xref>). Using immunohistochemistry on meningeal whole mounts, we confirmed that aged meninges have significantly increased J chain deposition that is concentrated along the sinuses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6d and e</xref>). Next, we wanted to determine whether the increased antibody-related gene production we saw in aged mice was due to an overall increased number of B cells. Interestingly, we saw that the number cells expressing B220 along the meningeal transverse sinus in mice was significantly lower in aged mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6f and g</xref>), which is in contrast to other recent studies have shown that B cells comprise a larger proportion and number of cells in aged dural meninges (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Brioschi et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Mrdjen et al., 2018</xref>). Therefore, as a second method of validation, we performed flow cytometry on the entire dural meninges to assess for B220 + and CD19 + cell counts and frequency within total CD45 + cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1a</xref>). The aged dural meninges had overall fewer cells when compared to young dural meninges (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1b</xref>). Upon examination of total B220+, CD19+, and B220 + CD19 + cell numbers, we did not see significant differences in aged mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1c</xref>).

In summation, we do not see increases in B cell numbers in the aged dura, which suggests that the increase in antibody-related gene expression seen in aging may reflect a change in the function of the B cells in the dural meninges rather than a recruitment of more B cells. Differences in our data compared to other published findings may reflect regional differences in B cell populations along the transverse sinus given the impaired meningeal lymphatics seen in aged mice. Other potential drivers of our distinct findings include differences in sex and microbiome, both of which might also influence the number and frequency of B cells in the meninges. Overall, this suggests that the composition of the B cell population in aged mice may be substantially different than in young mice; however, future studies are needed to formally evaluate this in greater detail.</p><p>In addition to the antibody-related gene upregulation, we also observed increased expression of type I interferon (IFN)-related genes within the bulk RNA sequencing dataset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6h</xref>). Type I IFNs have been shown to be upregulated in the brain parenchyma in various neurological disorders, where they are generally thought to play deleterious roles in promoting disease pathogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Karve et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Barrett et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Baruch et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abdullah et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib119">Zhang et al., 2017</xref>).

These findings demonstrate that aging promotes profound alterations in the meningeal transcriptome. Moreover, the upregulation of antibody genes and type I IFN related-genes suggests an overall elevation in immune activation status in the aged meninges.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>Injury in aged mice results in prolonged inflammatory responses</title><p>In order to assess the unique transcriptional response to TBI in aged compared to young mice, we analyzed the transcriptional response that is exclusive to the Young TBI vs Aged TBI comparison and not shared with the Young Sham vs Aged Sham comparison in the bulk RNA-seq dataset.

We found that genes associated with immune activation were profoundly upregulated in aged TBI mice in comparison to their young TBI counterparts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7d</xref>). The most enriched GO biological processes included the ‘defense response’ and ‘immune system process’ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7d</xref>). Some of the genes that contributed to the upregulation of these immune-related terms included those associated with immunoglobulin production (<italic>Ighg2c</italic>), T and B cell signaling (<italic>Cd24a, Zap70, Cxcr6</italic>), and cell death (<italic>Casp12, C2</italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7e</xref>). In summary, these findings highlight some of the distinct changes seen in the aged meningeal tissue following TBI. Specifically, we find that mild TBI in aged mice results in prolonged activation of immune genes and decreased expression of genes involved in extracellular matrix remodeling and the maintenance of cellular junctions. Furthermore, we report that while the meningeal transcriptome in young mice returns almost completely to baseline resting levels by 1.5 months post mild head injury, the aged meninges, in contrast, continue to exhibit substantial and protracted transcriptional alterations related to head injury.</p></sec><sec id="s2-8"><title>Immune system-related transcriptional changes link TBI-driven gene expression patterns in young mice with chronic changes seen in aging</title><p>Finally, we wanted to investigate whether post-TBI gene expression changes persist in aged mice by identifying common gene expression patterns between the young mice one week after injury and the aged mice 1.5 months after injury. To do this, we looked at both the scRNA-seq dataset (one week after TBI) and the bulk RNA-seq dataset (1.5 months after TBI) to determine whether there were shared differentially expressed genes. First, we compared the differentially expressed genes in the T cells, B cells, Fibroblasts, and Macrophages in the scRNA-seq dataset with the differentially expressed genes in the Young Sham vs. Aged Sham comparison, to determine whether some of these genes were shared with aging alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8a</xref>). While there were 139 shared differentially regulated genes, a majority of the differentially expressed genes in each dataset were not shared (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8a</xref>). When we looked more closely at the shared downregulated genes, we found that many were important for wound healing and maintenance of connective tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8c</xref>). These data suggest that some of the downregulated genes important for wound healing in the subacute time point after TBI remain chronically downregulated in the aged meninges, further supporting the idea that aged meninges may be less able to respond to injury at baseline. Some of the upregulated genes that were shared at the subacute time point and chronically in aging were genes that contribute to abnormal immune cell physiology, innate immune response, and immune cell activation, again supporting the notion that aged meninges adopt a chronic, baseline activation of the immune system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8c</xref>). Alternatively, while the young meninges initially upregulate some genes important for an inflammatory response one week following TBI, gene expression levels eventually return to baseline.</p><fig id="fig8" position="float"><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Shared gene signatures show dysregulated immune activation.</title><p>Differential gene expression was compared between the scRNA-seq dataset in young mice (1 week post-TBI) and the bulk RNA-seq dataset in aged mice (1.5 months post-TBI).

Of the shared downregulated genes, many contribute to cell adhesion and response to endoplasmic reticulum stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8d</xref>). Altogether, while a majority of the genes that were differentially expressed in both the bulk RNA and scRNA sequencing datasets were not shared, the common genes reflect a pattern of abnormal immune cell activation and a defective response to healing as demonstrated by the downregulation of genes important for extracellular matrix repair and cellular adhesion. While the aged mice still exhibit this signature 1.5 months after injury, the young mice express these shared genes initially, but return to baseline levels 1.5 months after injury.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Findings from these studies highlight the heterogeneous and dynamic nature of the meninges in response to TBI and aging. Following TBI in young mice, there is an enrichment of fibroblast and macrophage populations in the dural meninges, as well as an upregulation in genes associated with immune activation. Interestingly, the gene expression patterns of the meninges are significantly altered in aging, with large upregulations in genes involved in immunoglobulin production and type I IFN signaling. More than a month after injury, the aged meninges exhibit downregulation of genes related to collagenase production, extracellular matrix maintenance, and cell junction formation, when compared to young meninges. The aged meninges after injury also show upregulation of genes involved in immune signaling. Moreover, the aged meninges experience a much more prolonged and substantial response to injury than the meninges in young mice, which have largely returned to baseline by 1.5 months post-injury.</p><p>While our overall knowledge of meningeal biology in TBI remains limited, recent work has begun to uncover roles for meningeal macrophages in head trauma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Russo et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Roth et al., 2014</xref>). For instance, studies by Roth et al. demonstrated that the release of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which occurs as part of meningeal macrophage cell death, can trigger subsequent tissue damage in the brain parenchyma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Roth et al., 2014</xref>). Interestingly, they showed that blocking ROS release by dying meningeal macrophages is also effective in minimizing cell death in the brain parenchyma. Collectively, these results suggest that the meningeal response to TBI directly affects cells in the brain as well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Roth et al., 2014</xref>). More recently, this same group also demonstrated that meningeal macrophages play important roles in coordinating meningeal remodeling and vascular repair following mild head trauma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Russo et al., 2018</xref>). Here, they showed that distinct macrophage populations function within defined regions in and around the injury site. For example, they identified that inflammatory myelomonocytic cells work in the core of the lesion where dead cells are abundant, whereas wound-healing macrophages are present along the perimeter of the injury where they work to restore blood vasculature and clear fibrin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Russo et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Recent studies have also begun to uncover critical roles for meningeal lymphocytes in various neurological disorders as well as in the regulation of basic neurological functions and behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Alves de Lima et al., 2020b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Alves de Lima et al., 2020a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Filiano et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Derecki et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Ribeiro et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Rua and McGavern, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Brioschi et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Mrdjen et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Louveau et al., 2018</xref>). Yet, surprisingly little is currently known with regard to how head trauma impacts adaptive immunity in the meninges. Here, we show that adaptive immune cells found in the meninges of young mice upregulate genes essential for activation and maturation at one week post-TBI. Furthermore, in both aging alone and in aged mice following brain injury, we observed an upregulation of many genes important for antibody production by B cells. Interestingly, emerging studies have proposed that IgA-producing plasma B cells survey the meninges and that their IgA secretion provides an ‘immunological barrier’ to prevent potential pathogens from gaining access into the brain parenchyma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Fitzpatrick et al., 2020</xref>). While speculative, perhaps this upregulation in antibody production genes in the meninges is a protective strategy that is mobilized to counteract the loss of blood-brain barrier (BBB) integrity that can occur both in aging and following TBI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Ren et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib117">Yang et al., 2020</xref>). Nevertheless, further studies are required to follow up on the significance and function of this elevation in antibody-related genes that is seen in the meninges as a result of aging and head trauma.</p><p>For the studies that appear in this paper we paid special attention to the transcriptional response that occurs in meningeal macrophages, fibroblasts, and lymphocytes given their high abundance in the meninges as well as emerging evidence suggesting important roles for these immune cell lineages in TBI pathogenesis. However, it should be noted that there are many other populations of cells present in the meninges in which we were not able to adequately assess differential gene expression due to their small population sizes. In future studies, it will be important to further interrogate the functions of these less abundant cell populations in TBI. Notably, the presence of plasmacytoid dendritic cells within the meninges is intriguing as they are known to be potent producers of type I IFNs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Fitzgerald-Bocarsly et al., 2008</xref>). It is possible that plasmacytoid cells could be contributing to the type I IFN signature seen with aging and TBI in the meninges; however, future work is needed to formally investigate this.</p><p>It is also known that sex differences play a role in outcomes after TBI both in human and animal models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Gupte et al., 2019</xref>). While men have a higher likelihood of sustaining a TBI, women have a higher likelihood of suffering worse outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Gupte et al., 2019</xref>). Due to the number of other variables we were already considering for this study (age, time, and injury status), we were unable to include sex as a variable for our sequencing data. This leaves further opportunities for investigation into how sex impacts the meningeal transcriptome in the context of both TBI and aging. High throughput sequencing techniques provide unique opportunities to understanding how sex affects CNS tissues at a cellular and transcriptional level.</p><p>While the meningeal immune response to head trauma in aged mice appears to be largely upregulated, the meningeal immune response in young mice following injury appears to be held in check. One week following injury, although there is an upregulation in genes important for the inflammatory response in the macrophage and adaptive immune cell populations, there are other upregulated genes that are important for dampening this same immune response and promoting wound healing. For instance, the subsets of macrophages whose frequencies increase the most following injury are ‘Anti-Inflammatory’ and ‘Resolution Phase’ macrophages, both of which have been reported to exert wound-healing properties in injury models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Russo et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Stables et al., 2011</xref>). Furthermore, while T cells were observed to upregulate genes associated with immune activation, survival, and adhesion, they also displayed increased expression of genes involved in dampening cytokine signaling and controlling the immune response in the meninges of young mice (e.g. <italic>Cfl1, Socs2</italic>, and <italic>Cd52</italic>). Moreover, the vast majority of these differentially expressed genes seen in young meninges at one week post-injury return to resting levels by 1.5 months following head trauma, suggesting a resolution of inflammation and a restoration of homeostasis in young mice. In contrast, aged mice do not appear to have this same success in resolving inflammatory responses following head trauma. In addition to the baseline inflammatory state of aged meninges that is characterized by increased expression of genes related to type I IFN signaling and antibody production, aged mice that received a TBI were found to further upregulate genes involved in driving inflammatory responses. Moreover, these injured aged mice were also shown to downregulate numerous genes involved in extracellular matrix reorganization and collagen production, which are two processes that are necessary for proper tissue regeneration. These transcriptional alterations in aged meninges persist beyond a month following injury, with no indications of resolution.</p><p>It is well known that aged individuals have a higher morbidity and mortality than young individuals when experiencing a similar severity brain injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Susman et al., 2002</xref>). The explanation for why the elderly experience these poorer outcomes following TBI is likely complex and multifaceted. Many studies have highlighted baseline changes in the aged brain that has been speculated to prime the elderly for differential responses following injury, including changes in the BBB, microglial dysfunction, and an overall increase in neuroinflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Androvic et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib117">Yang et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Marschallinger et al., 2020</xref>). Furthermore, other findings support changes in the response to injury in the aged brain, including alterations in the type and number of immune cells recruited to the injury site, further increases in inflammatory gene signatures in the brain parenchyma, and elevated production of potentially neurotoxic molecules such as ROS and type I IFNs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Chou et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Morganti et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Ritzel et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Androvic et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Ritzel et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Kumar et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Krukowski et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Karve et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Barrett et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Baruch et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abdullah et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib119">Zhang et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Itoh et al., 2013</xref>). Our findings indicate that the meninges may also play a role in this differential response to head trauma seen in aging. In particular, it is possible that the increased baseline type I IFN gene signature and antibody production observed in aging potentially renders the aged brain prone to more severe clinical outcomes post-TBI.</p><p>Recent studies have implicated the meningeal lymphatic system, which resides in the dura, in modulating inflammation in the brain following TBI and sub-arachnoid hemorrhage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Bolte et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Chen et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Pu et al., 2019</xref>). In these studies, impairments in the meningeal lymphatic system prior to brain injury were found to result in increased gliosis and worsened behavioral outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Bolte et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Chen et al., 2020</xref>). Interestingly, the meningeal lymphatic system is also known to be impaired in aging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Da Mesquita et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ahn et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Ma et al., 2017</xref>), and we have previously shown that the rejuvenation of the meningeal lymphatic vasculature in aged mice dampens the subsequent gliosis following TBI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Bolte et al., 2020</xref>). How the meningeal lymphatic system might modulate meningeal immunity before and after injury remains to be investigated. Furthermore, whether the meningeal lymphatic impairment in aging contributes to the overall increase in inflammation seen in the aged meninges is another area for future investigation.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Overall, the findings presented here provide new insights into the meningeal response to brain injury and aging. We show that TBI results in broad gene expression changes in discrete cell populations following injury in young mice. Specifically, we demonstrate that there is an increase in the frequency of fibroblasts and macrophages 1 week following injury in young mice. Furthermore, we provide evidence that the transcriptional environment in the aged meninges is drastically altered. At baseline, the aged meninges show increases in gene expression patterns associated with type I IFN signaling and antibody production by B cells. However, upon injury, the aged meninges further upregulate genes involved in immune system activation, while downregulating genes critical for tissue remodeling. Improved understanding of how the meninges respond to brain injury in youth and aging will help shed light on why the elderly have poor outcomes following TBI and may help to identify opportunities for targeted therapies to improve outcomes following TBI.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom">Reagent type (species) or resource</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Designation</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Source or reference</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Identifiers</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Antibody</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Anti-CD45.2 EF450 (rat monoclonal)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Thermo Scientific</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Catalog #

All WT aged mice were approximately 20 months of age and were obtained from the National Institute on Aging (NIA) Aged Rodent Colonies. The mice from the NIA Aged Rodent Colonies were originally derived from the Jackson colonies. Upon arrival, aged mice were housed in University of Virginia facilities for at least 2 months before use. Other young mice ordered directly from the Jackson Laboratories were housed in the local University of Virginia facility for at least 2 weeks before use. Mice were housed in specific pathogen-free conditions under standard 12 hr light/dark cycle conditions in rooms equipped with control for temperature (21 ± 1.5°C) and humidity (50 ± 10%).

Mice were anesthetized by 4% isoflurane with 0.3 kPa O<sub>2</sub> for 2 min and then the right preauricular area was shaved. The mouse was placed prone on an 8x4 x 4-inch foam bed (type E bedding, open-cell flexible polyurethane foam with a density of approximately 0.86 pounds per cubic feet and a spring constant of approximately 4.0 Newtons per meter) with its nose in a nosecone delivering 1.5% isoflurane (purchased from Foam to Size, Ashland VA). The head was otherwise unsecured. The device used to deliver TBI was a Controlled Cortical Impact Device (Leica Biosystems, 39463920). A 3 mm impact probe was attached to the impactor device which was secured to a stereotaxic frame and positioned at 45 degrees from vertical. In this study, we used a strike depth of 2 mm, 0.1 s of contact time and an impact velocity of 5.2 meters (m) per second (s). The impactor was positioned at the posterior corner of the eye, moved 3 mm towards the ear and adjusted to the specified depth using the stereotaxic frame. A cotton swab was used to apply water to the injury site and the tail in order to establish contact sensing. To induce TBI, the impactor was retracted and dispensed once correctly positioned. The impact was delivered to the right inferior temporal lobe of the brain. Following impact, the mouse was placed supine on a heating pad and allowed to regain consciousness. After anesthesia induction, the delivery of the injuries took less than 1 minute. The time until the mouse returned to the prone position was recorded as the righting time. Upon resuming the prone position, mice were returned to their home cages to recover on a heating pad for six hours with soft food. For Sham procedures, mice were anesthetized by 4% isoflurane with 0.3 kPa O<sub>2</sub> for 2 min and then the right preauricular area was shaved. The mouse was placed prone on a foam bed with its nose secured in a nosecone delivering 1.5% isoflurane. The impactor was positioned at the posterior corner of the eye, moved 3 mm towards the ear and adjusted to the specified depth using the stereotaxic frame. A cotton swab was used to apply water to the injury site and the tail in order to establish contact sensing. Then, the impactor was adjusted to a height where no impact would occur, and was retracted and dispensed. Following the Sham procedure, the mouse was placed supine on a heating pad and allowed to regain consciousness. Mice were allowed to recover on the heating pad in their home cages for 6 hr with soft food before being returned to the housing facilities.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Meningeal tissue collection</title><p>Mice were euthanized with CO<sub>2</sub> and then transcardially perfused with 20 mL 1 x PBS.

For each of the four experimental groups (Young Sham, Aged Sham, Young TBI and Aged TBI) 2 dorsal meningeal samples were combined to create 1 biological replicate. Three biological replicates were used for each experimental group yielding a total of 12 samples comprised of 2 meninges each. After defrosting on ice, 10 silica beads were added to each tube and the tissue was homogenized for 30 s using a mini bead beater. Following homogenization, the samples were centrifuged for 12,000 xg for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was transferred to a new tube and incubated at room temperature for 5 min. Next, 0.1 mL of chloroform was added to the supernatant, vortexed, incubated for 2 min at room temperature and then centrifuged at 12,000 xg for 15 min at 4 °C. The top aqueous phase was transferred into a new Eppendorf tube and the RNeasy Micro Kit (74004, Qiagen) was used to isolate the RNA. The quality and concentration of the RNA was assessed using a plate reader. RNA was frozen at −80 °C until sent for sequencing.

Mice were euthanized with CO<sub>2</sub> and then transcardially perfused with ice-cold PBS with heparin (0.025%). The skull caps were prepared as described in ‘Meningeal tissue collection’. Meninges were peeled from the skull cap and placed in ice-cold DMEM for the entirety of collection. The meninges from 5 mice that had received TBI 1 week prior were pooled as one biological replicate. The meninges from 5 mice that had received a Sham procedure 1 week prior were pooled as one biological replicate. These 2 samples were then processed for scRNA sequencing. Meninges were then digested for 15 min at 37 °C with constant agitation using 1 mL of pre-warmed digestion buffer (DMEM, with 2% FBS, 1 mg/mL collagenase VIII (Sigma Aldrich), and 0.5 mg/mL DNase I (Sigma Aldrich)). The enzymes were neutralized with 1 mL of complete medium (DMEM with 10% FBS) and meninges were then filtered through a 70 µm cell strainer. An additional 2 mL of FACS buffer was added, samples were centrifuged at 400 xg for 5 min, and samples were resuspended in FACS buffer. After 2 washes, cells were resuspended in FACS buffer with DAPI (0.2 µg/mL). Singlet gates were selected using pulse width of the side scatter and forward scatter. Live cells were selected based on the lack of DAPI staining. Cells were sorted into 1.5 mL tubes with ice cold DMEM. Following sorting, cells were centrifuged again at 450 xg for 4 min and the media was aspirated. Cells were resuspended in 200 μL 0.04% BSA in PBS (0.04% non-acetylated BSA) and centrifuged again.

RStudio (v1.2.5033) was used for all downstream analyses and Seurat (v.3.9.9) was used for filtering out low-quality cells, normalization of the data, determination of cluster defining markers and graphing of the data on UMAP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Stuart et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Butler et al., 2018</xref>). Only one sequencing run was performed therefore there was no need for batch correction. Initially, there were 2261 cells collected from the Sham mice and 4022 cells collected from the TBI mice. Low-quality cells were excluded in an initial quality-control (QC) step by removing cells with fewer than 150 unique genes and cells expressing more than 5,000 unique genes in effort to remove doublets and triplets (Sham total: 2257, TBI total: 4018). Cells with transcriptomes that were more than 20% mitochondrial-derived were removed and cells with more than 5% hemoglobin among their expressed genes were also removed (Sham total: 2049, TBI total: 3775). Using Seurat, genes with high variance were selected using the FindVariableGenes() function, then the dimensionality of the data was reduced by principle component analysis (PCA) and identified by random sampling of 20 significant principal components (PCs) for each sample with the PCElbowPlot() function. Cells were clustered with Seurat’s FindClusters() function. Absolute cell counts for each population can be found in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>. scCATCH (v2.1) was used for automated cluster naming (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Shao et al., 2020</xref>), and all cluster names were manually checked due to the lack of literature regarding meningeal cell populations.

The data was cleaned by removing reads that aligned to uninformative regions of the genome and PCR duplicates. The proportion of PCR duplicates, proportion of reads that align with genes, and proportion of uninformative reads were analyzed for each sample to ensure there were no samples that were outliers regarding data quality. Samtools was used for quality control filtering (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Li et al., 2009</xref>). Reads were sorted into feature counts with HTSeq (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Anders et al., 2015</xref>). DESeq2 (v1.30.0) was used to normalize the raw counts based on read depth, perform principal component analysis, and conduct differential expression analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Love et al., 2014</xref>). For assessing differential gene expression in this dataset, the ‘categorize.deseq.df’ function was used to classify genes in to ‘activated’, ‘repressed’, and ‘not different’ categories as defined by an adjusted p-value of less than 0.1. The p-values were corrected with the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure to limit false positives arising from multiple testing. The gene set collections from MSigDB were used for differential gene set enrichment analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Liberzon et al., 2015</xref>).

Quantitative analysis of the acquired images was performed using Fiji software. Imaging parameters for brightness, contrast, and threshold values were applied uniformly throughout each experiment. Additionally, tears in the meninges were excluded when performing the analyses. For the assessment of collagen expression and J-chain quantification, 5 meningeal whole mounts were included per experimental group. For collagen, 10 x images were taken of meningeal whole mounts. To quantify the collagen, the corrected total cellular fluorescence (CTCF) was used, which takes into account the area of the meninges, the average fluorescent intensity of that area, and the fluorescent intensity of the background, as given by the formula: Mean fluorescence of meningeal whole mounts - (area of meningeal whole mount x mean fluorescence of background). For J-chain quantification, a uniformly sized 20 x image of the superior sagittal sinus was taken for each sample with 5 samples in each experimental group. The number of J-chain puncta was then quantified (puncta threshold: 5–10 microns) using the ‘Analyze Particle’ tool. For quantification of B220 + cells, 20 x scans (n=5 per group) were taken of the entire transverse sinus. The number of B220 + cells were manually counted and quantified by a blinded experimenter.

As the Reviewer suggested, we have provided additional analyses to further understand the link between the single cell and bulk RNA-seq datasets and have clarified the analysis of the bulk RNA sequencing according to the Reviewer’s comments. We thank the Reviewer for their valuable suggestions as we feel that they have greatly helped to improve this study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Cell class-level DEGs derived from scRNAseq studies were not well integrated/quantified from the bulkseq data. Sup Figures4-6 have unique genesets, and/or Figures 2a, 3a, and 4a have calculated trauma-responsive genes, yet these were not integrated very well from the bulkseq studies to determine whether these changes in the subacute timepoint carryover chronically.</p></disp-quote><p>This is an excellent point that is brought forth by the Reviewer, and therefore we have performed new analyses to better understand how our scRNA-seq and bulk RNA-seq gene sets are related. This new data analysis now appears in Figure 8 of the revised manuscript. First, we compared the differentially expressed genes in the T cells, B cells, Fibroblasts and Macrophages in the scRNA-seq dataset with the differentially expressed genes in the Young Sham vs. Aged Sham comparison, to determine whether some of these genes were differentially expressed with aging alone (Figure 8a in the revised manuscript). While there were 139 shared differentially regulated genes, a majority of the differentially expressed genes in each dataset were not shared (Figure 8a in the revised manuscript). When we looked more closely at the shared downregulated genes, we found that many were important for wound healing and maintenance of connective tissue (Figure 8c in the revised manuscript). These data suggest that some of the downregulated genes important for wound healing in the subacute timepoint after TBI remain chronically downregulated in the aged meninges, further supporting the idea that aged meninges may be less able to respond to injury at baseline. Some of the upregulated genes that were shared at the subacute timepoint and chronically in aging were genes that contribute to abnormal immune cell physiology, innate immune response, and immune cell activation, again supporting the notion that aged meninges have a baseline activation of the immune system compared with young meninges (Figure 8c in the revised manuscript).</p><p>Looking more closely at the differentially regulated genes shared between the Young TBI vs. Aged TBI bulk RNA sequencing comparison and the T cells, B cells, Fibroblasts, and Macrophages of the scRNA-seq dataset, we found 119 genes in common (Figure 8b in the revised manuscript). Similar to aging alone, many of the common upregulated genes were related to abnormal immune cell activation, reflecting the chronically activated immune response that occurs after TBI in aging (Figure 8d in the revised manuscript). Of the shared downregulated genes, many contribute to cell adhesion and response to endoplasmic reticulum stress (Figure 8d in the revised manuscript). Altogether, while a majority of the genes that were differentially expressed in both the bulk RNA and scRNA sequencing datasets were not shared, the common genes reflect a pattern of abnormal immune cell activation and a defective response to healing as demonstrated by the downregulation of genes important for extracellular matrix repair and cellular adhesion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Bulkseq data could be better presented for clarity. Figure 7 seems to belong within/after Figure 5. Overall, it would be better presented to show unbiased examinations on the bulkseq data first (e.g. pathway, ontologies, or gsea, etc.), then show scRNseq-defined gene/cell class quantification (e.g. Fig6).</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the Reviewer for bringing forth an area of the manuscript that was unclear and for this thoughtful suggestion. We have made efforts to clarify this portion of the manuscript. Figure 5 is the first introduction to the bulk sequencing dataset. We removed the Venn diagram in Figure 7 and instead included upset plots in Figure 5 to more clearly delineate the comparisons within the dataset and which genes were shared/unique to each comparison, as suggested by the Reviewer. Figure 5 in the revised manuscript now includes all general, unbiased expression data from this bulk sequencing experiment.</p><p>Next, in Figure 6 we highlight the gene expression changes that were seen with aging alone. Figure 6 starts with unbiased analysis of the Young Sham vs. Aged Sham comparison (top 20 upand down-regulated genes, GO terms) and then we more closely examine some of the genes that are important for contributing to these GO terms still within the bulk sequencing dataset (Figure 6c,h). We include additional immunohistochemistry and flow cytometry studies to expand on these points and to validate this dataset. Finally, in Figure 7, we discuss the changes that were unique to TBI in aging and not shared with the changes seen in aging alone. In Figure 7 we also start with unbiased analyses of the genes unique to TBI in aging with GO terms (Figure 7a,d) and again look at some of the specific genes that contribute to these GO signatures within the bulk sequencing dataset (Figure 7b,e). We have now included some validation of these genes by qPCR. We thank the Reviewer for these suggestions and we believe with these modifications, the presentation of the bulk RNA-seq data is clearer. We have added text to the manuscript to clarify these points further.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 7a and Figure 5d don't capture which DEGs (up or down) are unique to the Aged TBI condition as the baseline is calculated from Young TBI, rather than Aged Sham, similarly Young Sham vs. Young TBI were not elucidated.

We have now portrayed the bulk sequencing data using upset plots to better convey which genes are unique to TBI or shared between TBI and aging. Figure 7 shows the data for the genes that are unique to the aged TBI comparison and not shared with the aging alone comparison. Given the addition of this new upset plot in the revised manuscript, we have removed the Venn Diagram from Figure 7.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>Have the authors tried programs like NichNet to probe putative intercellular communication networks that would lend insight into whether there are macrophage-fibroblast or macrophage-B cell interactions that drive non-resolving alterations? Could authors comment on what they think is going on in terms of possible epigenomic alterations based on other works possibly with aging?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the Reviewer for their suggestion to use software like NicheNet to investigate the communication networks between cells that may shed light on ligand-receptor interactions. We have used NicheNet to examine how macrophage and fibroblast signaling in the meninges affects other meningeal cells, as both were large populations in the meninges that experienced significant changes post-TBI.</p><p>We first examined how the macrophage cell populations might influence the gene expression patterns of the other major cell populations in our scRNA-seq dataset (T cells, B cells, Dendritic Cells, NK cells, Fibroblasts, and Endothelial Cells) through inferred ligand-target interactions. This new data analysis is provided below for the Reviewer and also now appears in Figure 2—figure supplement 2 of the revised manuscript. <italic>Tgfb1</italic> was the top macrophage ligand that best predicted the gene expression patterns seen in these cell populations, indicating that the overall gene expression pattern represents one of cell growth, differentiation, and alternative macrophage activation (Figure 2—figure supplement 2a,b in the revised manuscript). Additionally, many of the top macrophage ligands were important for cell adhesion and phagocytosis signaling pathways, including <italic>Itgam</italic>, <italic>Apoe</italic>, <italic>Vcam1</italic>, <italic>Selplg</italic>, <italic>Nectin1,</italic> and <italic>Itgb1</italic>, all of which play critical roles in an inflammatory response (Figure 2—figure supplement 2a,b in the revised manuscript). Other top ligands instigate pro-inflammatory signaling pathways such as <italic>Adam17</italic>, which is involved in the processing of TNF at the surface of the cell, <italic>Tnfsf13b</italic>, which promotes activation and proliferation of B cells, and <italic>C3</italic>, which is part of the complement cascade (Figure 2—figure supplement 2a,b in the revised manuscript). When examining the predicted target genes that these top ligands would affect, they are very consistent with some of the gene expression patterns seen in the scRNAseq dataset. For example, signaling through <italic>Tgfb1</italic> is predicted to upregulate expression of multiple genes that affect collagen production including <italic>Col1a1</italic>, <italic>Col1a2,</italic> and <italic>Col3a1</italic> (Figure 2—figure supplement 2c in the revised manuscript), and we did see increased collagen production following TBI. Other ligands linked to heightening the inflammatory response such as <italic>Adam17</italic> and <italic>Tnfsf13b</italic> have predicted target genes including genes related to the B cell response (<italic>Cd19, Cd79a,</italic> and <italic>Ighm</italic>) and related to immune cell activation and antigen presentation (<italic>Cd38</italic> and <italic>Cd40</italic>) (Figure 2—figure supplement 2c in the revised manuscript). Finally, when we looked at how ligands from other cells in the meninges may impact the macrophage gene signature, we saw that ligands from multiple cell populations (Endothelial Cells, Dendritic Cells, T cells, and B cells) are likely responsible for shaping the macrophage gene signature (Figure 2—figure supplement 2d in the revised manuscript). This is not surprising given that monocytes and macrophages likely interact with all of the meningeal cell populations and exert a very important role in shaping the overall gene expression signatures seen after TBI. Overall, the predicted ligand-target interactions between the macrophage population and other major meningeal cell populations after brain injury illustrate a proliferative, pro-inflammatory state.</p></body></sub-article></article>
