However, this mechanism is inconsistent with the behavior of EmrE, a dual-topology protein for which the mutation of positively charged loop residues, even close to the C-terminus, leads to dramatic shifts in its topology. We use coarse-grained simulations to investigate the Sec-facilitated membrane integration of EmrE and its mutants on realistic biological timescales. This work reveals a mechanism for regulating membrane-protein topogenesis, in which initially misintegrated configurations of the proteins undergo post-translational annealing to reach fully integrated multispanning topologies. The energetic barriers associated with this post-translational annealing process enforce kinetic pathways that dictate the topology of the fully integrated proteins. The proposed mechanism agrees well with the experimentally observed features of EmrE topogenesis and provides a range of experimentally testable predictions regarding the effect of translocon mutations on membrane protein topogenesis.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.08697.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.08697.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.08697.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Proteins are long chains of smaller molecules called amino acids, and are built inside cells by a molecular machine called the ribosome. Many important proteins must be inserted into the membrane that surrounds each cell in order to carry out their role. As these proteins are being built by the ribosome, they thread their way into a membrane-spanning channel (called the translocon) from the inner side of the membrane. Short segments of these integral membrane proteins (called transmembrane domains) then become embedded in the membrane, while other parts of the protein remain on either side of the membrane.</p><p>For a membrane protein to work properly, the end of each of its transmembrane domains must be on the correct side of the membrane (i.e., the protein must obtain the correct ‘topology’). The conventional model for this process suggests that topology is fixed when the first transmembrane domain of a protein is initially integrated into the membrane, while the ribosome is still building the protein. This model can explain most integral membrane proteins, which only have a single topology. However, it cannot explain the family of membrane proteins that have an almost equal chance of adopting one of two different topologies (so-called ‘dual-topology proteins’).</p><p>Van Lehn et al. have now used computer modeling to simulate how a bacterial protein called EmrE (which is a dual-topology protein) integrates into the membrane via the translocon. The results reveal that a few transmembrane domains in EmrE do not fully integrate into the membrane while the ribosome is building the protein. Instead, these transmembrane domains slowly integrate after the ribosome has finished its job.</p><p>These findings contradict the conventional model and suggest that some membrane proteins only become fully integrated after the protein-building process is complete. The next step in this work is to experimentally test predictions from the computer simulations.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.08697.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.08697.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>membrane protein topology</kwd><kwd>simulation</kwd><kwd>dual-topology</kwd><kwd>topogenesis</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>None</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Ruth Kirschtein Postdoctoral Fellowship 1F32GM113334-01</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Van Lehn</surname><given-names>Reid C</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funder had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.3</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Coarse-grained modeling reveals a new mechanism for multispanning membrane protein topogenesis, in which misintegrated configurations of the proteins undergo post-translational annealing to reach final, fully integrated multispanning topologies.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Integral membrane proteins (IMPs) are central to cellular functions that include signal transduction, transport across the cell membrane, and energy conversion. Performing these roles requires integration of the IMPs into the membrane with the correct topology (i.e., the correct orientation of the fully integrated IMP relative to the membrane). In most cases, membrane integration proceeds via the Sec translocon, a conserved protein-conducting channel located in the endoplasmic reticulum membrane in eukaryotes or in the plasma membrane in bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">White and von Heijne, 2004</xref>). During this process, the ribosome or other molecular motor docks to the cytoplasmic opening of the translocon, feeding the nascent protein into the translocon channel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Shao and Hegde, 2011</xref>); conformational changes in the lateral gate (LG) helices of the translocon then allow sufficiently hydrophobic segments of the nascent protein to integrate as transmembrane domains (TMD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hessa et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Egea and Stroud, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Zhang and Miller, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gogala et al., 2014</xref>). The orientation of a single TMD relative to the membrane is determined by factors that include the hydrophobicity of the TMD and the charge and length of the soluble loops that flank the TMD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Goder and Spiess, 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Devaraneni et al., 2011</xref>). However, the extent to which these factors influence the topology of multispanning IMPs is less clear.</p><p>The conventional model of multispanning IMP topogenesis assumes that a single dominant topology is established via the successive integration of TMDs that thread back-and-forth across the membrane in alternating orientations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Blobel, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Wessels and Spiess, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Sadlish et al., 2005</xref>). In this cotranslational model, the dominant IMP topology is determined by the orientation of the N-terminal TMD and is primarily dictated by the features of that leading TMD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hartmann et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Borel and Simon, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dale et al., 2000</xref>). However, the cotranslational model is challenged by dual-topology proteins, which exhibit both possible orientations of the fully integrated IMP with respect to the membrane in approximately 1:1 stoichiometry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Rapp et al., 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">2007</xref>). The most thoroughly studied dual-topology protein is the bacterial multidrug transporter EmrE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chen et al., 2007</xref>), which can be biased in favor of a single dominant topology by introducing positive charges to any of its soluble loops (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Rapp et al., 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Seppälä et al., 2010</xref>). The dominant topology of each EmrE mutant retains the loop with the additional positive charges in the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Seppälä et al., 2010</xref>), apparently satisfying the empirical trend known as the ‘positive-inside’ rule which notes that the combined charges of the cytoplasmic loops (i.e., K+R bias) of an IMP correlates with its dominant topology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">von Heijne, 1986</xref>). Surprisingly, adding charges to even C-terminal loops can influence the dominant topology of EmrE, suggesting that such mutations have a long-range effect on the orientation of previously-translated TMDs. This finding is inconsistent with the cotranslational model and raises interesting questions about IMP topogenesis. At what point is IMP topology established with respect to ribosomal translation? Are TMD orientations locked-in during the period in which the nascent IMP is attached to the ribosome (i.e., cotranslationally) or do TMD orientations remain subject to change even upon completion of ribosomal translation (i.e., post-translationally)?</p><p>In this work, we simulate the topogenesis of EmrE and its mutants to address limitations in the cotranslational model of IMP topogenesis by understanding when IMP topology is established (co- or post-translationally) and how topology is regulated. We use a coarse-grained (CG) model that enables access to a timescale of minutes while retaining sufficient chemical accuracy to capture the forces that drive membrane integration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Zhang and Miller, 2012a</xref>). The distribution of topologies predicted by the simulations are in good agreement with previous experimental findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Rapp et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Seppälä et al., 2010</xref>). The simulation results show that TMDs in the dual-topology mutants do not completely integrate by the end of translation; instead, the slow post-translational flipping of loops across the membrane allows misintegrated TMDs to reorient and insert into the membrane. The fully integrated topology is determined by the position of the loop that undergoes flipping most slowly. This work elucidates the mechanism by which dual-topology protein topology is established, reconciles dominant protein topologies with the positive-inside rule, and predicts the role that the translocon plays in mediating multispanning IMP topogenesis. Other examples of post-translational topological changes in diverse multispanning IMP systems suggest that this mechanism may have generality beyond EmrE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lu et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lambert and Prange, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kanki et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Skach, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Öjemalm et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bowie, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Virkki et al., 2014</xref>).</p><sec id="s1-1"><title>Coarse-grained model</title><p>The cotranslational integration and topogenesis of EmrE and its mutants is simulated using a recently developed CG model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Zhang and Miller, 2012a</xref>), which we employ essentially unchanged from its original introduction. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> illustrates the CG representation of a nascent protein and the protocol for simulating membrane integration. The ribosome, translocon, and nascent protein are all composed of CG beads. Each bead has a diameter of <italic>σ</italic> = 0.8 nm to represent approximately three amino-acid residues. This bead diameter is similar to the Kuhn length of polypeptides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Staple et al., 2008</xref>) so that the nascent protein can be treated as a freely jointed chain. The surrounding solvent and lipid bilayer are included implicitly, a technique that is used in other CG models of the translocon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Rychkova and Warshel, 2013</xref>). The time-evolution of nascent protein configurations is calculated using Brownian dynamics with a 100 ns timestep. The kinetics of the LG are modeled as stochastic transitions between a closed conformation, which prevents the nascent protein from exiting from the channel interior to the membrane, and an open conformation, which removes the barrier to membrane entry. All bead positions are projected onto the plane that passes along the translocon channel axis between the helices forming the LG. This off-lattice 2D approximation reflects the cylindrical geometry of the channel and is inspired by previous models of biopolymer translocation through nanopores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Huopaniemi et al., 2006</xref>).

Two negative charges are placed on a bead at the cytosolic end of the translocon LG, whereas two positive charges are placed on a bead at the periplasmic end of the translocon LG. This charge distribution reflects the position of conserved charged residues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">White and von Heijne, 2004</xref>) near the translocon LG that have been previously shown to affect single-spanning protein topogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Goder et al., 2004</xref>).

We note that the model does not include nascent protein secondary/tertiary structure, charged lipids, protein chaperones, or an electrostatic potential across the membrane. However, the model does include explicit LG/translation dynamics, electrostatic interactions with the translocon, water/bilayer transfer free energies, and a direct mapping between the nascent protein sequence and the CG representation. The model thus captures the major physicochemical features of the translocon-membrane system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">White and von Heijne, 2004</xref>). Moreover, the model has been shown to accurately predict features of single-spanning IMP integration and topogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Zhang and Miller, 2012a</xref>), including the sigmoidal dependence of stop-transfer efficiency on TMD hydrophobicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hessa et al., 2005</xref>), the inversion of signal-anchor orientation during translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Goder and Spiess, 2003</xref>), and the effect of translation rates and sequence features on signal-anchor orientation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Goder and Spiess, 2003</xref>). In particular, the model has been shown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Zhang and Miller, 2012a</xref>) to correctly describe integration processes that are governed either by thermodynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hessa et al., 2005</xref>) or kinetics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Goder and Spiess, 2003</xref>), and it has provided a means of understanding the competition between such effects. The model has also been shown to correctly predict the dominant topology for a three-TMD multispanning IMP with a strong positive-inside bias (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Zhang and Miller, 2012a</xref>). The strong agreement between simulation and experimental results presented in this work further indicates that IMP topological determinants are captured at this CG resolution.</p><sec id="s1-1-1"><title>EmrE protein</title><p>The EmrE amino-acid sequence includes four hydrophobic domains and five hydrophilic loops, according to both the hydropathy plot and consensus topology prediction shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>. The hydropathy plot was calculated using the Wimley–White hydrophobicity scale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Wimley et al., 1996</xref>).

Shaded regions in the hydropathy plot indicate the predicted TMDs and loops.</p><p>In the CG model, each TMD is represented by four CG beads and each soluble loop is represented by five CG beads, as seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>. The CG beads assume one of four types as determined by the associated amino-acid residues in the nascent protein; these CG bead-types include V (moderately hydrophobic), L (very hydrophobic), Q (neutral-hydrophilic), and K (positively charged). Among these types, the CG beads vary with respect to their charge and their water/membrane transfer free energies (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Appendix table 1</xref>). In the hydropathy profile, the N-terminal TMD (TMD1) is less hydrophobic than the other three TMDs, so its beads are assigned the V bead type. All other TMD beads are assigned the L bead type. Beads in each soluble loop are assigned to either the K or Q bead type, depending on the location of positive charges in the amino-acid sequence; positive charges are highlighted in red in the EmrE wild-type amino-acid sequence in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>. Each K bead type is assigned a +2 charge, following previous work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Zhang and Miller, 2012a</xref>). Negative charges are excluded from the CG representation of EmrE, because EmrE exhibits a small number of such charges (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>) and because the experimentally studied EmrE mutations focus only on the addition/removal of positively charged residues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Seppälä et al., 2010</xref>). Nonetheless, the effect of negatively charged residues in the CG simulation was explicitly tested in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref> and was found to be minor. Similarly, the results of the simulations are robust with respect to changes in the modeling of TMD1 hydrophobicity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>) and loop length (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>).</p><p>Using the CG model, we consider a series of EmrE mutants from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Rapp et al.

Finally, we include a ‘cotranslationally-biased’, or CB, mutant that has elongated, 10-bead hydrophilic loops and two positives charges in the first, third, and fifth loops to create a strong K+R bias that favors a N<sub>cyto</sub>/C<sub>cyto</sub> topology (i.e., with both the N-terminal and C-terminal loops in the cytoplasm) according to the positive-inside rule (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">von Heijne, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Rapp et al., 2006</xref>); this protein is expected to be strongly biased towards membrane integration via the cotranslational mechanism, providing a useful comparison with the other EmrE mutants.

Despite its simplicity, we emphasize that the CG representation captures the major features of EmrE and its mutants, including the number of TMDs/loops and the distribution of charges.</p></sec><sec id="s1-1-2"><title>Simulation protocol</title><p>As illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, the dynamics of the ribosome/nascent protein/translocon complex is directly simulated using the CG model. Each CG trajectory is initiated with a short nascent protein attached to the ribosome exit channel; as a function of time, the nascent protein grows in length (while remaining attached to the ribosome) until it completes translation and is released from the ribosome. The dynamics of the nascent protein continue to be simulated until the protein reaches a fully integrated topology.</p><p>Simulations are initialized from equilibrated configurations of the nascent protein, initially comprised of 9 CG beads, with the C-terminus attached to the ribosome exit channel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). Translation is performed by adding a new CG bead to the C-terminus of the nascent protein and attaching it to the ribosome exit channel; the previous C-terminus is released from the exit channel. The simulation is then continued for 125 ms before the next bead is added, a simulation time which corresponds to a translation rate of 24 residues/s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bilgin et al., 1992</xref>). At the end of translation, the C-terminus is released from the ribosome exit channel and simulations are continued until all beads in the TMDs are at least 4.5<italic>σ</italic> from the origin and integrated with either a N<sub>cyto</sub>/C<sub>cyto</sub> or N<sub>peri</sub>/C<sub>peri</sub> topology. The ribosome remains bound to the translocon for the duration of all simulations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Potter and Nicchitta, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Schaltetzky and Rapoport, 2006</xref>). The distance threshold ensures that the final configuration of the protein has exited from both the ribosome and translocon channel.</p><p>The trajectory termination criteria are designed to examine the effects of the Sec-facilitated membrane integration process on EmrE topogenesis. Specifically, it is assumed that upon reaching configurations in which all of the TMDs are integrated into the membrane, the protein topology remains irreversibly fixed for all subsequent times; physical processes that may lead to this irreversibility include the dimerization of EmrE proteins to form functional channels in the membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lloris-Garcerá et al., 2012</xref>) or the degradation of undimerized EmrE proteins prior to topological inversion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Woodall et al., 2015</xref>). Given the symmetry of the membrane-protein interactions in the absence of the translocon, if the CG trajectories were allowed to run for infinitely long times to reach full equilibration after diffusing away from the translocon, the relative probability of the N<sub>cyto</sub>/C<sub>cyto</sub> and N<sub>peri</sub>/C<sub>peri</sub> topologies would be equal, regardless of the protein sequence. The employed trajectory termination criteria thus isolate the role of the non-equilibrium integration process in determining IMP topology. Demonstration of the robustness of the reported results to the cutoff values employed in the trajectory termination criteria are provided in the <italic>Robustness checks for the trajectory termination criteria</italic> section of the ‘Materials and methods’.</p><p>The integration and orientation of a TMD is interpreted from the positions of hydrophobic beads in each TMD and the third bead in each hydrophilic loop. The coordinate system is defined with the x-axis perpendicular to the bilayer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>).

In the first step, the cotranslational integration (or misintegration) of each TMD leads to an ensemble of IMP configurations associated with the time at which ribosomal translation completes; we call this set of configurations the EOT ensemble. In the second step of the proposed mechanism, configurations in the EOT ensemble anneal toward a fully integrated topology as a function of time as loops post-translationally flip across the membrane. The rate at which the soluble loops undergo post-translational flipping is a key determinant of the fully integrated topology.

Differences in loop charges in the various mutants leads to variation in the corresponding EOT ensembles, because electrostatic interactions between highly-charged loops and the translocon favor their cytoplasmic retention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Goder et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Zhang and Miller, 2012a</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref> shows representative members of the EOT ensemble for the EmrE, T28R, and nR111 mutants with the most-charged loop of each mutant highlighted in red. The EOT ensemble is defined as the set of configurations visited by a given nascent protein within 1 s of simulation time following the termination of ribosomal translation. The schematics indicate how various TMDs integrate or misintegrate to give rise to heterogeneity in the EOT ensemble of configurations, while the loops with added charges preferentially obtain cytoplasmic positions. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref> further quantifies the cytoplasmic bias of charged loops by showing the EOT ensemble averaged loop positions with respect to the membrane for all five loops in each mutant, expressed as the fraction of EOT configurations with a given loop in the cytoplasm. The increased cytoplasmic localization exhibited by the L2 and L5 loops in T28R and nR111 respectively highlights the effect of adding positive charges. Similarly, the reduced cytoplasmic retention of L2 and L4 in nR111 relative to EmrE is due to the removal of charges from these loops.</p><p>The second step of the proposed mechanism is presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref> in greater detail. For each of the three mutants, the figure schematically illustrates the post-translational kinetics of two representative configurations from the EOT ensemble. Black horizontal arrows indicate how the flipping of soluble loops across the membrane leads to transitions between intermediate configurations. The most-charged loop is again highlighted in red. Each configuration post-translationally anneals toward a fully integrated topology as loops stochastically flip across the membrane to correct the misintegrated TMDs. The soluble loops undergo flipping at different rates, with charged loops flipping more slowly. The slowest-flipping loop thus determines the fully integrated topology that is most kinetically-accessible from a given configuration in the EOT ensemble, because the other loops will more rapidly flip. The EmrE examples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>, left) demonstrate how the equal distribution of L2 positions with respect to the membrane in the EOT ensemble leads to two different fully integrated topologies, giving rise to the dual-topology behavior. The T28R examples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>, right) show that increasing the charge of L2, thereby biasing its cytoplasmic localization in the EOT ensemble (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>), leads to a dominant N<sub>peri</sub>/C<sub>peri</sub> topology. Finally, the nR111 examples illustrate how C-terminal charges can have a long-range topogenic effect by biasing the fully integrated proteins towards a dominant N<sub>cyto</sub>/C<sub>cyto</sub> topology.</p><p>The proposed mechanism predicts that the final topological distribution of each EmrE mutant is determined by both the distribution of configurations in the EOT ensemble and the available post-translational kinetic pathways that lead to fully integrated protein topologies.

The energetic cost for flipping a hydrophilic loop across the hydrophobic membrane increases with the hydrophilicity of the loop; the loop-flipping frequency observed during simulations is thus expected to decrease for loops with larger numbers of charges. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> shows the computed loop-flipping frequencies for each loop in the EmrE mutants.

The number of charges in each loop are marked with dots. As expected, highly-charged loops exhibit a decreased loop-flipping frequency. The figure also reveals that the terminal L1 and L5 loops have a lower loop-flipping frequency than the intermediate L2-4 loops. Loop-flipping events are not found to be strongly concerted, as two or more loops were observed to flip concurrently in only 0.015% of all 1-ms time intervals in which at least one loop-flipping event was observed. However, the loop-flipping frequency of a given loop is impacted by the orientation of its neighboring TMDs; on average, a loop with a single misintegrated neighboring TMD flips 1.5 times more frequently than the same loop with zero misintegrated neighboring TMDs, while a loop with two misintegrated TMDs flips 3.7 times more frequently than the same loop with zero misintegrated neighboring TMDs.

Several bacterial proteases that degrade membrane proteins have been characterized which provides insight into the approximate degradation timescale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dalbey et al., 2011</xref>). For example, FtsH is a membrane-embedded protease that degrades misassembled IMPs over timescales ranging from 2 min (for SecY) to 15 min (for YccA) in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Ito and Akiyama, 2005</xref>), and even longer timescales for degradation have been observed in eukaryotic systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Buck and Skach, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Feige and Hendershot, 2013</xref>); very recently, FtsH was also shown to degrade undimerized EmrE on a sub-30 min timescale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Woodall et al., 2015</xref>). In comparison to the simulated trajectories (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>), these degradation timescales are relatively slow, supporting the assumption that IMP integration and post-translational annealing reaches completion prior to significant degradation. Nonetheless, if degradation of EmrE occurs on faster timescales, it could potentially impact the reported topologies from the simulations. To investigate this effect, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref> shows the relative fraction of N<sub>cyto</sub>/C<sub>cyto</sub> and N<sub>peri</sub>/C<sub>peri</sub> protein topologies for the CG trajectories that have reached fully integrated topologies as a function of time, excluding all trajectories for which at least one TMD is misintegrated. If it is assumed that fully integrated proteins are resistant to degradation (or that rapid dimerization following the full integration of EmrE protects the proteins from degradation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Woodall et al., 2015</xref>]), then each point in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref> represents the distribution of topologies that would be observed if all misfolded proteins were uniformly degraded at the corresponding time.

Introducing charge mutations to the soluble loops of a multispanning IMP leads to shifts in both the distribution of loop positions in the EOT ensemble (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>) and changes in the kinetics of loop-flipping events that lead to the fully integrated topologies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). The combination of these effects is found to govern the observed distribution of fully integrated topologies in the CG simulations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). This proposed mechanism explains the experimental finding that adding charges to any of the soluble loops of EmrE, even a loop near the C-terminus, affects the observed topology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Seppälä et al., 2010</xref>). The proposed mechanism also agrees with recent experiments that find EmrE to undergo partial topological rearrangements that correspond to the loop-flipping events described here (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Woodall et al., 2015</xref>). Furthermore, the mechanism can explain deviations from the positive-inside rule if the position of the slowest-flipping loop in the EOT ensemble enforces a topology in which the majority of the positive charges are in periplasmic loops, as seen for the K3 mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>).</p><p>In addition to explaining existing experimental data for the topogenesis of the EmrE mutants, the proposed mechanism yields a number of new and experimentally testable predictions. A simple overarching prediction of the mechanism is that changes to the ribosome or translocon that affect the EOT ensemble may lead to significant shifts in topology. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref> shows the average position of the slowest-flipping loop in the EOT ensemble after slowing translation from 24 residues/s to 6 residues/s to model the addition of cycloheximide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Goder and Spiess, 2003</xref>), removing the periplasmic positive charge from the channel, or removing the cytoplasmic negative charge from the channel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Goder et al., 2004</xref>). For single-spanning IMPs, the rate of translation and the removal of translocon charges were previously found to significantly affect TMD orientation in both simulations and experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Goder and Spiess, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Goder et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Zhang and Miller, 2012a</xref>). We find that slowing translation has a minimal effect on the mutants studied here, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1</xref> confirms this finding for other translation rates. Given that these EOT loop positions are unchanged, and given that the post-translational dynamics is unaffected by the ribosomal translation rate, these results suggest that changing translation rate will not affect the final distribution of fully integrated topologies. In contrast, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref> shows that removing either the cytoplasmic or periplasmic charge on the translocon significantly decreases the cytoplasmic retention of the slowest-flipping loops by increasing the periplasmic accessibility of highly charged loops. Most notably, it is found that for two of the EmrE mutants (indicated in dashed boxes) the translocon charge mutations dramatically shift the slowest-flipping loop position in the EOT ensemble from being primarily cytosolic to being primarily periplasmic, suggesting that the dominant topology for these EmrE mutants will be similarly reversed by the translocon charge mutations. These changes in IMP topology due to channel mutations are experimentally testable predictions of the proposed mechanism.<fig-group><fig id="fig8" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.08697.019</object-id><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Predictions from the CG simulations in terms of changing the rate of ribosomal translation and introducing translocon mutations.</title><p>In each case, the figure presents the average position of the slowest-flipping loop in the EOT ensemble.

In the CG model, neglecting interactions with the Sec translocon, both the N<sub>cyto</sub>/C<sub>cyto</sub> or N<sub>peri</sub>/C<sub>peri</sub> topologies are energetically equivalent and would be observed with equal probability if simulations were continued for an infinitely long time. The prediction of a dominant topology by the CG model arises from the initial distribution of configurations in the EOT ensemble (due to interactions of the nascent protein with the translocon complex) and from the available kinetic pathways that allow the configurations in the EOT ensemble to reach fully integrated topologies. We note that the changes in topology predicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref> would be unexpected from a model in which the dominant topology of an IMP is determined by thermodynamic equilibration, since the equilibrium distribution of the protein topologies would be unaffected by transient interactions with the translocon or ribosome during initial membrane integration.</p><p>We further note that direct comparison of the experimental and simulation timescales for the kinetic annealing of misintegrated TMDs is limited by both the accuracy of the CG model as well as the neglect of external chaperone proteins, such as TRAP, TRAM, or other members of the Sec complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Sommer et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Zhu et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aviram and Schuldiner, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jung et al., 2014</xref>), that may catalyze loop-flipping. However, since the topological predictions of the proposed mechanism are primarily sensitive to which soluble loop flips most slowly—as opposed to the actual timescale of loop-flipping—we expect that the presented conclusions are relatively robust with respect to these effects. This robustness is directly illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>, which shows that the relative fraction of proteins that reach each fully integrated topology is nearly constant as a function of time.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Conclusions</title><p>In this work, we utilize a recently developed CG computational approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Zhang and Miller, 2012a</xref>) that enables the direct simulation of Sec-facilitated membrane integration of proteins on biological timescales to investigate the topogenesis of the dual-topology EmrE protein and its mutants. In addition to demonstrating excellent agreement with the experimentally observed topologies of EmrE and its mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Seppälä et al., 2010</xref>), the simulations reveal a novel mechanism for the regulation of topogenesis in multi-spanning membrane proteins, in which initially misintegrated configurations of the proteins undergo post-translational annealing to reach final, fully integrated topologies. The energetic barriers associated with this post-translational annealing process enforce kinetic pathways that dictate the topology of the fully integrated proteins. The inclusion of charged residues on the soluble loops of the IMP can lead to significant changes in the distribution of fully integrated topologies by both altering the ensemble of protein configurations at the end of ribosomal translation, as well as by altering the available kinetic pathways that lead to fully integrated topologies.</p><p>This analysis leads to a number of experimentally testable predictions regarding IMP topogenesis. In particular, the results of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref> predict that the mutation of charged residues near the cytoplasmic or periplasmic openings of the translocon channel will lead to significant shifts in the observed topology of several EmrE mutants. More generally, we note that any effect of channel mutations on the fully integrated IMP topology would indicate that kinetic effects during translation influence topogenesis, as suggested by the proposed mechanism. Additionally, we predict that the introduction of IMP mutations that significantly alter the EOT ensemble with respect to the cytosolic localization of the slowest-flipping soluble loop, either by introducing charge mutations or by changing TMD hydrophobicity, will influence the multispanning IMP topology.</p><p>Although the current manuscript primarily focuses on the mechanism of topogenesis in the dual-topology EmrE protein, the mechanism and simulation analysis presented here has broader implications for topogenesis in other multispanning IMPs. For EmrE and its mutants, we find that a significant fraction of the IMP configurations are misintegrated upon completion of ribosomal translation and undergo subsequent post-translational annealing to reach fully integrated topologies. In contrast, a CB mutant exhibits an essentially fully integrated ensemble of configurations at the time that ribosomal translation completes. For other IMPs, a combination of these behaviors may well be expected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lu et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lambert and Prange, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kanki et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Skach, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Öjemalm et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bowie, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Virkki et al., 2014</xref>), with some fraction of the nascent protein configurations reaching fully integrated topologies at the completion of ribosomal translation and some fraction reaching misintegrated configurations that subsequently undergo post-translational annealing.

In particular, following the definitions of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cymer et al. (2014)</xref>, it is possible to characterize each cotranslational TMD integration event as corresponding to either the ‘channel-sliding’, ‘interface-sliding’, or ‘in-out’ pathways. Simulation snapshots illustrating the three pathways are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>.</p><p>Each pathway is defined in terms of the series of intermediate states that are visited by the TMD prior to membrane integration. To characterize these intermediate states, the following geometric regions are defined (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). The channel region is defined as that for which −2<italic>σ</italic> ≤ <italic>x</italic> ≤ 2<italic>σ</italic> and −2<italic>σ</italic> ≤ <italic>y</italic> ≤ 2<italic>σ</italic>, the membrane region is defined as that for which −2<italic>σ</italic> ≤ <italic>x</italic> ≤ 2<italic>σ</italic> and <italic>y</italic> &gt; 2<italic>σ</italic>, the ribosome region is defined as that for which −11<italic>σ</italic> ≤ <italic>x</italic> &lt; −2<italic>σ</italic> and −8.5<italic>σ</italic> ≤ <italic>y</italic> ≤ 4.5<italic>σ</italic>, and the cytoplasm region is defined as the region outside of the ribosome for which <italic>x</italic> &lt; −2<italic>σ</italic>. Finally, a bead is considered to overlap the LG if it is within a distance of <italic>σ</italic> to any lateral-gate bead.</p><p>We now define the four intermediate states. Intermediate state 1 (IS1) is that for which the TMD partially enters the channel; it is defined as the set of configurations for which at least two TMD beads are in the channel region and zero TMD beads are in the membrane region. Intermediate state 2 (IS2) is that for which the TMD fully spans the membrane while in the channel; it is defined as the set of configurations for which all four TMD beads are in the channel region and the two hydrophilic beads that flank the TMD occupy opposite sides of the membrane. Intermediate state 3 (IS3) is that for which the TMD accesses the membrane interior via the LG; it is defined as the set of configurations for which at least one TMD bead occupies the membrane region, the remaining three TMD beads occupy either the channel or membrane regions, and at least one TMD bead overlaps with the LG. Intermediate state 4 (IS4) is that for which the TMD accesses the cytoplasm region without accessing the channel region; it is defined as the set of configurations for which each of the four TMD beads occupies either the ribosome, membrane, or cytoplasm regions and for which at least one of the hydrophilic beads that flank the TMD occupies the cytoplasm region.</p><p>In this analysis, cotranslational TMD integration events are defined as those for which the TMD reaches a membrane integrated configuration (for which all four beads of the TMD span the membrane region and the two hydrophilic flanking beads occupy opposite sides of the membrane) before reaching a misintegrated configuration (for which both hydrophilic flanking beads occupy the same side of the membrane and for which all TMD beads and both flanking beads lie outside of the channel and ribosome regions). Using the definitions of intermediate states, the cotranslational integration pathways are defined as follows. In the ‘channel-sliding’ pathway, the TMD partially enters the channel, then crosses the LG, then fully integrates into the membrane; a trajectory thus exhibits this pathway if a TMD visits IS1, IS2, and membrane integration in chronological order and without visiting any other intermediate states. In the ‘interface-sliding’ pathway, the TMD enters the cytoplasm through the gap between the translocon and ribosome, prior to undergoing membrane integration; a trajectory thus exhibits this pathway if a TMD visits IS4 on the way to membrane integration. In the ‘in-out’ pathway, the TMD fully spans the channel prior to membrane integration; a trajectory thus exhibits this pathway if a TMD visits IS3 on the way to membrane integration without visiting IS4.</p><p>At right, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref> shows the relative fraction of cotranslational TMD integration events that exhibit each of these three pathways. It is clear that the dominant cotranslational integration pathway for all four TMDs in both the EmrE and nEmrE mutants is the ‘channel-sliding’ pathway. This same pathway was also observed in the previous study of single-spanning proteins using the CG model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Zhang and Miller, 2012a</xref>) and similar configurations were observed in long-timescale atomistic molecular dynamics simulations of the early stages of cotranslational membrane integration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Zhang and Miller, 2012b</xref>). We find that only a small number of CG trajectories exhibit the ‘interface-sliding’ pathway. Finally, we note that the dominant cotranslational integration pathway is likely to depend on the IMP sequence, and the ‘channel-sliding’ behavior may be less dominant in other IMPs with less hydrophobic TMDs.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>Research reported in this publication was supported by the National Institute of General Medical Sciences of the National Institutes of Health under Ruth L Kirschstein National Research Service Award award number 1F32GM113334-01.

Your submission has been favorably evaluated by Randy Schekman (Senior Editor) and three reviewers, one of whom, Gerhard Hummer, is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>he reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Co-translational and post-translational steps in Sec-facilitated insertion of the EmrE integral membrane protein are studied using a coarse-grained simulation model. Consistent with experiment, the simulations produce a mixture of orientations of the protein in the membrane that is sensitive to mutations in the loops connecting the transmembrane helices. Transient topologies are found to anneal by flipping loops across the membrane during post-translational annealing. The resulting orientation distribution thus depends strongly on the electrostatic character of these loops. This work sheds light on the mechanism of membrane protein insertion, its kinetics, and the factors determining the orientation and its variability.</p><p>All three referees are overall positive but raise a number of concerns regarding the details of the model, the interpretation of the simulation results, and the presentation in the paper. I find the issues raised by the referees to be relevant. Addressing them in a revision should result in a stronger paper. Following is a brief summary of their reports that emphasizes the main points as seen from my perspective:</p><p>Reviewer #1 is concerned that the outcome of the simulations was sensitive to the somewhat arbitrary simulation termination criterion. Other concerns center on the modeling of the peptides, including the assignment of CG sequences, loop length, and the neglect of negative charge (however, the latter may not be particularly relevant for the EmrE sequence).</p><p>Reviewer #2 points out a number of relevant connections to the literature, and asks for clarifications/rectifications in the presentation of the model and the simulation results.</p><p>Reviewer #3 is concerned that the reported agreement with experiment, while visually strong, may not be quite as convincing in a more quantitative statistical analysis. The reviewer is also concerned about the factors determining the rates of loop flipping in the model and in real systems. The role of degradation (which could affect slowly relaxing EOT structures) should also be discussed in more detail.</p><p>In the following, I highlight the points in the reports I consider most relevant.</p><p>1) The terms topology, single-topology, and dual-topology should be explained to the general reader. The exact meaning of these technical terms is not immediately obvious and has caused some confusion even among the experts (cf. dual vs. antiparallel topology).</p><p>2) The simulations are terminated when a dissociated N<sub>cyto</sub>/C<sub>cyto</sub> or N<sub>peri</sub>/C<sub>peri</sub> state with 4 inserted TMDs is reached. The authors should briefly discuss (a) if the results are sensitive to variations in the termination criterion (e.g. by continuing the simulations for an additional set time, by asking for a larger distance from the origin, by running the simulations for a fixed time after initial release etc.) and (b) if there is a justification for this criterion (e.g. that subsequent changes to the topology occur on much longer time scales). It would also be useful to indicate the length of the longest simulation at which 0% of misintegrated proteins is observed.</p><p>3) Proteins with mixed orientations in the membrane appear to be the exception. The authors should thus briefly discuss whether by applying the same coarse-graining recipe to other proteins, and using the same simulation protocol, one indeed finds well defined orientations.</p><p>4) TMD1 was treated differently from the other 3 TMDs. What happens if one uses the same bead type for all TMDs? (The text states that L-type beads were used, but Supplementary file 1C lists them as V-type beads. The legend of the table also has the assignment of moderate and strong hydrophobicity of L and V beads switched vis-à-vis the text).</p><p>5) A discussion of the present results in light of earlier studies should prove insightful. In particular, Cymer et al. in a recent review (J Mol. Biol., 427:999-1022, 2015) raised questions about the simplistic model of release of TM helices in the correct topology. They noted that (a) the assembly process is driven by thermodynamics and (b) at an elongation rate of about 50 ms per amino acid, there is ample time for a chain to sample what could be a very complicated energy landscape. Here the authors indeed find that the insertion pathway and topology of a given EmrE mutant are not immutable. This connection should be discussed.</p><p>6) The pathways of insertion should be discussed in more detail. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> shows the 2D model used by Miller et al. The nascent chain can exit from the translocon either by a gap between translocon and membrane or through the translocon. Although the upper panel of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> suggests passage through the translocon, the lower panel shows the nascent chain passing from ribosome directly into the membrane. The paper does not address which of these two pathways is preferred. I think the authors should comment on this and, if possible, provide more information on the pathways observed in the simulations. This is important, because Cymer et al. (2015) suggested that the preferred path of the nascent chain might be along the translocon lateral gate rather than through the translocon as suggested by the current cartoons. The lower panel of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> suggests that the lateral gate pathway may be the preferred path.</p><p>7) A more thorough statistical analysis of the data would strengthen the paper. P-values, rank correlations, or other measures of correlation could be calculated for the data presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> so that the reader can understand the correlation and statistical significance of the simulation results compared to the experimental results.</p><p>8) What is the role of neighboring protein elements on the flipping frequency of a given loop? How do these correlated motions affect the flipping frequencies presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>?</p><p>9) A more detailed discussion of the possible role of degradation would be important. Based on experimentally determined timescales of degradation (a brief comment is presented in the last paragraph of the Discussion), and the time scales of insertion and annealing observed here, can one estimate the degraded fraction and the effect on the orientation distribution?</p><p>Along the same lines, in the third paragraph of the subsection “Position of slowest-flipping loop in EOT ensemble determines fully integrated topology”, it is not immediately clear how “the fraction of CG trajectories that have reached fully integrated multispanning configurations” (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>) is related to degradation of sequences as a function of time prior to reaching a fully integrated multispanning topology. This paragraph needs to be edited for greater clarity to reveal the authors' assumptions more clearly.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled “Regulation of multispanning membrane protein topology via post-translational annealing” for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>.

A given IMP can thus become fully integrated in one of two topologies (which for EmrE correspond to N<sub>peri</sub>/C<sub>peri</sub> and N<sub>cyto</sub>/C<sub>cyto</sub>). To emphasize that “topology” refers to the fully integrated proteins, as opposed to partially integrated configurations of the proteins, we at times refer to the “fully integrated topology” – however, in both cases, we are referring to the same notion and the more verbose term is used to avoid confusion.</p><p>“Dual-topology proteins” refers to those which exhibit both possible orientations of the fully integrated IMP with respect to the cell membrane in approximately 1:1 stoichiometry (Rapp et al., Nat.

[…] Demonstration of the robustness of the reported results to the cutoff values employed in the trajectory termination criteria are provided in the Robustness checks for the trajectory termination criteria section of the Materials and methods.”</p><p>The choice of trajectory termination criteria is further justified by the robustness of the reported results with respect to the detailed cutoff values, as discussed with regard to point (a).</p><p>Finally, in regard to the reviewers’ suggestion to report the longest simulation at which 0% of misintegrated proteins is observed, we have included a table in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3–figure supplement 2</xref> that reports the amount of simulation time required for 50%, 90%, and 95% of the CG trajectories to reach fully integrated topologies for each mutant. This table provides the reader with a useful sense of the range of lengths of the trajectories. (We prefer not to report the “longest trajectory”, since this is not a well-defined property of the converged ensemble and will become arbitrarily long as the number of trajectories in the ensemble of simulated trajectories increases.)</p><p><italic>3) Proteins with mixed orientations in the membrane appear to be the exception. The authors should thus briefly discuss whether by applying the same coarse-graining recipe to other proteins, and using the same simulation protocol, one indeed finds well defined orientations.</italic></p><p>This is a good point. The coarse-grained model has indeed been tested for the prediction of topology in membrane proteins with a single dominant topology.</p><p>In previous work (B. Zhang and T. F. Miller III, Cell Rep., 2012), the topogenesis of single-spanning signal anchor proteins was shown to exhibit similar trends as in the experimental studies of Goder and Spiess (EMBO J., 2003). It was further shown in this previous work that a multispanning (three TMD) membrane protein with a strong positive charge bias obtained the correct, single dominant topology according to the positive-inside rule, in agreement with expectations.</p><p>In the current work, the EmrE, EmrE(N<sub>cyto</sub>), and EmrE(N<sub>peri</sub>) mutants, which have topologies that have been thoroughly characterized experimentally (Rapp et al., Science, 2007; Seppala et al., Science, 2010), exhibit the expected distribution of topologies. The cotranslationally-biased mutant provides another example where incorporating a strong positive charge bias leads to a single dominant topology as expected from the positive-inside rule. These examples underscore the ability of the CG model to produce well-defined topologies.</p><p>To emphasize past findings in the revised manuscript, the last paragraph of the subsection “Coarse-grained model” has been expanded to read: “Moreover, the model has been shown to accurately predict features of single-spanning IMP integration and topogenesis […] The strong agreement between simulation and experimental results presented in this work further indicates that IMP topological determinants are captured at this CG resolution.”</p><p><italic>4) TMD1 was treated differently from the other 3 TMDs. What happens if one uses the same bead type for all TMDs? (The text states that L-type beads were used, but Supplementary file 1C lists them as V-type beads. The legend of the table also has the assignment of moderate and strong hydrophobicity of L and V beads switched vis-à-vis the text).</italic></p><p>The representation for TMD1 used in the model is based on the hydropathy plot presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1–figure supplement 1</xref>, which shows that the first TMD is significantly less hydrophobic than the following three.</p><p>Regardless, we agree that it is worth investigating whether this lower hydrophobicity of TMD1 impacts the reported conclusions; having performed additional simulations to investigate this point, we find that it does not have a significant impact.</p><p>To test the robustness of our results with respect to TMD1 hydrophobicity, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5–figure supplement 1</xref> presents the end-of-translation (EOT) ensemble averaged loop positions for the six EmrE mutants. The loop positions are compared between mutants with either a moderately hydrophobic (V-type beads) or very hydrophobic (L-type beads) TMD1. The positions of loops L3-L5 are largely unchanged in all cases. There is a slight increase in L2 cytoplasmic retention for all six mutants; this finding agrees with the increase in type I (N<sub>peri</sub>/C<sub>cyto</sub>) integration with increasing TMD hydrophobicity that was identified in previous work (B. Zhang and T. F. Miller III, Cell Rep., 2012). Given the strong correlation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>) between EOT loop positions and the final, fully integrated topology, these results suggest that increasing TMD1 hydrophobicity does not qualitatively affect the reported conclusions.</p><p>We have revised the manuscript to include this additional robustness check as follows. We have added <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5–figure supplement 1</xref> as described above. Furthermore, in the subsection “EmrE protein”, we have added: “Similarly, the results of the simulations are robust with respect to changes in the modeling of TMD1 hydrophobicity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5–figure supplement 1</xref>) and loop length (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3–figure supplement 3</xref>).”</p><p>As per the reviewers’ suggestion, we have also rechecked the manuscript and figures to confirm that the reported bead-types for TMD1 are correct.</p><p><italic>5) A discussion of the present results in light of earlier studies should prove insightful. In particular, Cymer et al. in a recent review (J Mol. Biol., 427:999-1022, 2015) raised questions about the simplistic model of release of TM helices in the correct topology. They noted that (a) the assembly process is driven by thermodynamics and (b) at an elongation rate of about 50 ms per amino acid, there is ample time for a chain to sample what could be a very complicated energy landscape. Here the authors indeed find that the insertion pathway and topology of a given EmrE mutant are not immutable. This connection should be discussed.</italic></p><p>We agree that this review raises interesting questions that should be cited in the manuscript.</p><p>As the reviewers point out, the translation process is slow, and equilibrium thermodynamic effects play a major role in determining the insertion pathway of a nascent chain, which is also noted in the review by Cymer et al. Nonetheless, some experiments, such as the work of Goder and Speiss (EMBO J., 2003), also demonstrate a clear role for kinetic effects, in addition to purely equilibrium effects, on nascent chain topogenesis.</p><p>The CG model has previously been demonstrated (B. Zhang and T. F. Miller III, Cell Rep., 2012) to correctly describe membrane integration processes that are governed by both thermodynamic and/or kinetic effects. In particular, the CG model correctly reproduces the stop-transfer efficiency of TMDs with varying hydrophobicity (T. Hessa et al., Nature, 2005), a process that is dominated by thermodynamics. The CG model also correctly reproduces the effect of translation rate and nascent chain length on signal anchor topogenesis (Goder and Spiess, EMBO J., 2003), both of which exhibit clear kinetic effects. The CG model is therefore able to model pathways dominated by both kinetics and thermodynamics as discussed in the review by Cymer et al.</p><p>To emphasize these points in the revised text, we have expanded the last paragraph of the subsection “Coarse-grained model” to read: “Moreover, the model has been shown to accurately predict features of single-spanning IMP integration and topogenesis […] and it has provided a means of understanding the competition between such effects.” Note that this revision includes explicit citation of the Cymer et al. review (2014).</p><p><italic>6) The pathways of insertion should be discussed in more detail.</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1"><italic>Figure 1</italic></xref> <italic>shows the 2D model used by Miller et al. The nascent chain can exit from the translocon either by a gap between translocon and membrane or through the translocon. Although the upper panel of</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1"><italic>Figure 1B</italic></xref> <italic>suggests passage through the translocon, the lower panel shows the nascent chain passing from ribosome directly into the membrane. The paper does not address which of these two pathways is preferred. I think the authors should comment on this and, if possible, provide more information on the pathways observed in the simulations. This is important, because Cymer et al. (2015) suggested that the preferred path of the nascent chain might be along the translocon lateral gate rather than through the translocon as suggested by the current cartoons. The lower panel of</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1"><italic>Figure 1B</italic></xref> <italic>suggests that the lateral gate pathway may be the preferred path.</italic></p><p>As suggested by the reviewers, we have performed additional analysis of the simulation data to characterize the cotranslational integration pathways. We find that the preferred pathway for cotranslational integration is for a TMD to partially enter the channel, then integrate into the membrane via the lateral gate.</p><p>Our analysis of the simulated trajectories examines three pathways by which by which individual TMDs undergo Sec-facilitated cotranslational integration. These three pathways are categorized according to the definitions of Cymer et al. In the “channel-sliding” pathway, the TMD partially enters the channel, then crosses the lateral gate, then fully integrates into the membrane. In the “interface-sliding” pathway, the TMD enters the cytoplasm through the gap between the translocon and ribosome, prior to undergoing membrane integration. In the “in-out” pathway, the TMD fully spans the channel prior to membrane integration.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3–figure supplement 1</xref> in the revised manuscript shows that the dominant cotranslational integration pathway for all four TMDs in both the EmrE and nEmrE mutants is the “channel-sliding” pathway. This same pathway was also observed in our previous study of single-spanning proteins using the CG model (B. Zhang and T. F. Miller III, Cell Rep., 2012) and similar configurations were observed in previous atomistic molecular dynamics simulations (B. Zhang and T. F. Miller III, JACS, 2012). These observations agree in part with the proposal by Cymer et al. that TMDs do not need to fully enter the channel prior to lateral gate opening and membrane integration. However, we observe only a few CG trajectories in which TMDs exhibit the “interface-sliding” pathway. Finally, we note that the “channel-sliding” behavior may be less dominant in other IMPs with less hydrophobic TMDs.</p><p>To provide this analysis of the cotranslational integration pathways in the revised manuscript, we have added <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3–figure supplement 1</xref> and a new section titled “Cotranslational integration pathways” to the Materials and methods section. We have also updated trajectory snapshots in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> to depict the dominant integration pathway and added to the subsection “Dual-topology proteins exhibit slow post-translational integration”: “Over 90% of the CB mutant trajectories reach the N<sub>cyto</sub>/C<sub>cyto</sub> topology within three seconds following the completion of translation and thus rapidly integrate as expected for the cotranslational model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Blobel, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Wessels and Spiess, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Sadlish et al., 2005</xref>); mechanistic features of individual TMD integration steps are discussed in the Cotranslational integration pathways section of the Materials and methods.”</p><p><italic>7) A more thorough statistical analysis of the data would strengthen the paper. P-values, rank correlations, or other measures of correlation could be calculated for the data presented in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2"><italic>Figure 2</italic></xref> <italic>so that the reader can understand the correlation and statistical significance of the simulation results compared to the experimental results.</italic></p><p>We agree with this comment and have revised the manuscript to include improved statistical analysis.</p><p>First, for the data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, we calculated the Pearson correlation coefficient to quantify the linear correlation between the simulation and experimental data. This calculation yielded a value of 0.92, confirming a strong linear correlation. We have also graphically illustrated this correlation in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2–figure supplement 2</xref> of the revised text. This plot is divided into quadrants – data points lying in the top right and bottom left quadrants (shaded in light gray) show where simulations and experiments both predict the same dominant topology. All mutants, with the exception of A52K, have the same dominant topology in the simulations as in the experiments within the statistical error. These measures confirm the agreement between simulation/experiment discussed in the text and strengthen the conclusions in the manuscript.</p><p>In the revised text, we have added <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2–figure supplement 2</xref> and the following passage to the subsection “Simulations match experimental observations of topology”: “<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2-figure supplement 2</xref> illustrates that the distribution of topologies determined experimentally and the distribution of topologies measured from the simulations are linearly correlated (Pearson correlation coefficient, <italic>r</italic> = 0.92); points lying in the two shaded quadrants of the graph correspond to proteins for which the simulations and experiments predict consistent topologies.”</p><p><italic>8) What is the role of neighboring protein elements on the flipping frequency of a given loop? How do these correlated motions affect the flipping frequencies presented in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6"><italic>Figure 6</italic></xref><italic>?</italic></p><p>As suggested by the reviewers, we have performed additional analysis of the CG trajectories to address the role of neighboring protein elements and correlated loop motions on the loop-flipping frequencies.</p><p>Our new analysis indicates that multiple loops do not flip concurrently within the same time interval, although loops are more likely to flip when neighboring TMDs are misintegrated. These results show that while loop-flipping events are not concerted on the millisecond timescale, the loop-flipping frequency of a given loop is impacted by the orientation of its neighboring TMDs.</p><p>To examine the concurrence of loop-flipping events, we calculated the frequency with which multiple loops undergo flipping within the same 1 ms interval. It was found that pairs of loops undergo concurrent flipping with a frequency that is only 0.015% of the frequency of single loop-flipping events. Three or more loops were never observed to concurrently flip. These results indicate that loop-flipping events are not concerted on the millisecond timescale.</p><p>To examine the effect of neighboring TMDs on the loop-flipping frequency, we separately calculate the loop-flipping frequency for each loop for configurations in which zero, one, or two of the neighboring TMDs is misintegrated. On average, it was found that a loop with a single misintegrated neighboring TMD flips 1.5 times more frequently than the same loop with zero misintegrated neighboring TMDs, while a loop with two misintegrated neighboring TMDs flips 3.7 times more frequently than the same loop with zero misintegrated neighboring TMDs. These findings show that the orientation of neighboring TMDs does indeed impact the loop-flipping frequency.</p><p>To address these points in the revised manuscript, we have added to the subsection “Calculation of loop-flipping frequency”: “Loop-flipping events are not found to be strongly concerted, as two or more loops were observed to flip concurrently in only 0.015% of all 1-ms time intervals in which at least one loop-flipping event was observed. […] Additional details on these calculations are presented in the Calculation of loop-flipping frequency section of the Materials and methods.” We have also added additional details to the “Calculation of flipping frequency” section.</p><p><italic>9) A more detailed discussion of the possible role of degradation would be important. Based on experimentally determined timescales of degradation (a brief comment is presented in the last paragraph of the Discussion), and the time scales of insertion and annealing observed here, can one estimate the degraded fraction and the effect on the orientation distribution?</italic></p><p><italic>Along the same lines, in the third paragraph of the subsection “Position of slowest-flipping loop in EOT ensemble determines fully integrated topology”, it is not immediately clear how “the fraction of CG trajectories that have reached fully integrated multispanning configurations” (</italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7"><italic>Figure 7B</italic></xref><italic>) is related to degradation of sequences as a function of time prior to reaching a fully integrated multispanning topology. This paragraph needs to be edited for greater clarity to reveal the authors' assumptions more clearly.</italic></p><p>We agree that this issue of protein degradation in this context is interesting and worth clarifying. While the exact pathway for EmrE degradation is unknown, several bacterial proteases that degrade membrane proteins have been characterized which provides insight into the approximate degradation timescale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">R. Dalbey et al., 2011</xref>). Notably, FtsH is a membrane-embedded protease that degrades misassembled IMPs over timescales ranging from 2 minutes (for SecY) to 15 minutes (for YccA) in <italic>E. coli</italic> (K. Ito and Y. Akiyama, Annu. Rev. Microbiol., 2005)<italic>.</italic> In comparison to the simulated trajectories (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3–figure supplement 2</xref>), these degradation timescales are relatively slow, supporting the assumption that IMP integration and post-translational annealing reaches completion prior to significant degradation. Nonetheless, if it is assumed that misfolded proteins are uniformly subject to degradation, even on relatively short (i.e. 5-100 s) timescales, we provide analysis in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref> to suggest that degradation still does not significantly affect the distribution of topologies predicted from the simulations.</p><p>Our analysis of the likely effects of degradation are presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>. This figure presents the relative fraction of N<sub>cyto</sub>/C<sub>cyto</sub> and N<sub>peri</sub>/C<sub>peri</sub> protein topologies for the CG trajectories that have reached fully integrated multispanning topologies as a function of time, excluding all trajectories for which at least one TMD is misintegrated If it is assumed that fully integrated proteins are resistant to degradation, then each point in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref> represents the distribution of topologies that would be observed if all misfolded proteins were uniformly degraded at the corresponding time. The figure shows that the distribution of topologies is nearly constant with respect to degradation time, preserving the correlation between the position of the slowest-flipping loop at the end of translation and in the fully integrated multispanning topology.</p><p>To clarify these points in the manuscript, we have expanded the last paragraph of the Results.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p><italic>The authors have, in my opinion, responded extremely well to the previous reviews.
