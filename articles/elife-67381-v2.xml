its NAD-metabolizing activity and is a drug target for neurodegenerative disorders. We designed and synthesized fluorescent conjugates of styryl derivative with pyridine to serve as substrates of SARM1, which exhibited large red shifts after conversion. With the conjugates, SARM1 activation was visualized in live cells following elevation of endogenous NMN or treatment with a cell-permeant NMN-analog. In neurons, imaging documented mouse SARM1 activation preceded vincristine-induced axonal degeneration by hours. Library screening identified a derivative of nisoldipine (NSDP) as a covalent inhibitor of SARM1 that reacted with the cysteines, especially Cys311 in its ARM domain and blocked its NMN-activation, protecting axons from degeneration. The Cryo-EM structure showed that SARM1 was locked into an inactive conformation by the inhibitor, uncovering a potential neuroprotective mechanism of dihydropyridines.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>SARM1</kwd><kwd>fluorescent probes</kwd><kwd>base-exchange</kwd><kwd>allosteric inhibitors</kwd><kwd>CryoEM structure</kwd><kwd>covalent inhibitors</kwd><kwd>cADPR</kwd><kwd>NAD</kwd><kwd>NAADP</kwd><kwd>dHNN</kwd><kwd>nisoldipine</kwd><kwd>CD38</kwd><kwd>cyclic ADP-ribose</kwd><kwd>ADP-ribosyl cyclase</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Ministry of Science and Technology of the People's Republic of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2019YFA0906000</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhang</surname><given-names>Hongmin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>31871401</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhao</surname><given-names>Yong Juan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001747</institution-id><institution>Hong Kong Baptist University</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RC-SGT2/18-19/SCI/005</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lee</surname><given-names>Chi-Sing</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001747</institution-id><institution>Hong Kong Baptist University</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RC-ICRS-18-19-01A</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lee</surname><given-names>Chi-Sing</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The first-in-class cell-permeant fluorescent probe provides direct and visual evidence of SARM1 activation in axonal degeneration and identified the first covalent, allosteric inhibitor of SARM1 acting on the NAD-binding pocket in the ARM domain.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Axon degeneration (AxD) occurs in most neurodegenerative disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Coleman and HÃ¶ke, 2020</xref>). Sterile Alpha and TIR Motifâcontaining 1 (SARM1) acts as a main effector in this processÂ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Osterloh et al., 2012</xref>) and its depletion significantly attenuates AxD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Geisler et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Osterloh et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Turkiew et al., 2017</xref>). SARM1 controls AxD through its enzymatic activityÂ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Essuman et al., 2017</xref>). It is self-inhibitory and is activated by nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN)Â (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Zhao et al., 2019</xref>), resulting in depletion of the intracellular NAD-poolÂ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Essuman et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Zhao et al., 2019</xref>). However, recent studies suggest that nicotinamide adenine dinucleotideÂ (NAD) itself is an inhibitor of SARM1 activation and the balance between NMN and NAD controls the activation of SARM1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Figley et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Jiang et al., 2020</xref>;Â <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Sporny et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>It should be noted that SARM1 is not just a simple NADase activated to deplete the cellular NAD. We have documented that SARM1 is a multifunctional enzyme with properties similar to CD38, a universal signaling enzyme possessing not only NADase activity but also catalyzing both the cyclization of NAD to cyclic ADP-ribose (cADPR) and the exchange of nicotinamide in NADP with nicotinic acid to produce nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NAADP)Â (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Zhao et al., 2019</xref>). Both cADPR and NAADP are messengers regulating calcium mobilization in the endoplasmic reticulum and the endo-lysosomes, respectively (reviewed inÂ <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Galione, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Lee, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lee and Zhao, 2019</xref>). The catalytic similarities and its ubiquitous presence in non-neuronal cells suggest that SARM1 may be a calcium signaling enzyme as well.</p><p>Since SARM1 is important in axon degeneration and potentially other physiological processes as well, we thus aim to design and synthesize probes for visualizing SARM1 activation in live cells and to screen drug library for potent inhibitors.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Probe design, synthesis, and characterization</title><p>We focused on its base-exchange reaction for designing specific probes for SARM1 and had shown that pyridyl derivatives can readily serve as substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Graeff et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lee and Aarhus, 1997</xref>). We thus conjugated various styryl derivatives to pyridine to produce a series of conjugates (PCs) as fluorescent probes for SARM1 activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). We reasoned that conjugating the electron-rich styryl derivative with pyridine should provide a donor-Ï-acceptor frameworkÂ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Pawlicki et al., 2009</xref>;Â <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>).

Extra electron density was only observed near residue Cys311, the dHNN-target (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C and D</xref>), but not other cysteine residues, consistent with it being derived from dHNN (5<italic>F</italic>, purple). dHNN interacts with Glu264, Leu268, Arg307, Phe308, and Ala315 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>, green) in the ARM domain, pushing the insertion loop (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>, red) toward ARM1 and stabilizes the domain.

The PCÂ probes developed here are particularly advantageous. They are cell-permeant, but the SARM1-catalyzed exchange products are not and accumulate in the cytosol, enhancing their detection. The remarkably large red shift of the product fluorescence provides easy visualization away from the interference of autofluorescence.</p><p>Currently, there are several fluorescent probes for SARM1 activity in use. They are all analogs of NAD and are cell-impermeant, such as ÎµNAD. The fact that NAD is now shown to beÂ an inhibitor of SARM1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Jiang et al., 2020</xref>;Â <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Sporny et al., 2020</xref>)Â makes the use of these analog probes problematic, as they may affect SARM1 activity as well. PC6 has no such drawback as it is a pyridine, not an NAD analog. Furthermore, the use of PC6 requires neither expression of construct nor cell manipulation, making it suitable for detecting SARM1 activity in any cells. This is documented in this study. Using CZ-48, a cell-permeant activator, to activate endogenous SARM1 produces large increase in PAD6 fluorescence in a variety cell lines as well as primary neurons. With the probes, we provided the first direct evidence in live DRG neurons that SARM1 activation precedes AxD by several hours and that it is a necessary but insufficient factor for AxD.</p><p>Screening library to identify compounds of interest is a straightforward strategy widely used. The case for SARM1 is more complicated, as it is not only a multi-domain protein but also an auto-regulated enzyme catalyzing multiple reactions. Compounds may target the regulatory ARM domain as shown here for dHNN, or the catalytic TIR domain as Nam and the inhibitors reported during the preparation of this manuscript (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hughes et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Loring et al., 2020</xref>). For SARM1, the substrates are different for the base-exchange and the NADase reactions and may thus be differentially affected by the inhibitor-induced conformational changes of the catalytic site. Although the exact reason remains to be determined, the compounds shown here that can selectively block one reaction much more than the other are of interest. Many believe that the NADase activity of SARM1, leading to cellular NAD depletion, is its dominant property for regulating AxD. But the two calcium messengers, cADPR and NAADP produced by its cyclizing and base-exchange reactions may well have functional roles as well. Compounds with differential inhibition can thus be an important tool to resolve the issue.</p><p>Much effort is being invested in targeting SARM1-mediated NAD depletion for therapeutic protection from AxD. Chemical blockers may well be an ideal tool for turning off the NAD depletion. dHNN uncovered in this study is the first compound ever described that can block the activation of SARM1, revealing a druggable allosteric site and can thus usher in a new approach for therapeutic drug development. Another point of interest is that dHNN is a derivative of NSDP. Metabolic conversion of NSDP to dHNN, leading to inhibition of SARM1, may well account for the neural protective effects of NSDP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Siddiqi et al., 2019</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals</title><p>This study was carried out in strict accordance with animal use protocol approved by Peking University Shenzhen Graduate School Animal Care and Use Committee (#AP0015001).

describing the development of small molecule probes that can detect the activity of SARM1 in live cells. One of the probe allows the author to monitor the activity SARM1 and discovery a small molecule derived from an hyertension drug as an effective SARM1 inhibitor. SARM1 is an enzyme that can convert NAD+ to ADP-ribose or cyclic ADP-ribose and is implicated in axon degeneration, thus the probe and the inhibitor described in the manuscript could lead to future therapeutic development targeting SARM1 to treat axon degeneration.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Permeant Fluorescent Probes Visualize the Activation of SARM1 and Uncover an Anti-neurodegenerative Drug Candidate&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 2 peer reviewers, including Hening Lin as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Michael Marletta as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1. Since the inhibitors react with multiple cysteines and the mechanism of inactivation is not clear from the MS data, please either propose a reasonable mechanism and/or minimize those aspects of the report and explicitly state that the inhibitor modifies multiple cysteines and is unlikely to be a very useful probe.</p><p>2. It would be necessary to do a more thorough editing and proof-reading to further improve the language.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>The authors aimed to develop cell-permeable small molecule probes that can monitor the activity of SARM1, an enzyme that hydrolyzes NAD+ and is thought to be important for axon degeneration. They successfully achieved this goal using the base exchange activity of SARM1 to make a donor-Ï-acceptor type of fluorophore. The best probe described in the manuscript is PC6. A number of experiments were carried to rigorously test that the probe works as expected. PC6 has a number of nice features. It is cell permeable, gives much stronger signal than any other probes known for SARM1, is specific for SARM1 and does not detect the activity of CD38 (another enzyme that has similar activity), and allows detection of endogenous SARM1 activation in neurons.</p><p>Using this probe PC6, the authors was able to monitor SARM1 activity in neurons treated with vincristine and demonstrated that SARM1 activation precedes axon degeneration and is important but not sufficient for axon degeneration. Most importantly, using this probe to monitor SARM activity, they screened a library of about 2000 drug molecules and discovered that a hypertension drug, nisoldipine, could inhibits SARM1. Surprisingly, further studies showed that a derivative of nisoldipine, dehydronitrosonisoldipine (dHNN, present in the nisoldipine compound used ), is actually the inhibitor of SARM1. They then carried nice mechanistic studies (including mass spectrometry and cryo-EM structures) showing that dHNN inhibits SARM1 by covalently modify Cys311 residue in the ARM domain. The dHNN binding site is similar to the previously established NAD+ inhibitory site.</p><p>Overall, the probe is novel with many useful features, the study is rigorous and rather complete, and the conclusion is well supported. I believe the study will be important for the field and will be well received by the field.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>The manuscript by Li et al. describes the development of styrylpyridines as cell permeant fluorescent sensors of SARM1 activity. This work is significant because SARM1 activity is increased during neuron damage and SARM1 knockout mice are protected from neuronal degeneration caused by a variety of physical and chemical insults. Thus, SARM1 is a key player in neuronal degeneration and a novel therapeutic target. SARM1 is an NAD+ hydrolase that cleaves NAD+ to form nicotinamide and ADP ribose (and to a small extent cyclic ADP ribose) via a reactive oxocarbenium intermediate. Notably, this intermediate can either react with water (hydrolysis), the adenosine ring (cyclization to cADPR), or with a pyridine containing molecule in a 'base-exchange reaction'. The styrylpyridines described by Li et al. exploit this base-exchange reaction; the styrylpyridines react with the intermediate to form a fluorescent product. Notably, the best probe (PC6) can be used to monitor SARM1 activity in vitro and in cells. Upon validating the utility of PC6, the authors use this compound to perform a high throughput screen of the Approved Drug Library (L1000) from TargetMol and identify nisoldipine as a hit. Further studies revealed that a minor metabolite, dehydronitrosonisoldipine (dHNN), is the true inhibitor, acting with single digit Î¼M potency. The authors provide structural and proteomic data suggesting that dHNN inhibits SARM1 activity via the covalent modification of C311 which stabilizes the enzyme in the autoinhibited state.</p><p>Key strengths of the manuscript include the probe design and the authors demonstration that they can be used to monitor SARM1 activity in vitro in an HTS format and in cells. The identification of C311 as potential reactive cysteine that could be targeted for drug development is an important and significant insight.</p><p>Key weaknesses include the fact that dHNN is a highly reactive molecule and the authors note that it modifies multiple sites on the protein (they mentioned 8 but MS2 spectra for only 5 are provided). As such, the compound appears to be a non-specific alkylator that will have limited utility as a SARM1 inhibitor. Additionally, no information is provided on the proteome-wide selectivity of the compound. An additional key weakness is the lack of any mechanistic insights into how the adducts are generated.</p><p>Moreover, it is not clear how the proposed sulphonamide and thiohydroxylamine adducts are formed. From the images presented, it is unclear whether there is sufficient 'density' in the cryoEM maps to accurately predict the sites of modification. Finally, the authors do not show whether the conversion of PC6 to PAD6 is stable or if PAD6 can also be hydrolyzed to form ADPR.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.67381.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1.

The dominant role of Cys311 is also confirmed by our mutagenesis and structural studies. Furthermore, quantification of cysteine-containing peptides of other proteins showed no dHNN modification. So, we conclude that dHNN shows significant specificity to the Cys311 of SARM1.
