Preadipocyte differentiation is altered in obese individuals, which has been proposed to contribute to obesity-associated metabolic disturbances. Here, we aimed at identifying the pathogenic processes underlying impaired adipocyte differentiation in obese individuals with insulin resistance (IR)/type 2 diabetes (T2D). We report that down-regulation of a key member of the major spliceosome, <italic>PRFP8</italic>/PRP8, as observed in IR/T2D preadipocytes from subcutaneous (SC) fat, prevented adipogenesis by altering both the expression and splicing patterns of adipogenic transcription factors and lipid droplet-related proteins, while adipocyte differentiation was restored upon recovery of <italic>PRFP8</italic>/PRP8 normal levels. Adipocyte differentiation was also compromised under conditions of endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-associated protein degradation (ERAD) hyperactivation, as occurs in SC and omental (OM) preadipocytes in IR/T2D obesity. Thus, targeting mRNA splicing and ER proteostasis in preadipocytes could improve adipose tissue function and thus contribute to metabolic health in obese individuals.</p></abstract><kwd-group

preadipocytes, are essential for the maintenance of adipose tissue homeostasis, regeneration, and expansion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Berry et al., 2016</xref>). Preadipocytes differentiation into adipocytes, i.e. adipogenesis, enables adipocyte turnover and adipose tissue growth and ensures adipose tissue plasticity to accommodate surplus energy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Arner et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Sarjeant and Stephens, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Spalding et al., 2008</xref>). It has been proposed that the inability for recruiting new adipose cells together with the functional impairment of hypertrophied adipocytes that occur in obesity contribute to lipid spill over from the adipose tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Lessard and Tchernof, 2012</xref>). Ectopic fat deposition and lipotoxicity in non-adipose organs have been associated with the development of insulin resistance (IR) and type 2 diabetes (T2D) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Engin and Engin, 2017</xref>). Thus, increasing adipogenesis appears as a valuable strategy to facilitate healthy adipose tissue expansion and ensure metabolic health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Ghaben and Scherer, 2019</xref>).</p><p>Adipocyte differentiation involves striking changes in size, metabolism, and responsiveness to signals. This process, in turn, relies on major changes in gene expression programs regulating mRNA and protein production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Mota de Sá et al., 2017</xref>). An increasing body of evidence shows that mRNA processing and, in particular, alternative splicing, is crucial for genome reprogramming during cell differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Fiszbein and Kornblihtt, 2017</xref>). In this line, the recent identification of PPARγ protein variants with opposing effects on preadipocyte differentiation, supports a role for alternative splicing in adipogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Aprile et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Aprile et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Aprile et al., 2014</xref>). However, the splicing components relevant to adipogenesis and the cellular events regulated by alternative splicing during adipocyte differentiation have been scarcely explored (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Lin, 2015</xref>), and it is yet to be established whether alternative splicing is modified in human obesity.</p><p>Another crucial mechanism preserving precursor cell function relates to protein homeostasis (i.e. proteostasis), which maintains the capacity of cells to expand in order to sustain tissue growth and regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Noormohammadi et al., 2018</xref>). Several lines of evidence support an important role for the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) protein quality control system in the regulation of adipogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Lowe et al., 2011</xref>). In fact, the unfolded protein response (UPR) is perturbed in the obese adipose tissue and has been proposed to contribute to the pathology of obesity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Yilmaz, 2017</xref>). By contrast, it is still unknown whether the other component of the protein control system, the ER-associated protein degradation (ERAD), which is crucial for protecting cells against accumulation of misfolded/unfolded proteins and proteotoxicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Hwang and Qi, 2018</xref>), is altered in the obese adipose tissue. Importantly, genetic ablation of the core ERAD protein, SEL1L, in mouse adipocytes causes lipodystrophy and postprandial hyperlipidaemia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Sha et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Here, we set out an iTRAQ-LC-MS/MS proteomic approach for the analysis of subcutaneous (SC) and omental (OM) preadipocytes from obese individuals with normoglycaemia (NG) and T2D in order to identify altered molecular pathways that may contribute to metabolic disease in obesity. Down-regulation of multiple components of the splicing machinery was observed in SC preadipocytes from obese individuals with insulin resistance (IR) or T2D, as compared to NG obesity. This, together with the observation that adipogenesis can be modulated by regulating the expression levels of a key spliceosome component, <italic>PRFP8</italic>/PRP8, support a role for alternative splicing in the development of obesity-associated metabolic complications. In addition, our studies show that not only the UPR but also the ERAD system are altered in human SC and OM preadipocytes from IR/T2D obese subjects, and that this condition (i.e., hyperactivated ERAD), when mimicked in vitro, prevented adipogenesis. Our results provide novel mechanistic explanations for the impaired adipogenic capacity observed in IR/T2D obesity that relates to both mRNA and ER-proteostasis disturbance.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Preadipocytes display distinct features in obesity-related IR/T2D</title><p>Preadipocytes from SC and OM adipose tissue were isolated from 78 morbidly obese subjects (BMI &lt;40 kg/m<sup>2</sup>) (hereinafter referred to as obese individuals) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>), who were subclassified into three groups [normoglycemic (NG Obese): Glucose &lt;100 mg/dL, HbA1c &lt; 5.7%; impaired fasting glucose (IFG Obese): Glucose 100–126 mg/dL, HbA1c 5.7–6.5%; and with type 2 diabetes (T2D Obese): Glucose &gt;126 mg/dL, HbA1c &gt; 6.5%], according to the criteria of the American Diabetes Association (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">ADA, 2021</xref>).

TUDCA was also able to increase the expression of markers of differentiation in preadipocytes from IR and, to a lower extent, also from T2D obese individuals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7H and I</xref>). In fact, this chaperone enhanced the lipid content in OM preadipocytes of IR and T2D obese subjects to the levels found in OM preadipocytes of NG obese subjects, though TUDCA-treated T2D OM preadipocytes exhibited low LD numbers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7G</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>We found that alternative splicing in the SC adipose tissue, and the ER stress-UPR-ERAD system in both SC and OM fat represent essential components of the adipogenic process that are altered in obese individuals with IR/T2D. We show novel evidence demonstrating that NG obesity involves the up-regulation of splicing-related genes in SC preadipocytes as compared with lean individuals. However, the development of IR/T2D, both in simple and morbid obesity, is associated with a general decrease in the expression of splicing genes in SC preadipocytes. In fact, decreasing the expression of a key component of the major spliceosome, <italic>PRPF8</italic>/PRP8, by siRNA is sufficient to hamper the expression of both markers of adipogenesis and regulators of LD biogenesis and growth. Our results support a relevant role for this protein and the splicing machinery in the regulation of adipocyte differentiation and highlight the biological significance of alternative splicing in maintaining adipose tissue homeostasis and metabolic health in obesity. Our results are also indicative of IR/T2D-dependent ERAD hyperactivation in preadipocytes of the two major fat depots, SC and OM, in obese individuals. Maladaptative UPR and ERAD signalling upon ER stress induction may contribute to impair adipocyte differentiation and to the progression of metabolic disease in obesity.</p><p>Alternative splicing of mRNA enables cells to acquire protein diversity, which is essential for cell differentiation and tissue growth and identity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Baralle and Giudice, 2017</xref>). It is accepted that both mRNA transcription and processing contribute to the changes in gene expression patterns leading to the transition of progenitor cells toward a mature phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Fiszbein and Kornblihtt, 2017</xref>). In this regard, recent reports suggest a role for alternative splicing in adipocyte differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Lin, 2015</xref>). It has been shown that inhibition of the splicing factor, SF3B1, blocks 3T3-L1 adipocyte differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kaida, 2019</xref>), and recent RNA-seq studies support the occurrence of alternative splicing events during adipogenesis of bonemarrow-derived human mesenchymal stem cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Yi et al., 2020</xref>). Furthermore, certain naturally PPARγ isoforms generated by alternative splicing act as dominant-negative isoforms that prevent adipocyte differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Aprile et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Aprile et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Aprile et al., 2014</xref>). However, few studies have addressed the relevance of the splicing machinery in human preadipocytes and whether this system is altered in obesity. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study demonstrating the deregulation of representative members of the two main components of the splicing machinery, the major and minor spliceosome, and associated splicing factors in human SC preadipocytes (and, occasionally, also in OM preadipocytes) in relation to obesity-associated IR/T2D. To be more specific, we show the up-regulation of several splicing-related genes in response to simple obesity, especially in SC preadipocytes, in individuals that maintain an adequate glycaemic control. This could represent an adaptive response to weight gain that seems to be lost in obese or extremely obese individuals with IR/T2D. In fact, our proteomic and gene expression results indicate that a high proportion of splicing-related elements were down-regulated in SC preadipocytes from obese individuals with IR/T2D as compared to those with a better metabolic profile (NG). In all, our results strongly support the notion that the splicing process is altered in obesity and related metabolic disease.</p><p>To analyse the relevance of alternative splicing on adipogenesis, we reduced the expression of <italic>PRPF8</italic>/PRP8 in SC preadipocytes from NG obese individuals to the levels found in their counterparts in IR/T2D obese individuals as well as in the human preadipocyte cell line, SGBS cells. In this context, recent work combining RNA-seq and proteomics demonstrated that PRP8 depletion altered the expression of more than 1,500 proteins in Cal51 breast cancer cells, supporting the relevance of this protein in defining the human proteome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Liu et al., 2017</xref>). In fact, as part of the core of the major spliceosome, PRP8 is potentially involved in the removal of most introns from precursor mRNAs (99.5% of non-coding regions are removed by the major spliceosome) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Turunen et al., 2013</xref>). Our studies showed that decreasing PRP8 protein levels in NG obese SC preadipocytes or in SGBS preadipocytes evoked gene/protein expression changes indicative of altered adipogenesis, which was confirmed by the decreased accumulation of lipids observed in both cell types at late stages of differentiation. These results were replicated in another SC adipocyte cell line, hADSCs, derived from a lean donor, reinforcing the key contribution of <italic>PRPF8</italic>/PRP8 to human adipocyte differentiation.</p><p>Two different yet functionally interrelated pathways were impaired in either NG obese SC preadipocytes, SGBS preadipocytes or hADSCs cells silenced for <italic>PRPF8</italic> in terms of both total gene expression levels and isoform balance of the proteins involved, that is, adipogenic transcriptional program, and LD biogenesis and growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). Thus, PRP8 down-regulation altered the expression of PPARγ and SREBP1, as well as of seipin and two members of the CIDE family (CIDEB, CIDEC). In particular, the overall decrease in PPARγ and SREBP1 isoforms observed upon PRP8 down-regulation may account for the reduction observed in mRNA and/or protein levels of known downstream target genes of these transcription factors (adiponectin, FABP4, CIDEC, and FAS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Lowe et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Slayton et al., 2019</xref>). Likewise, the dramatic changes in LD size and number observed in <italic>PRPF8</italic>-silenced adipocytes might be related to the low expression levels of the canonical seipin variant, seipin1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Craveiro Sarmento et al., 2018</xref>), observed in these cells. Indeed, our observations are in line with previous data on seipin knockout A431 cells, which also exhibited more numerous but smaller LDs than controls (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Salo et al., 2016</xref>). Interestingly, seipin knock-down has been shown to suppress <italic>PPARG</italic> and <italic>SREBF1</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Fei et al., 2011</xref>), thus suggesting that the phenotype of cells silenced for PRP8 may be the result of the action of this spliceosome component on multiple key genes contributing to adipogenesis and lipogenesis. In line with this notion, analysis of CLIP-sep data in the ENCORI database revealed the presence of PRP8 binding sites in <italic>PPARG</italic>, <italic>SREBP1</italic>, <italic>BSCL2</italic>, <italic>CIDEB,</italic> and <italic>CIDEC</italic> mRNAs. Further research is needed to fully establish the splicing targets for PRP8 in preadipocytes and to characterize the relevance of the resulting protein isoforms (and/or their ratio) in adipogenesis. Notwithstanding this, the observation that PRP8 re-expression in <italic>PRPF8</italic>-silenced SGBS cells and, most notably, in SC preadipocytes from IR/T2D obese individuals, can restore the expression and/or isoform balance of genes such as <italic>PPARG</italic>, <italic>BSCL2</italic>, <italic>CIDEB,</italic> or <italic>CIDEC</italic>, as well as normal LD content, supports a prominent role for this protein in lipid accumulation in adipocytes. Our data on <italic>SFPQ</italic> silencing and SF3B pharmacological inactivation would further extend this role to the whole splicing machinery. In this scenario, it is reasonable to propose that the decreased expression of splicing-related genes in SC preadipocytes in IR/T2D obesity as compared to NG obesity could be responsible, at least in part, of the loss of adipogenic capacity displayed by SC preadipocytes from obese individuals with metabolic disease. The regulatory mechanisms controlling the expression of splicing genes in preadipocytes under physiological and pathological conditions remain to be elucidated. Studies from our laboratory using in vitro models mimicking different obesogenic inputs (hyperglycaemia/hyperinsulinemia, adipocyte hypertrophy, inflammation) failed to modify <italic>PRPF8</italic> mRNA levels in preadipocytes (data not shown). Future studies will be aimed at establishing whether other pathogenic processes causing adipose tissue dysfunction in obese individuals (i.e. fibrosis, hypoxia) may alter alternative splicing in these cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>).</p><fig id="fig8" position="float"><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Schematic representation of the proposed mechanisms of action of PRP8/splicing and UPR/ERAD on adipocyte differentiation.</title><p>PRP8 mediates alternative splicing events in subcutaneous (SC) preadipocytes by regulating the expression and/or isoform balance of the master regulators of adipogenesis, SREBP1 and PPARγ (solid arrows), likely through a direct action on the corresponding pre-mRNAs. This, in turn, would result in changes in the expression of adipogenic genes down-stream SREBP1 and PPARγ (dashed arrows), yet a direct action of PRP8 on CIDEB splicing is also plausible. The observed down-regulation of PRP8 in SC preadipocytes from obese individuals with insulin resistance (IR) and type 2 diabetes (T2D) would contribute to the impaired adipogenic capacity of these cells. A second pathogenic mechanism is activated in SC preadipocytes from IR/T2D obese individuals that impairs adipogenesis, that is, dysregulated ER proteostasis leading to UPR/ERAD activation. This mechanism, which is also triggered in omental (OM) preadipocytes under conditions of IR/T2D obesity, alters the adipogenic program by modifying the expression of key adipogenic transcripction factors and down-stream adipocyte markers. Splicing dysregulation and UPR/ERAD activation could be differentially triggered by obesogenic insults. The model is based on published molecular mechanisms, in silico analysis of ENCORI and HumanBase databases, and the main findings shown in this article.

As mentioned earlier, changes in splicing components between groups were negligible in OM preadipocytes as compared to their SC counterparts. These inter-depot differences, which appear to be cell autonomous, might contribute, at least partly, to the distinct differentiation capacity of SC and OM preadipocytes observed in this and other studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Martyniak and Masternak, 2017</xref>).Interestingly, along with altered splicing, SC preadipocytes in IR/T2D obesity also exhibited molecular features indicative of ER stress response failure, a hallmark process associated with the development of metabolic diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Bhattarai et al., 2020</xref>). Our data suggest that this pathogenic process also occurs in OM preadipocytes in IR/T2D obesity. In accordance with these findings, previous studies from our laboratory have established that IR obesity is associated with enhanced levels of ER stress markers in mature adipocytes isolated from either SC or OM fat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Díaz-Ruiz et al., 2015</xref>). Herein we report, for the first time, that the three UPR signal transducers, IRE1α, PERK, and ATF6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Hetz and Papa, 2018</xref>), and two effector systems downstream the UPR branches, CHOP and <italic>XBP1</italic> splicing, are dysregulated in primary SC and OM preadipocytes in the transition from NG to IR/T2D in severe obesity, in terms of total protein content and/or phosphorylation rate (i.e. activation). It is noteworthy that changes in these proteins did not always follow the same trends between SC and OM preadipocytes in response to IR/T2D, indicating the existence of depot-specific (mal)adaptative responses to obesity-associated ER stress. Notwithstanding this notion, a feature common to SC and OM preadipocytes was the up-regulation of both the master initiator of the UPR signalling pathway, BiP, and <italic>XBP1s/ XBP1u</italic> ratio, in IR/T2D obesity. Given the role of BiP in mediating the targeting of misfolded/unfolded ER proteins for cytosolic degradation via ERAD, and the stimulatory effect of <italic>XBP1s</italic> on the expression of ERAD components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Karagöz et al., 2019</xref>), these observations supported that IR/T2D obesity could not only alter the UPR but also the activity of this branch of the quality-control system in the ER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Hwang and Qi, 2018</xref>). Interestingly, ERAD is activated when the protein folding capacity of the ER is exceeded (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Hwang and Qi, 2018</xref>), which seems to be the case for SC and OM preadipocytes of IR/T2D morbidly obese individuals according to their enhanced expression levels of ER chaperones as compared to NG obesity. In fact, our studies show, for the first time, that SC and OM preadipocytes from IR/T2D obese individuals, as compared to NG obese individuals, display enhanced levels of proteins participating in all the steps comprising the ERAD, thus suggesting that this pathway is hyperactivated in preadipocytes during the progression to IR/T2D in obese individuals. Notably, our studies also revealed increased mRNA levels of genes involved in protein retrotranslocation from the ER to the cytosol in preadipocytes from individuals with simple obesity, especially in those with T2D, as compared to lean individuals.</p><p>In all, our data on the UPR and ERAD strongly support the notion that metabolic disease in obesity is characterized by the perturbation of ER proteostasis network components in preadipocytes. They also support the link between unresolved ER stress and adipogenesis dysregulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Longo et al., 2016</xref>). Our studies using in vitro models mimicking different obesogenic inputs indicate that inflammation, adipocyte hypertrophy and, specially, hyperglycaemia/hyperinsulinemia (HGHI), as occurs in IR obese individuals, may contribute to alter ER proteostasis in preadipocytes. To be more specific, exposure to hyperglycaemic/hyperinsulinemic conditions induced ERAD hyperactivation, as well as BiP expression, in both OM preadipocytes from NG obese individuals and in SGBS preadipocytes. Intriguingly, HGHI-induced ERAD expression was accompanied by a concomitant increase in ubiquitinated proteins in preadipocytes and, in the case of SGBS cells, by a decrease in the activity of the cell machinery involved in misfolded/unfolded protein degradation, the proteasome. In this line are also our results on the decreased activity of the proteasome in OM preadipocytes from obese individuals with IR/T2D. These results suggest that the preadipocytes are unable to counteract the proteostatic stress occurring under IR/T2D conditions, and proteotoxicity may ensue. In agreement with these findings, we have reported the occurrence of proteotoxicity, that is, decreased activity of the proteasome and accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins, in in vitro differentiated preadipocytes and in mature adipocytes isolated from SC and OM fat of diet-induced obese mice as compared to lean animals, as well as in mature adipocytes isolated from IR <italic>vs.</italic> NG obese individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Díaz-Ruiz et al., 2015</xref>). In all, our studies strongly support the notion that dysregulated ERAD in preadipocytes represents a relevant pathological mechanism linked to the development of metabolic disease in obese individuals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). In this line, altered ERAD expression levels in NG OM preadipocytes and SGBS cells exposed to HGHI were accompanied by changes in adipogenic markers demonstrative of impaired adipocyte differentiation. These effects were reverted by pre-exposure of these cells to the ER stress-reducing agent, TUDCA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Zhang et al., 2018</xref>), which also reduced the enhanced expression levels of ERAD genes found in OM preadipocytes of IR obese individuals or, although to a lesser extent, in T2D OM preadipocytes. Together, these findings suggest that TUDCA may represent a potentially useful treatment for preadipocyte damage prevention in obesity, as it has been proposed for this bile acid in other ER stress-related pathologies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Kusaczuk, 2019</xref>).</p><p>In summary, our results unveil an important role for alternative splicing in SC preadipocyte differentiation thus paving the way for the development of novel therapeutic strategies to modulate adipose tissue expansion. Our studies on altered ER dynamics, that affect not only the UPR but also the ERAD pathway, in SC and OM preadipocytes are in line with our previous results in mature adipocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Díaz-Ruiz et al., 2015</xref>) and, in all, indicate that the maintenance of ER proteostasis in adipose tissue cells is key to ensure metabolic health in obesity.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Subjects (Cohort 1)</title><p>A total of 78 morbidly obese subjects (BMI &gt;40 kg/m<sup>2</sup>) undergoing bariatric surgery were recruited at the General and Digestive Surgery Unit and the Lipids and Atherosclerosis Unit of the Reina Sofía University Hospital (HURS; Córdoba, Spain).

Reduction and alkylation were done by addition of 2 mM 1,4-dithiothreitol (DTT) and 7 mM iodoacetamide (IAA), respectively, for 15 min at RT. Then, samples from two to three individuals per group and fat depot were pooled and used for two separate iTRAQ experiments (n = 5–6 subjects per group and fat depot). Protein samples were precipitated using 10% trichloroacetic acid (TCA), diluted in tetraethylammonium bromide (TEAB) with 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS) and quantified. Samples were diluted 1:2 with TEAB and digested with 2% trypsin. Tryptic peptides (240 μg per group and fat depot) were employed for proteomic analysis using 4-plex isobaric tags for iTRAQ according to the manufacturer’s instructions.

The MS system used was an Orbitrap XL (Thermo Scientific) equipped with a microESI ion source (Proxeon; Madrid, Spain) and coupled to an Agilent 1,200 series LC-system (Agilent Technologies; Madrid, Spain). The SCX-fractions were loaded onto a chromatographic system consisting of a C18 preconcentrating cartridge (Agilent Technologies) connected to a 15 cm long, 100 μm i.d.

The separation was performed at 0.4 μL/min in a 90 min acetonitrile gradient from 3% to 40% [solvent A: 0.1 % formic acid, solvent B: acetonitrile with 0.1 % formic acid]. The Orbitrap XL was operated in the positive ion mode with a spray voltage of 2 kV. The scan range for full scans was m/z 400–1800. The spectrometric analysis was performed in a data dependent mode, acquiring a full scan followed by 8 MS/MS scans of the four most intense signals detected in the MS scan. For each MS signal, two MS/MS spectra were acquired using higher energy collisional dissociation (HCD) and ion-trap-based collision-induced dissociation (CID) as fragmentation devices. The HCD spectra were used to measure the intensity of iTRAQ fragments and the CID spectra were used for database search and peptide identification. An exclusion time of 30 sec and a spectral count of 2 were included to avoid repetitive MS/MS analysis of the dominant MS signals.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Database search and protein identification</title><p>Peak lists were searched against the complete human proteome (UniProt release 2014_08, with 68049 proteins) using SEQUEST (Proteome Discoverer 1.3, ThermoFisher) as search engine.

Proteins showing quantification values within a fixed average ratio ( ± 1.5) and a coefficient of variation (CV) under 20% were considered for further statistical analysis. Specifically, the Perl module ‘Statistic R’ was used to calculate the average, the standard deviation (SD), the coefficient of variation (CV), and the fold change ratios for each protein between groups.

Pathway and upstream regulator analysis were performed using IPA (Ingenuity Pathways Analysis) software 49309495. Canonical pathway analysis identified the pathways from the IPA library of canonical pathways that were most significant to the data set. The significance of the association between the data set and the canonical pathway was measured in two ways: (1) A ratio of the number of proteins from the data set that mapped to the pathway divided by the total number of proteins that mapped to the canonical pathway displayed. (2) Fisher’s exact test was used to calculate a p-value determining the probability that the association between the proteins in the dataset and the canonical pathway was explained by chance alone, and p &lt; 0.05 was considered statistically significant.

All samples for each experiment were run in the same plate in triplicate and the average values were calculated.</p></sec><sec id="s4-18"><title>qPCR dynamic array</title><p>A qPCR dynamic array based on microfluidic technology for simultaneous determination of the expression of 45 transcripts in 36 samples (Fluidigm; San Francisco, CA) was employed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Del Río-Moreno et al., 2019</xref>). Specific primers for human transcripts including components of the major (n = 13) and minor spliceosome (n = 4), associated splicing factors (n = 28), and three housekeeping genes (<italic>ACTB</italic>, <italic>GAPDH</italic>, and <italic>HPRT</italic>) were specifically designed with the Primer3 software and StepOneTM Real-Time PCR System software v2.3 (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Preamplification, exonuclease treatment, and qPCR dynamic array based on microfluidic technology were implemented as recently reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Gahete et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Del Río-Moreno et al., 2019</xref>), following manufacturer’s instructions using the Biomark System and the Real-Time PCR Analysis Software (Fluidigm). The panel of splicing machinery components was selected on the basis of two main criteria: (1) the relevance of the given spliceosome components in the splicing process (such as the components of the spliceosome core), and (2) their demonstrated participation in the generation of splicing variants implicated in the pathophysiology of metabolic diseases (as is the case of the 28 splicing factors selected in this study) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Gahete et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Del Río-Moreno et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Briefly, following manufacturer’s instructions, 12.5 ng of cDNA of each sample were pre-amplified using 1 μL of all primers mix (500 nM) in a T100 Thermal cycler (BioRad, Hercules, CA), using the following program: (1) 2 min at 95 °C; (2) 15 sec at 94°C and 4 min at 60°C (14 cycles). Then, samples were treated with 2 μL of 4 U/μL Exonuclease I solution following the manufacturer’s instructions. Next, samples were diluted with 18 μL of TE Buffer, and 2.7 μL were mixed with 3 μL of EvaGreen Supermix and 0.3 μL of cDNA Binding Dye Sample Loading Reagent. Primers were diluted to 5 μM with 2 X Assay Loading Reagent. Control line fluid was charged in the chip and Prime script program was run into the IFC controller MX. Finally, 5 μL of each primer and 5 μL of each sample were pipetted into their respective inlets on the chip and the Load Mix script in the IFC controller software was run. Thereafter, the qPCR was run in the Biomark System following the thermal cycling program: (1) 9°C for 1 min; (2) 35 cycles of denaturing (95 °C for 5 s) and annealing/extension (60 °C for 20 s); and (3) a last cycle where final PCR products were subjected to graded temperature-dependent dissociation (60°C to 95°C, increasing 1°C/3 s). Data were processed with Real-Time PCR Analysis Software 3.0.</p><p>Finally, to control for variations in the efficiency of the retrotranscription reaction, mRNA copy numbers of the different transcripts analysed were adjusted by normalization factor (NF), calculated with the expression levels of the three housekeeping genes mentioned above using GeNorm 3.3 software. This selection was based on the stability of these housekeeping genes among the experimental groups to be compared, wherein the expression of these housekeeping genes was not significantly different among groups.</p></sec><sec id="s4-19"><title>Quantitative immunoblotting</title><p>Human preadipocytes isolated from SC and OM adipose tissue of NG, IR and T2D obese individuals were disrupted in BLC buffer containing 150 mM NaCl, 20 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.4, 1% Triton-X-100, 1 mM EDTA, and 1 µg/mL anti-protease cocktail CLAP (Chymostatin, Leupeptin, Antipain and Pepstatin A). Protein content was measured by Bradford assay and 30 mg of protein per sample were loaded into 4–20% precast SDS-PAGE gels (Bio-Rad) under denaturing conditions. SGBS cells were homogenized in SDS-DTT buffer containing 62.5 mM Tris-HCL pH 7.6, 2% SDS, 100 mM DTT, 20% Glycerol. Protein content was separated by 10% SDS-PAGE under denaturing conditions. In both cases, samples were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Bio-Rad). After Ponceau staining to ensure equal sample loading, membranes were blocked in Tris-buffer saline (TBS) consisting of 25 mM Tris, 150 mM NaCl with 0.05% Tween 20 (TTBS) containing 5% non-fat dry milk for 1 hr at RT. Blots were then incubated overnight at 4°C with the corresponding primary antibody (<bold><italic>Appendix 1—key resource table</italic></bold>). Immunoreactive bands were visualized using horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated secondary antibodies (<bold><italic>Appendix 1—key resource table</italic></bold>) and the enhanced chemiluminescence ECL Plus detection system. Quantification of band intensities was carried out on digital images of membrane samples provided by LAS4000 gel documentation system (GE Healthcare; Barcelona, Spain) using ImageJ software (1.50b, NIH, Bethesda, MA), and normalized with Ponceau density values as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Jimenez-Gomez et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Peinado et al., 2011</xref>). All comparative experiments were performed under identical conditions.</p></sec><sec id="s4-20"><title>Proteasome activity assay</title><p>The 26 S proteasome (ATP stimulated) and/or 20 S (SDS stimulated) activities were measured in primary human OM preadipocytes from NG, IR, and T2D obese individuals (cohort 1) and SGBS preadipocytes upon exposure to HGHI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Díaz-Ruiz et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Bunnell et al., 2008</xref>). Assays for proteasome activity were performed using Suc-LLVY-AFC product, which is proteolyzed by the chymotrypsin-like (ChT-L) active site of the proteasome forming a fluorogenic substrate (AFC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Keita et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Cells were washed with D-PBS and scraped from plates in BLC buffer without DTT, TX-100 or protease inhibitors because these compounds interfere with the assay. The reaction was conducted in 250 μL of activity assay buffer in a 96-well plate containing 50 μg/ml protein lysate in Proteasome buffer (20 mM Tris–HCl, pH 7.8, 1 mM EDTA, 0.5 mM DTT, 5 mM MgCl2, and 50 μM Suc-LLVY-AFC) plus 2 mM ATP or 0.02% SDS for the determination of the 26 S or 20 S proteasome, respectively. In order to confirm the specificity of the findings for proteasome activity, parallel reactions containing the proteasome inhibitor, MG-132 (25 μM), were run as controls. The reaction mixture was incubated for 3 hr at 37°C and the fluorescence of the released AMC product was kinetically followed each 10 min in a Flex Station three at an emission wavelength of 355 nm and an excitation wavelength of 460 nm. The background fluorescence values obtained by incubating the lysates with MG132 were subtracted from activity values. Results were analysed with the SoftMax Pro 2.2.1 and the values reported for proteasome peptidase activity are expressed as relative fluorescence arbitrary units/min/mg of total protein.</p></sec><sec id="s4-21"><title>Cell viability and cytotoxicity assays</title><p>Cell viability of SGBS cell cultures was assessed by the MTT assay. Briefly, cells were incubated for 2 h with 0.1 mg/ml of 3-(4,5-dimetililtiazol-2-ilo)–2,5-difeniltetrazol de bromuro (MTT), dissolved in D-PBS. Washing with D-PBS (1 mL) was followed by the addition of DMSO (1 mL) and gentle shaking for 10 min so that complete dissolution was achieved. Aliquots (200 μL) of the resulting solutions were transferred to 96-well plates and absorbance was recorded at 570 nm using a Flex Station 3. Results were analysed with the SoftMax Pro 2.2.1 and are presented as percentage of the control siRNA values.</p><p>Cytotoxicity of PRPF8-silencing in hADSCs was evaluated by Cytotoxicity Detection Kit Plus. The culture medium was aspirated and centrifugated at 3000 rpm for 10 min to obtain a cell free supernatant. Aliquots of media and warm reagent were mixed in a 96-well plate and absorbance was recorded using a microplate reader (Tecan Infinite 2000; Männedorf, Switzerland). Results were analysed with Magellan software 7.2 SP1.</p></sec><sec id="s4-22"><title>Measurement of cell proliferation rate</title><p>Cell counting in culture flasks was carried out to monitor growth rates of the preadipocytes in culture. At passage 3, cells were detached from the culture flasks and an aliquot was stained with trypan blue and cells were counted in a Neubauer chamber. Cell proliferation was calculated as the total number of live cells per initial seeding number (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Morten et al., 2016</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-23"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>For in vitro experiments, at least three replicates were obtained for each condition. Data are presented as mean ± standard error of the mean (S.E.M.) and statistical analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism 7. To determine the normality distribution of the samples, Shapiro-Wilk normality test was used. To determine significance, either unpaired t test for parametric data or Mann Whitney test for non-parametric data were employed for comparisons between two groups. For comparison of more than two groups either one-way ANOVA with Tukey’s multiple comparisons test for parametric data or Kruskal-Wallis with Dunn’s multiple comparisons test for non-parametric were used. A two-way ANOVA was used to identify significant differences between experimental conditions in the response to insulin or during differentiation. Values were considered significant at p &lt; 0.05. Statistical details and significance can be found in the figure legends.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec id="s5" sec-type="additional-information"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group

hypertrophied pre-adipocytes in humans with morbidly obese individuals with metabolic disease. Decreased expression of the core splicing factor PRP8 and also reduced proteasome activity are reported to contribute to the functional defects in pre-adipocytes. The study provides important new insight into mechanisms of metabolic disease, including diabetes.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Impaired mRNA splicing and proteostasis in preadipocytes in obesity-related metabolic disease&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 2 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and David James as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1 – The authors conclude that decreased PRP8 expression could explain functional impairment of hypertrophied preadipocytes in obesity. However, this appears to be based on correlation and seems to be specific of SC but not OM preadipocytes (Figure 2C) without a clear explanation. In addition, SC preadipocytes from lean subjects have a PRP8 expression comparable to T2D obese group (Figure 2E). It is unclear if the changes in PRP8 expression have functional consequences in these cells or if these changes are a cause or a consequence of impairment of SC preadipocytes. To clarify this point, the authors should investigate if PRP8 complementation is associated with normalized proliferation and/or differentiation potential of SC preadipocytes from obese TD2 patients.</p><p>It should also be noted that the acute inactivation of core splicing components (e.g PRP8) in SGBS cell line is expected to have a broad impact in gene expression and adipocyte function. To demonstrate that changes in PRP8 expression have a specific impact in preadipocyte fitness, authors should clarify if changes in the expression of PPARG or SREBF1 isoforms are specifically recapitulated in SC preadipocytes from obese TD2 patients. In addition, they should interrogate whether these changes are specifically normalized by recovering PRP8 expression.</p><p>2 – While the study focused on comparing the molecular alterations between obese NG and obese IR/T2D, the levels of the genes/proteins of interest in lean subjects need to be considered. In particular, Figure 2E showed the expression levels of PRPF8 in lean subjects were significantly lower than that in the NG obese people. This would impose a critical caveat for the siRNA silencing studies because reduced PRPF8 level could represent the lean SC preadipocyte. Please discuss the overall implications of the findings when data from lean subjects are considered.</p><p>3 – The authors report increased expression of components of the ERAD pathway in preadipocytes from obese TD2 patients. While this doesn't seem to be associated with a consistent increase in UPR response, the authors conclude that in cells obtained from this subgroup of patients there is an impairment in proteostasis. Further mechanistic studies have been performed in a completely independent model (SGBS cell lines) but have not been replicated in preadipocytes obtained from patients (that are the subject of this study). To validate the contribution of ERAD and proteolysis to the functional impairment of preadipocytes in obese patients, these experiments should be performed in preadipocytes obtained from patients. Is proteasome activity decreased in preadipocytes from obese TD2 patients? Is it normalized by chemical chaperones? Is proliferation and/or differentiation potential of SC preadipocytes from obese TD2 patients recovered by chemical chaperones? Does Bip play a central role in orchestrating this response in these cells?</p><p>4 – The rigor of data presentation: For the data presented, please show each individual value using the dot plot to let the readers see the data's distributions and ranges of variations. For in vitro studies, please indicate the numbers of technical replicates within a given experiment and the numbers of replicate studies. Please elaborate on how Western blots' data were quantified, including imaging quantification and normalization of loading.</p><p>5 – The authors report two mechanisms linked to dysfunction of adipocyte differentiation and function in obese subjects with IR or T2D (i.e., the spliceosome and the ERAD). Can the authors discuss and clarify whether each of these pathways plays an essential, complementary, or redundant role in the pathologies of adipocytes dysfunction in IR or T2D subjects? It would be informative to include an integrative model to present the two pathways and how they regulate adipocyte differentiation and function.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.65996.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1 – The authors conclude that decreased PRP8 expression could explain functional impairment of hypertrophied preadipocytes in obesity.

In fact, this prevented us from discussing whether <italic>PRPF8</italic>/PRP8 down-regulation was a cause or a consequence of preadipocyte dysfunction. Likewise, we were cautious when discussing the differences found between SC and OM preadipocytes and only suggested that inter-depot differences appeared to be cell autonomous (page 18, lines 429-432, in the original version of the manuscript). In this regard, we proposed that experiments in human primary preadipocytes with altered expression levels of selected splicing-related genes would be required to establish the impact of splicing on adipogenesis (page 18, lines 432-435, in the original version of the manuscript).</p><p>With this in mind, and given the comments offered by the Reviewing Editor, we have carried out new experiments using human preadipocytes obtained from obese subjects with T2D. To be more specific, SC preadipocytes from obese patients with T2D were transfected using a <italic>PRPF8</italic>-pcDNA3.1 expression vector to increase <italic>PRPF8</italic> content, as it is shown in the new Figure 4A that has been prepared for the revised version of the manuscript. To complement these data, we employed an identical strategy using SC preadipocytes from obese patients with IR. After transfection, both T2D and IR obese preadipocytes exhibited <italic>PRPF8</italic> expression levels comparable to those of SC preadipocytes from obese NG patients (new Figure 4A). <italic>PRPF8</italic> expression recovery upon <italic>PRPF8</italic>-pcDNA3.1 transfection increased the expression levels of several PPARG isoforms (<italic>PPARG-2</italic>, <italic>PPARG-3</italic>, <italic>PPARG-4</italic>, and γ<italic>ORF4</italic>) to control levels (i.e., SC preadipocytes in NG obesity), especially in SC preadipocytes from obese individuals with IR (new Figure 4C)<italic>.</italic> Similar results were observed for both total <italic>SREBF1</italic> and <italic>SREBF1</italic> isoform 1 (<italic>SREBF1</italic>-<italic>1</italic>) (Figure 4D). In all, these results indicate that the expression of <italic>PPARG</italic> and <italic>SREBF1</italic> could be recapitulated in SC preadipocytes from obese IR/T2D patients by <italic>PRPF8</italic> complementation. In line with these findings are our data from confocal microscopy demonstrating that <italic>PRPF8</italic> complementation by <italic>PRPF8</italic>-pcDNA3.1 expression increased total lipid content in SC preadipocytes from obese subjects with IR/T2D (new Figure 4B). To be more specific, our data show that <italic>PRPF8</italic>-pcDNA3.1 expression increased total lipid content in SC preadipocytes from obese subjects with IR/T2D by increasing lipid droplet size, while decreasing lipid droplet number (new Figure 4B).</p><p>Along with these studies, we also examined the effect of <italic>PRPF8</italic> silencing in SC preadipocytes from obese NG patients using a specific siRNA as a mean to mimic the down-regulation of this gene found in SC preadipocytes from obese subjects with IR/T2D. As shown in new Figures 4C and 4D, <italic>PRPF8</italic> down-regulation caused numerical decreases, that in most cases reached statistical significance, in the expression levels of both total <italic>PPARG</italic> and <italic>SREBF1</italic> and their isoforms as compared to mock-transfected SC preadipocytes from NG obese subjects. Notably, rescue experiments by transfection of silenced NG obese preadipocytes with the <italic>PRPF8</italic>-pcDNA3.1 expression vector showed restored expression of most of the genes tested (new Figures 4C and 4D). In accordance with these findings, SC preadipocytes from NG obese patients exhibited lower lipid content and changes in lipid droplet size and number when silenced for <italic>PRPF8</italic>, while these effects were restored upon <italic>PRPF8</italic> complementation (new Figure 4B).</p><p>Analysis of markers of lipid droplet biogenesis and growth (<italic>BSCL<sup>-</sup>2</italic>, <italic>CIDEB</italic>, <italic>CIDEC</italic>), showed similar trends to those observed for <italic>PPARG</italic> and <italic>SREBF1</italic> upon manipulation of <italic>PRPF8</italic> expression in SC preadipocytes from either NG or IR/T2D obese individuals (new Figures 4E-4G).</p><p>When viewed together, these results highlight the relevance of PRP8 in adipocyte differentiation and further support our initial proposal that impaired PRPF8 expression likely contributes to preadipocyte dysfunction and altered adipogenesis in SC fat in obese individuals with IR/T2D. These new results have been described in a new Results subsection “Analysis of PRPF8/PRP8 effects on human primary preadipocytes” in pages 13 and 14, and discussed in pages 21 and 22 in the new version of the manuscript.</p><p>According to our original data from qPCR array and RT-PCR studies of preadipocytes from the three groups of obese individuals (cohort 1; Figure 2—Figure supplements 1 and 2, respectively), not only <italic>PRPF8</italic> but other spliceosome components and splicing factors were decreased in SC preadipocytes from IR/T2D <italic>vs</italic>. NG obese individuals, suggesting that they could be also important for adipocyte differentiation. In fact, recovering <italic>PRPF8</italic>/PRP8 expression in SC preadipocytes from obese individuals with IR/T2D normalized most but not all the changes observed in these cells as compared to their NG counterparts (new Figure 4). To test this hypothesis, and in line with the comment offered by the Reviewing Editor as to whether the changes are normalized by recovering <italic>PRPF8</italic> expression, we carried out additional experiments targeting another component of the major spliceosome, the SF3B complex, and a splicing factor, SFPQ. These experiments were carried out in SGBS preadipocytes, given the limitations imposed by the low number of primary cells that can be obtained from bariatric surgery, since this procedure is performed in our hospital via laparoscopy. In addition, as for other cell types, the efficiency of transfection for expression manipulation is higher in cell lines than in primary cells (especially in preadipocytes from IR/T2D obese individuals; new Figure 4A). We also restricted our studies to adipocyte differentiation given that this was the process that we found dysregulated after <italic>PRPF8</italic>/PRP8 overexpression and/or silencing. We sincerely hope that the Reviewing Editor and the Reviewers may understand our decisions.</p><p>Specifically, since SC preadipocytes from IR/T2D obese individuals showed diminished <italic>SF3B1 tv1</italic> expression levels (Figure 2—Figure supplements 1 and 2), we exposed SGBS cells to pladienolide-B, which binds to the SF3B complex and inhibits pre-mRNA splicing via targeting splicing factor SF3B1 (Cretu <italic>et al.</italic>, 2018, doi: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.molcel.2018.03.011; Aouida <italic>et al.</italic>, 2016, doi: 10.1016/j.biopen.2016.02.001). Notably, we found that exposure to pladienolide-B also impaired lipid accumulation in SGBS cells (new Figure 3—Figure supplement 3A). This concurred with, among other changes, diminished expression levels of <italic>PPARG-1</italic>, <italic>PPARG-2</italic>, and both total <italic>SREBF1</italic> and <italic>SREBF1-1</italic>, while <italic>PPARG-4</italic> and <italic>BSCL2-2/3</italic> expression increased (new Figure 3—Figure supplements 3B and 3C).</p><p>These findings support the involvement of the SF3B complex/SF3B1 in adipocyte differentiation and, together with our previous data on <italic>PRPF8</italic>/PRP8, suggest a prominent role for the major spliceosome in adipogenesis, which is consistent with the observation that this complex is responsible for splicing 99.5% of all introns in the human genome (Turunen <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013; doi: 10.1002/wrna.1141). Notably, although both <italic>PRPF8</italic>/PRP8 silencing and pladienolide-B treatment impaired lipid accumulation in differentiating SGBS adipocytes, their effects on gene expression levels were similar but not identical (i.e., <italic>PPARG-4</italic>, <italic>BSCL<sup>-</sup>2</italic>, <italic>CIDEB-1</italic>, <italic>CIDEC-5</italic>) (new Figures 4C-4G and Figure 3—Figure supplements 3B and 3C), indicating that the relative contribution of each component of the spliceosome core to adipocyte differentiation may differ, at least partially. This would be in accordance with previous evidence showing that depleting the cellular abundance of individual spliceosomal proteins modulates individual splice site usage (Dvinge <italic>et al.</italic>, 2019; doi: 10.1101/gr.246678.118).</p><p>To further explore the relative contribution of the components of the splicing machinery to adipocyte differentiation, we down-regulated the protein content of the splicing factor, SFPQ, by siRNA treatment of SGBS cells; rescue experiments using an expression vector coding for <italic>SFPQ</italic> were also carried out. As shown in new Figure 3—Figure supplements 3D-3G, either down-regulation or overexpression of <italic>SFPQ</italic> caused significant changes in the expression of only a few genes, and the combination of both strategies tended to restore the expression values found in control cells. To be more specific, <italic>SFPQ</italic> overexpression slightly reduced <italic>CIDEB1</italic> expression, while <italic>SFPQ</italic> silencing increased total <italic>SREBF1</italic> and <italic>SREBF1-1</italic> and decreased <italic>PPARG-4</italic> (new Figure 3—Figure supplements 3F-3G). Surprisingly, silenced SGBS cells exhibited reduced lipid content, as measured by the total number of lipid droplets per cell, mostly due to the increase in the number of lipid droplets (2.4-fold), while lipid droplet size decreased as compared with control cells (2.7-fold) (new Figure 3—Figure supplement 3E). A recent publication has reported “<italic>fatty acid biosynthetic process</italic>” as one of the Gene Ontology (GO) terms of the genes that are up-regulated upon loss of <italic>SFPQ</italic> expression (Gordon <italic>et al.</italic>, 2021; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-021-22098-z). This could be associated with the up-regulation of <italic>SREBF1</italic> in SGBS cells silenced for <italic>SFPQ</italic>, given the involvement of SREBP1 in adipocyte lipogenesis through its stimulatory effects on fatty acid production (Crewe <italic>et al.</italic>, 2019; doi: 10.1172/jci.insight.129397). The lack or small effect of <italic>SFPQ</italic> silencing on other genes relevant for adipocyte differentiation and/or lipid droplet biogenesis and growth may account for the increase in small lipid droplets and the decrease in total lipid content observed in <italic>SFPQ</italic>-silenced SGBS cells.</p><p>These new experiments and results have been described and discussed where appropriate in the new version of the manuscript (page 12, and page 22, respectively).</p><p>We sincerely hope that the new experiments that have been carried out for the revised version of the manuscript in both primary and SGBS preadipocytes, together with our previous data, will help convince the Reviewing Editor and the Reviewers that decreased <italic>PRPF8</italic>/PRP8 expression, as occurs in SC preadipocytes of IR/T2D <italic>vs.</italic> NG obese subjects, has specific consequences on adipocyte differentiation, likely by altering the function of the major spliceosome. We thank the Reviewers and the Reviewing Editor for their comments, which have been very helpful to reinforce our original proposal on the relevance of <italic>PRPF8</italic>/PRP8 and, for that matter, of the major spliceosome, as well as to show the contribution of other splicing components, such as SF3B complex and SFPQ, to adipocyte differentiation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2 – While the study focused on comparing the molecular alterations between obese NG and obese IR/T2D, the levels of the genes/proteins of interest in lean subjects need to be considered. In particular, Figure 2E showed the expression levels of PRPF8 in lean subjects were significantly lower than that in the NG obese people. This would impose a critical caveat for the siRNA silencing studies because reduced PRPF8 level could represent the lean SC preadipocyte. Please discuss the overall implications of the findings when data from lean subjects are considered.</p></disp-quote><p>We concur with the Reviewing Editor that siRNA studies to reduce <italic>PRPF8</italic> levels may seem paradoxical in the face of the reduced <italic>PRPF8</italic> mRNA content observed in lean subjects as compared to that found in the NG obese people. As shown in the original Figure 2 and the new Figure supplement 6 that has been prepared to address Minor Comment 4, not only <italic>PRPF8</italic> but also other component of the major spliceosome, <italic>SF3B1 tv1</italic>, and the splicing factors, <italic>CELF1</italic> and <italic>SNW1</italic>, showed significantly lower expression levels in lean SC preadipocytes than in their counterparts from obese individuals of cohort 2 (i.e., individuals with simple obesity, BMI 30-35 kg/m<sup>2</sup>). These results indicate that, as compared with lean individuals, NG simple obesity involves the up-regulation of splicing-related genes in SC preadipocytes, which might be required to sustain the increase in adipocytes that has been reported to be associated with healthy adipose tissue expansion (reviewed by Vishvanath and Gupta, 2019; https://doi.org/10.1172/JCI129191), given the role of splicing in shaping cell identity (Dvinge, 2018; https://doi.org/10.1002/1873-3468.13119).</p><p>Interestingly, our original studies on <italic>PRPF8</italic>/PRP8 and other splicing-related genes together with our new data demonstrate that, either in simple obesity (Figure 2C, and new Figure 2—Figure supplement 3; cohort 2) or morbid obesity (Figure 2B, and Figure 2—Figure supplements 1 and 2; cohort 1), IR/T2D is accompanied by diminished expression levels of these genes as compared to NG obesity. Given that both simple and morbidly obese NG and IR/T2D groups were matched by BMI, these findings suggest that the adaptive response of SC preadipocytes to adipose tissue expansion (i.e., increased expression of splicing-related genes), is lost in the transition from NG to IR/T2D in both obese and extremely obese individuals. There is only one exception to this rule, the minor spliceosome component, <italic>RNU12</italic>, whose levels were higher in IR/T2D than in NG obesity (simple or morbid) (original Figure supplements 4 and 5, cohort 1; and new Figure 2—Figure supplement 3B, cohort 2). These results might be related to the differences existing between the minor and major spliceosome (Akinyi and Frielander, 2021; doi: 10.3389/fgene.2021.700744), but since the former is less known than the latter and there is not much information on the specific role played by <italic>RNU12</italic>, in particular in adipocytes, we modestly believe that there is no evidence enough to discuss these findings.</p><p>The new results have been depicted in the revised version of the manuscript (pages 8 and 9, and page 19 and 20, respectively). In all, our findings support the notion that SC preadipocyte dysfunction and IR/T2D occur when the expression levels of important components of the splicing machinery remain below (or, occasionally, above) those needed to respond to the requirements imposed by the obesogenic environment. With all due respect, we modestly believe that, in this scenario, our silencing studies of <italic>PRPF8</italic> are justified because they mimic the reductions in gene expression observed under conditions of IR/T2D <italic>vs</italic>. NG in both simple and severe obesity. Our novel data on <italic>SFPQ</italic> silencing and SF3B inactivation further support the notion that decreasing the splicing potential of adipocyte precursors impairs adipogenesis.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3 – The authors report increased expression of components of the ERAD pathway in preadipocytes from obese TD2 patients. While this doesn't seem to be associated with a consistent increase in UPR response, the authors conclude that in cells obtained from this subgroup of patients there is an impairment in proteostasis. Further mechanistic studies have been performed in a completely independent model (SGBS cell lines) but have not been replicated in preadipocytes obtained from patients (that are the subject of this study). To validate the contribution of ERAD and proteolysis to the functional impairment of preadipocytes in obese patients, these experiments should be performed in preadipocytes obtained from patients. Is proteasome activity decreased in preadipocytes from obese TD2 patients? Is it normalized by chemical chaperones? Is proliferation and/or differentiation potential of SC preadipocytes from obese TD2 patients recovered by chemical chaperones? Does Bip play a central role in orchestrating this response in these cells?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the Reviewing Editor and the Reviewers for their insightful recommendations. As for the splicing machinery, we performed novel experiments in primary preadipocytes from NG, IR, and T2D obese individuals, in this case preadipocytes isolated from omental fat, to validate the contribution of ERAD and proteostasis to the functional impairment of preadipocytes in obese individuals. Regarding OM preadipocytes from NG obese individuals, we took advantage of the knowledge gained from SGBS cells in the original version of the manuscript (original Figures 5I-5K) and employed three experimental groups: (1) exposure to HGHI conditions, (2) to TUDCA, or (3) to the combination of both (new Figure 7). We observed that, as for SGBS cells, exposure of OM preadipocytes from NG obese individuals to HGHI increased the expression levels of genes involved in all ERAD steps (recognition, retrotranslocation, ubiquitination, and targeting to the proteasome) in these cells (new Figures 7A-D). On the other hand, TUDCA, which did not alter essentially the expression of ERAD genes when administered alone, reduced HGHI-induced gene expression increases to control levels (i.e., OM preadipocytes from NG obese individuals exposed to medium alone) (new Figures 7A-D). As for SGBS cells, HGHI increased the accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins in OM preadipocytes from NG obese individuals, and only a slight, not significant decrease in ubiquitin-conjugated proteins was observed when HGHI was combined with TUDCA (new Figure 7E). Notably, the activity of the 26S proteasome remained unchanged in all the experimental conditions tested (new Figure 7F). Microscopic analysis of NG OM preadipocytes under the different experimental settings demonstrated an inhibitory effect of HGHI on lipid accumulation, that was reverted by TUDCA (new Figure 7G). In accordance with these results are also our new data on mRNA levels of adipogenic genes in NG OM preadipocytes exposed to HGHI alone or in combination with TUDCA (new Figures 7H and 7I).</p><p>In clear contrast, and as the Editor correctly anticipated, our new experiments demonstrate that, as compared to their NG counterparts, proteasome activity is decreased in OM preadipocytes from both IR and T2D obese individuals, who also showed increased levels of ubiquitin-conjugated proteins (new Figures 7E and 7F). Interestingly, TUDCA reverted both effects in OM preadipocytes from IR obese patients but not in T2D preadipocytes (new Figures 7E and 7F). TUDCA was also able to increase the expression of markers of differentiation in preadipocytes from IR and, to a lower extent, also from T2D obese individuals (new Figures 7H and 7I). In fact, this chaperone was able to increase the lipid content of OM preadipocytes of IR and T2D obese subjects to the levels found in OM preadipocytes of NG obese subjects, though TUDCA-treated T2D OM preadipocytes exhibited low LD numbers (new Figure 7G). Together, these results suggest that preadipocyte proteostasis is more severely compromised in OM fat of T2D than in IR obese individuals and that chemical chaperones may improve adipogenesis specially in the latter.</p><p>These new data have been depicted in the revised version of the manuscript and discussed where appropriate (pages 17-19, and pages 25 and 26).</p><p>Finally, due to the high number of cells employed for the experiments depicted above, and the limitations imposed by the number of IR and T2D patients available with biochemical and anthropometric parameters comparable to those employed for the original version of the manuscript, we were only able to carry out overexpression experiments of BiP in primary OM preadipocytes from NG obese patients. These samples were employed for measurement of ubiquitinated proteins as a readout of cell proteostasis. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref>, BiP overexpression highly increased the amount of ubiquitinated proteins in NG preadipocytes, which is consistent with our previous results in SGBS cells showing that pCMV-BiP expression caused an imbalance in both ERAD and adipogenesis (original Figure supplement 8; new Figure 7—Figure supplement 3). In accordance with this notion are our results showing increased BiP levels in NG preadipocytes exposed to HGHI as well as in IR and T2D preadipocytes as compared to control NG preadipocytes (new Figure 7A), which is consistent with the increases observed in the expression of ERAD genes and ubiquitinated proteins in these groups (Figure 6). TUDCA did not prevent the response to pCMV-BiP transfection, which might be linked to the strong effect caused by BiP overexpression on the accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins (6-fold increase <italic>vs</italic>. mock transfected cells; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref>).</p><fig id="sa2fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Representative dot-blot and protein quantification of ubiquitin-conjugated proteins in OM preadipocytes from NG obese individuals in control conditions (control, white), overexpressing BiP (pCMV-BIP, black), exposed 14 h to 0.</title><p>5 mg/mL TUDCA (TUDCA, grey), or to a combination of both (TUDCA+pCMV-BIP, white with black dots) (6-7 replicate studies, 1 technical replicate each). <bold>**</bold>P&lt;0.01 <italic>vs.</italic> control; <bold><sup>###</sup></bold>P&lt;0.001 <italic>vs.</italic> pCMV-BIP; <bold><sup>$</sup></bold>P&lt;0.05 <italic>vs.</italic> TUDCA.

In this regard, we and other authors have shown that both actin and other common reference standards (tubulin, GAPDH) exhibit significant intra-group variations in proteomic studies of adipose tissue (Peinado <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010, doi: 10.1002/pmic.201000350; Diaz-Ruiz <italic>et al.</italic>, 2014, doi: 10.1089/ars.2014.5939; Guzman-Ruiz <italic>et al.</italic>, 2020, doi: 10.1096/fj.201902703R), which prevented us from using these markers as standard proteins for further quantitative immunoblotting analyses. Indeed, immunoblotting using antibodies against b-actin, tubulin, or GADPH does not always give consistent results when using protein extracts from adipose tissue. We apologize if the information provided was not clear enough for understanding the procedure employed for Western blots' data quantification.
