However, NREM sleep is heterogeneous, varying in duration, depth, and spatially across the cortex. While these NREM sleep features are thought to be largely independently regulated, there is also evidence that they are mechanistically coupled. To investigate how cortical NREM sleep features are controlled, we examined the astrocytic network, comprising a cortex-wide syncytium that influences population-level neuronal activity. We quantified endogenous astrocyte activity in mice over natural sleep and wake, then manipulated specific astrocytic G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling pathways in vivo. We find that astrocytic Gi- and Gq-coupled GPCR signaling separately control NREM sleep depth and duration, respectively, and that astrocytic signaling causes differential changes in local and remote cortex. These data support a model in which the cortical astrocyte network serves as a hub for regulating distinct NREM sleep features.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Sleep has many roles, from strengthening new memories to regulating mood and appetite. While we might instinctively think of sleep as a uniform state of reduced brain activity, the reality is more complex. First, over the course of the night, we cycle between a number of different sleep stages, which reflect different levels of sleep depth. Second, the amount of sleep depth is not necessarily even across the brain but can vary between regions.</p><p>These sleep stages consist of either rapid eye movement (REM) sleep or non-REM (NREM) sleep. REM sleep is when most dreaming occurs, whereas NREM sleep is particularly important for learning and memory and can vary in duration and depth. During NREM sleep, large groups of neurons synchronize their firing to create rhythmic waves of activity known as slow waves. The more synchronous the activity, the deeper the sleep.</p><p>Vaidyanathan et al. now show that brain cells called astrocytes help regulate NREM sleep. Astrocytes are not neurons but belong to a group of specialized cells called glia. They are the largest glia cell type in the brain and display an array of proteins on their surfaces called G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). These enable them to sense sleep-wake signals from other parts of the brain and to generate their own signals. In fact, each astrocyte can communicate with thousands of neurons at once. They are therefore well-poised to coordinate brain activity during NREM sleep.</p><p>Using innovative tools, Vaidyanathan et al. visualized astrocyte activity in mice as the animals woke up or fell asleep. The results showed that astrocytes change their activity just before each sleep–wake transition. They also revealed that astrocytes control both the depth and duration of NREM sleep via two different types of GPCR signals. Increasing one of these signals (Gi-GPCR) made the mice sleep more deeply but did not change sleep duration. Decreasing the other (Gq-GPCR) made the mice sleep for longer but did not affect sleep depth.</p><p>Sleep problems affect many people at some point in their lives, and often co-exist with other conditions such as mental health disorders. Understanding how the brain regulates different features of sleep could help us develop better – and perhaps more specific – treatments for sleep disorders. The current study suggests that manipulating GPCRs on astrocytes might increase sleep depth, for example. But before work to test this idea can begin, we must first determine whether findings from sleeping mice also apply to people.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>sleep</kwd><kwd>astrocytes</kwd><kwd>slow-wave activity</kwd><kwd>cortex</kwd><kwd>two-photon imaging</kwd><kwd>chemogenetics</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01NS099254</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Poskanzer</surname><given-names>Kira E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01MH121446</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Poskanzer</surname><given-names>Kira E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R21DA048497</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Poskanzer</surname><given-names>Kira E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CAREER 1942360</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Poskanzer</surname><given-names>Kira E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Genentech Fellowship, UCSF</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Vaidyanathan</surname><given-names>Trisha V</given-names></name><name><surname>Reitman</surname><given-names>Michael E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Cortical astrocytes play key roles in NREM sleep by regulating sleep depth and duration through separate GPCR pathways, and differentially control neuronal slow-wave activity in local and remote cortical circuits.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Sleep is characterized by distinct electrophysiological features that reflect the rhythmic activity of large populations of neurons. One phase of sleep—non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep—is critical for several important functions including memory consolidation/destabilization and synaptic homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Klinzing et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Genzel et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Kim et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib117">Tononi and Cirelli, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Diekelmann and Born, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib116">Tononi and Cirelli, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib118">Tononi and Cirelli, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Ji and Wilson, 2007</xref>). These functions are thought to require slow-wave activity (SWA), the distinct oscillatory pattern of neural activity in the cortex that occurs during NREM sleep and differentiates it from the relatively desynchronized activity during wakefulness and REM sleep. However, neural activity during NREM sleep is not uniform over the course of sleep, but varies in duration and depth (as measured by SWA intensity). Past work has demonstrated that NREM sleep duration and depth can be independently controlled (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Dijk and Beersma, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Patrick and Gilbert, 1896</xref>). Indeed, the circuit mechanisms known to underlie sleep depth and duration are largely independent from each other and operate on very different time-scales: sleep duration is mediated by subcortical nuclei that receive direct input from circadian centers and drive sleep/wake transitions through release of neuromodulatory signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Holst and Landolt, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Saper and Fuller, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Lee and Dan, 2012</xref>). On the other hand, SWA intensity is largely regulated by cortical and thalamocortical circuits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Chen et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Steriade et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Lemieux et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib122">Volgushev et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Steriade and Timofeev, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Sheroziya and Timofeev, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Amzica and Steriade, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Sanchez-Vives and McCormick, 2000</xref>). While these two physiological measures of sleep have been mostly described in non-overlapping mechanistic terms, there is also physiological evidence that sleep depth and duration can be coupled. For example, cortical calcium (Ca<sup>2+</sup>) signaling can act on a millisecond time-scale to modulate cortical synchrony during SWA while also engaging longer term signaling cascades that regulate the sleep/wake cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Ode et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib115">Tatsuki et al., 2016</xref>). Thus, the extent to which the neural mechanisms underlying sleep depth and duration are linked remains unclear.</p><p>The cortex—where mammalian sleep is most often measured—is a brain region where neural mechanisms underlying sleep duration and sleep depth coincide: many neuromodulatory nuclei associated with sleep/wake transitions send direct projections to the cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Björklund and Lindvall, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib125">Woolf, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Loughlin et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Panula et al., 1989</xref>), and the cortex plays an instrumental role in generating and propagating SWA during sleep (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib122">Volgushev et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Sanchez-Vives and McCormick, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Niethard et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">Stroh et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Luczak et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Massimini et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Krone, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Sanchez-Vives and Mattia, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Lemieux et al., 2014</xref>). Further, cortical SWA intensity can be locally regulated, leading to heterogeneity of SWA across cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Huber et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Funk et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Siclari and Tononi, 2017</xref>). However, how the cortex integrates separate regulatory signals to orchestrate activity across sleep and wake is unknown. In untangling sleep mechanisms, both in cortex and throughout the brain, the historical focus has almost exclusively been on neurons and neuronal circuits. Yet astrocytes—the largest class of non-neuronal brain cells—are also situated to play critical roles in sleep regulation within the cortex. Astrocytes tile the cortex, can participate in bidirectional communication with thousands of neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Halassa et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Allen and Barres, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Bushong et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bazargani and Attwell, 2016</xref>), exhibit morphological and transcriptional changes during sleep (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bellesi et al., 2015</xref>), and regulate SWA under anesthesia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib112">Szabó et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Poskanzer and Yuste, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Durkee et al., 2019</xref>). Further, multiple canonical astrocytic functions are also associated with sleep/wake regulation, including regulation of extracellular glutamate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Poskanzer and Yuste, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Poskanzer and Yuste, 2011</xref>), extracellular ion dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Ding et al., 2016</xref>), release of neurotransmitters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Halassa et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Papouin et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Fellin et al., 2009</xref>), and metabolic regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Petit and Magistretti, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bellesi et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">DiNuzzo and Nedergaard, 2017</xref>).</p><p>Astrocyte physiology is primarily measured via intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup>dynamics, which vary widely in size, shape, and location, and can propagate within or even between cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib123">Wang et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Khakh and McCarthy, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Shigetomi et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Shigetomi et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Guerra-Gomes et al., 2017</xref>). Because imaging complex astrocyte Ca<sup>2+</sup> activity in vivo is relatively new, it remains unknown whether these diverse astrocytic Ca<sup>2+</sup> dynamics map onto different circuit functions. However, the potential of astrocytes to influence large populations of cortical neurons across different time-scales is significant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">Stobart et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Lind et al., 2013</xref>). The majority of astrocyte Ca<sup>2+</sup> activity is thought to result from upstream activation of G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Durkee et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Di Castro et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Agulhon et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Kofuji and Araque, 2021</xref>). Importantly, many astrocytic GPCRs are activated by neuromodulators, including those associated with sleep/wake regulation, such as norepinephrine, acetylcholine, and histamine. Since GPCRs regulate a diverse array of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent intracellular signals on many different time-scales (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Grundmann and Kostenis, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Kholodenko et al., 2010</xref>), they are prime candidates for differentially regulating individual features of NREM sleep, such as duration and depth. A downstream target of GPCRs, the inositol triphosphate type two receptor (IP<sub>3</sub>R2), has been recently shown to be involved in sleep regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Bojarskaite et al., 2020</xref>). In astrocytes, both Gi- and Gq-coupled GPCRs activate IP<sub>3</sub>R2s and lead to increases in intracellular Ca<sup>2+ </sup>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Durkee et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Mariotti et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Nagai et al., 2019</xref>), while also engaging separate signaling cascades. Despite this, scant attention has been paid to whether the activation of different astrocytic GPCRs, and resulting Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals, have differential effects on the surrounding neural circuit. Indeed, GPCR signaling in astrocytes may underlie mechanisms by which astrocytes perform multiple, parallel functions in the neural circuit.</p><p>Here, we leveraged a recently developed image analysis tool that captures the spatiotemporal complexity of astrocyte Ca<sup>2+</sup> dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib123">Wang et al., 2019</xref>) and astrocyte-specific chemogenetics to investigate the mechanisms by which cortical astrocytes both link and independently regulate different features of NREM sleep via GPCR signaling. To do this, we carried out in vivo two-photon (2P) imaging of astrocyte Ca<sup>2+</sup> while recording electrophysiological sleep rhythms to examine astrocyte Ca<sup>2+</sup> changes across natural sleep and wake. We find that endogenous Ca<sup>2+</sup> activity is inversely correlated with SWA and exhibits bidirectional changes prior to sleep-wake transitions. Using chemogenetics to selectively manipulate astrocytic Gi- and Gq-GPCR pathways, we demonstrate that astrocytes actively regulate both NREM sleep duration and depth, via separate GPCR signaling pathways: astrocytic Gi-induced Ca<sup>2+</sup> is sufficient to increase SWA (sleep depth), while sleep-wake transitions (sleep duration) is dependent on Gq-GPCRs. We demonstrate a role for astrocytes in both local and cortex-wide sleep regulation; manipulating astrocytic Ca<sup>2+</sup> in primary visual cortex (V1) alters not only local SWA, but also affects SWA in contralateral frontal cortex (FC). Further, we find that while local changes in SWA arise from greater changes in delta waves, remote SWA effects in FC are due to increases in slow oscillations. Since these two slow waves underlie different functions, our data support the concept that astrocytes exert different effects on neuronal populations depending on both the type of GPCR activated <italic>and</italic> their localization within cortical circuits. Together, our data support a role for the cortical astrocytic network as a hub for the regulation of sleep depth and duration across cortex.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Accurate detection of astrocyte Ca<sup>2+</sup> events in vivo across sleep and wake</title><p>To study the role of astrocytes in sleep regulation, we conducted 2P imaging of astrocyte Ca<sup>2+</sup> dynamics as animals naturally transitioned between sleep and wake states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Niethard et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Seibt et al., 2017</xref>).

We separated wake by locomotion to quantify Ca<sup>2+</sup> dynamics independently from large Ca<sup>2+</sup> bursts that occur with locomotion onset (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib123">Wang et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Paukert et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Nimmerjahn et al., 2009</xref>). As predicted by the negative correlation between event rate and SWA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>), we found that Ca<sup>2+</sup> event rate was highest during locomotory wake, lower during stationary wake, and lowest during sleep (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). To confirm, we compared SWA in the three behavioral states and found an inverse relationship of Ca<sup>2+</sup> event rate, namely SWA was highest during sleep, lower during stationary wake, and lowest during locomotory wake (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). These findings are supported by recent work demonstrating the same pattern of Ca<sup>2+</sup> activity across similar behavioral states, using an ROI-based image analysis approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Bojarskaite et al., 2020</xref>), confirming that our event-based image analysis can generate comparable results when the same metrics are quantified. Together, these data demonstrate that changes in Ca<sup>2+</sup> event frequency co-occur with major changes in behavioral state, consistent with levels of SWA.</p><p>To explore whether each behavioral state can be characterized by the types of astrocytic Ca<sup>2+</sup> events that occur during these states, we first compared the events' size, duration, and amplitude. As predicted by the large, synchronous bursts observed during locomotion, we found locomotory wake Ca<sup>2+</sup> events were larger in size and duration than events observed in the other two states. However, when we controlled for locomotion we did not find differences in size, duration, or amplitude of events between sleep and stationary wake when these features were compared individually (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). However, astrocyte events have many other features beyond size, duration, and amplitude, such as event perimeter or propagation. Because of this spatiotemporal complexity, we next used a dimensionality reduction approach, implementing principal component analysis to explore whether astrocyte Ca<sup>2+</sup> events differed among behavioral states. This approach allowed us to incorporate 20 different event features calculated by AQuA. We found that the first three principal components (PCs) represented spatial-, temporal-, and amplitude-related features respectively. We then focused on the five PCs that explained the most variance in the imaging data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>) and compared them among the three behavioral states. While the largest differences in each PC were between locomotory wake and the other two states, we also found significant differences between sleep and stationary wake in all five PCs examined (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Together, this analysis demonstrates that while no state-specific differences are observed by comparisons of individual event features, there are unique spatial, temporal, and amplitude signatures of sleep-specific astrocyte Ca<sup>2+</sup> events when multiple features are incorporated.</p><p>We next examined the relationship between astrocyte Ca<sup>2+</sup> event frequency and SWA within stationary behavioral states and found, similar to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, a negative correlation between Ca<sup>2+</sup> frequency and SWA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>). The strong association found between Ca<sup>2+</sup> frequency and SWA during sleep, namely high Ca<sup>2+</sup> activity during sleep periods of low SWA and vice versa, is suggestive of a possible role of astrocytic Ca<sup>2+</sup> specifically in sleep depth. Lastly, we explored the role of IP<sub>3</sub>R2 in the relationship between astrocyte Ca<sup>2+</sup> activity and SWA since IP<sub>3</sub>R2s are enriched in astrocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib127">Zhang et al., 2014</xref>), underlie a significant fraction of astrocytic Ca<sup>2+</sup> dynamics through Ca<sup>2+</sup> release from intracellular stores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Beck et al., 2004</xref>), and IP<sub>3</sub>R2 KO mice show a total decrease in SWA during NREM sleep (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Bojarskaite et al., 2020</xref>). To test whether the inverse relationship of astrocyte Ca<sup>2+</sup> and SWA is dependent on IP<sub>3</sub>R2s, we imaged astrocyte Ca<sup>2+</sup> dynamics over natural sleep and wake in IP<sub>3</sub>R2 KO mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Petravicz et al., 2008</xref>). Similar to previous work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Srinivasan et al., 2015</xref>), we noted a reduction, but not complete abolishment, of Ca<sup>2+</sup> events in IP<sub>3</sub>R2 KO mice. In IP<sub>3</sub>R2 KO mice, Ca<sup>2+</sup> event rate and SWA were negatively correlated, but the correlation was decreased compared to controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref>), suggesting the astrocyte-SWA relationship is at least partially dependent on the IP<sub>3</sub>R2. The change in correlation between control and IP<sub>3</sub>R2 KO was most dramatic in sleep, implicating IP<sub>3</sub>R2-dependent astrocytic Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling in the regulation of SWA intensity in the sleep state.

We next calculated Ca<sup>2+</sup> event-triggered averages of SWA, separated by behavioral state. Because the majority of locomotory wake Ca<sup>2+</sup> events were in bursts tied to locomotion onset, we focused on sleep and stationary wake states. We found a pattern in which Ca<sup>2+</sup> events were preceded by decreases in SWA and followed by increases in SWA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, left).

Specifically, we speculate that astrocytes may be associated with a homeostatic process that increases SWA in response to a transient decrease in SWA. Although we cannot determine this from the data shown here, several lines of evidence support this hypothesis: astrocytes exhibit Ca<sup>2+</sup> increases in response to many neuromodulators associated with decreased low-frequency power (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Ding et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Khan et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib114">Takata et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Shelton and McCarthy, 2000</xref>) and cortical astrocytes have the ability to increase low-frequency power (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib112">Szabó et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Poskanzer and Yuste, 2016</xref>).

Thus, although the total duration of sleep did not change, the sleep was characterized by higher SWA, or greater sleep depth. Together, these data demonstrate that regulation of SWA and sleep duration can be separated, and that astrocyte Ca<sup>2+</sup>, through Gi-GPCR activation, is sufficient to increase SWA during sleep. We hypothesized that astrocytes were part of a homeostatic mechanism regulating SWA, where in response to decreases in SWA, astrocyte Ca<sup>2+</sup> causes an increase in SWA.

This negative result was expected by this analysis, because delta waves and slow oscillations were identified using amplitude percentile thresholds (see Materials and methods) that were set for each individual recording. However, when quantifying the amplitude of these waveforms, we noted increases in the mean amplitude, particularly for delta waves (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F,I</xref>). Indeed, by plotting peak vs. trough amplitude, we observed a clear change in delta waves after CNO, resulting in higher peak and lower trough amplitudes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>). This change was smaller in the slow oscillation waveforms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4J</xref>). Similarly, we quantified the change in total peak – trough amplitude after CNO administration. While we saw a significant increase in size for delta waves (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H</xref>) and slow oscillations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4K</xref>) compared to saline controls in the same animal, the change in delta waves was significantly higher than that for slow oscillations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4L</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). Together, these data demonstrate that astrocyte Ca<sup>2+</sup>, through Gi-GPCR signaling, preferentially increases SWA by altering delta wave amplitude. Delta waves are more local than slow oscillations and are thought to be generated within the cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Genzel et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Siclari and Tononi, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Siclari et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bernardi et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Spoormaker et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Nir et al., 2011</xref>). Given that our Gi-astrocytic manipulation is restricted to a small portion of cortex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>), the result that astrocytic Gi-DREADD activation affects delta waves more than slow oscillations may indeed be expected.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Cortical astrocyte Ca<sup>2+</sup> dynamics exhibit bidirectional changes before sleep/wake transitions</title><p>We next wondered whether astrocytes might play a role beyond the regulation of sleep depth, to also influence sleep duration. Data here (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) suggest that a component of astrocyte signaling may be important for sleep/wake state transitions, which would directly affect sleep duration. To study these transitions, we first examined endogenous cortical astrocyte Ca<sup>2+</sup> dynamics in the 30 s leading up to transitions between sleep or wake. We found a pattern in which Ca<sup>2+</sup> events consistently increased before the sleep-to-wake transition and decreased before the wake-to-sleep transition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). This is supported by a recent study that demonstrated, using an alternative image analysis technique, that Ca<sup>2+</sup> increases preceding sleep-to-wake transitions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Bojarskaite et al., 2020</xref>). We next divided all sleep and wake periods, regardless of length, into three equal bins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). This allowed us to study how astrocyte Ca<sup>2+</sup> dynamics generally change throughout a sleep or wake period. In so doing, we found that Ca<sup>2+</sup> event rate increased in the last third of sleep and decreased in the last third of wake (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). Since Ca<sup>2+</sup> event rate is higher during wake than sleep (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>) and Ca<sup>2+</sup> events occur after dips in SWA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>), the increase in event rate preceding the transition to wake could reflect a gradual shift in SWA to a wake state. In fact, various ascending brainstem neuromodulatory neurons associated with wakefulness have been shown to increase firing prior to the transition to wake and decrease firing prior to the transition to sleep (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib113">Takahashi et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Eban-Rothschild et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Aston-Jones and Bloom, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Lee et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib119">Trulson and Jacobs, 1979</xref>).

We found that fluorescence in both somas and processes remained elevated above baseline after 1 mg/kg CNO (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1I</xref>), which suggests that Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels may be clamped at saturating levels. Together, these results indicate that (1) we cannot assume that Gq-DREADD activation simply increases astrocytic Ca<sup>2+</sup> in vivo, and (2) when feasible, astrocytic experiments using chemogenetics in vivo should be validated individually, particularly for those involving circuit function and animal behavior.</p><p>To test whether the astrocytic Ca<sup>2+</sup> silencing we observed following Gq-DREADD activation could be reproduced with endogenous GPCR signaling, we measured Ca<sup>2+</sup> activity in ex vivo cortical slices in response to a cocktail of neuromodulators associated with wakefulness, including norepinephrine, acetylcholine, dopamine, and histamine. We adapted methodology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Ding et al., 2016</xref>), using half the concentration of each neuromodulator as previously, since each experiment involved two total applications of this ‘wake cocktail’ (20 μM norepinephrine, 5 μM acetylcholine, 5 μM dopamine, 2.5 μM histamine). We also included TTX in the circulating bath to block neuronal firing. As predicted from previous studies reporting astrocytic Ca<sup>2+</sup> increases to various neuromodulators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Ding et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Khan et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib114">Takata et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Shelton and McCarthy, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Pankratov and Lalo, 2015</xref>), we observed a dramatic increase in Ca<sup>2+</sup> activity in response to the cocktail (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1J</xref>). However, after this initial increase in Ca<sup>2+</sup>, GCaMP fluorescence did not return to baseline levels, but remained high and further Ca<sup>2+</sup> events were almost completely absent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1J</xref>), similar to in vivo dynamics observed 5–10 min after CNO administration. To test whether this ‘silent’ state altered the astrocytic response to further neuromodulatory input, we bath-applied a second round of the wake cocktail. In contrast to the initial Ca<sup>2+</sup> increase, we observed no further increase in astrocyte Ca<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1J</xref>). We speculate that the mechanism underlying the inability of astrocytes to respond to a second dose of wake cocktail may be similar to that underlying the inhibition of Ca<sup>2+</sup> dynamics in vivo in response to circulating CNO.</p></sec><sec id="s2-8"><title>Gq-induced Ca<sup>2+</sup> dynamics regulate sleep-wake transitions</title><p>The finding that Gq-DREADD chemogenetics can inhibit an intracellular GPCR signaling pathway in astrocytes makes this is a particularly useful tool for understanding astrocytes' roles in cortical state regulation. To investigate whether astrocytes regulate sleep duration, we focused on the long period of Ca<sup>2+</sup> suppression in these experiments. We found that mice spent significantly more time in sleep after CNO administration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>, left). Further, in the absence of Gq-GPCR-mediated Ca<sup>2+</sup> events, mice made fewer sleep-to-wake transitions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>, left) and accordingly, we observed fewer sleep bouts of longer duration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2A</xref>). This suggests that the IP<sub>3</sub>R2-dependent increase in event rate prior to sleep-to-wake transitions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>) is important to transition the cortex to the wake state. The transition data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>) also showed that endogenous Ca<sup>2+</sup> decreases toward the end of wake periods, just prior to wake-to-sleep transitions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Thus, we wondered whether Ca<sup>2+</sup> suppression via Gq-DREADDs would affect wake as well. We observed a decrease in the percent time awake (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>, right), as predicted by the increase in sleep observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>, left). However, we also observed less frequent transitions out of wake, demonstrating that astrocyte Ca<sup>2+</sup> is important for both wake-to-sleep transitions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>, right), and sleep-to-wake transitions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>, left). As predicted from the decrease in transitions, we also observed fewer wake bouts and wake bouts of longer duration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2B</xref>). We hypothesize that decreased astrocytic Ca<sup>2+</sup> prior to wake-to-sleep transitions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>) is important for the transition to sleep, but astrocytes were unable to make this significant decrease due to clamped Ca<sup>2+</sup> in these experiments.</p><p>If Gq-GPCR signaling is an important bidirectional regulator of sleep/wake transitions, we would expect that increases in Gq-GPCR signaling to have the opposite effect from decreased Gq-GPCR Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling. We thus used data from the short, initial period with elevated Ca<sup>2+</sup> activity to ask whether this is the case. Because this period is so short (5–10 min), we were somewhat limited in our analysis. However, of the animals that exhibited some sleep in either the CNO or saline condition (n = 4), we observed a significant decrease in the percent time sleeping (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G</xref>). This bidirectional change in sleep time strongly supports the hypothesis that Gq-GPCR-mediated Ca<sup>2+</sup> plays a critical role in regulating sleep duration. Interestingly, we did not observe a change in the amount of sleep with Gi-GPCR activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>), which similarly increased Ca<sup>2+</sup> dynamics. This difference between Gq- and Gi-mediated Ca<sup>2+</sup> increases indicates an important functional dissociation between Gq- and Gi-GPCR-mediated Ca<sup>2+</sup> activity in astrocytes and highlights the likelihood that other signaling molecules involved in GPCR signaling cascades play roles in regulating sleep-wake transitions. Because we observed a significant increase in sleep depth in response to the Ca<sup>2+</sup> increase with Gi-DREADDs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>), we also wondered whether Ca<sup>2+</sup> suppression via Gq-DREADDs would have an opposing effect. In contrast to manipulation of the Gi-GPCRs, we found that Ca<sup>2+</sup> suppression via Gq-GPCR manipulation had no significant effect on SWA during sleep (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6H</xref>). This suggests that astrocytic regulation of SWA is specifically dependent on the Gi-GPCR pathway and provides further evidence that astrocytic Gi- and Gq-GPCR signaling regulate separable sleep/wake features.</p></sec><sec id="s2-9"><title>Local Gi-DREADD activation of cortical astrocytes can drive changes in remote cortical sleep features</title><p>SWA during NREM sleep is considered a widespread phenomenon, involving the synchronization of neurons across the entire cortex.

The morphology and interconnectedness of cortical astrocytes and astrocytic networks make them well positioned to mediate neural activity across broad swaths of cortex.

To assess how the spread of astrocytic DREADD expression compared with the location of the two recording electrodes, we performed immunohistochemistry on brain slices across the rostral-caudal axis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1D</xref>). As expected, the majority of expression was centered around the V1-LFP electrode where viruses had been injected, while no expression was observed in FC at the site of the EEG electrode (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1E</xref>). To assess a causal role for astrocyte Ca<sup>2+</sup> in brain-wide oscillatory activity, we compared the effect of Gi-DREADD activation of V1 astrocytes at both V1-LFP and FC-EEG electrodes. Here, we found that increasing Ca<sup>2+</sup> via Gi-DREADDs in V1 was sufficient to increase SWA in the contralateral frontal cortex, although this increase was smaller than that observed in V1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F–H</xref>).

We showed IP<sub>3</sub>R2-dependent Ca<sup>2+</sup> activity is inversely correlated with SWA and changes bidirectionally prior to sleep-wake transitions. With chemogenetics, we demonstrated that astrocyte Ca<sup>2+</sup> is sufficient to increase SWA during sleep through specific enhancement of delta waves. This is specific to Gi-, not Gq-, GPCR-induced Ca<sup>2+</sup>. In contrast, Gq-, but not Gi-, GPCR Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling is important for mediating sleep/wake transitions. Lastly, we demonstrated that astrocyte Ca<sup>2+</sup> has far-reaching, cortex-wide effects on SWA and slow oscillations.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Sleep depth and sleep length are separable</title><p>We found that astrocytic Gi-DREADD activation increases SWA, but not sleep duration, while Gq-DREADD activation altered sleep duration but not SWA. This suggests a separation in the mechanisms underlying sleep depth, measured by SWA, and sleep duration. Previous work has also shown separation in sleep depth and duration by demonstrating that following sleep deprivation, recovery sleep has higher sleep depth but the duration is not significantly changed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Dijk and Beersma, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Patrick and Gilbert, 1896</xref>). On the other hand, Ca<sup>2+</sup> has been suggested to mechanistically link the regulation of sleep duration and depth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Ode et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib115">Tatsuki et al., 2016</xref>). Interestingly, our data supports both these ideas. We found that endogenous astrocyte Ca<sup>2+</sup> is modulated in relation to both sleep duration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>) and sleep depth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Nevertheless, we were able to affect one without the other by selectively manipulating different GPCR pathways, suggesting these mechanisms are also separable.</p><p>The two-process model of sleep regulation has attributed the regulation of sleep duration to the interaction of sleep pressure, measured by SWA, and circadian rhythm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Borbély et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Daan et al., 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Borbely, 2016</xref>). Our findings that Gi-DREADD activation increased SWA without affecting sleep duration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E,F</xref>) suggests that SWA does not directly influence sleep duration. However, we cannot discount the two-process model from this data alone, since we did not investigate the effect of circadian rhythm, nor did we directly study sleep homeostasis; our recordings were performed at the same time of day and were limited to 2–3 hr. In fact, astrocyte Ca<sup>2+</sup> changes with circadian rhythm in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Brancaccio et al., 2017</xref>) and increases with sleep need after sleep deprivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Ingiosi et al., 2020</xref>). Longer recordings and sleep deprivation interventions to examine astrocytic integration of circadian signals and sleep pressure will be informative. Additionally, our methodology led us to focus on the role of astrocyte GPCR signaling in NREM sleep regulation, although previous work has demonstrated astrocyte Ca<sup>2+</sup> changes with REM sleep (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Bojarskaite et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Ingiosi et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Foley et al., 2017</xref>). The further study of astrocytic regulation of REM sleep may reveal interesting differences between regulation of behavioral sleep and cortical state, which is similar between REM sleep and wake. Indeed, our data suggests that Gi-GPCR signaling would be much attenuated during REM sleep, which is characterized by a lack of SWA.</p><p>Since astrocytes differentially control SWA and sleep/wake transitions, we hypothesize that Gi- and Gq- GPCR activation in astrocytes—while both drive Ca<sup>2+</sup> changes—lead to different downstream effects which may elucidate new mechanisms of sleep regulation. In fact, many astrocytic functions associated with sleep may be important, such as extracellular glutamate regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Poskanzer and Yuste, 2016</xref>), extracellular ion dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Ding et al., 2016</xref>), and adenosine release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Halassa et al., 2009</xref>). While we don’t yet know what downstream astrocytic effects underlie the sleep changes observed here, we have established that the functional astrocytic output is a not a simple consequence of changed Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels in the cell, but rather of signaling downstream of either Gi- or Gq-GPCRs. Many new optical sensors, such as those for glutamate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Marvin et al., 2013</xref>), ATP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Lobas et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Kitajima et al., 2020</xref>), and adenosine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib126">Wu, 2020</xref>), in combination with astrocyte-specific manipulations, may be useful to link specific GPCR-driven Ca<sup>2+</sup> dynamics with relevant astrocyte outputs.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Functional dissociation between Gi- and Gq-GPCR Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling in astrocytes</title><p>The activation of both astrocytic Gi- and Gq-GPCRs increases intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Durkee et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Mariotti et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Nagai et al., 2019</xref>), and yet we observed a functional dissociation between manipulation of the Gi- and Gq-GPCR pathways. These data underscore the complexity of Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals in astrocytes and demonstrate that caution is necessary when attributing astrocytic Ca<sup>2+</sup> increases to one specific downstream function. Many different roles have been attributed to astrocytes, suggesting astrocytes have the capacity to perform several functions in parallel. Our findings suggest that, through GPCR signaling, astrocytes interpret Ca<sup>2+</sup> dynamics within the cell differently, resulting in different functional outputs. This may be a consequence of the many other signaling molecules downstream of Gi- and Gq-GPCRs, including phospholipase C or protein kinase A. Tools such as AQuA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib123">Wang et al., 2019</xref>) that allow the accurate capture of complex astrocyte Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling are a first step in elucidating how Ca<sup>2+</sup> dynamics map to the myriad of functions associated with astrocytes. The next step we took was to extract meaning from these signals by analyzing the multi-dimensional nature of astrocyte Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals. We used PCA to reduce the 20 different properties describing each Ca<sup>2+</sup> event and revealed differences that were not observed with individual comparisons of event rate, duration, size, or amplitude (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>). This both illustrates the complexity of astrocyte Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling and emphasizes the importance of implementing more robust analysis tools.</p><p>Understanding how Gi- and Gq-GPCR activation gives rise to different effects on sleep will require further examination of these signaling pathways in astrocytes. First, we will need to identify the specific endogenous ligands during sleep that alter SWA and sleep/wake transitions. Candidates for sleep/wake transitions include neuromodulators, since many Gq-GPCRs for neuromodulators are expressed by astrocytes. In contrast, regulation of SWA has been attributed to both GABA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Lemieux et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Sheroziya and Timofeev, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib128">Zucca et al., 2017</xref>) and glutamate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Sanchez-Vives and McCormick, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Poskanzer and Yuste, 2011</xref>). GABA and glutamate are attractive candidate endogenous ligands because astrocytic GABAergic (via GABA<sub>B</sub>) and glutamatergic (via mGluR3 in adults) signaling are both mediated via Gi-GPCRs. Acute, astrocyte-specific knock-out of these receptors will provide important insight into the relevant receptors. Importantly, astrocyte-specific knock-outs will also reveal whether Gi-GPCR signaling is necessary to regulate SWA. While we demonstrated that astrocytic Gi-GPCR signaling is sufficient to alter SWA, other signaling cascades and cell types may also play important roles in SWA regulation. Second, further studies will be required to understand how intracellular signaling cascades for Gi- and Gq-GPCRs differ in astrocytes. Using PCA, we found differences in the effect of Gi-DREADD activation on Ca<sup>2+</sup> in sleep versus wake, suggesting the action of the Gi-DREADD may be interacting with endogenous signaling that differs across behavioral states. Both Gi- and Gq-GPCRs increase Ca<sup>2+</sup> via IP<sub>3</sub>R2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Durkee et al., 2019</xref>), and we similarly noted a partial dependence on IP<sub>3</sub>R2 in both Gi- and Gq-GPCR-mediated sleep effects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref>). This only partial dependence on IP<sub>3</sub>R2s in this data could be due to compensation for global IP<sub>3</sub>R2 absence, but it could also indicate that perhaps other signaling molecules unique to Gq- and Gi-signaling are critical for the sleep features described here. In fact, 1.4% of all astrocyte transcripts are regulated by sleep/wake state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bellesi et al., 2015</xref>) and multiple biochemical assays have already identified various important molecules in sleep/wake regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib111">Suzuki et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Funato et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Mikhail et al., 2017</xref>).

Acute manipulation via chemogenetics was advantageous because DREADD activation mimics endogenous signaling pathways known to be important in astrocyte signaling. However, it is still critical to properly validate these tools specifically in astrocytes, especially since they were developed and have been more widely used in neurons. While astrocytic Gq-DREADD activation can increase Ca<sup>2+</sup> under anesthesia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Durkee et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Bonder and McCarthy, 2014</xref>), we report for the first time the effect of Gq-DREADD activation on astrocyte Ca<sup>2+</sup> in awake mice, both for long time periods (2–3 hr) and with several CNO concentrations. Gq-DREADD activation increased Ca<sup>2+</sup> only for a short time after CNO injection, after which we observe a complete suppression of Ca<sup>2+</sup> activity for several hours, for all CNO concentrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C–D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). This unexpected result points to the importance of validating DREADD responses for each in vivo experiment when feasible.</p><p>We think that it is most likely that the opposite effects of CNO on Ca<sup>2+</sup> activity in Gi-DREADD- and Gq-DREADD-expressing astrocytes reveal important differences in the Gi and Gq signaling pathways. However, these results may also indicate that expression levels of Gi- and Gq-DREADD may be more different than expected based on the observed immunostaining. Another possibility is that differential Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses may be caused by differences in CNO action on Gi- and Gq-DREADD receptors. For example, CNO may be less efficacious on Gi-DREADDs in astrocytes. This possibility could be tested by determining whether higher doses of CNO are sufficient to suppress Ca<sup>2+</sup> with Gi-DREADD.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Differential regulation of local and cortex-wide sleep</title><p>Two unique slow-waves have been characterized in NREM sleep: delta waves and slow oscillations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Genzel et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Kim et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Steriade et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Steriade and Timofeev, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Siclari et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Dang-Vu et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bernardi et al., 2018</xref>). Here, we found that astrocytic Gi-DREADD activation increases SWA by preferentially increasing the amplitude of delta waves in V1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). This data supports existing literature suggesting delta waves are generated locally within the cortex by the spreading of DOWN states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Genzel et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Siclari and Tononi, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Siclari et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bernardi et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Spoormaker et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Nir et al., 2011</xref>). Since our Gi-DREADD manipulation was restricted within the cortex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>) and DOWN states are thought to be generated through GABAergic inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Chen et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Lemieux et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Sheroziya and Timofeev, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib128">Zucca et al., 2017</xref>), we hypothesize that Gi-GPCR signaling in astrocytes mediates the local synchronization of delta waves via control of inhibition. Additionally, astrocytes may also mediate synchronization of UP states through glutamate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Sanchez-Vives and McCormick, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Poskanzer and Yuste, 2011</xref>).</p><p>In addition to the increase in delta waves, we observed a smaller, but significant, increase in slow oscillation amplitude that was equal in magnitude to that observed in contralateral FC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). This suggests that cortical astrocytes may have influence over more global, cortex-wide neural activity. We explored this further and found that SWA in contralateral FC was modulated around endogenous Ca<sup>2+</sup> events recorded in V1. Further, we found that coherence between V1 and FC was increased immediately following astrocyte Ca<sup>2+</sup> events. Interestingly, coherence was increased in the range of 5–10 Hz, which is higher than expected for slow oscillations, but might also indicate a role for astrocytes in the connectivity across cortex during REM or wake. The synchronization across broad areas of cortex may involve astrocytic gap junctions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib112">Szabó et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Clasadonte et al., 2017</xref>), which could mediate fast recruitment of neurons in synchronous waves. If this is indeed the mechanism, our findings indicate that GPCR activation regulates gap junction coupling in astrocytes, which can be explicitly tested (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Murphy-Royal et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>Slow oscillations are more global than delta waves. Here, the change in slow oscillation amplitude with CNO administration was similar in V1 and FC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7J</xref>). One explanation for this finding is that activation of V1 astrocytes is sufficient to recruit subcortical circuitry, such as thalamocortical circuits, that can underlie brain-wide synchronous events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Steriade, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Crunelli et al., 2018</xref>). This hypothesis is supported by studies showing subcortical ‘bottom-up’ regulation of slow oscillations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Steriade et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Siclari et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bernardi et al., 2018</xref>) and a role of astrocytes in mediating communication between different brain areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Kol, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Sardinha et al., 2017</xref>), and could be tested by simultaneously recording from thalamus and cortex during astrocyte activation.</p><p>Recent work indicates that slow oscillations and delta waves have distinct functions in memory during NREM sleep (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Genzel et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Kim et al., 2019</xref>). Since Gi-driven astrocyte Ca<sup>2+</sup> preferentially drives changes in delta waves locally, we might expect that astrocytic activity in sleep is more involved in forgetting than memory consolidation. This could be tested by quantifying the effect of Gi-DREADD activation during sleep following a learning paradigm, such as fear conditioning. Further, a light-activated Gi-GPCR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Siuda et al., 2015</xref>) in astrocytes would provide temporal control for selective Gi-DREADD activation specifically during NREM sleep following learning, to further explore how astrocytic effects on sleep impact cortical memory functions.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals</title><p>All procedures were carried out using adult mice (C57Bl/6, P50–100) in accordance with protocols approved by the University of California, San Francisco Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC).

Event-aligned coherence spectra were compared against coherence spectra aligned to randomly chosen time-points. Random time-points were chosen uniformly between the start of each dataset and 1.5 s (the duration of the coherence analysis window) from the end, in equal numbers to the original astrocyte events for each dataset.

Activity in networks of neurons throughout the brain is different when an animal is asleep compared to when it is awake, and it has long been speculated that astrocytes, non-neuronal cells in the brain, may be partly responsible for regulating neuronal network activity during sleep. However, solid evidence has been largely lacking until recently. This paper plays an important in elucidating the connection between astrocytes and sleep, and suggests that astrocytes play a homeostatic role in regulating neurons during sleep.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Cortical astrocytes independently regulate sleep depth and duration via separate GPCR pathways&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>.

Overall, this study builds on several years' worth of work by many labs showing or at least suggesting potentially important roles of astrocytes in sleep. As such, the topic and the data are not completely novel, but to their credit the authors have performed in depth analyses that go far deeper than previous studies. The depth of the analyses and the rigor of the approach outweigh any concerns that may linger regarding past work and push this study into a category of paper that is much needed and valued in the field. Seems highly appropriate for <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>No major concerns.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>This is an exciting paper showing relationships between sleep and Gi- and Gq-coupled GPCR signaling pathways in astrocytes. The paper demonstrates correlations between astrocyte calcium signals and sleep signatures such as slow-wave activity (SWA) measured with LFP in cortex. Astrocytes show activity changes near SWA changes such as at sleep-wake transitions. These are investigated using Gi- and Gq-DREADDs and it is found that astrocytes have a causal effect on SWA and the frequency of sleep-wake transitions. These results provide evidence for a role for astrocytes in controlling sleep-related SWA, with separate effects on sleep depth and duration depending on which GPCR pathway is perturbed.</p><p>This work is related to other recent publications implicating astrocyte control of sleep and contains a multitude of new findings. These are very interesting and elucidating while also pointing toward directions of research needed for determining the molecular and mechanisms underlying the reported observations.</p><p>1) The conclusions are somewhat indirect when it comes to causal relationships and mechanisms. The temporal relationships between astrocyte signals and SWA changes is complex, with SWA decreasing before astrocyte calcium events and increasing after. This is interpreted as astrocytes having a homeostatic effect on SWA. Causality is therefore somewhat hard to interpret, in part because the homeostatic effect may involve more than just astrocytes but also neurons, including neurons whose activity is less visible in LFP measurements of SWA. Although this may be outside the scope of this study, if the authors have imaging data available of cortical astrocytes together with nearby cortical neurons (that is, a more direct measure of nearby neuron activity than LFP), this might clarify the temporal relationship between these cells.</p><p>2) The paper demonstrates sufficiency, astrocytes can change cortical SWA and sleep duration, but does not conclusively demonstrate that sleep is regulated through these pathways in natural behavior because of the difficulty in knocking them out. Can the text (perhaps the title) be adjusted to reflect this?</p><p>3) The authors show that there is inverse relationship between SWA amplitude and astrocytic calcium events in Figure 1H, with higher calcium activities associated with lower SWA. Gi-DREADD activation by CNO can increase astrocytic calcium events, and also increase SWA. Can the authors discuss this changed relationship in more depth? In addition, Gq-DREADD can change sleep time and sleep-wake transition, but not change SWA. Do these results indicate that astrocytic calcium may be not directly affect sleep duration or depth, but some other signal downstream of the GPCR?</p><p>4) In the Gi-DREADD experiments, the IP3R2-/- mouse is tested and found to lead to a smaller effect of CNO on SWA. Why was the IP3R2-/- not included in the Gq-DREADD experiments? Was that based on the assumption that there would be no difference, since Ca events disappeared in the Gq experiments?</p><p>5) It is unclear what the true effect of the Gq-DREADDs is on astrocyte calcium because activity is only represented by event rate (extracted by AQuA) and not as Ca concentration. Does event rate go down because Ca concentration drops to low levels and shows no dynamics, or because Ca concentration saturates and shows no dynamics due to a ceiling effect (as in the wake cocktail experiments)? This could be measured as absolute fluorescence of GCaMP. Interpretation of the results could change depending on which one of these is true. For example, saturated calcium could indicate an “unphysiological” state of astrocytes that can have consequences on the network that may not occur during natural sleep/wake.</p><p>6) The conclusion that &quot;Gq-induced Ca<sup>2+</sup> is necessary for sleep-wake transitions&quot; (text and Figure 6) seems somewhat overstated. The Gq-DREADDs are a useful way to perturb calcium dynamics and this leads to changes in sleep-wake transitions, but it was not shown that without Gq sleep-wake transitions disappear. Also the effect demonstrated (Figure 6F for example) is partial. It seems appropriate to rephrase this statement.</p><p>7) SWA, measured through LFP, is used as the primary measure of sleep. SWA can also be measured from EEG, and this appears the more common way to define sleep states. Can data be included that quantifies the degree to which these are correlated? Is cortical LFP-measured SWA one hundred percent predictive of SWA derived from EEG? Other indicators of sleep include arousal threshold. Do the authors have data showing relationships between their LFP-measure of SWA and such other measures?</p><p>8) Related to this, how are changes in LFP-measured SWA in local cortical areas related to EEG-measured SWA during perturbation experiments? This is partially addressed in Figure 7 by measuring SWA with LFP in another cortical area, but it would be interesting to compare this to a global EEG measure.</p><p>9) Is there any possibility that manipulation of astrocytes may directly influence LFP, for example through secretion of ions? It seems unlikely, but not impossible.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.63329.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Revisions for this paper:</p><p>– Please revise to increase clarity in text and figures as suggested.</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested by the reviewers, we have edited the manuscript for clarity throughout the paper, focusing most heavily on the sections that they commented on the most, but making changes in all sections to soften the tone and clarify the analyses and conclusions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– The temporal relationships between astrocyte signals and SWA changes is complex, with SWA decreasing before astrocyte calcium events and increasing after.

We have added this possibility to the text (see Discussion), specifically emphasizing that we cannot conclude what is the cause of this change and describing alternative interpretations if we performed the experiments with different CNO doses as described by reviewer #1.</p><p>We agree that it is interesting to compare the results of Gq-DREADD activation on event rate with that of fluorescence levels. As such, we have added a panel (Figure 6—figure supplement 1I) in which we used ROIs to analyze change in fluorescence after CNO administration in somas and processes. We see that Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration in both somas and processes remain elevated after CNO administration. This could, as the author suggests, indicate Ca<sup>2+</sup> is clamped at a saturating level. We believe this does not change our interpretation. As is the case with all DREADD manipulations, we are altering astrocyte activity in a “non-physiological” way. Regardless of the exact mechanism, the perturbation that causes a decrease in event rate and a change in sleep—in combination with our endogenous, “physiological” activity (see Figure 4)—informs our understanding of the potential role of astrocytes in this process.</p><p>Lastly, while we agree quantifying DREADD protein levels with western blots would be informative, it was currently beyond the scope of this study. We did, however, indirectly compare expression levels between Gi- and Gq-DREADDs by analyzing the immunohistochemistry data we have collected (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref>). Specifically, we analyzed the pixel intensity values of mCherry fluorescence from samples collected from all mice (Gi: n = 10 mice; Gq: n = 12 mice). We analyzed images taken with both 5x and 63x magnification, and found no significant difference between fluorescence using this approach (ranksum test, p &gt; 0.05). As a note, we did observe that the virus for Gi-DREADDs expressed more strongly than Gq-DREADDs during pilot experiments and so we injected a lower volume of the Gi-DREADD virus (<italic>AAV5-GFAP-hM4D(Gi)-mCherry,</italic> 200-400nl) than the Gq-DREADD virus (<italic>AAV5-GFAP-hM3D(Gq)-mCherry</italic> 400-600nl, see Materials and methods).</p><fig id="respfig1"><label>Author response image 1.</label><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-63329-resp-fig1-v1.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– In this study SWA, measured through LFP, is used as the primary measure of sleep; however SWA can also be measured from EEG, a more common way to define sleep states.

Please include or address potential caveats in paper if data cannot be included.</p></disp-quote><p>While it is true that LFP and EEG will produce different neural recordings, we expect that patterns of SWA and sleep scoring will be very similar between LFP and EEG recordings. In fact, the use of LFP to define sleep states and quantify SWA is quite common in rodents (see for example, Watson et al., 2016, Hengen et al., 2016, Kim et al., 2019). The main difference between LFP and EEG is the spatial scale of the recording, with LFP being a more local signal. However, it has been shown that the spatial scale of the recording is inversely related to the frequency, and thus we would expect that the spatial scale of the LFP is more similar to EEG for the low-frequencies we used to define sleep states and measure SWA and indeed it has been shown that these recordings are largely similar (for further discussion on this, see review Buzsaki, Anastassioiu and Koch 2012). In our data, we found that, using a 5 second window, the average power correlation for SWA (0.5-4 Hz) in LFP (V1) and EEG (FC) was relatively high (See <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig2">Author response image 2</xref>. Saline controls: n = 13 mice, 26 hours, r = 0.67, p &lt; 0.0005; Gi-DREADDs + CNO: n = 19 mice, 38 hours, r = 0.69, p &lt;0.0005). We also found that the sleep state recorded in the V1 LFP and FC EEG agreed in 80% of our timebins. Thus even in two different sites, we find that these two signals are largely similar. The remaining differences we see in sleep state and SWA may reflect local sleep and the heterogeneity of SWA that has been reported, and which we were specifically interested in capturing for the purposes of the present study.</p><fig id="respfig2"><label>Author response image 2.</label><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-63329-resp-fig2-v1.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>This is an exciting paper showing relationships between sleep and Gi- and Gq-coupled GPCR signaling pathways in astrocytes.

In Figure 3, we are artificially increasing Ca<sup>2+</sup> events above levels seen endogenously, and as a result we are driving an increase in SWA above levels seen in controls.
