Here, we determine a functional relevance of the long-established mutually exclusive expression of the receptor tyrosine kinase Kit and the trans-membrane protein Kit Ligand by discrete populations of neurons in the mammalian brain. Kit is enriched in molecular layer interneurons (MLIs) of the cerebellar cortex (i.e., stellate and basket cells), while cerebellar Kit Ligand is selectively expressed by a target of their inhibition, Purkinje cells (PCs). By in vivo genetic manipulation spanning embryonic development through adulthood, we demonstrate that PC Kit Ligand and MLI Kit are required for, and capable of driving changes in, the inhibition of PCs.

It is perhaps unsurprising that loss-of-function <italic>Kit</italic> mutations in humans are rare; <italic>Kit</italic> is highly pleiotropic, supporting diverse cell populations, including melanocytes, hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells, germ cells, masts cell, and interstitial cells of Cajal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Yarden et al., 1987</xref>). Thus, <italic>Kit</italic> mutations can result in diverse conditions such as hypo- or hyperpigmentation or melanoma, anemia or leukemia, infertility, mastocytosis, and impaired gut motility or gastrointestinal tumors (Kit biology reviewed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bernstein et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lennartsson and RÃ¶nnstrand, 2012</xref>).</p><p>The activation of Kit is stimulated by Kit Ligand (KL) (human gene symbol <italic>KITLG</italic>, mouse gene symbol <italic>Kitl</italic>, herein KL), a single-pass transmembrane protein having an extracellular active domain that induces Kit dimerization and kinase activity. Across several decades and species, it has been reported that KL and Kit are mutually expressed in discrete neuron populations known to be connected; it has thus been hypothesized that the expression pattern of KL-Kit may reflect a role in connectivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Keshet et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Motro et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hirota et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Manova et al., 1992</xref>). Consistent with such a function, case reports have implicated inactivating <italic>Kit</italic> mutations with disorders of the central nervous system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Telfer et al., 1971</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Finucane et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Funderburk and Crandall, 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lacassie et al., 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kilsby et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1C</xref>). Clinical phenotypes include developmental delay, ataxia, hypotonia, intellectual disability, deafness, and autism spectrum disorder. White matter abnormalities have been noted, and limited evidence suggests KL-Kit may indeed regulate axon outgrowth. KL or Kit mutation or pharmacological manipulation alters outgrowth of spinal commissural axons in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gore et al., 2008</xref>), KL stimulates cortical neurite outgrowth in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Su et al., 2013</xref>), and Kit reduction in cortex of developing rats or mice delays axon extension (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Guijarro et al., 2013</xref>). While these reports provide anatomical/morphological data suggesting that KL-Kit influences connectivity, these studies did not address the consequences to neuronal physiology or synaptic connectivity. Functional studies of KL-Kit in synaptic physiology have likely been hampered by pleiotropy and organismal or cell death. Severe global KL-Kit hypomorphs exhibit fatal anemia, and developmental Kit depletion or inhibition in the cerebrum has resulted in the death of neuronal progenitors or nascent neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Guijarro et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Mashayekhi and Gholizadeh, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Aoki et al., 2017</xref>). Therefore, whether KL-Kit is necessary for synaptic function has remained largely unstudied. Here, we address this gap.</p><p>In mice, rats, and humans, Kit is abundantly expressed by molecular layer interneurons (MLIs) of the cerebellar cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Motro et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hirota et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Manova et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kim et al., 2003</xref>), while cerebellar KL is restricted to Purkinje cells (PCs), which MLIs provide GABAergic synaptic inhibition to. We tested the hypothesis that PC KL and MLI Kit were essential to the GABAergic inhibition of PCs. We created a Kit conditional knockout mouse and accomplished embryonic knockout of Kit from MLIs; separately, we knocked out KL from postnatal PCs. By either method, disruption of the KL-Kit pair produced robust and specific impairments to GABAergic inhibition of PCs. Through sparse postnatal viral manipulation of KL in PCs, we provide evidence that KL functions throughout adulthood to regulate synaptic function. These results demonstrate that cell-type-specific expression of KL and Kit influences functional connectivity in the mammalian brain, informing the long-observed expression of KL-Kit in the brain and suggesting a rationale for the affiliation of Kit loss with neurological impairment.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>We generated mice in which <italic>Kit</italic> exon 4 is flanked by LoxP sites (<italic>Kit</italic> tm1c); <italic>Kit</italic> gene modifications are illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C and D</xref>. Kit tm1c homozygous Control animals had normal appearance, sex ratios, and reproductive success. Kit protein is abundantly expressed in parvalbumin-positive GABAergic interneurons in the molecular layer of the cerebellar cortex (MLIs), whereas KL is expressed by PCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and B</xref>). To determine if Kit influences synapse function, we conditionally knocked out Kit from MLIs and assessed the MLI:PC synapse. Pax2 is a transcription factor expressed early in the lineage of GABAergic interneurons of the cerebellum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Maricich and Herrup, 1999</xref>); a <italic>Pax2</italic>-Cre transgene enables embryonic recombination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Blake and Ziman, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Pfeffer et al., 2002</xref>). We generated <italic>Kit</italic> tm1c homozygous litters of which nominally half were hemizygous for <italic>Pax2</italic> Cre (Kit KO) and half were not (Control). We produced Control and Kit KO animals in normal sex and genotype ratios. As expected for the C57BL/6J background, Control littermates had dark coat and eyes, but littermate Kit KO animals had white whiskers, white fur with variable pigmented patches, and black eyes; example littermates are provided in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>. Given Pax2 expression in melanocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lee et al., 2011</xref>) and the role of Kit in melanogenesis reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Wehrle-Haller, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Besmer et al., 1993</xref>, the pigmentation phenotype provided gross confirmation of conditional Kit KO. We thus confirmed that cerebella of Kit KO animals were Kit depleted. By immunohistochemistry in Control animals, we recapitulated the known pattern of Kit immunoreactivity in the parvalbumin-positive MLIs of the cerebellar cortex (Control, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref> and inset). In contrast, a sex-matched Kit KO littermate demonstrated loss of cerebellar Kit immunoreactivity (Kit KO, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref> and inset). In data not shown, we confirmed that both mGlur1/2 and neurogranin-positive cerebellar Golgi cells (which share the MLI Pax2+ lineage, and of which some are transiently Kit positive) were still present in the Kit KO condition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Maricich and Herrup, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Leto et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Weisheit et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Amat et al., 2017</xref>). By western blot of cerebellar lysates from Control animals, Kit resolved as a major band at ~120 kD, but in Kit KO littermates, Kit immunoreactivity was lost; GAPDH as loading control was equivalent, as was parvalbumin (which marks mature MLIs and PCs) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Design and validation of a Kit conditional knockout (KO) mouse.</title><p>(<bold>A, B</bold>) Kit receptor tyrosine kinase (Kit) is enriched in parvalbumin-positive GABAergic interneurons of the molecular layer (i.e., basket and stellate cells, MLIs) of the cerebellar cortex, where they synapse onto each other and onto Purkinje cells (PCs, Calbindin+), which express Kit Ligand (KL).

This reduced inhibition did not produce obvious impacts to spontaneous PC firing dynamics: we determined (in 29 Control vs 22 Kit KO cells) that PC membrane potential and membrane resistivity were not significantly different, and that per cell average: spontaneous action potential frequency, inter-spike interval (ISI), and ISI CV2 were not significantly different, despite some difference in the distribution of individual ISI across genotypes.(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1</xref>).

However, capacitance, input resistance, and spontaneous or evoked MLI action potential frequency was not different between Control and Kit KO (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2âfigure supplement 3BâE</xref>). Since MLI numbers, distribution, and firing were apparently normal in Kit KO, we sought to determine if there were defects in evoked neurotransmitter release. Direct electrode stimulation of the outer or inner molecular layer in a paired-pulse paradigm evoked inhibitory postsynaptic currents (IPSCs) of equivalent mean amplitude in PCs from Control and Kit KO conditions, and we detected no difference in the paired pulse ratio across genotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2âfigure supplement 3FâM</xref>). These data suggest that electrical stimulation can produce IPSCs of similar amplitude, and that release probability of individual synapses is unchanged, between Control and Kit KO conditions. We therefore investigated markers of the MLI:PC synapses to determine if they were altered.</p><p>The density and average size of GABAergic synapses onto PCs (triple-positive VGAT, gephyrin, and calbindin puncta in the molecular layer) was not reduced by Kit KO (example immunofluorescence, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2âfigure supplement 4A</xref>; quantification, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2âfigure supplement 4B and C</xref>). MLI axon terminals contribute not just to individual axo-dendritic synaptic puncta, but also to interdigitated MLI axon collaterals around the soma and initial axon segment of PCs, forming âpinceauxâ structures. By parvalbumin immunoreactivity, these structures were preserved but smaller in Kit KO (arrowheads, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2âfigure supplement 4C</xref>), and this was confirmed by decreased Kv1.2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2âfigure supplement 4D</xref>) and PSD-95 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2âfigure supplement 4E</xref>). As PSD-95 immunoreactivity faithfully follows multiple markers of pinceaux size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Zhou et al., 2020</xref>), we quantified PSD-95 immunoreactive pinceau area and determined that pinceaux size decreased by ~50% in Kit KO (26 Control vs 43 Kit KO pinceau from n of 5 Control vs 8 Kit KO animals, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2âfigure supplement 4F</xref>). These results suggested that Kit KO MLIs may have defects in physical and/or functional maturation of synapses onto PCs.</p><p>To evaluate the number of functional GABAergic synapses, we analyzed miniature synaptic currents in acute cerebellar slices (schema, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2EâG</xref>; example traces, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2HâJ</xref>). In PCs of Kit KO, there was a significant ~50% reduction in the average frequency, but not amplitude, of miniature inhibitory postsynaptic currents (mIPSCs) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2K</xref>). In contrast, the average frequency and amplitude of miniature excitatory postsynaptic current (mEPSC) in PCs from Control and Kit KO did not differ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2L</xref>). These data suggested that Kit KO impaired the MLI:PC synapse but did not rule out a general defect in MLI synapse function. As MLIs synapse not just onto PCs, but also onto other MLIs, we evaluated mIPSCs in MLIs. Mean mIPSC frequency and amplitude in MLIs was unchanged between Control and Kit KO (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2M</xref>). Therefore, embryonic MLI Kit KO was associated with a specific defect in the number or proportion of functional GABAergic synapses onto PCs. As MLI Kit and PC KL expression is maintained postnatally, we hypothesized that postnatal postsynaptic PC KL KO would phenocopy embryonic presynaptic MLI Kit KO.</p><p>We utilized previously described <italic>KL</italic> floxed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Ding et al., 2012</xref>) and <italic>Pcp2</italic>-Cre (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Barski et al., 2000</xref>) strains to yield mice with Control or KL KO PCs (schema, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). We confirmed depletion of cerebellar KL transcripts by rtPCR in data not shown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Ding et al., 2012</xref>) and that PC KL KO did not grossly disrupt the pattern of Kit immunoreactivity. Patch clamp of PCs in acute slices revealed that PC KL KO produced significant differences in the distribution of sIPSC event amplitudes (example traces, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B and C</xref>). PC KL KO reduced the average sIPSC frequency and amplitude, as well as the total inhibitory charge transfer (âchargeâ) recorded in PCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>), without changes to PC capacitance or membrane resistance. The phenotype was specific to GABAergic synapses: there was a substantial reduction in the frequency but not the amplitude of mIPSC events in PCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). As with Kit KO, we detected no decrease in the per-animal average size or density of triple-positive VGAT/gephyrin/calbindin synaptic puncta in the molecular layer (n = 4 Control vs 4 KL KO animals, mean area 0.249 vs 0.286 Âµm<sup>2</sup>, p = 0.1962; mean density 0.045 vs 0.046 per Âµm<sup>2</sup>, p = 0.9658, not illustrated). We further detected no difference in PDS-95+ pinceau area (49 Control vs 48 KL KO pinceaux from n = 4 Control vs 4 KL KO animals, mean area 57.93 vs 53.37 Âµm<sup>2</sup>, p = 0.6036, not illustrated). Thus, as with embryonic Kit KO, postnatal KL KO apparently reduced the proportion of functional, if not the absolute total number, of GABAergic synapse sites upon PCs. In contrast to this impact on GABAergic synapses, the frequency and amplitude of mEPSCs in KL KO PCs were not different vs Controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). In data not shown, a KS test revealed a significant difference in the individual mEPSC event amplitude distribution (p = 0.0002, n = 1196 Control vs 1244 KL KO); however, the mean mEPSC amplitude was within 1% between conditions. Similarly, a KS test of mIPSC event amplitudes revealed that the mean mIPSC amplitude was ~10% greater in PC KL KO than in Control (p &lt; 0.0001, n = 5996 Control vs 3958 KL KO). It is therefore unlikely that decreased event amplitude contributed to the specific and robust &gt; 50% decrease in mIPSC frequency detected in PC KL KO. Thus, as with MLI Kit KO, PC KL KO specifically reduced synaptic GABAergic inhibition of PCs.</p><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Knockout of Kit Ligand (KL KO) from Purkinje cells decreases the inhibitory input they receive.</title><p>(<bold>A, B</bold>) Experimental schema and example traces of inhibitory postsynaptic currents detected in PCs from Control animals or from those with KL KO accomplished by a <italic>Pcp2</italic>-Cre Ã KL (<italic>Kitl</italic>) floxed strategy.

Injections were at P7, P18, or P56; acute slices were generated 2â3 wk after injections. In the P7 neonatal animals, we utilized lentivirus due to its reduced spread vs adeno-associated viral (AAV) particles, which were used for P18 and P56. Patch-clamp recordings in areas of sparse infection revealed that regardless of when KL was depleted, PC KL KO reduced PC sIPSC frequency and inhibitory charge transferred (P7, P18, and P56 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4âfigure supplement 1D, H, and I</xref><bold>;</bold> P18 injections <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4BâD</xref>).

By generating a conditional knockout mouse, we were able to produce viable animals with Kit protein depleted from the cerebellum to reveal a role in synapse function.</p><p>MLI number, distribution, action potential firing, and the density of GABAergic synaptic puncta onto PCs are all apparently normal in MLI Kit KO. These data suggest that while MLI axon terminals are present in Kit KO, they may be less functional. An increased failure rate between action potential generation and neurotransmitter release would be consistent with the normal firing frequency and synapse puncta density but decreased sIPSC and mIPSC frequency observed. Under the PPR paradigm, the apparently equivalent evoked responses may be due to direct stimulation of axon terminals and/or simultaneous recruitment of multiple MLIs.</p><p>Kit KO most directly impacts the MLI:PC synapse, based on seemingly normal miniature events for parallel fiber: PC synapses (mEPSC in PC) and MLI:MLI (mIPSC in MLI) synapses. This is perhaps expected given the cell-type-specific expression of KL by PCs and Kit by MLIs; however, it is a critical distinction as cerebellins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Zhang et al., 2015</xref>) and calsystenin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Liu et al., 2022</xref>) impact multiple forms of synaptic input to PCs. It will be informative to determine if the residual inhibitory drive to PCs observed in MLI Kit KO or PC KL KO comes from PC axon collaterals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chan-Palay, 1971</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Larramendi and Lemkey-Johnston, 1970</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Orduz and Llano, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Witter et al., 2016</xref> whose input we might expect to be preserved if KL-Kit functions primarily to mediate connectivity between different cell types or perhaps from a subtype of interneuron not dependent upon Kit signaling. This distinction is further relevant since our histological analysis of synaptic puncta does not resolve between MLI:PC and PC:PC synapses, the relative balance of which may be altered by either KL or Kit manipulations. Indeed, future studies of the role of KL-Kit on PC-PC connectivity may inform how PC KL OX can apparently weaken inhibition to adjacent PCs: this may occur through the reduction of inhibitory drive from KL OX PCs to adjacent control PCs. An alternative and not mutually exclusive possibility is that PC KL OX excessively potentiates MLI Kit to enhance MLI:MLI inhibition, reducing the inhibitory output surrounding MLIs can provide to control PCs.</p><p>Though such important nuances of the circuit mechanisms remain to be elucidated, our results demonstrate that the KL-Kit axis, from embryonic development through young adulthood, can alter GABAergic drive to PCs. These results suggest that KL-Kit may be necessary to maintain, and perhaps capable of modulating, MLI:PC GABAergic inhibition in the adult cerebellum. As each MLI (e.g., basket cell) has axon collaterals that can target multiple PCs, and as each PC can receive input from multiple MLIs, it is interesting to speculate that dynamics (e.g., in the expression or shedding) of KL may act through presynaptic Kit to tune the degree of convergent MLI:PC inhibitory drive. This would complement existing forms of modulation at the MLI:PC synapse, such as those dependent on other PC-derived signaling molecules, like endocannabinoids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kreitzer et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kreitzer and Regehr, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Safo et al., 2006</xref>) or peptides like secretin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Williams et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fuchs et al., 2014</xref>) and CR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Wu et al., 2020</xref>). The physiology of PCs, and the structure of MLI:PC inhibition, also varies over zones such as those identified by Zebrin-II and PLC Î²4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Zhou et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Brochu et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Leclerc et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Sarna et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Marzban et al., 2007</xref>); whether there is functional variation in KL or Kit expression, signaling, or dependency remains to be determined. Though we have demonstrated a role in synaptic GABAergic inhibition, it is currently unknown whether Kit signaling also plays a role in other forms of inhibition in the cerebellar cortex, such as MLI:MLI gap-junctions, or MLI:PC ephaptic coupling. The latter may be suggested by the Kit KO-mediated reduction in Kv1.1/Kv1.2 and PSD-95 immunoreactivity.</p><p>While our data clearly demonstrates that KL-Kit influences synaptic function, we do not yet know the molecular mechanisms involved. Kit is a receptor tyrosine kinase that can activate multiple downstream effectors, including Src family kinases, PLC, PI3K/mTOR, and the MAPK pathway, the latter two notable here for their shared affiliation with synapse phenotypes and autism spectrum disorder. Investigation of the interactome of Kit under basal and KL manipulated conditions may inform the receptor kinase cascades through which Kit signaling sustains synaptic function. It also plausible that trans-cellular interactions between KL and Kit may function in a kinase-independent, cell adhesion molecule modality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adachi et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Tabone-Eglinger et al., 2014</xref>). There is a substantial literature illustrating the importance of adhesion molecules in the organization and maintenance of MLI:PC inhibition, such as neurexins/neuroligins, dystrophin/dystroglycan, semaphorins, and neurofascins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Zhang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Liu et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ango et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Buttermore et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Telley et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cioni et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Wu et al., 2022</xref>). Much of what is understood about these molecules in the maintenance of PC inhibition is revealed by postsynaptic phenotypes; that is, <italic>cis</italic>- and <italic>trans</italic> interacting proteins that, via gephyrin, maintain the organization of PC GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors. It is notable therefore that MLI Kit or PC KL KO has a more predominant effect on mIPSC frequency than on amplitude, suggesting a presynaptic phenotype.</p><p>Despite the reduced PC inhibition resulting from MLI Kit KO or from PC KL KO, we have not observed overt cerebellar signs (i.e., ataxia). We suspect that this is due to compensation. Even the developmental ablation of functional GABA<sub>A</sub> channels in PCs does not produce overt motor signs, while adulthood ablation can (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Wisden et al., 2009</xref>). Thus, we might unmask behavioral phenotypes if KL or Kit KO is delayed until adulthood. Consistent with the interpretation that developmental compensation may be involved, the impact of postnatal PC KL KO on inhibitory drive to PCs is more pronounced than embryonic MLI Kit KO. Beyond direct inhibition of PCs, MLI:PC GABAergic inhibition constrains granule cell-mediated PC dendritic excitation and thus gates the conversion of PC LTD to LTP at the PF-PC synapse in motor learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bonnan et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gaffield et al., 2018</xref>). It is therefore possible that KL or Kit KO may only reveal phenotypes in motor learning (or other cerebellar-plasticity dependent) behaviors; speaking to the feasibility of this possibility, global hypomorphs for KL or Kit have altered hippocampal neurophysiology and learning performance on a Water Maze task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Motro et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Katafuchi et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kondo et al., 2002</xref>). Continuous expression of KL and Kit in specific neurons may thus reflect not only a role in the development (or maintenance) of synaptic function as suggested here but also in the plastic modulation of synaptic strength.</p><p>Despite the importance of future works to determine molecular mechanisms and organismal consequences, our study is a discrete advance because it establishes that KL-Kit regulates mammalian central synapse function. Here, we demonstrate impacts at the mouse GABAergic MLI:PC synapse; however, Kit and KL are expressed in diverse organisms and neuronal populations including glutamatergic neurons of the hippocampus, and neurons in olfactory bulb, basal forebrain, and brainstem. It is therefore feasible that the synaptic phenotypes reported here reflect that KL-Kit is broadly capable of influencing connectivity.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals</title><p>All procedures performed at Michigan State University were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees of Michigan State University, which is accredited by the Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care.

A strength of this paper is the use of cell-specific knockouts of cKit and Kit ligand, in MLIs and PCs, respectively. In both cases, the frequency of spontaneous or miniature (in the presence of TTX) IPSCs was reduced. This suggests either a reduction in the number of functional inhibitory release sites or reduced release probability. IPSCs evoked by electrical stimulation in the molecular layer showed no change in paired-pulse ratio, indicating release probability is not changed in the cKit KO, and favoring a reduction in the number of release sites. Changes in IPSC amplitude were more subtle, with some analyses showing a decrease and others not. These data suggest that disruption of the cKit-Kit ligand complex reduces the number of functional synapses with only minor changes in synapse strength.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="referee-report" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.89792.3.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><anonymous/><role specific-use="referee">Reviewer</role></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>In their study, Zaman et al. demonstrate that deletion of either the receptor tyrosine kinase Kit from cerebellar interneurons or the kit ligand (KL) from Purkinje cells reduces the inhibition of Purkinje cells.

Zaman et al., investigates how the receptor tyrosine kinase Kit and its trans-cellular kit ligand regulate molecular layer interneuron (MLI)- Purkinje cell (PC) connectivity in the cerebellum. Presynaptic Kit is specific for MLIs, and forms a trans-synaptic complex with Kit ligand in postsynaptic PC cells. The authors begin by generating Kit cKOs via an EUCOMM allele to enable cell-type specific Kit deletion. They cross this Kit cKO to the MLI-specific driver Pax2-Cre and conduct validation via Kit IHC and immunoblotting. Using this system to examine the functional consequences of presynaptic MLI Kit deletion onto postsynaptic PC cells, they record spontaneous and miniature synaptic currents from PC cells and find a selective reduction in IPSC frequency. Deletion of Kit ligand from postsynaptic PC cells also results in reduced IPSC frequency, together supporting that this trans-synaptic complex regulates GABAergic synaptic formation or maturation. The authors then show that sparse Kit ligand overexpression in PCs decreases neighboring uninfected control sIPSCs in a potential competitive manner.</p><p>Strengths: Overall, the study addresses an important open question, the data largely supports the authors conclusions, the experiments appear well-performed, and the manuscript is well-written. I just have a few suggestions to help shore up the author's interpretations and improve the study.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>The strong decrease in sIPSC frequency and amplitude in control uninfected cells in Figure 4 is surprising and puzzling. The competition model proposed is one possibility, and I think the authors need to do additional experiments to help support or refute this model. The authors can conduct similar synaptic staining experiments as in Fig S4 but in their sparse infection paradigm, comparing synapses on infected and uninfected cells. Additional electrophysiological parameters in the sparse injection paradigm, such as mIPSCs or evoked IPSCs, would also help support their conclusions.</p><p>The authors should validate KL overexpression and increased cell surface levels using their virus to support their overexpression conclusions.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="author-comment" id="sa4"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.89792.3.sa4</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author Response</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Zaman</surname><given-names>Tariq</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Michigan State University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Grand Rapids</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Vogt</surname><given-names>Daniel</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Michigan State University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Grand Rapids</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Prokop</surname><given-names>Jeremy W</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Office of Research, Corewell Health</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Grand Rapids</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Alsabia</surname><given-names>Qusai Abdulkhaliq</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Michigan State University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Grand Rapids</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Simms</surname><given-names>Gabriel R</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Michigan State University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Grand Rapids</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Stafford</surname><given-names>April M</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Michigan State University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Grand Rapids</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Luikart</surname><given-names>Bryan</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Geisel School of Medicine at Dartmouth</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Hanover</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Williams</surname><given-names>Michael R</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Michigan State University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Grand Rapids</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>The following is the authorsâ response to the original reviews.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for The Authors):</bold></p><p>Major comments:</p><p>1. The immunolabeling data in Figure S4 shows no change in puncta number but reduced puncta size in Kit KO. sIPSC data show reduced frequency but little change in amplitude. These data would seem contradictory in that one suggests reduced synaptic strength, but not number, and the other suggests reduced synapse number, but not strength. How do the authors reconcile these results?</p></disp-quote><p>Regarding the synaptic puncta, In Kit KO (or KL KO), we have not detected an overt reduction in the average VGAT/Gephyrin/Calbindin positive puncta density or puncta size per animal. With respect to puncta size, only in the Kit KO condition, and only when individual puncta are assessed does this modest (~10%) difference in size become statistically significant. In the revision, we eliminate this figure and focus on the per animal averages.</p><p>We interpret that the reduction in sIPSC and mIPSC frequency likely stems from a decreased proportion of functional synapse sites. The number of MLIs, their action potential generation, the density of synaptic puncta, and the ability of direct stimulation to evoke release and equivalent postsynaptic currents, are all similar in Control vs Kit KO. It is therefore feasible that a reduced frequency of postsynaptic inhibitory events is due to a reduced ability of MLI action potentials to invade the axon terminal, and/or an impaired ability for depolarization to drive (e.g. coordinated calcium flux) transmitter release. That is, while the number of MLIs and their synapses appear similar, the reduced mIPSC frequency suggests that there is a reduced proportion of, or probability that, Kit KO synapse sites that function properly.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. Related to point 1, it would be helpful to see immunolabeling data from Kit ligand KO mice? Do these show the same pattern of reduced puncta size but no change in number?</p></disp-quote><p>Although we have not added a figure, we have now added experiments and a corresponding analysis in the manuscript. As we had previously for Kit KO, we now for KL KO conducted IHC for VGAT, Gephyrin, and Calbindin, and we analyzed triple-positive synaptic puncta in the molecular layer of Pcp2 Cre KL KO mice and Control (Pcp2 Cre negative, KL floxed homozygous) mice. We did not find a gross reduction in the average synaptic puncta size or density, or in the PSD-95 pinceau size. From this initial analysis, it appears that the presynaptic hypotrophy is more notable in the receptor than in the ligand knockout. We speculate that this is perhaps because the Kit receptor may have basal activity in the absence of Kit ligand, that Kit may serve a presynaptic scaffolding role that is lost in the receptor (but not the ligand) knockout, or simply that the embryonic timing of the Pax2 Cre vs Pcp2 Cre recombination events is more relevant to pinceaux development, especially as basket cells are born primarily prenatally.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. The data using KL overexpression in PC (figure 4E,F) are intriguing, but puzzling. The reduction in sIPSC frequency and amplitude in the control PC is much greater than seen in the Kit or KL KO. The interpretation of these data, &quot;Thus, KL-Kit levels may not set the number of MLI:PC release sites, but may instead influence the proportion of synapses that are functional for neurotransmission (Figure 4G)&quot; is not clear and the reasoning here should be explained in more detail, perhaps in the discussion.</p></disp-quote><p>We have attempted to clarify this portion of the manuscript by eliminating the cartoon of the proposed model, and by revising and adding to the discussion. Either MLI Kit KO or PC KL KO seems to preserve the absolute number of MLI:PC anatomical synapse sites (IHC) but to reduce the proportion of those synapse that are contributing to neurotransmission (mIPSC). We speculate that sparse PC KL overexpression (OX) may either (1) weaken inhibition to surrounding control PCs by either diminishing KL OX PC to KL Control PC inhibition, and/or (2) act retrogradely through MLI Kit to potentiate MLI:MLI inhibition, reducing the MLI:PC inhibition at neighboring Control PCs.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Minor comments:</p><p>1. In the first sentence of the results, should &quot;Figure 1A, B&quot; be &quot;Figure C, D&quot;?</p></disp-quote><p>Yes, corrected.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. The top of page 6 states &quot;the mean mIPSC amplitude was ~10% greater in PC KL KO than in control&quot;, this does not appear to be the case in Figure 3E. control and KL KO look very similar here.</p></disp-quote><p>In this portion of the text citing the modest 10% increase in mIPSC amplitude, we are referring to the average amplitude of all individual mIPSC events in the PC KL KO condition; in the figure referred to by the reviewer (3E), we are instead referring to the average of all mIPSC event amplitudes per KL KO PC. Because of the dramatic difference in sample size for individual events vs cells, this modest difference rises to statistical, if not biological, significance. We include this individual event analysis only to suggest that, since we in fact saw a slightly higher event amplitude in the KL KO condition, it is unlikely that a reduced amplitude would have been a technical reason that we detected a lower event frequency.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1.

For MLI action potential recordings, we opted to sample the middle third of the molecular layer so that we would not be completely biased to either classic distal stellate vs proximal basket subtypes. It is our hope, in future optogenetic interrogations, to simultaneously record the dynamics of all MLI subtypes in a more unbiased way. With respect to internal solutions, we initially utilized a cesium chloride internal to maximize our ability to resolve differences in GABAA mediated currents, which was the hypothesis-driven focus of our study. While we agree that utilizing a single internal and changing the voltage clamp to arrive at per-cell analysis of Excitatory/Inhibitory input would have been most informative, our decision to utilize pharmacological methods was driven by our experience that achieving adequate voltage clamp across large Purkinje cells was often problematic, particularly in adult animals.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Introduction:</p><p>In the introduction, the authors state that inactivating Kit contributes to neurological dysfunction - their examples highlight neurological, psychiatric, and neurodevelopmental conditions.</p></disp-quote><p>The language has been changed.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>General:</p><p>Using violin plots illustrates the data distribution better than bar graphs/SEM.</p></disp-quote><p>We have included violin plots throughout, and we have changed p values to numeric values, both in the interest of presenting the totality of the data more clearly.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Synapses 'onto' PCs sounds more common than 'upon' PCs.</p></disp-quote><p>We have changed the wording throughout.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 1:</p><p>1F - there seems to be an antero-posterior gradient of Kit expression.</p></disp-quote><p>Though not explicitly pursued in the manuscript, it is possible that such a gradient may reflect differences in the timing of the genesis and maturation of the cerebellum along the AP axis.

To the reviewerâs valid point however, we intend to probe the spatial extent/specificity of the sparse phenomenon when we are resourced to complement the KL/Kit manipulations with transgenic methods for evaluating MLI-PC synapses specifically, potentially by GRASP or related methods that would not be confounded by PC-PC synapses.
