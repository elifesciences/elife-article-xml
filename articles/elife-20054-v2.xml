If the level of oxygen in the brain decreases – for example when a blood vessel becomes blocked – neurons begin to die, and permanent brain damage can result. A shortage of oxygen first causes sodium ion channels within the surface membrane of the neurons to open. Sodium ions then flow into the cells through these open channels to trigger a cascade of events inside the cells that ultimately results in their death.</p><p>Plant et al. now reveal how oxygen deficiency, otherwise known as hypoxia, rapidly increases the flow of sodium ions into brain cells. By inducing hypoxia in neurons from the rat brain, Plant et al. show that a lack of oxygen causes the SUMOylation – a process whereby a series of enzymes work together to attach a Small Ubiquitin-like Modifier (or SUMO) protein – of specific sodium ion channels in under a minute. The channels linked to the SUMO protein, a subtype called Na<sub>V</sub>1.2, open more readily than unmodified channels, allowing more sodium ions to enter the neurons.</p><p>Plant et al. study granule cells of the cerebellum, the most numerous type of neuron in the human brain. Further investigation is required to determine if SUMOylation of Na<sub>V</sub>1.2 channels underlies the response of other neurons to hypoxia as well. It also remains to be discovered whether molecules that block the SUMOylation of Na<sub>V</sub>1.2 channels, or that prevent the flow of sodium ions through these channels, could reduce the number of brain cells that die in low-oxygen conditions such as strokes.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.20054.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.20054.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>SUMO</kwd><kwd>SCN2A</kwd><kwd>hypoxia</kwd><kwd>stroke</kwd><kwd>ischemia</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd><italic>E. coli</italic></kwd><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Rat</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01NS058505</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Goldstein</surname><given-names>Steven AN</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01NS056313</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Marks</surname><given-names>Jeremy D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The immediate response of the brain to a sudden, harmful drop in oxygen supply is the addition of SUMO proteins to sodium ion channels in neurons, increasing their activity.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Acute hypoxia contributes to brain damage arising from such common conditions as stroke, heart attack, and head trauma. In humans, decreased cerebral blood flow (ischemia) resulting in acute neuronal hypoxia correlates with pathological changes in electroencephalographic recordings and decreased electrical signaling in less than 150 s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Sundt et al., 1981</xref>). At the cellular level, the first effect of hypoxia is to increase <italic>I<sub>Na</sub></italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Boening et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Stys et al., 1992</xref>); this precedes a series of events that include depolarization of the plasma membrane, excitotoxic elevation of intracellular calcium, mitochondrial dysfunction, ATP depletion, increased production of reactive oxygen species and, ultimately, cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Leao, 1944</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hansen, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Choi, 1990</xref>). While these downstream effects have been well studied, the early hypoxia-induced change in Na<sup>+</sup> flux has received less attention despite strong evidence to support its critical role in the hypoxic insult: inhibition of <italic>I<sub>Na</sub></italic> by tetrodotoxin (TTX) attenuates hypoxia-induced depolarization and reduces neuronal death in the hippocampus, hypothalamus, and neocortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Boening et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Stys et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Weber and Taylor, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Xie et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Taylor et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Fung et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Horn and Waldrop, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Raley-Susman et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Banasiak et al., 2004</xref>).

These channels are mixed complexes comprised of one α-subunit (~2000 residues), which contains four voltage sensor domains and one ion conduction pore, and smaller β-subunits that modify function. Of the ten genes for α-subunits in mammals, four are predominant in the central nervous system including SCN2a, which encodes Na<sub>V</sub>1.2, an α-subunit that is widely distributed in the brain. SCN2a mutations are associated with epilepsy and febrile seizures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Shi et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>SUMOylation is the enzyme-mediated, post-translational linkage of one of three SUMO isoforms to the ε-amino group of specific Lys residues on a target protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Henley et al., 2014</xref>). Present in all eukaryotic cells, the SUMO pathway was recognized to regulate the trafficking and activity of nuclear transcription factors when we discovered it to operate as well at the plasma membrane to regulate neuronal excitability via direct SUMOylation of K<sup>+</sup> channel α-subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Rajan et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Plant et al., 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">2012</xref>). Here, seeking to determine if the SUMO pathway also regulated sodium channels, we documented SUMOylation of Na<sub>V</sub>1.2 channels in CGN and then recognized it to be the basis for acute, hypoxic augmentation of <italic>I<sub>Na</sub></italic>.</p><p>To establish the mechanism, we studied rat CGN using whole-cell voltage-clamp, and observed hypoxia to increase <italic>I<sub>Na</sub></italic> to a new steady-state level in &lt;40 s due to an excitatory, leftward shift in the voltage required to activate the current. The shift was recapitulated by application of SUMO1 under normoxic conditions and suppressed by the deSUMOylating enzyme SENP1. Consistent with tonic control of <italic>I<sub>Na</sub></italic> by the SUMO pathway, SUMO1 and SENP1 increased and decreased the current, respectively, under normoxic conditions. The response of <italic>I<sub>Na</sub></italic> to hypoxia was ablated by µ–Conotoxin-TIIIA (CnTX), a potent blocker of Na<sub>V</sub>1.2 channels. Supporting the implied mechanism—rapid SUMOylation of Na<sub>V</sub>1.2 channels at the CGN plasma membrane in response to hypoxia—hypoxia was directly shown to increase the interaction of native SUMO1 and Na<sub>V</sub>1.2 at the neuronal surface using antibody-mediated fluorescent resonance energy transfer (amFRET) microscopy and ground state depletion, stochastic optical reconstruction super-resolution microscopy (STORM). SUMOylation of Na<sub>V</sub>1.2 on Lys38 was shown to be necessary and sufficient to explain the changes in <italic>I<sub>Na</sub></italic> induced by hypoxia by reconstitution of the hypoxic response in Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells using heterologously expressed subunits. Further, study of live CHO cells in real-time using total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy revealed that acute hypoxia leads to monoSUMOylation of single Na<sub>V</sub>1.2 channels already at the plasma membrane without a change in the number of channels on the surface.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Hypoxia rapidly increases CGN <italic>I<sub>Na</sub></italic></title><p>In ambient (21%) O<sub>2</sub>, CGN <italic>I<sub>Na</sub></italic> activated and inactivated rapidly, showing the expected biophysical properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Diwakar et al., 2009</xref>), including a mean peak <italic>I<sub>Na</sub></italic> of −172 ± 20 pA/pF at −20 mV, a half-maximal activation voltage (<italic>V<sub>½</sub></italic>) of −23 ± 0.5 mV, and a steady-state inactivation midpoint (SSI) of −67 ± 2 mV, the last parameter a measure of the number of channels available to pass current (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>).

rid="bib31">Plant et al., 2011</xref>) and suppressed <italic>I<sub>Kso</sub></italic> in CGN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Plant et al., 2012</xref>) due to SUMOylation of their pore-forming channel α-subunits, K<sub>V</sub>2.1 and K2P1, respectively. Moreover, we found that the enzymes that mature, activate, and conjugate SUMO to the channels reside on the cytosolic face of the plasma membrane in tissue culture cells and neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Plant et al., 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">2012</xref>). Here, seeking evidence for regulation of <italic>I<sub>Na</sub></italic> by the SUMO pathway, we delivered 100 pm SUMO1 into CGN via the patch-pipette, a concentration that produces maximal effects on the K<sup>+</sup> channels. We observed SUMO-induced changes in <italic>I<sub>Na</sub></italic> like those produced by acute hypoxia: peak <italic>I<sub>Na</sub></italic> increased by ~76% and <italic>V<sub>½</sub></italic> and SSI were left-shifted by −13 ± 1 mV and −10 ± 3 mV, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c,d</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>).

Supporting the notion that rapid changes in <italic>I<sub>Na</sub></italic> were due to shifts in the conductance-voltage (G-V) relationship, rather than changes in the number of channels on the surface passing current or unitary channel conductance, maximal currents at 0 mV, a voltage where G-V relationships were saturated under all test conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b and d</xref>), were not significantly different for CGN at 21% O<sub>2</sub> with the three pipette solutions (i.e. control, SUMO1, or SENP1) or on acute exposure to 5% O<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). Indicating that the SUMO pathway exerted tonic control over <italic>I<sub>Na</sub></italic> under normoxic conditions, CGN studied with control pipette solution rested midway between the <italic>V<sub>½</sub></italic> extremes.

First, rat CGN were confirmed to tolerate long-term culture in 7% O<sub>2</sub>, as we previously observed for rat hippocampal neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Shelat et al., 2013</xref>). Next, CGN cultured for 7–10 days at 7% O<sub>2</sub> were evaluated at 7% O<sub>2</sub> and then on exposure to 1.5% O<sub>2</sub>; the decrease in O<sub>2</sub> led to an acute increase in mean peak <italic>I<sub>Na</sub></italic> of ~65% and, starting from a baseline for <italic>V<sub>½</sub></italic> of −42 ± 1.5 mV and −57 ± 3 mV, <italic>V<sub>½</sub></italic> and SSI were left-shifted by −8 ± 2 mV and −11 ± 3 mV, respectively.

Among 133 Lys residues in the Na<sub>V</sub>1.2 α-subunit, a sensitive predictive tool, GPS-SUMO (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Zhao et al., 2014</xref>), identified Lys38 as one of just five potential SUMOylation sites.

However, in contrast with CFP-Na<sub>V</sub>1.2, the mutant failed to exhibit FRET with either YFP-SUMO1 or YFP-Ubc9. The absence of FRET supported the conclusion that Lys38 was required for SUMOylation of the Na<sub>V</sub>1.2 channel complex and suggested that no other Lys in the α subunit or the β1 subunit was subject to SUMOylation.</p><p>Next, we observed that acute hypoxia altered the function of wild type Na<sub>V</sub>1.2 channels expressed in CHO cells in the same manner as seen for native <italic>I<sub>Na</sub></italic> in CGN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>).

surface only at sites where CFP-Na<sub>V</sub>1.2 channels were already present and without altering the number of channels at the surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8a,b</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>). Here, surface density and localization of CFP-Na<sub>V</sub>1.2 and mCherry-SUMO1 subunits were assessed using TIRF and pixel-by-pixel analysis at room temperature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Manders et al., 1993</xref>), a method we have applied to quantify the surface density and co-assembly of cardiac K<sup>+</sup> channel α and β subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Plant et al., 2014</xref>). In ambient O<sub>2</sub>, just 16% of channel pixels were localized with mCherry-SUMO1 (67 ± 6/µm<sup>2</sup>) and 84% were observed to be unmodified (340 ± 16/µm<sup>2</sup>). After 2 min of hypoxia, an additional 50% of channel pixels were localized with mCherry-SUMO1, increasing the total to 65% (265 ± 12/µm<sup>2</sup>) with 35% unmodified by the tagged SUMO (137 ± 8/µm<sup>2</sup>). Although hypoxia increased the surface density of mCherry-SUMO1 associated with CFP-Na<sub>V</sub>1.2 by ~4-fold, there was no change in the level of CFP-Na<sub>V</sub>1.2 (407/µm<sup>2</sup> versus 402/µm<sup>2</sup>) and free mCherry-SUMO1 on the surface remained at low levels (4/µm<sup>2</sup> versus 12/µm<sup>2</sup>). During 20 min of post-hypoxia recovery in ambient O<sub>2</sub>, the total number of CFP-Na<sub>V</sub>1.2 surface particles decreased by ~10% without a change in the fraction of channels localized with mCherry-SUMO1 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>). Because current density decreased by just ~2% over the same period, we suspected that the decrease in fluorescent Na<sub>V</sub>1.2 particles on the surface was due to CFP photobleaching, in-keeping with the idea that neither acute hypoxia-induced SUMOylation nor re-oxygenation led to net addition or removal of CFP-Na<sub>V</sub>1.2 channels from the CHO cell plasma membrane; a conclusion supported as well by the similar size of CFP-Na<sub>V</sub>1.2 currents recorded at 0 mV in ambient O<sub>2</sub> and 5% O<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1a</xref>).<fig id="fig8" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.20054.014</object-id><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Hypoxic SUMOylation of Na<sub>V</sub>1.2 and current density proceed concurrently.</title><p>CFP-Na<sub>V</sub>1.2 or CFP-Na<sub>V</sub>1.2-Lys38Gln (K38Q, blue) channels and SUMO1 tagged with mCherry (m-SUMO1, red) were studied in CHO cells by TIRFM and pixel-by-pixel analysis performed as described in the Materials and methods. Briefly, images were captured at 5 s intervals and data for each fluorophore saved as separate stacks; the background was subtracted and processed for misalignment in an identical manner. Manders’ coefficients were assessed post-hoc for 3–5 regions per cell. Co-localization was defined as the presence of both fluorophores at more than 30% of the maximum fluorescence level recorded in that stack (and their overlap is represented in the images as white pixels). The time-course of hypoxic modulation of Na<sub>V</sub>1.2 current in moving from O<sub>2</sub> of 21% to 5% was studied with steps from –100 mV to −20 mV every 10 s and normalized to cell capacitance (pA/pF).

After 40 s of hypoxia, rapid recruitment of SUMO1 (bottom, left) to the surface is observed to be at sites with Na<sub>V</sub>1.2 channels (bottom, left).

Hypoxia increased co-localization to 268 ± 12 pixels per µm<sup>2</sup> and decreased the density of free Na<sub>V</sub>1.2 channels (139 ± 8) without altering the density of free SUMO1 (12 ± 2).

That the entire population of surface CFP-Na<sub>V</sub>1.2 channels was not SUMOylated despite ongoing hypoxia suggested that either ~20–35% of the channels were already modified on Lys38 by native, non-fluorescent SUMO in ambient O<sub>2</sub>, and hence not reported by the assays, or these channels were resistant to SUMOylation if, like some other targets, SUMO modification of Na<sub>V</sub>1.2 can be down-regulated by prior phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Konopacki et al., 2011</xref>), ubiquitination, methylation, or acetylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hendriks et al., 2014</xref>). The rough concordance of the increase in current-density (~70%, <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>) and in the fraction of newly SUMOylated channels in response to hypoxia (~50–60%) should be noted with some caution because the intracellular cesium fluoride solution used for recording Na<sup>+</sup> currents is very different from the native cytosolic milieu of intact cells studied with TIRF.</p><p>Finally, we confirmed that hypoxia-induced SUMOylation of CFP-Na<sub>V</sub>1.2 in CHO cells was not triggered secondary to an increase in Na<sup>+</sup> flux through the channels by showing that the increase in surface levels mCherry-SUMO1 in response to acute hypoxia, and its co-localization with CFP-Na<sub>V</sub>1.2, were insensitive to 5 µm TTX, a concentration that inhibited &gt;95% of the Na<sup>+</sup> current (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8f</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Here, we show that SUMOylation of Na<sub>V</sub>1.2 channels at the plasma membrane underlies the immediate increase in <italic>I<sub>Na</sub></italic> in response to acute hypoxia in cultured neurons and CHO cells. Previously, we demonstrated that SUMOylation increases excitability by suppressing the activity of background K<sup>+</sup> channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Rajan et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Plant et al., 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">2012</xref>) and voltage-gated K<sup>+</sup> channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Plant et al., 2011</xref>) that stabilize cells below firing threshold and restore cells to baseline after excitatory events, respectively. Now, we report that SUMOylation augments the activity of voltage-gated Na<sub>V</sub> channels that initiate and propagate action potentials, expanding the known targets through which the SUMO pathway can regulate neuronal activity. In addition, while chronic stressors, including low tissue oxygenation, have been associated with global changes in SUMOylation, this is the first report, to our knowledge, to demonstrate rapid modulation of the SUMO pathway over just 10’s of s.</p><p>Hypoxia increases the SUMOylated fraction of Na<sub>V</sub>1.2 channels at the cell surface in both CGN and CHO cells ~4-fold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">8</xref>). Further, hypoxia or SUMO in the pipette shift the <italic>V<sub>½</sub></italic> of channel activation and SSI leftward, increasing Na<sup>+</sup> current in response to depolarization by ~70% in both cell types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). Consistent with tonic regulation by the SUMO pathway of both CGN <italic>I<sub>Na</sub></italic> and Na<sub>V</sub>1.2 in CHO cells, V<sub>½</sub> in ambient O<sub>2</sub> rests midway between the SUMOylating and deSUMOylating experimental conditions; the full excursion in <italic>V<sub>½</sub></italic> between the two conditions was ~27 mV in both cell types; and SENP1 decreased Na<sup>+</sup> current from baseline by ~75% in both cases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>).

Together, the following observations support the notion that hypoxia acts directly via SUMOylation of Na<sub>V</sub>1.2 Lys38: modification of Lys38 is demonstrated directly by FRET and MS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>); hypoxia does not alter the current passed by Na<sub>V</sub>1.2-Lys38Gln channels nor <italic>I<sub>Na</sub></italic> in neurons pretreated with SUMO1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref>); hypoxia cannot overcome suppression of <italic>I<sub>Na</sub></italic> by SENP1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref>); and, the time-course of SUMOylation of Lys38 matches the increase in Na<sub>V</sub>1.2 currents observed when CHO cells are subjected to hypoxia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). That hypoxia-mediated SUMOylation of Na<sub>V</sub>1.2 is observed in the presence of TTX shows that Na<sup>+</sup> flux is not a prerequisite for channel SUMOylation. These findings offer a molecular rationale for acute, hypoxia-induced increases in the activity of neuronal Na<sub>V</sub> channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Boening et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Horn and Waldrop, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Raley-Susman et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hammarström and Gage, 2000</xref>), a well-known trigger for the subsequent cascade of pathological events leading to cellular injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Banasiak et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fung and Haddad, 1997</xref>).</p><p>Even short periods of hypoxia can diminish neuronal viability and perturb physiology.

Because inhibition of <italic>I<sub>Na</sub></italic> by TTX reduces hypoxia-induced death in neuronal cultures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Boening et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Stys et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Weber and Taylor, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Xie et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Taylor et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Fung et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Horn and Waldrop, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Raley-Susman et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Banasiak et al., 2004</xref>), the response we study here — acute hypoxic recruitment of SUMO to Na<sub>V</sub>1.2 channels leading to increased CGN <italic>I<sub>Na</sub></italic>— might be expected to be deleterious. However, neuronal pathology depends on the etiology, severity, and duration of the insult (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Puyal et al., 2013</xref>). Thus, increased <italic>I<sub>Na</sub></italic> may be self-limiting (or protective) if it leads to membrane depolarization, inducing Na<sub>V</sub> channel inactivation and, thereby, limits subsequent Na<sup>+</sup> flux. Consistent with this notion, we previously found that acute hypoxic challenge induces membrane depolarization when rat CGN were studied in current-clamp mode (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Plant et al., 2002</xref>).</p><p>Indeed, chronic stressors that increase the level of SUMOylated proteins in cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Shao et al., 2004</xref>), including the transcription factor HIF1α (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cheng et al., 2007</xref>), and modify global patterns of SUMOylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cimarosti et al., 2012</xref>) have been inferred to be cytoprotective in cases where gene regulation and protein turnover are altered to conserve energy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Henley et al., 2014</xref>). Thus, ground squirrel hibernation torpor, a model system for studying tissue protection during decreased blood flow and oxygen delivery, is associated with more SUMOylation in the brain, liver, and kidneys (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lee et al., 2007</xref>). Also consistent with a long-term protective role, cortical neurons isolated from mice and subjected to oxygen-glucose deprivation show decreased survival when the translation of SUMO2/3 is suppressed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Datwyler et al., 2011</xref>), and increasing SUMOylation by overexpression of Ubc9 is protective in a mouse model of focal cerebral ischemic damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lee et al., 2011</xref>). This report on acute regulation of Na<sub>V</sub>1.2 by hypoxia joins an emerging body of work exploring the roles of SUMOylation in the nervous system in health and disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Henley et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cimarosti and Henley, 2008</xref>).</p><p>Neuronal excitability is determined by the interplay of currents that depolarize and restore the membrane to resting potential. It is notable, therefore, that the immediate effects of ion channel SUMOylation we have observed thus far are excitatory. Here, we show that SUMOylation increases <italic>I<sub>Na</sub></italic> in rat CGN, favoring depolarization and action potential firing. Our earlier work on <italic>I<sub>Kso</sub></italic> in rat CGN carried by channels with K2P1 subunits showed SUMOylation to decrease that background K<sup>+</sup> conductance that stabilizes cells below firing threshold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Plant et al., 2012</xref>). So, too, we found SUMOylation to suppress the voltage-gated, delayed-rectifier K<sup>+</sup> current <italic>I<sub>DR</sub></italic> in rat hippocampal neurons that speeds recovery after excitatory events, due to a rightward shift in the G-V relationship for activation of K<sub>V</sub>2.1 channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Plant et al., 2011</xref>). Of note, we found that SUMO did not regulate hippocampal pyramidal cell <italic>I<sub>Na</sub></italic>, a current carried predominantly Na<sub>V</sub>1.1 and Na<sub>V</sub>1.6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gong et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Vacher et al., 2008</xref>). This suggests that SUMO regulation of Na<sub>V</sub> channels may be isoform-specific, a notion supported by the failure of the small amount of <italic>I<sub>Na</sub></italic> in rat CGN that was not carried by Na<sub>V</sub>1.2 to respond to hypoxia, SUMO1 or SENP1, a current we attribute primarily to Na<sub>V</sub>1.6 based on its pharmacology.</p><p>Here, we observe that Na<sub>V</sub>1.2 current remains elevated due to SUMOylation for at least 10–20 min following return to ambient O<sub>2</sub> in both CGN and CHO cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref>). In contrast, an acute hypoxic challenge to hypothalamic neurons induced an increase in Na<sub>V</sub> current that recovered when the cells were returned to normoxia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Horn and Waldrop, 2000</xref>). While different targets have been reported to be SUMOylated in a stable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bernier-Villamor et al., 2002</xref>) or labile (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Lang, 2015</xref>) fashion, it is not necessarily the case that the response in hypothalamic neurons is mediated by the SUMO pathway and, thus, those findings may represent the operation of other Na<sub>V</sub> channel subtypes, differential effects of cellular history and environment, or variations in experimental strategies. Indeed, the cellular effects of hypoxia on neurons are numerous and those with significant influence should be expected to vary acutely and over time as well as by cell type.</p><p>Some of the limits of this study include that we evaluate CGN in vitro, isolated from their rich native environment and neuronal inputs. Furthermore, the kinetics of channel activity and SUMOylation-deSUMOylation we measure here at room temperature will be slower than the rates in vivo. Further, CGN cultures do not contain Purkinje cells or, as a result, the parallel fibers that arise from CGN to form synapses with Purkinje cells. Because parallel fibers are rich in Na<sub>V</sub>1.2 channels, our studies may underestimate the effects of Na<sub>V</sub>1.2-SUMOylation in response to hypoxia in the cerebellum. Moreover, we employ standard, potassium-free, recording solutions to study <italic>I<sub>Na</sub></italic> and, therefore, <italic>I<sub>Kso</sub></italic>, a rat CGN current we previously showed to be responsive to hypoxia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Plant et al., 2002</xref>), was not evaluated in this work.</p><p>Despite extensive discovery efforts, medications offering broad neuroprotective efficacy in patients with brain hypoxia and ischemia are lacking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Rogalewski et al., 2006</xref>). The reasons underlying this therapeutic deficit reflect, in part, the complexity and variety of neurotoxic challenges. Our findings suggest that Na<sub>V</sub>1.2 channels and SUMO pathway enzymes may be valuable therapeutic targets for reducing damage due to acute hypoxic insults to central neurons.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Molecular biology and reagents</title><p>Rat Na<sub>V</sub>1.2 (NM_012647.1) was handled in pcDNA1, as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Plant et al., 2006</xref>).

Experiments were performed 36 to 48 hr post transfection at room temperature. The rat β1 accessory subunit was co-expressed with Na<sub>V</sub>1.2 subunits unless otherwise indicated. CGN were cultured from 6 to 8 day old Sprague-Dawley rat pups (Charles River, Wilmington, MA; RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/RGD_734476">RGD_734476</ext-link>) as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Plant et al., 2002</xref>). Briefly, the cerebellum was isolated, cut into ~300 µm cubes, triturated with a fire-polished Pasteur pipette and incubated for 15 min at 37°C with 2.5 mg/ml trypsin in PBS. Digestion was halted by the addition of PBS containing 0.1 mg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, 2000 U/ml DNase I and 1 mm MgCl<sub>2</sub>.

Cultured CGN or CHO cells were superfused with a solution comprising (in mm): NaCl 130, CsCl 4, CaCl<sub>2</sub> 2, MgCl<sub>2</sub> 1.2, glucose 5.5, HEPES 10 and, 100 µM CdCl<sub>2</sub>, a concentration previously shown to block &gt;98% of voltage-gated calcium channel current in CGN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Pearson et al., 1993</xref>). The pH was adjusted to 7.4 with NaOH and HCl. Cells were studied at room temperature with borosilicate glass pipettes (Warner, Hamden, CT) with a resistance of 2–3 MΩ when filled with a solution comprising (in mm): CsCl 60, CsF 80, CaCl<sub>2</sub> 1, MgCl<sub>2</sub> 1, Na<sub>2</sub>ATP 5, EGTA 10, HEPES 10, pH 7.4 with CsOH. Pipettes were coated with Sylgard (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MI) prior to use. Capacitance artifacts were subtracted online, series resistance was compensated to 70% and cells with a series resistance of less than 10 MΩ were studied. Current-voltage relationships were evoked from a holding potential of −100 mV by 30 ms test pulses between −75 and 20 mV, in 5 mV increments. Steady-state inactivation was studied by holding cells at −100 mV and then comparing currents evoked by 30 ms test pulses between −110 mV and 0 mV to those evoked by a 50 ms prepulse to 0 ms. A 10-s interpulse interval was used in both cases. Normalized peak current values are plotted against prepulse potential (mV). A Boltzmann function, <italic>I</italic> = <italic>I<sub>max</sub></italic>/(1 + exp[V – V<sub>½</sub>/<italic>k</italic>]), where <italic>I<sub>max</sub></italic> is the maximum current and <italic>k</italic> is slope factor, was used to fit normalized activation-voltage relationships. Recovery from fast inactivation was studied by holding cells at −100 mV and comparing currents evoked by a pair of 30 ms test step to −20 mV separated by an interpulse interval that increased in duration by 30 ms increments per sweep. The time constant for recovery from inactivation (τ<sub>Recovery</sub>) was obtained from mono-exponential fits of the normalized current amplitude to the recovery time using I = I<sub>0</sub> + A(<sub>exp</sub><sup>(<italic>t</italic>/τRecovery)</sup>), where A is the amplitude of components and <italic>t</italic> is time. Whole-cell currents were normalized to cell capacitance. Mean ± S.E.M. capacitance values were 6 ± 2 pF for CGN and 11.5 ± 2 pF for CHO cells.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Acute hypoxia for electrophysiology</title><p>Acute hypoxia was achieved as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Plant et al., 2002</xref>). Briefly, the cells were made hypoxic (5% or 1.5% O<sub>2</sub> as indicated) by switching the perfusate with one that had been bubbled with nitrogen for at least 30 min prior to perfusion. Oxygen tension was measured at the cell by a polarized carbon fiber electrode; solution exchange occurred in less than 10 s.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Two-color TIRFM</title><p>Single protein complexes at the surface of live CHO cells were identified using TIRFM as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Plant et al., 2014</xref>). Cells were studied in a solution comprising (in mm): NaCl 130, KCl 4, MgCl<sub>2</sub> 1.2, CaCl<sub>2</sub> 2, HEPES 10, pH was adjusted to 7.4 with NaOH. The critical angle for TIRF was adjusted using a CellTIRF illuminator (Olympus, Waltham, MA) and a high numerical aperture apochromat objective (150x, 1.45 NA) mounted on an automated fluorescence microscope controlled by Metamorph software (Molecular Devices). For simultaneous illumination of two fluorophores, CellTIRF software (Olympus) was used to adjust the critical angle for each excitation wavelength to generate evanescent waves of equivalent depth (100 nm). mCherry was excited by a 561 nm laser line and CFP was excited a 445 nm laser line. When CFP was studied with mCherry the emitted light signals were split using a 520 nm dichroic mirror mounted in a DualView adapter (Photometrics, Tucson, AZ), and each wavelength was directed to one-half of an EM-CCD. The dichroic mirror was disengaged when single fluorophores were studied.</p><p>To assess stoichiometry, fluorophores were photobleached by continual excitation and data were captured as movies of 100–400 frames acquired at 1 Hz. When CFP was studied with mCherry in the same cell, the data for each fluorophore were saved as separate stacks and processed in an identical manner. Images were background corrected by subtracting the mean of five fully bleached frames from the end of each stack analyzed. Misalignment of the data between stacks was corrected in ImageJ using StackReg. Fluorescent spots were defined as a discrete 3 × 3 pixel region around a pixel of maximum intensity, as before (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Plant et al., 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">2014</xref>). Fluorescence is reported as the change in fluorescence intensity normalized by the initial fluorescence for each trace. The density of co-localized and single fluor-fluorescent particles was determined following thresholding and watershed separation in ImageJ. The particle number was counted in 4, separate 100 by 100 pixel regions of interest for 6–10 cells per group using the Analyze particles plugin.</p><p>Manders’ coefficient of colocalization was assessed from live-cell simultaneous two-color TIRF images captured at 5 s intervals to minimize photobleaching. Data stacks were background subtracted and aligned for each fluorophore post-hoc, as above. Co-localization of partner pixels from the two stacks of images was defined as the presence of both fluorophores with at least 30% of maximum fluorescence levels recorded in that region of interest. Mean Manders’ coefficients were calculated for 3–5 separate 100 by 100 pixel regions of interest per cell.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>amFRET immunocytochemistry and microscopy</title><p>Double immunostaining for SUMO1 (RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_2198257">AB_2198257</ext-link>) and Na<sub>V</sub>1.2 (RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_10673401">AB_10673401</ext-link>), or the housekeeping gene, GAD67 (RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_2278725">AB_2278725</ext-link>) was performed to allow measurement of FRET between secondary antibodies labeled with Alexa 488 and Alexa 594, employed as FRET donor and acceptor fluorophores, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Plant et al., 2011</xref>). CGN were permeabilized with digitonin (20 mg/ml) in a HEPES-buffered solution matching the intracellular ionic composition containing EGTA (1 mm) and a cocktail of protease inhibitors (N-methylmaleimide, PMSF, aprotinin, leupeptin, antipain, and pepstatin A), and then fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde for 30 min. SUMO1 or GAD67 were detected with highly cross-adsorbed donkey anti-rabbit IgG (1 µg/ml, Thermo Fisher), labeled with Alexa 594 to act as the FRET acceptor. Na<sub>V</sub>1.2 antibody binding was detected with highly cross-adsorbed donkey anti-goat IgG (1 µg/ml, Thermo Fisher) labeled with Alexa 488 to act as a FRET donor. Neurons were exposed to hypoxia by overnight equilibration of dishes of HCO<sub>3</sub>-buffered saline matching the osmolality and ionic composition of the culture media in an environmental chamber (Coy Laboratory Products, Grass Lake, MI) with an atmosphere of 1% O<sub>2</sub> and 5% CO<sub>2</sub> at 37°C. Neurons on coverslips were immersed in the hypoxic buffer for 5 min and were then permeabilized and fixed in similarly equilibrated HCO<sub>3</sub>-buffered intracellular saline containing digitonin.</p><p>For amFRET microscopy, neurons were imaged with a 60x, NA 1.40 oil objective on a Leica SP5 laser scanning confocal microscope with identical illumination acquisition settings across staining conditions. Sequential confocal images of Alexa 488 and Alexa 594 were obtained using laser lines at 488 nm and 546 nm, respectively. The Leica Acceptor Photobleaching Wizard was used to obtain pre-bleach images of donor (Na<sub>V</sub>1.2, Alexa 488) and acceptor (SUMO1 or GAD67, Alexa 594) intensities to create a region to bleach on the donor subunit image; to bleach the Alexa 594 fluorescence within the region (200 passes of full laser power); and to obtain post-bleaching images of Alexa 488 and Alexa 594 fluorescence. Image pairs demonstrating a focus shift between pre- and post-bleaching images were excluded. Twelve-bit raw confocal images were deconvolved using Huygens Deconvolution software (Scientific Volume Imaging, Hilversum, Netherlands) and Maximum Likelihood Estimation with a signal-to-noise ratio of 20. Using ImageJ, raw Alexa 488 images were de-noised, and FRET efficiency images within the bleaching regions created, on a voxel-by-voxel basis, by subtracting pre-bleach from post-bleach and then dividing the difference by the post-bleach intensity.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>STORM immunostaining and imaging</title><p>Cells were first double-immunostained for SUMO1 and Na<sub>V</sub>1.2 using the same antibodies as above. Secondary antibodies against anti-SUMO1 and anti-Na<sub>V</sub>1.2 were labeled here with Alexa 568 and Alexa 647, respectively. For permeabilization, digitonin was replaced with saponin (0.01%), which was present in all buffers during staining. To label the plasma membrane, cells were incubated in saponin-free buffer for 2 hr to allow the lipid membrane to regain its integrity and then incubated with biotin (2 mM) for 30 min, followed by Alexa 488-labeled streptavidin (5 μg/ml; Thermo Fisher) for 1 hr all at room temperature.</p><p>For microscopy, coverslips were mounted on slides in PBS containing cysteamine (MEA, 100 μM) and sealed with epoxy. Neurons were imaged on the stage of a Leica SR GSD 3D inverted microscope with a 160x, 1.43 NA objective. Fluorophores were sequentially excited, from red to blue, employing 642, 532, and 488 nm lasers, respectively, and individual fluorescent events imaged with an Andor iXon Ultra EMCCD over a 180 × 180 pixel region. For each fluorophore, images were collected at 56 Hz for at least 10 min. Image stacks were background subtracted and Gaussian blurred in FIJI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Schindelin et al., 2012</xref>), and reconstructed with the Thunderstorm Plug-in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Ovesný et al., 2014</xref>) to produce a list of fluorescent molecule localizations. Fluorescent events having X-Y uncertainty &gt;40 nm or a Z uncertainty &gt;400 nm were filtered out, and a 20-image stack of X-Y scatter plots to encompass a volume of 41 × 41 × 800 nm were produced for each fluorophore. Maximum Z-projections for each fluorophore were produced and overlaid and masks consisting of fluorescent events from all three fluorophores occurring in the same voxel were produced.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Live CHO cell FRET microscopy</title><p>Donor-decay time-course was studied as before (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Plant et al., 2010</xref>), using an automated Olympus IX81 epi-fluorescence microscope.

Protein was purified with Ni-NTA affinity columns to a yield of ~1 mg of Na<sub>V</sub>1.2<sub>1-336</sub>–SUMO1<sub>1-97</sub>T95K per 1 L media. In-gel protein trypsin digestion was performed after SDS-PAGE. Samples were analyzed with a Dionex Ultimate 3000 Nano-HPLC System (Sunnyvale, CA), Zorbax C18 trapping and analytical columns, and an LTQ-FT tandem MS instrument (Thermo Fisher) equipped with a nanospray source and a picotip nanospray needle (8 µm id tip; New Objectives, Woburn, MA) running Xcalibur software. Spectra were acquired using positive ion nano ESI mode with the FT-ICR acquiring precursor spectra from 250–1800 m/z at a resolution of 50000 at m/z 400. Tandem mass spectra were acquired in a data-dependent manner using the five most intense ions with charge states of +2 or higher from each FT-ICR MS scan to trigger the LTQ performance of collision-induced dissociation (CID) on each of the selected precursor ions using an activation Q of 0.25, a normalized collision energy of 35, and an activation time of 30 ms. The RAW data files from each run were processed with DTA supercharge to generate MGF peak list files and ReadW to produce binary mzXML files (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://tools.proteomecenter.org/software.php">http://tools.proteomecenter.org/software.php</ext-link>). MGF files were submitted to a Mascot sequence database (Matrix Science, Boston, MA) and mzXML files to the Sagen Research Sorcerer database. Searches were then run against a custom database created by adding the sequences of rat Na<sub>V</sub>1.2 and SUMO1<sub>1-97</sub>T95K to the International Protein Index (IPI) - Human database version 3.33 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ebi.ac.uk">www.ebi.ac.uk</ext-link>). In each search, a peptide precursor mass tolerance of 5 ppm was used, allowing for modifications due to additions such as Gly-Gly (+114.04292, Th), up to three missed cleavages, and strict adherence to tryptic digestion rules. Search results were then loaded into Scaffold software (Proteome Software, Portland, OR) and peptides with scores of 95% confidence or better used to confirm peptide assignments. The LTQ was programmed to accumulate precursor masses of expected peptides and perform dedicated tandem MS of only those ions using the LC conditions above and a multi-event study consisting of single MS scans on the FT-ICR and up to three dedicated MS/MS experiments on the selected masses. Data obtained were extracted as above and subjected to searches and manual evaluation including assessment of molecular weight, spectral quality and consistency of peptides retention time in relation to unmodified versions of the peptide.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Data and statistical analysis</title><p>Data were analyzed using pClamp, Origin and Excel software.

Marks. Brandeis University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC), operating under Animal Welfare Assurance #A3445-01, approved the use of vertebrate animals (rats) in protocol #0910-09 to Suzanne Paradis. The neurons are studied by various techniques, including electrophysiology, immunocytochemistry and microscopy. Invertebrate model systems are not useful here because the proteins we study are not present in their genome. Where possible we use tissue culture cells, however, much of the work focuses on how native ion channels are expressed and regulated. Rodents are the lowest phylogenetic order in which we can carry out the experiments we propose. Rats are also the standard organism for studies of cerebellar granule neuron physiology and are well established in the field as the organism of choice for the studies proposed. Thus, there is an extensive literature against which to compare and interpret the experimental results. Rats are frequently the source of neurons for cultures due to the large size of their brains and the relative robustness of their neurons in culture. The rat is a well-accepted model for studying ischemia in vitro, providing several advantages: a) the vulnerability of the rodent nervous system to hypoxia-ischemia is well-characterized, b) that rat shares identical mechanisms of ischemia-induced neuronal death with humans and c) procedures for minimizing discomfort, distress, pain, and injury as well as for euthanasia are extensively studied and ours follow AVMA guidelines.</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>LDP, Conceptualization, Methodology, Investigation, Formal Analysis, Writing – Original Draft, Writing – Review and Editing, Visualization</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>JDM, Methodology, Investigation, Formal Analysis, Writing – Review and Editing, Visualization, Funding Acquisition</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>SANG, Conceptualization, Methodology, Writing – Original Draft, Writing – Review and Editing, Visualization, Funding Acquisition, Supervision</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec id="s6" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="SD1-data"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.20054.015</object-id><label>Supplementary file 1.</label><caption><title>The biophysical properties of I<sub>Na</sub> and Na<sub>V</sub>1.2 channels.</title><p>(a) Biophysical properties of <italic>I<sub>Na</sub></italic> and Na<sub>V</sub>1.2 channels cultured at 21% O<sub>2</sub>.

A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;SUMOylation of Na<sub>V</sub>1.2 channels mediates the early response to acute hypoxia in central neurons&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been favorably evaluated by Richard Aldrich as the Senior Editor and three reviewers, one of whom, Baron Chanda (Reviewer #1), is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The mechanism for increased sodium leak, which is a major component of the initial response to hypoxia in the central nervous system, is not known. In this study, Plant et al. show that SUMOylation of the Na<sub>V</sub>1.2 channels within few tens of seconds of hypoxia underlies this excitatory shift in sodium conductance properties. They also provide direct evidence that SUMO1 interacts with Na<sub>V</sub>1.2 channel and that SUMOylation of a specific lysine in the N-terminus of these channels mediates these responses. Furthermore, they provide evidence that SUMO regulation of sodium current is isoform specific and Na<sub>V</sub>1.6 which is also found in rat CGN is not modulated by SUMO1. Overall, this is a solid contribution to the field and shows for the first time that the SUMO pathway is involved in rapid modulation of sodium currents in response to hypoxia.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The three reviewers found the study to be of great interest and well executed but were concerned about the overly broad generalizations especially in absence of animal studies. For instance, one of the reviewer notes that the bulk of Na<sub>V</sub>1.2s in CGNs in situ are in parallel fibers and terminals, and not in the cell bodies as is in the population studied by the authors in cultured CGNs. The authors do not study these neurons in situ and it is possible that the other SUMO regulated channels (K2P1, K<sub>V</sub>2.1) also play an important role in defining CGN excitability in culture and in situ. The reviewer also notes that Plant et al. (Stroke 33 (2002) 2324-8) defined TASK-1 (K2P3.1/KCNK3) as the only ion channel important in regulating the hypoxic depolarization of CGNs. In light of these comments, it is essential that authors provide a more nuanced discussion in broader context of the limitations of the present study.</p><p>In addition, the other essential points that should be addressed experimentally are:</p><p>1) The authors report peak sodium currents and normalized conductance-voltage curves, but they do not report the maximum sodium conductance for any of their experiments. They measure sodium current at -20 mV, which is about 50% activation for the control condition but manipulation of SUMO shifts the voltage dependence of activation so the changes in sodium currents measured at this fixed potential may be a mixture of changes in V<sub>a</sub> and in G<sub>max</sub>. To me, it would be nice to see both parameters separately, especially since G<sub>max</sub> changes could reflect changes in channel number on the cell surface, in contrast to their conclusions about regulation of channel activity.</p><p>2) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref>, I don't find the evidence for cell surface localization of the labeled channels very convincing. Most of the intracellular volume of these cells seems to be taken up by their nuclei, and it is not clear whether the fluorescent label is at the cell surface or in the cytosol between the nucleus and the cell surface.</p><p>3) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E, F</xref>: it is not clear under what conditions (normoxic, hypoxic) the amFRET experiments were performed. The context of these n=1 results to the author's model for the signaling pathway is unclear, especially if this was done under normoxic conditions. A more comprehensive amFRET experiment comparing Na<sub>V</sub>1.2:SUMO1 amFRET levels quantitatively, under the conditions used in the experiments in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> that lead to changes in Na<sub>V</sub>1.2-based <italic>I<sub>Na</sub></italic>(control, hypoxia, SUMO1, SENP1) would represent a more substantial contribution to this study.</p><p>4) The SDS gel in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref> is not very convincing. The banding pattern is very complex (10-11 bands between the 25-50 kD range shown) and there is no apparent band at the site of the arrow, and the band at the asterisk is very minor. For a protein expressed in bacteria, cleaner and more robust proteins bands are expected. Adding a control lane showing uninduced cultures do not have the protein of interest will also help clarify this issue.</p><p>Details of additional points raised by the reviewers that can be clarified in the text are:</p><p>1) The last sentence of the Abstract gives the impression that hypoxia induced SUMOylation shifts the half-activation of the curve by -26.5 mV. This is not strictly true because compared to the half-activation of the wild type channels under ambient oxygen conditions the shift is about 9 mV in the hyperpolarizing direction.</p><p>2) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, the authors show that the SENP1 deSUMOylase causes the conductance voltage curves to shift to the right compared to the wild type channels under ambient conditions. Does that imply that a significant fraction of the wild type channels are SUMOylated under normal oxygen conditions and that the observed current responses are ensemble averages of SUMOylated and unSUMOylated channels? While this notion is broadly supported by FRET data and single molecule photobleaching experiments, the numbers do not match. For instance, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref> shows more than 3 fold increase in SUMO associated Na<sub>V</sub>1.2 under hypoxic conditions but the shift in G-V curves is less than 50%. Is it possible that some of this is due to expression in a heterologous system?</p><p>3) The results in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> are a bit confusing. The long-term culture in 7% O<sub>2</sub> yields a larger shift in the activation V<sub>1/2</sub> (-42.9 mV) that does acute 7% O<sub>2</sub> treatment (-34 mV), yet does not lead to an increase on <italic>I<sub>peak</sub></italic> measured at -20 mV. This does not conform to expectations of their model (left shifted G-V curves lead to enhanced INa). The manner in which these results are described in the Results subsection “CGN cultured at 7% O<sub>2</sub>” glosses over these findings, and suggests that going from 7% to 1.5% O<sub>2</sub> is pretty much the same as going from 21% to 7%. This is not the case, and this point is critical to their study, as the data support that long term culture in 7% O<sub>2</sub> already leads to substantial (SUMO-based?) changes in Na<sub>V</sub>1.2. This needs to be addressed.</p><p>4) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref> legend: the statement &quot;Na<sub>V</sub>1.2-Lys38Gln channels passed large currents&quot; is a bit misleading, as the scale bars are different than in 5A, and a major point of this finding is that the currents are much smaller than WT Na<sub>V</sub>1.2. That the Na<sub>V</sub>1.2-Lys38Gln currents are in fact quite small should be more clearly stated in the legend.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.20054.017</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Essential revisions:</italic> </p><p><italic>The three reviewers found the study to be of great interest and well executed but were concerned about the overly broad generalizations especially in absence of animal studies. For instance, one of the reviewer notes that the bulk of Na<sub>V</sub>1.2s in CGNs in situ are in parallel fibers and terminals, and not in the cell bodies as is in the population studied by the authors in cultured CGNs. The authors do not study these neurons in situ and it is possible that the other SUMO regulated channels (K2P1, K<sub>V</sub>2.1) also play an important role in defining CGN excitability in culture and in situ. The reviewer also notes that Plant et al. (Stroke 33 (2002) 2324-8) defined TASK-1 (K2P3.1/KCNK3) as the only ion channel important in regulating the hypoxic depolarization of CGNs. In light of these comments, it is essential that authors provide a more nuanced discussion in broader context of the limitations of the present study.</italic> </p><p>Thank you. The Discussion has been made more complete by the addition of a sentence in the second paragraph and two paragraphs (sixth and seventh) that consider, in part, other channels known to respond to hypoxia in CGN, other neuronal responses to hypoxia, and four important study limitations including the absence of Purkinje cells in our culture and, as a result, the absence of parallel fibers that carry many Na<sub>V</sub>1.2 channels in cerebellum in vivo.</p><p><italic>In addition, the other essential points that should be addressed experimentally are:</italic> </p><p><italic>1) The authors report peak sodium currents and normalized conductance-voltage curves, but they do not report the maximum sodium conductance for any of their experiments. They measure sodium current at -20 mV, which is about 50% activation for the control condition but manipulation of SUMO shifts the voltage dependence of activation so the changes in sodium currents measured at this fixed potential may be a mixture of changes in V<sub>a</sub> and in G<sub>max</sub>. To me, it would be nice to see both parameters separately, especially since G<sub>max</sub> changes could reflect changes in channel number on the cell surface, in contrast to their conclusions about regulation of channel activity.</italic> </p><p>Thank you, this feedback led to inclusion of important data and clarifying text. First, we amend <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref> to include comparisons at 0 mV for CGN <italic>I<sub>Na</sub></italic> and for Na<sub>V</sub>1.2 expressed in CHO cells; at this voltage, the G-V relationships are saturated for all test conditions and the currents are ~ equal supporting the hypothesis that changes in the G-V relationships are sufficient to rationalize the rapid changes in current (that is, without a need to invoke changes in channel number or unitary current). In the legend, we also give the voltage for peak current and values for CGN cultured at 21% O<sub>2</sub> with all the pipette solutions (i.e., control, SUMO1 and SENP1). We also include comparisons at 0 mV for CFP-Na<sub>V</sub>1.2 in CHO cells in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1A</xref>. The new data are described in the subsection “The SUMO pathway regulates CGN <italic>I<sub>Na</sub></italic>”, last paragraph, a revised sentence in the subsection “SUMOylation of Na<sub>V</sub>1.2 on Lys38 is necessary and sufficient for the hypoxic response” (on Na<sub>V</sub>1.2 in CHO cells), and a revised sentence in the subsection “Hypoxia induces rapid monoSUMOylation of Na<sub>V</sub>1.2 channels” (on CFP-Na<sub>V</sub>1.2 in CHO cells where TIRF also supports the conclusion that rapid trafficking is not a primary response to acute hypoxia since the surface density of channels did not change over 5 min).</p><p><italic>2) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref>, I don't find the evidence for cell surface localization of the labeled channels very convincing. Most of the intracellular volume of these cells seems to be taken up by their nuclei, and it is not clear whether the fluorescent label is at the cell surface or in the cytosol between the nucleus and the cell surface.</italic> </p><p>Thank you; this feedback led to revision of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> as well as inclusion of new data employing three-color GSD-STORM super resolution microscopy (SRM) in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>. First, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> is reformatted to improve clarity of the image even when it is this small so the CHO cell plasma membrane is more readily seen. Second, new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D and E</xref> shows proximity of the CGN plasma membrane, Na<sub>V</sub>1.2 and SUMO1 with an X-Y range of &lt; 20 nm using SRM. This new work is described in the Results subsection “Interaction of native Na<sub>V</sub>1.2 and SUMO1 at the CGN surface increases with hypoxia” and Methods subsection” STORM immunostaining and imaging”.</p><p><italic>3) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E, F</xref>: it is not clear under what conditions (normoxic, hypoxic) the amFRET experiments were performed. The context of these n=1 results to the author's model for the signaling pathway is unclear, especially if this was done under normoxic conditions. A more comprehensive amFRET experiment comparing Na<sub>V</sub>1.2:SUMO1 amFRET levels quantitatively, under the conditions used in the experiments in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> that lead to changes in Na<sub>V</sub>1.2-based I<sub>Na</sub> (control, hypoxia, SUMO1, SENP1) would represent a more substantial contribution to this study.</italic> </p><p>Thank you; the feedback led to new amFRET studies comparing neurons under normoxic and hypoxic conditions that we now include. We sought originally to confirm that the two native proteins were found together at the neuron surface consistent with the electrophysiology so we stained CGN in ambient conditions. Now, new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A-C</xref> compares amFRET under normoxic conditions (showing basal levels of SUMOylation) and amFRET with hypoxia showing a 4-fold increase in SUMO with the channels; this, and the statistics underlying the studies (now including the number of neurons studied, n = 8-10), are described in the Results subsection “Interaction of native Na<sub>V</sub>1.2 and SUMO1 at the CGN surface increases with hypoxia”, the Methods subsection “<underline>amFRET immunocytochemistry and microscopy<bold>”</bold></underline>, the legend for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>. To your last point, the new amFRET microscopy studies were performed under ambient and hypoxic conditions with native intracellular composition prior to fixation whereas in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> we replaced the cytosol with cesium fluoride (CsF) solution to allow patch clamp Na<sup>+</sup> current recording; this limits direct comparison, a challenge noted again below and now recognized in the subsection “Hypoxia induces rapid monoSUMOylation of Na<sub>V</sub>1.2 channels”. (Note, to add the new data to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, toxin-blocking studies were moved from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>.)</p><p><italic>4) The SDS gel in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref> is not very convincing. The banding pattern is very complex (10-11 bands between the 25-50 kD range shown) and there is no apparent band at the site of the arrow, and the band at the asterisk is very minor. For a protein expressed in bacteria, cleaner and more robust proteins bands are expected. Adding a control lane showing uninduced cultures do not have the protein of interest will also help clarify this issue.</italic> </p><p>Thank you; this feedback led to inclusion of more gel lanes, correction of the main text and movement of the arrow and asterisk to the correct locations. Revised <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref> now compares expression of channel alone, SUMO alone, and channel with SUMO. The position of the arrow and the asterisk are shifted to highlight the bands correctly. Also, text is added to the legend to note and cite the complex band patterns seen in this system due to His-labeling of target and native proteins by expression of the full array of SUMO pathway enzymes and His-tagged SUMO).</p><p><italic>Details of additional points raised by the reviewers that can be clarified in the text are:</italic> </p><p><italic>1) The last sentence of the Abstract gives the impression that hypoxia induced SUMOylation shifts the half-activation of the curve by -26.5 mV. This is not strictly true because compared to the half-activation of the wild type channels under ambient oxygen conditions the shift is about 9 mV in the hyperpolarizing direction.</italic> </p><p>Thank you; we have correctly reworded the Abstract.</p><p><italic>2) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, the authors show that the SENP1 deSUMOylase causes the conductance voltage curves to shift to the right compared to the wild type channels under ambient conditions. Does that imply that a significant fraction of the wild type channels are SUMOylated under normal oxygen conditions and that the observed current responses are ensemble averages of SUMOylated and unSUMOylated channels? While this notion is broadly supported by FRET data and single molecule photobleaching experiments, the numbers do not match. For instance, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref> shows more than 3 fold increase in SUMO associated Na<sub>V</sub>1.2 under hypoxic conditions but the shift in G-V curves is less than 50%. Is it possible that some of this is due to expression in a heterologous system?</italic></p><p>Thank you; it is very important that we make clear that some channels are SUMOylated in ambient O<sub>2</sub>, and that hypoxia increases that fraction. We now do this early in the Introduction, in a dedicated new paragraph in the Results subsection “The SUMO pathway regulates CGN Ina” for CGN, later in the report in the section on CGN spectroscopy, subsection “Interaction of native Na<sub>V</sub>1.2 and SUMO1 at the CGN surface increases with hypoxia”, and again thereafter in the reconstituted CHO cell system (where it had previously been noted). The failure of numbers to match in the original has been addressed first by making it clear that we see close correlations between the native and reconstituted systems (as summarized in the subsection “Hypoxia induces rapid monoSUMOylation of Na<sub>V</sub>1.2 channels”) while emphasizing study limitations in the Discussion (seventh paragraph). You highlight a good example where the comparison was a challenge (now noted in the subsection “Hypoxia induces rapid monoSUMOylation of Na<sub>V</sub>1.2 channels”): current measured in CHO cells and CGN involves replacing the cytosol with cesium fluoride (CsF) solution for recording whereas CHO cells are intact for TIRF and therefore enjoy a native intracellular milieu (indeed, we found CsF recording solution precluded fluorescent measurements).</p><p><italic>3) The results in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> are a bit confusing. The long-term culture in 7% O<sub>2</sub> yields a larger shift in the activation V<sub>1/2</sub> (-42.9 mV) that does acute 7% O<sub>2</sub> treatment (-34 mV), yet does not lead to an increase on I<sub>peak</sub> measured at -20 mV. This does not conform to expectations of their model (left shifted G-V curves lead to enhanced INa). The manner in which these results are described in the Results subsection “CGN cultured at 7% O<sub>2</sub>” glosses over these findings, and suggests that going from 7% to 1.5% O<sub>2</sub> is pretty much the same as going from 21% to 7%. This is not the case, and this point is critical to their study, as the data support that long term culture in 7% O<sub>2</sub> already leads to substantial (SUMO-based?) changes in Na<sub>V</sub>1.2. This needs to be addressed.</italic> </p><p>Thank you again for helping us to clarify. We edited the text in the subsection “CGN cultured at 7% O<sub>2</sub>” to make clear that 7-10 days at 7% changed the baseline attributes of the cells compared to those incubated at 21% but that subsequent changes with hypoxic challenge are similar in type and magnitude while starting from this new steady-state.</p><p><italic>4) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref> legend: the statement &quot;Na<sub>V</sub>1.2-Lys38Gln channels passed large currents&quot; is a bit misleading, as the scale bars are different than in 5A, and a major point of this finding is that the currents are much smaller than WT Na<sub>V</sub>1.2. That the Na<sub>V</sub>1.2-Lys38Gln currents are in fact quite small should be more clearly stated in the legend.</italic> </p><p>Thank you; the error is now corrected (large changed to small).</p></body></sub-article></article>
