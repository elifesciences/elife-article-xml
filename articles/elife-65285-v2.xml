eliminate invading microbes. In turn, pathogens have evolved effector proteins to counteract antimicrobial autophagy. How adapted pathogens co-opt autophagy for their own benefit is poorly understood. The Irish famine pathogen <italic>Phytophthora infestans</italic> secretes the effector protein PexRD54 that selectively activates an unknown plant autophagy pathway that antagonizes antimicrobial autophagy at the pathogen interface. Here, we show that PexRD54 induces autophagosome formation by bridging vesicles decorated by the small GTPase Rab8a with autophagic compartments labeled by the core autophagy protein ATG8CL. Rab8a is required for pathogen-triggered and starvation-induced but not antimicrobial autophagy, revealing specific trafficking pathways underpin selective autophagy. By subverting Rab8a-mediated vesicle trafficking, PexRD54 utilizes lipid droplets to facilitate biogenesis of autophagosomes diverted to pathogen feeding sites. Altogether, we show that PexRD54 mimics starvation-induced autophagy to subvert endomembrane trafficking at the host-pathogen interface, revealing how effectors bridge distinct host compartments to expedite colonization.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>With its long filaments reaching deep inside its prey, the tiny fungi-like organism known as <italic>Phytophthora infestans</italic> has had a disproportionate impact on human history. Latching onto plants and feeding on their cells, it has caused large-scale starvation events such as the Irish or Highland potato famines.</p><p>Many specialized proteins allow the parasite to accomplish its feat. For instance, PexRD54 helps <italic>P. infestans</italic> hijack a cellular process known as autophagy. Healthy cells use this ‘self-eating’ mechanism to break down invaders or to recycle their components, for example when they require specific nutrients. The process is set in motion by various pathways of molecular events that result in specific sac-like ‘vesicles’ filled with cargo being transported to specialized compartments for recycling. PexRD54 can take over this mechanism by activating one of the plant autophagy pathways, directing cells to form autophagic vesicles that <italic>Phytophthora</italic> could then possibly use to feed on or to destroy antimicrobial components. How or why this is the case remains poorly understood.</p><p>To examine these questions, Pandey, Leary et al. used a combination of genetic and microscopy techniques and tracked how PexRD54 alters autophagy as <italic>P. infestans</italic> infects a tobacco-related plant. The results show that PexRD54 works by bridging two proteins: one is present on cellular vesicles filled with cargo, and the other on autophagic structures surrounding the parasite. This allows PexRD54 to direct the vesicles to the feeding sites of <italic>P. infestans</italic> so the parasite can potentially divert nutrients. Pandey, Leary et al. then went on to develop a molecule called the AIM peptide, which could block autophagy by mimicking part of PexRD54.</p><p>These results help to better grasp how a key disease affects crops, potentially leading to new ways to protect plants without the use of pesticides. They also shed light on autophagy: ultimately, a deeper understanding of this fundamental biological process could allow the development of plants which can adapt to changing environments.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>nicotiana benthamiana</kwd><kwd>Phytophthora infestans</kwd><kwd>autophagy</kwd><kwd>haustorium</kwd><kwd>autophagy

that mediates the lysosomal degradation and relocation of cellular cargoes within double-membraned vesicles called autophagosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">He and Klionsky, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Leidal et al., 2020</xref>). Although previously considered to be a bulk catabolic pathway tasked with maintaining cellular homeostasis under normal or stress conditions, it is now clear that autophagy can be highly selective (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Zaffagnini and Martens, 2016</xref>). Autophagic cargoes are typically captured during autophagosome formation, a complex process regulated by a set of conserved autophagy-related proteins (ATG) as well as specialized autophagy adaptors and cargo receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Mizushima et al., 2011</xref>). These captured cargoes are sorted within the autophagosome during maturation of the isolation membrane (also known as the phagophore) via the specific interactions between cargo receptors and ATG8, which decorates the phagophore to serve as a docking platform for cargo receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Slobodkin and Elazar, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Ryabovol and Minibayeva, 2016</xref>).</p><p>The source of the phagophore is still under debate, but its primary source is considered to be the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bernard and Klionsky, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hamasaki et al., 2013</xref>). As the cargo is captured, the phagophore undergoes massive expansion and is finally sealed to form a mature autophagosome. Therefore, formation of the autophagosome requires additional lipid supplies that are needed for elongation and final sealing of the phagophore. Supporting this view, the essential autophagy protein ATG2 was recently discovered to have lipid transfer activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Valverde et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Maeda et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Osawa et al., 2019</xref>). To cope with cellular starvation, cells can rapidly generate hundreds of autophagosomes, conceivably requiring an available supply of lipids. Remarkably, in yeast, lipids mobilized from lipid droplets (LDs) were found to fuel autophagosome biogenesis during starvation-induced autophagy, which employs relatively larger autophagosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Shpilka et al., 2015</xref>). In contrast, smaller autophagosomes of the cytosol-to-vacuole targeting (Cvt) pathway do not rely on LDs, suggesting that LDs are specifically recruited for starvation-induced autophagy in order to meet the increased demand of lipids required for the biogenesis of larger sized autophagosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Shpilka et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dupont et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Although poorly characterized, there is accumulating evidence for autophagosome maturation relying on vesicle transport and membrane expansion events which are regulated by secretory pathways involving Rab GTPases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ao et al., 2014</xref>). For instance, the mammalian Rab8a that regulates polarized secretion and lipid droplet fusion events is also implicated in autophagy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bansal et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Vaibhava et al., 2012</xref>). The model plant <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> genome contains five closely related Rab8a members organized into the RabE group (RabE1a-d), but whether any of the RabE1 members contribute to autophagy is unknown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Rutherford and Moore, 2002</xref>). Molecular mechanisms governing autophagosome biogenesis, including the sources of membrane precursors required for autophagosome elongation and the transport routes to position these lipid supplies at autophagosome assembly sites remain to be comprehensively described in plants.</p><p>The discovery of various autophagy cargo receptors uncovered a multitude of selective autophagy pathways implicated in crucial cellular functions ranging from development to immunity in both plants and animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Zaffagnini and Martens, 2016</xref>). For instance, the plant selective autophagy cargo receptor Joka2/NBR1 mediates antiviral immunity by eliminating viral components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hafrén et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hafrén et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Jung et al., 2020</xref>). Joka2/NBR1 is also required for immunity against bacteria and oomycete pathogens, however, the extent to which defense-related autophagy acts against these pathogens is unknown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dagdas et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Üstün et al., 2018</xref>). Consistent with the important role of autophagy in plant immunity, adapted pathogens have evolved strategies to manipulate the host autophagy machinery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Leary et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Üstün et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Leary et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Plants detect pathogens via immune sensors consisting of surface localized pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) and intracellular nucleotide-binding leucine-rich repeat-containing proteins (NLRs). In response, pathogens secrete an arsenal of effector proteins to modulate host immunity and processes to support their virulence. Interestingly, effectors function not only to evade and suppress host immunity but also to mediate nutrient uptake (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Win et al., 2012</xref>). Some filamentous plant pathogens, including the Irish potato famine pathogen <italic>Phytophthora infestans,</italic> produce hyphal extensions called haustoria that grow into the host cells to facilitate effector delivery and gain access to host nutrients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Panstruga and Dodds, 2009</xref>). A haustorium is a specialized infection structure that remains enveloped by an enigmatic host-derived membrane known as the extra-haustorial membrane (EHM), whose functions and biogenesis are poorly understood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Whisson et al., 2016</xref>). Notably, we previously showed that Joka2-mediated defense-related autophagy is diverted to the EHM during <italic>P. infestans</italic> infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dagdas et al., 2018</xref>). The pathogen counteracts this by deploying PexRD54, a host-translocated RXLR class of effector with five consecutive WY motifs, that targets plant autophagy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dagdas et al., 2016</xref>). PexRD54 carries a canonical C-terminal ATG8 interacting motif (AIM) that is typically found on autophagy cargo receptors to bind ATG8 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Maqbool et al., 2016</xref>). Among the diverse set of potato ATG8 members (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kellner et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Zess et al., 2019</xref>), PexRD54 preferentially binds the ATG8CL isoform and outcompetes Joka2/NBR1 from ATG8CL complexes, thereby disarming defense-related autophagy at the pathogen interface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dagdas et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dagdas et al., 2018</xref>). Intriguingly, PexRD54 does not fully shutdown autophagy as has been shown for animal pathogens that suppress autophagy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Choy et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kimmey and Stallings, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Real et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Xu et al., 2019</xref>). Instead, it stimulates formation of autophagosomes that accumulate around the pathogen interface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dagdas et al., 2018</xref>). How PexRD54 stimulates autophagy and in what way the pathogen benefits from this remains unknown.</p><p>Here, we show that PexRD54 mimics carbon starvation-induced autophagy by coupling the host vesicle transport regulator Rab8a (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Speth et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Zheng et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Pfeffer, 2017</xref>) to autophagosome biogenesis at the pathogen interface. Unlike PexRD54 which activates autophagy by recruiting Rab8a to ATG8CL compartments, PexRD54’s AIM peptide fails to associate with Rab8a, and instead functions as an autophagy inhibitor. Thus, by using an effector protein and its peptide derivative as molecular tools to perturb host-autophagy, we provide insights into not only how vesicle transport processes selectively support autophagosome formation, but also how the pathogen exploits these pathways to undermine plant immunity.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>PexRD54-ATG8 binding is not sufficient for stimulation of autophagosome formation</title><p>We have previously shown that PexRD54 stimulates formation of ATG8CL-autophagosomes in a macroautophagy dependent manner, and PexRD54 itself is a substrate of host autophagy when expressed in plant cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dagdas et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Maqbool et al., 2016</xref>). During infection, these pathogen-induced autophagosomes are diverted to the EHM in a process that relies on the core autophagy machinery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dagdas et al., 2018</xref>). Because AIM-mediated binding of PexRD54 to ATG8CL is essential for the activation of autophagosome formation by the effector protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dagdas et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Maqbool et al., 2016</xref>), we reasoned that PexRD54 could stimulate autophagosome formation by either negative regulation of host autophagy suppressors or through positive regulation of host components to the autophagosome biogenesis sites.</p><p>To understand how PexRD54 stimulates autophagy, we used <italic>N. benthamiana</italic>, because: it is widely accepted as a solanaceous model plant in the field of plant-pathogen interactions; enables rapid functional, and cell biology assays using <italic>Agrobacterium</italic>; and can be infected by <italic>P. infestans</italic>. To first address whether ATG8 binding is sufficient to trigger autophagosome induction, we generated a PexRD54 truncate comprising only the C terminal AIM peptide (amino acids 350–381, hereafter AIMp), and compared its potency to stimulate autophagosome formation to the full-length protein. Strikingly, instead of stimulating autophagosome formation, AIMp fused to RFP (RFP:AIMp) significantly reduced the number of ATG8CL-autophagosomes in leaf epidermal cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–B</xref>). Compared to RFP:GUS control, expression of RFP:AIMp reduced the number of GFP:ATG8CL-autophagosomes by ~sixfold, whereas cells expressing RFP:PexRD54 had a ~fourfold increase in GFP:ATG8CL-autophagosome numbers as has been shown before (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–B</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dagdas et al., 2016</xref>). The AIMp interacted with ATG8CL in planta (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C–D</xref>), as was previously shown through in vitro studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dagdas et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Maqbool et al., 2016</xref>). However, this association appears to take place mainly in the cytoplasm as the suppression of autophagosome formation by AIMp is such that we hardly observe any GFP:ATG8CL autophagosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–B,E</xref>). In contrast, RFP:PexRD54 and GFP:ATG8CL produced strong overlapping fluorescence signals which peak at mobile, ring-like ATG8CL-autophagosome clusters that are induced by PexRD54 as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dagdas et al., 2016</xref>). However, in cells expressing RFP:GUS control, we did not detect any RFP signal that peaks at ATG8CL-puncta (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–B,E</xref>). Taken together these results show that binding of PexRD54 to ATG8CL, although necessary, is not sufficient to activate autophagosome biogenesis. This suggests while the full-length protein stimulates autophagy, PexRD54’s AIM peptide functions as an autophagy suppressor.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>The AIM peptide of PexRD54 is not sufficient for stimulation of autophagosome formation.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Confocal micrographs of <italic>Nicotiana benthamiana</italic> leaf epidermal cells transiently expressing either RFP:AIMp (left), RFP:PexRD54 (middle), or RFP:GUS (right), with GFP:ATG8CL.

As there are no specific antibodies available for individual plant ATG8 isoforms, GFP:ATG8 depletion is used to measure autophagic flux in plants rather than quantifying the ratio of lipidated to unlipidated ATG8 isoforms as for other model organisms. Consistent with the AIMp triggered decrease in ATG8CL-autophagosome numbers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–B</xref>), RFP:AIMp stabilized GFP:ATG8CL compared to RFP:PexRD54 or the controls RFP:EV and RFP:GUS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Western blotting showed that in the presence of RFP:AIMp, GFP:ATG8CL was still able to produce a strong protein signal even after 6 days of transient expression. On the other hand, GFP:ATG8CL protein signal was hardly detectable after just four days in the presence of RFP:PexRD54 or RFP:EV, indicating that the AIMp hampers autophagic flux (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Consistent with our previous report that PexRD54 acts as a cargo receptor that activates autophagy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dagdas et al., 2016</xref>), we saw rapid decline of RFP:PexRD54 protein levels after 2 days post infiltration (dpi) with only free RFP detectable at six dpi, indicating vacuolar processing of RFP:PexRD54 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). This was not due lack of PexRD54 expression at later time points as we could still detect mRNA expression of all constructs which are driven by constitutive 35S promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). In line with this view, confocal microscopy revealed that while RFP:PexRD54 localizes to the cytoplasm at two dpi, RFP signal becomes vacuolar at 4 and 6 dpi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>), providing further evidence that PexRD54 itself is a substrate of autophagy and is degraded inside the plant vacuole, consistent with the flux assays we reported earlier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dagdas et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Maqbool et al., 2016</xref>). In contrast, RFP:AIMp remains mostly cytoplasmic at 2–6 dpi consistent with its function as a suppressor of ATG8 autophagy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>). However, we did not observe any stabilisation of the GFP control by RFP:AIMp, RFP:PexRD54 or RFP:GUS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>), indicating that reduced turnover of GFP:ATG8CL by RFP:AIMp is specific and is not due to altered Agrobacterium-mediated expression efficiency. Moreover, the AIM peptide mutated in the conserved ATG8-interacting region was unable to prevent ATG8CL depletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4</xref>).

To support these results, we measured the endogenous NBR1/Joka2 and ATG8 protein levels in <italic>N. benthamiana</italic> in the presence or absence of the AIMp. Consistently, ectopic expression of RFP:AIMp led to marked increase in both native NbJoka2 and NbATG8(s) levels compared to RFP:GUS expression, whereas RFP:PexRD54 mildly increased levels of native NbJoka2 but not NbATG8s (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5">Figure 2—figure supplement 5A</xref>). These results further support the view that PexRD54’s AIMp suppresses autophagy non-selectively, whereas PexRD54 activates ATG8CL-autophagy while neutralizing Joka2-mediated autophagy as shown before (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dagdas et al., 2016</xref>). Furthermore, AIMp enhanced protein levels of the recombinantly tagged derivatives of Joka2 and ATG8CL that are expressed under constitutive 35S promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5">Figure 2—figure supplement 5B</xref>), indicating that AIMp-triggered Joka2 and ATG8CL stabilization is not due to gene expression differences caused by the AIMp.</p><p>We then explored the potency of the AIMp in autophagy suppression when applied exogenously. For this we custom synthesized PexRD54’s AIM peptide (AIMp<sup>syn</sup>, 10 amino acids at the C terminus) along with an AIM peptide mutant (mAIMp<sup>syn</sup>) that has a two amino acid substitution in the conserved residues of the AIM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dagdas et al., 2016</xref>), fused to cell penetrating peptides. We first tested their activities in roots of a transgenic <italic>N. benthamiana</italic> line that stably express GFP:ATG8CL to test the uptake and efficacy of the peptide in different plant tissues and as many plant autophagy studies are performed in roots. Although both AIMp<sup>syn</sup> and mAIMp<sup>syn</sup> fused to 5-Carboxyfluorescein (CF-AIMp<sup>syn</sup> and CF-mAIMp<sup>syn</sup>) were effectively taken up by the root cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s6">Figure 2—figure supplement 6</xref>), only the wild-type AIMp<sup>syn</sup> reduced the frequency of GFP:ATG8CL-puncta (by ~10-fold) compared to mAIMp<sup>syn</sup> or buffer control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C–D</xref>). We also repeated these assays in leaf epidermal cells successfully, however, peptide translocation efficiency and thus autophagosome reduction by AIMp<sup>syn</sup> were much lower in leaves compared to root cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E–F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s7">Figure 2—figure supplement 7</xref>). These findings demonstrate that PexRD54’s AIM peptide suppresses autophagy in a variety of tissues, likely through binding to plant ATG8 isoforms with a high affinity and limiting their access to the autophagy adaptors that are essential for induction of autophagy. This implies that full-length PexRD54 carries additional features to stimulate autophagosome formation, by for instance, recruiting and/or manipulating other host components.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>PexRD54 associates with the host vesicle transport regulator Rab8a independent of ATG8CL binding</title><p>We next set out to investigate the mechanism of autophagy activation by PexRD54.

We therefore reasoned that in addition to binding ATG8CL, PexRD54 could possibly hijack host vesicle transport machinery to stimulate autophagosome biogenesis. Interestingly, our previous proteomics survey identified Rab8a, which shows the most sequence similarity to Arabidopsis RabE1a, a member of the small Ras-related GTPases that mediate vesicle transport and fusion events, as a candidate PexRD54 interactor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dagdas et al., 2016</xref>).

Although earlier work challenged the applicability of these mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Langemeyer et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Nottingham and Pfeffer, 2014</xref>), we reasoned that Rab8a mutants could still be useful to dissect the role of Rab8a in PexRD54 activated autophagy.

To this end, we first investigated the extent to which PexRD54 associates with its two host interactors, Rab8a and ATG8CL. We achieved this through live-cell imaging of Rab8a and ATG8CL co-expressed in combination with either PexRD54, AIMp, or BFP control. This revealed that BFP:PexRD54, but not free BFP or BFP:AIMp, localizes to puncta co-labeled by RFP:ATG8CL and GFP:Rab8a (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A–C</xref>). Furthermore, GFP:Rab8a localized to ring-shaped RFP:ATG8CL clusters triggered by BFP:PexRD54, whereas no such structures occurred in cells expressing BFP control or BFP:AIMp (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A–C</xref>). Notably, our quantitative imaging revealed that, even in the absence of PexRD54, more than half of RFP:ATG8CL-puncta (60%, <italic>N</italic> = 18 images) are positively labeled by GFP:Rab8a (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A,D</xref>). However, BFP:PexRD54 expression significantly increased the frequency of GFP:Rab8a-positive RFP:ATG8CL-puncta (85%, <italic>N</italic> = 18 images) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B,D</xref>). Conversely, we rarely detected any fluorescent puncta that were co-labeled by GFP:Rab8a and RFP:ATG8CL in the presence of BFP:AIMp (6%, <italic>N</italic> = 18), which strongly suppresses autophagosome formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C–D</xref>). These results indicate that a subset of Rab8a localizes to autophagy compartments marked by ATG8CL and this is enhanced by PexRD54. Consistently, in plants stably expressing GFP:Rab8a, we observed a similar degree of PexRD54-triggered increase in ATG8CL-Rab8a colocalization in ring-shaped ATG8CL-clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>), suggesting that PexRD54 might boost Rab8a recruitment to autophagic compartments. To then gain biochemical evidence for PexRD54-mediated recruitment of Rab8a to ATG8CL compartments, we conducted in planta co-immunoprecipitation assays between Rab8a and ATG8CL in presence of PexRD54, AIMp, or a control. We extracted proteins at an early time point (2 dpi) to minimize differences in ATG8CL levels, especially because we express proteins that alter autophagic activity (PexRD54 and AIMp). We observed noticeably more RFP:ATG8CL pulled down with GFP:Rab8a in presence of 3xHA:PexRD54 but not 3xHA:AIMp or 3xHA:EV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). As the 3xHA tag is only 27aa and 3.3 kDa, expression of smaller constructs such as 3xHA:EV and 3xHA:AIMp are not visible on western blots. Therefore, we validated expression of the HA-tagged constructs by RT-PCR using the RNA extracts from the Agroinfiltrated leaf patches (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>).

Consistent with the silencing assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A–D</xref>), GFP:Rab8a<sup>N128I</sup> led to 50% reduction in PexRD54 triggered ATG8CL-autophagosome numbers compared to wild-type GFP:Rab8a (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s7">Figure 5—figure supplement 7</xref>). We further validated the dominant negative role of GFP:Rab8a<sup>N128I</sup>, which significantly reduced PexRD54-triggered ATG8CL puncta compared to GFP control in two independent biological replicates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s8">Figure 5—figure supplement 8</xref>).</p><p>Since we found that PexRD54 associates with Rab8a and its mutants with varying affinities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>), we next checked whether ectopic expression of Rab8a and its mutants (S29N and Q74L) have any effect on the formation of PexRD54-autophagosomes. Compared to GFP control, GFP:Rab8a expression led to a slight increase (~1.5 fold) in the number of BFP:PexRD54 puncta (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s9">Figure 5—figure supplement 9</xref>), suggesting that Rab8a could positively regulate autophagosome formation. Expression of GDP-bound GFP:Rab8a<sup>S29N</sup> substantially enhanced (~three fold) the frequency of BFP:PexRD54 puncta compared to a GFP control, whereas GTP bound GFP:Rab8a<sup>Q74L</sup> did not lead to any significant changes in the number of BFP:PexRD54 puncta compared to the GFP control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s9">Figure 5—figure supplement 9</xref>). These results are consistent with the pulldown assays, which revealed stronger interaction between PexRD54 and Rab8a<sup>S29N</sup>. These findings were initially surprising given the general view that Rab S-to-N mutations in this position lead to less active (or inactive) forms that mimic the GDP-bound state, whereas the Q-to-L mutations in this site are assumed to be locked in GTP-bound state that is more active. However, there are reports which revealed that these mutations cannot be generalized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Langemeyer et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Nottingham and Pfeffer, 2014</xref>). Consistent with this view, the GDP-bound form of the mammalian Rab8a (T22N mutant) was found to promote lipid droplet (LD) fusions, indicating that S-to-N mutation in this Rab protein functions differently. Therefore, further biochemical evidence is required to determine whether these mutations show perturbed GTPase activities. Nevertheless, together with the data presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>, these findings demonstrate that PexRD54-driven autophagy requires Rab8a.</p></sec><sec id="s2-8"><title>Rab8a is specifically recruited to PexRD54-autophagosomes and is dispensable for Joka2-mediated autophagy</title><p>To better characterize the autophagy pathway stimulated by PexRD54, we further investigated the interplay between Rab8a and ATG8CL. The weak interaction of ATG8CL and Rab8a in the absence of PexRD54 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>) suggests for an indirect association potentially mediated through a host autophagy adaptor. Therefore, we explored whether increased ATG8CL and Rab8a association triggered by PexRD54 is a general hallmark of autophagy activation or is a process that is stimulated through plant selective autophagy adaptors. Because the plant autophagy cargo receptor Joka2 that mediates aggrephagy also binds ATG8CL and stimulates autophagosome formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dagdas et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Jung et al., 2020</xref>), we tested if Joka2 could interact with Rab8a and enhance Rab8a-ATG8CL association. Unlike PexRD54, Joka2 did not colocalize or interact with Rab8a (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A–B</xref>). Moreover, our quantitative imaging revealed that Joka2 overexpression leads to a reduction of RFP:ATG8CL puncta positively labeled by GFP:Rab8a (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C,D</xref>). This sharply contrasts with the positive impact of PexRD54 on ATG8CL-Rab8a association (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C,D</xref>), indicating that the autophagy pathway mediated by Joka2 is different from the PexRD54 triggered autophagy, and possibly does not require Rab8a function.

Collectively, these results indicate that Joka2-mediated autophagy pathway does not involve Rab8a, and the weak association between ATG8CL and Rab8a observed in the absence of PexRD54 is not mediated by Joka2 but potentially through an unknown autophagy adaptor.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Rab8a is dispensable for Joka2-mediated autophagy.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Confocal micrographs of <italic>Nicotiana benthamiana</italic> leaf epidermal cells transiently expressing either Joka2:RFP (top) or RFP:PexRD54 (bottom), with GFP:Rab8a.

In addition, the GDP-bound mutant form of the mammalian Rab8a is enriched at LD contact sites to regulate their fusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Wu et al., 2014</xref>). Therefore, we investigated Rab8a association with LDs under normal or starvation conditions. We first checked co-localization between GFP:Rab8a and LDs marked by the orange-red fluorescent fatty acid (FA), BODIPY 558/568 C12 (herein BODIPY-C<sub>12</sub>). Confocal microscopy revealed that a small fraction of GFP:Rab8a puncta are labeled by the LD marker BODIPY-C<sub>12</sub> under normal light conditions, whereas the frequency of this colocalization increased by ~1.4-fold when plants are light restricted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E–F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s3">Figure 7—figure supplement 3</xref>). Furthermore, we observed that GFP:Rab8a puncta positive for BODIPY-C<sub>12</sub> are also labeled by BFP:ATG8CL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s4">Figure 7—figure supplement 4</xref>). The stronger association of Rab8a and LDs upon light restriction, combined with the finding that LDs are recruited toward autophagosomes during carbon starvation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fan et al., 2019</xref>), suggest that Rab8a-LD association could be a hallmark of starvation-induced autophagy.</p><p>Additionally, we observed that ring-shaped PexRD54 clusters labeled with Rab8a also tightly associate with BODIPY-C<sub>12</sub> labeled puncta (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7G</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s5">Figure 7—figure supplements 5</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s6">6</xref>). However, we did not detect BODIPY-C<sub>12</sub> fluorescence signal filling the lumen of the PexRD54-labeled compartments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7G</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s5">Figure 7—figure supplements 5</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s6">6</xref>), indicating that fatty acids are likely not the autophagic cargoes of PexRD54. Rather, we detected a BODIPY-C<sub>12</sub> signal at the periphery of autophagosomes marked by PexRD54, which overlaps with GFP:Rab8a fluorescence signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7G</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s5">Figure 7—figure supplements 5</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s6">6</xref>). Moreover, these PexRD54/Rab8a-clusters are also accompanied by LDs densely labeled with only BODIPY-C<sub>12</sub> as they navigate through the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="video" rid="video3">Video 3</xref>). These findings suggest that fatty acids could be one of the potential membrane sources of the autophagosomes stimulated by PexRD54 as observed during carbon-starvation-induced autophagy in other systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Shpilka et al., 2015</xref>). To gain further evidence for this, we investigated the colocalization of PexRD54 and Rab8a with the LD structural membrane protein Oleosin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Siloto et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fan et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Singh et al., 2009</xref>). Similar to BODIPY-C<sub>12</sub>-labeled puncta (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s5">Figure 7—figure supplement 5</xref>), Oleosin labeled LDs clustered around PexRD54/Rab8a-positive ring-like autophagosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s6">Figure 7—figure supplement 6</xref>). Although Oleosin-positive LDs were adjacent to PexRD54 autophagosomes, in contrast to BODIPY-C<sub>12</sub>, Oleosin-YFP did not produce fluorescent signal that overlaps with PexRD54/Rab8a ring-like autophagosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s6">Figure 7—figure supplement 6</xref>), suggesting that FAs but not LD surface proteins are transferred to PexRD54-triggered autophagosomes. Strikingly, stimulation of autophagy by BFP:PexRD54, but not Joka2:BFP, led to enhanced association of BODIPY-C<sub>12</sub> and GFP:Rab8a-labeled puncta, supporting the hypothesis that PexRD54 mimics autophagy induced during carbon starvation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7H</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s7">Figure 7—figure supplement 7</xref>). Together these results show that unlike the aggrephagy receptor Joka2, PexRD54 triggers responses similar to carbon-starvation-induced autophagy including induction of autophagosomes and enhanced association of ATG8CL-autophagosomes with Rab8a and LDs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>).

We observed that Rab8a knockdown not only reduces the total amount of PexRD54 autophagosomes but also the proportion of those associated with LDs compared to a silencing control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s8">Figure 7—figure supplement 8</xref>). Finally to gain further evidence of the positive contribution of LDs to PexRD54-triggered autophagosomes, we designed a RNAi silencing construct to knockdown Seipin that has been shown to contribute to LD biogenesis in yeast, animals, and plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cai et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Yang et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Taurino et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Greer et al., 2020</xref>). RNAi-mediated knockdown of the <italic>NbSeipin-A</italic> significantly reduced the amount of Oleosin-labeled LDs compared to a silencing control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s9">Figure 7—figure supplements 9</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s10">10</xref>) consistent with the established role of Seipin in LD biogenesis. <italic>NbSeipin-A</italic> knockdown significantly reduced the amount of PexRD54 puncta in the cell compared to the control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s11">Figure 7—figure supplement 11</xref>), supporting the notion that PexRD54 relies on host LD resources to stimulate autophagosome formation. Together, these data show that PexRD54 requires Rab8a to recruit lipid droplets and that LDs contribute to its induction of autophagosome formation. These findings are in agreement with the findings in yeast and mammalian cells that LDs supply membrane sources required for autophagosome formation during starvation-induced autophagy autophagosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Shpilka et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dupont et al., 2014</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-10"><title>PexRD54 subverts Rab8a to autophagosomes at the pathogen interface</title><p>Our recent work revealed that the perihaustorial niche is a hot spot for the formation of ATG8CL autophagosomes stimulated by PexRD54 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dagdas et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dagdas et al., 2018</xref>). Therefore, we next examined whether Rab8a-PexRD54 association occurs at perihaustorial ATG8CL-autophagosomes. We first checked GFP:Rab8a localization alone in the haustoriated cells. In infected leaf epidermal cells transiently or stably expressing GFP:Rab8a, we detected varying sizes of GFP:Rab8a puncta around the <italic>P. infestans</italic> haustoria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1</xref>). These structures included ring shaped compartments that are reminiscent of PexRD54-autophagosomes as well as smaller densely packed GFP-positive puncta and large vacuole like structures, indicating that Rab8a could regulate diverse trafficking pathways during infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video4">Videos 4</xref>–<xref ref-type="video" rid="video5">5</xref>). To verify that the perihaustorial Rab8a puncta represent the PexRD54-autophagosomes, we imaged infected plant cells which co-express GFP:Rab8a and the autophagosome marker protein RFP:ATG8CL in combination with BFP:PexRD54, BFP:AIMp, BFP, or Joka2:BFP. Confocal micrographs of haustoriated plant cells showed accumulation of RFP:ATG8CL-autophagosomes around the haustoria which are co-labeled with GFP:Rab8a, and are positive for BFP:PexRD54 but not BFP control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A–C</xref>). However, formation of perihaustorial puncta co-labeled by RFP:ATG8CL and GFP:Rab8a was suppressed by arresting autophagosome formation through expression of BFP:AIMp (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>). Notably, we detected a subset of perihaustorial GFP:Rab8a puncta that are not labeled by RFP:ATG8CL, further supporting an ATG8CL-independent haustorial trafficking role for Rab8a (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A–D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s2">Figure 8—figure supplement 2</xref>). In agreement with these findings, other Rab8 members including RabE1 family have been reported to localize to distinct subcellar compartments including Golgi and Peroxisomes in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Zheng et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cui et al., 2013</xref>). Therefore, we next investigated the potential colocalization of Rab8a and PexRD54 with markers that label organelles such as Golgi, peroxisomes and mitochondria. Co-expression of Rab8a and PexRD54 with GmMan1<sub>1-49</sub>-mCherry (Golgi marker), ScCOX4<sub>1-29</sub>-mCherry (mitochondria marker), or CFP-GLOX (peroxisome marker) revealed extensive co-localization of Rab8a with the Golgi marker but not with the markers that label mitochondria or peroxisomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s3">Figure 8—figure supplement 3A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Nelson et al., 2007</xref>). However, PexRD54-Rab8a puncta did not show any labeling by any of the organelle markers tested (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s3">Figure 8—figure supplement 3A</xref>). Consistent with these findings, Rab8a distinctly localized at either the Golgi or PexRD54 puncta, but not at peroxisomes or mitochondria, at the haustorium interface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s3">Figure 8—figure supplement 3B</xref>). Therefore, we conclude that Rab8a localization to PexRD54 autophagosomes cannot be explained by Rab8a’s association with these organelles. Intriguingly, we noticed that peroxisomes frequently appear around the PexRD54-Rab8a puncta, suggesting a potential involvement of this organelle in PexRD54-mediated autophagy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s3">Figure 8—figure supplement 3</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig8" position="float"><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Rab8a is recruited to perihaustorial PexRD54-ATG8CL autophagosomes.</title><p>(<bold>A-D</bold>) Confocal micrographs of <italic>P. infestans</italic>-infected <italic>N. benthamiana</italic> leaf epidermal cells transiently expressing either BFP:PexRD54 (<bold>A</bold>), BFP:EV (<bold>B</bold>), BFP:AIMp (<bold>C</bold>) or Joka2:BFP (<bold>D</bold>), with both RFP:ATG8CL and GFP:Rab8a.

This is mainly due to prolonged stress accumulation in autophagy mutants and non-autophagy related roles of the targeted genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Munch et al., 2014</xref>). Pathogen effectors that target specific components of the host autophagy machinery have emerged as alternative tools to unravel the underlying mechanisms of defense-related autophagy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dagdas et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hafrén et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Üstün et al., 2018</xref>). Here, by studying the <italic>P. infestans</italic> effector protein PexRD54, we shed light on the poorly understood mechanism of pathogen-induced autophagy in plants. We unveil a distinct pathogen virulence mechanism in which the effector protein couples host vesicle transport machinery to autophagosome biogenesis. Through its modular domain architecture, PexRD54 employs a diverse set of host proteins such as Rab8a and ATG8CL to stimulate autophagy that is reminiscent of starvation-induced autophagy. We propose a model in which PexRD54 recruits Rab8 and lipid droplets to the pathogen feeding site to stimulate autophagosome biogenesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>). Both PexRD54 and carbon starvation drive association of Rab8a and LDs which are positioned at autophagy compartments marked by ATG8CL. We hypothesize that the pathogen could benefit from this process potentially through subverting the immune function of Rab8a and gaining access to plant resources carried in autophagosomes diverted to haustoria.</p><fig id="fig10" position="float"><label>Figure 10.</label><caption><title>Model for PexRD54 subversion of host vesicle trafficking to stimulate autophagosome biogenesis at the haustorial interface.</title><p>Under carbon starvation conditions, Rab8a recruits lipid droplets (LDs) to the phagophore assembly site that contains ATG8CL to drive starvation-induced autophagy, possibly via an unknown cargo receptor or adaptor protein. During <italic>P. infestans</italic> infection, the RXLR effector PexRD54 is translocated inside the host cells across the extra-haustorial membrane (magenta). Inside the host cells PexRD54 interacts with the host autophagy protein ATG8CL and co-opts Rab8a to recruit LDs and induce the formation of autophagosomes which are directed towards the haustoria.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-65285-fig10-v2.tif"/></fig><sec id="s3-1"><title>Autophagy suppression by the AIM peptide</title><p>Effectors are excellent tools to dissect complex biological processes such as autophagy as they often display high target specificity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Schardon et al., 2016</xref>). In this study, we not only expanded our knowledge of pathogen-triggered autophagy but also discovered an effector derived peptide (AIMp) that can specifically block autophagy. Here, the AIMp served as an excellent negative control to understand PexRd54 activities and to interpret the impact of autophagy manipulation by the pathogen. We used it as a tool to perturb PexRD54 activities without directly interfering with Rab8a functions. Most <italic>ATG</italic> mutants show pleiotropic affects and have non-autophagy-related roles, making it difficult to interpret the outcomes of autophagy inhibition. However, the AIMp blocks autophagy specifically, as it directly acts on ATG8. Chemical inhibitors are also often used to measure autophagy flux. However, these inhibitors are mostly inefficient and lack the required specificity. We discovered that PexRD54’s AIM peptide is a strong autophagy suppressor effective against all potato ATG8 isoforms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Our data suggest that AIMp blocks the autophagosome biogenesis step, as both autophagosome formation and autophagic flux are suppressed by the AIMp (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2</xref>). Conceivably, the AIM peptide competitively inhibits autophagosome biogenesis by occupying the AIM docking site of ATG8 that accommodates host autophagy regulators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Noda et al., 2008</xref>). In agreement with our finding, autophagy cargo receptors that bind ATG8 via AIMs were recently shown to stimulate ATG8 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chang et al., 2021</xref>). The AIM peptide is a genetically encodable tool, which can enable spatio-temporal arrest of autophagy when expressed under inducible or tissue specific promoters. Thus, this should be of great interest for autophagy studies in plants and other systems, which can overcome the limitations of chemical autophagy inhibitors and autophagy mutants. We also developed AIM peptide derivatives with cell penetrating features, which allow studying the tissue-specific functions of autophagy. The cell penetrating AIM peptide can be used to study autophagy in plants and other eukaryotic systems that are not amenable to genetic manipulation.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>How does PexRD54 activate autophagy?</title><p>Autophagosome biogenesis is a complex multi-step process. But how could an effector activate such an intricate process? We uncovered that PexRD54 either directly or indirectly recruits Rab8a to autophagosome biogenesis sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref>). Similar channeling of Rab8a to ATG8CL-autophagosomes occurs during carbon starvation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>), suggesting that PexRD54 mimics autophagy induction via nutrient deprivation. Interestingly, the mammalian autophagy cargo receptor Optineurin also interacts with both LC3 (mammalian ATG8 isoform) and Rab8a in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bansal et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Vaibhava et al., 2012</xref>). Although the functional implications of these interactions are unclear, a proposed model suggests that Optineurin mediates pre-autophagosomal membrane elongation through anchoring Rab8a to autophagosome assembly sites. Our data is consistent with this model and suggests that PexRD54 recruits Rab8a to facilitate autophagosome formation.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>The role of Rab8a in autophagy</title><p>The membrane elongation step of autophagosome formation relies on direct transport of lipids from various donor compartments. LDs provide a membrane source for autophagosome biogenesis specifically during starvation-induced autophagy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Shpilka et al., 2015</xref>). More recently, a conserved acyl-CoA synthetase (ACS) from yeast was shown to be mobilized on nucleated phagophores where it locally mediates transport of fatty acids required for phagophore elongation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Schütter et al., 2020</xref>). But how are these lipid sources mobilized to autophagosome biogenesis sites at first? Intriguingly, the GDP bound form of the mammalian Rab8a mediates LD fusion events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Wu et al., 2014</xref>). In line with these reports, we found that PexRD54 associated more strongly with the Rab8a<sup>S29N</sup> mutant (presumably the GDP bound form) and recruits Rab8a to autophagosome biogenesis sites to enhance LD localization around the ATG8CL-foci and stimulate autophagosome formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s4">Figure 7—figure supplements 4</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s10">10</xref>). However, we did not find any luminal signal with the FA marker, indicating that FAs are not the likely the cargoes of PexRD54. Furthermore, we detected FAs labeled with Bodipy but not the LD membrane marker protein Oleosin localized to periphery of the PexRD54 compartments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7G</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s5">Figure 7—figure supplements 5</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s6">6</xref>). This suggests that PexRD54 could employ Rab8a to position LDs at ATG8CL nucleation sites to facilitate lipid transfer for autophagosome biogenesis. Interestingly, PexRD54-triggered association of Rab8a and LDs is also enhanced by carbon starvation but not by Joka2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7G–H</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s6">Figure 7—figure supplement 6</xref>). We propose that upon carbon starvation, the plant uses LDs as an additional membrane source to accommodate for an increase in autophagosome biogenesis, and PexRD54 exploits this process to stimulate autophagy. Nevertheless, Rab8a may not be engaged in all autophagy routes, as it is dispensable for Joka2-mediated autophagy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). This is consistent with the finding that Arabidopsis NBR1 (Joka2) mutants are sensitive to a variety of abiotic stress conditions but not to carbon starvation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Zhou et al., 2013</xref>). Our results are consistent with the recent findings in yeast, where LDs specifically contribute to starvation-induced autophagy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Shpilka et al., 2015</xref>). Nevertheless, further assays are needed to determine whether Rab8a is implicated in other autophagy pathways. Altogether, combined with previous findings, we conclude that distinct cellular transport pathways feed autophagosome formation during diverse selective autophagy pathways in plants.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>The role of Rab8a in immunity</title><p>Our data revealed that the Rab8a family contributes to basal resistance against <italic>P. infestans</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s6">Figure 8—figure supplements 6</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s8">8</xref>). Rab8a belongs to the Rab8 family of small GTPases that are implicated in polarized secretion events in eukaryotes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Pfeffer, 2017</xref>).

However, the extent to which Rab8 family members function in immunity remains unknown. Our findings revealed that Rab8a is most likely involved in a diverse range of cellular transport pathways including autophagy. Consistent with the evolutionarily conserved role of Rab8 family members in polarized secretion, we detected Rab8a localization to Golgi around the haustorium. These findings suggest that Rab8a has a function in defense-related secretion that possibly contributes to plant focal immune responses. Further research is required to determine the cargoes and the potential defense-related functions of Rab8a during infection.</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Why does <italic>P. infestans</italic> activate autophagy?</title><p>Autophagy suppression by the AIM peptide leads to reduced pathogen virulence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>), indicating that host autophagy inhibition is not favorable to <italic>P. infestans</italic>. This could explain why <italic>P. infestans</italic> deploys PexRD54, which can neutralize defense-related autophagy mediated by Joka2, while enabling other autophagy pathways that are somewhat beneficial. Intriguingly, the autophagy pathway primed by PexRD54 resembles autophagy induced by carbon starvation, but not to autophagy induced by the aggrephagy cargo receptor Joka2. In contrast to Joka2, both PexRD54 and light restriction stimulated enhanced Rab8a-ATG8CL and Rab8a-LD associations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). Furthermore, their effect on autophagosome formation were not additive (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A–B</xref>). This hints at the possibility that PexRD54 could facilitate nutrient uptake from the host cells by mimicking starvation conditions to stimulate autophagy. This view is further supported by our earlier finding that PexRD54-autophagosomes are diverted to the haustorial interface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dagdas et al., 2016</xref>). However, our data suggests that the fate of PexRD54 autophagosomes in infected and uninfected cells could be different, since in uninfected cells PexRD54 is degraded inside the plant vacuole following 4–6 days of ectopic expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplements 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">3</xref>). Therefore, PexRD54 may or may not be degraded in infected plant cells. PexRD54 is a member of RXLR effectors which typically show high level of expression during 2–5 days of infection. Consequently, even if PexRD54 is depleted via host autophagy machinery during infection, there would be more of it secreted via the haustorium to maintain PexRD54 virulence functions as long as the haustorium is accommodated in the host cells. PexRD54 likely remodels the cargoes engulfed in ATG8CL-autophagosomes targeted to pathogen interface, which are presumably assimilated by the parasite. Whether these cargoes are hydrolyzed in infected plant cells or directly absorbed by the pathogen remains to be determined. Alternatively, but not mutually exclusively, PexRD54 could also help neutralize defense-related host components by engulfing them in secure membrane-bound autophagy compartments. For instance, PexRD54 could promote diversion of Rab8a to autophagy to intervene with non-autophagy related immune functions of Rab8a (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). Therefore, we cannot exclude the possibility that PexRD54 could activate other host autophagy pathways that are beneficial to the pathogen, and further research is needed to determine whether PexRD54 could mimic other autophagy inducing conditions.</p><p>In summary, our findings demonstrate that to support its virulence, <italic>P. infestans</italic> manipulates plant cellular degradative and transport systems by deploying an effector protein that imitates carbon starvation conditions. It also demonstrates effectors can act as adaptors to bridge multiple host components to modulate complex cellular processes for the benefit the pathogen. Further research is needed (i) to determine the cargo of these autophagosomes, (ii) whether they are secreted to the pathogen interface and subsequently absorbed by the pathogen, and (iii) the

RFP:PexRD54, RFP:AIMp, RFP:ATG8CL, RFP:Rab8a, Joka2:RFP, BFP:AIMp, 3xHA:PexRD54, 3xHA:PexRD54aim, and 3xHA:Rd54AIMp constructs were generated by Gibson assembly of each gene PCR fragment into EcoRV digested RFP/tagBFP/HA vectors (N-terminal fusion for PexRD54, PexRD54aim, PexRD54AIMp and ATG8CL, C-terminal fusion for Joka2). For YFP:Oleosin, the eYFP fluorophore was split into N-terminal (residue M1- A155) and C-terminal half (residue D156 - K239). The N-terminal split YFP half was used via a linker peptide RPACKIPNDLKQKVMNH and the C-terminal split YFP half via a linker peptide HNMVKQKLDNPIKCAPR. EcoRV restriction site was added at the end of each linker to allow linearization of the vector and provide an insertion site for subsequent cloning. The DNA fragment encoding Oleosin, together with the linker peptides and restriction sites were amplified from <italic>N. benthamiana</italic> gDNA using primers NYFP-Oleosin F and Oleosin-CYFP R then assembled into pK7WGF2 vector backbone by Gibson assembly. GFP:Rab8a and RFP:Rab8a constructs were generated by PCR amplification from <italic>Solanum tuberosum</italic> cDNA using primers GW_StRab8a-1_F GW_StRab8a-1_R followed by Gateway cloning into the entry vector pENTR/D/TOPO (Invitrogen) then into the pK7WGF2 (GFP) and pH7WGR2 (RFP) vectors, respectively. RFP:GUS was created from the pENTR-GUS control plasmid provided in the GATEWAY cloning kit and inserted into pH7WGR2 (RFP) via LR reaction. Single residue mutations of Rab8aS29N, Rab8aQ74L and Rab8aN128I were obtained by inverse polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification of the StRab8a entry clone with the primer pairs (phosphorylated at five prime ends) carrying desired mutations; (i) Rab8aS29N_F and Rab8aS29N_R; (ii) Rab8aQ74L_F and Rab8aQ74L_R; (iii) Rab8aN128I_F and Rab8aN128I_R. Templates were then eliminated by one-hour Dpn-I (New England Biolabs) restriction digestion at 37°C and the PCR products of mutants were ligated using standard protocols to obtain circular Gateway entry clones carrying desired mutations. Next, the entry clones of Rab8a mutants were recombined into destination vectors pK7WGF2 or pB7RWG2 by Gateway LR reaction. All remaining constructs were amplified from existing constructs previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bozkurt et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dagdas et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dagdas et al., 2018</xref>), using primer pairs GA_RD54_F with GA_RD54_R for PexRD54, GA_RD54_F with GA_LIR2_R for PexRD54aim, GA_AIMp_F with GA_LIR2_R for PexRD54AIMp, GA_ATG8C_F with GA_ATG8C_R for ATG8CL and GA_NbJoka2_1_Fr with GA_NbJoka2_1_Rv.

Silencing of Rab8a was verified using RT-PCR. CFP-GLOX (Glycolate oxidase) was generated by PCR amplification from wheat cDNA using primers GLOX-F and GLOX-R followed by Gateway cloning into the entry vector pENTR/D/TOPO (Invitrogen) then into the pGWB445 (CFP) vector.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Synthetic construct generation</title><p>The sequence for the silencing resistant synthetic Rab8a construct (Rab8a-1<sup>syn</sup>) was obtained by codon shuffling the sequence of Rab8a-1 through a combination of the Integrated DNA Technologies (IDT) Codon optimization tool and manual codon shuffling.

GAPDH is used to normalize the transcription levels of the genes.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Confocal microscopy and image processing</title><p>Microscopy analyses were carried out on live leaf tissue 3–4 days post agroinfiltration. To minimize the damage of live tissue, leaf discs of <italic>N. benthamiana</italic> were cut using a cork borer and mounted onto Carolina observation gel (Carolina Biological Supply Company). For BODIPY-dodecanoic acid (BODIPY-C12, Invitrogen) staining, 10 μM was infiltrated into the leaf tissue 5 hr prior to observation. For PexRD54 AIM peptide experiments in leaf tissue, a solution of 10 μM of peptide in agroinfiltration buffer or buffer alone was infiltrated in leaves 3 hr prior to observation. For imaging in roots, seedlings were collected at 3 weeks old and the roots placed in 2 mL tubes containing 5 μM peptide solution in agroinfiltration buffer or buffer alone for 3 hr prior to observation. Confocal florescence microscopy was performed using Leica SP5 and SP8 resonant inverted confocal microscope (Leica Microsystems) using 63x and 40x water immersion objective, respectively. In order to excite fluorescent tagged proteins, Diode laser excitation was set to 405 nm, Argon laser to 488 nm and the Helium-Neon laser to 561 nm and their fluorescent emissions detected at 450–480, 495–550, and 570–620 nm to visualize BFP, GFP, and RFP fluorescence, respectively. Sequential scanning between lines was done to avoid spectral mixing from different fluorophores and images acquired using multichannel. Maximum intensity projections of Z-stack images were processed using ImageJ (2.0) to enhance image clarity.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Data analysis and statistics</title><p>Images for quantification of autophagosome numbers were obtained from Z stacks consisting of 1.3 μm depth field multi-layered images with similar settings for all samples unless stated otherwise. To detect and quantify punctate structures in one channel (green channel or red channel or blue channel) and to validate colocalization an overlay of two or three channel, where applicable, was acquired (green channel and/or red channel and/or blue channel). Z stacks were separated into individual images with the ImageJ (2.0) program and analyzed. Autopahgosome quantification was done using ATG8CL as a marker protein as described before (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dagdas et al., 2016</xref>). Colocalization of puncta was analyzed using ImageJ (2.0) with a modified version of the colocalization macro described elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Pampliega et al., 2013</xref>) with thresholding set as manual to avoid background cytoplasmic signals in each image. Boxplots were generated with mean of punctate numbers generated from stacks obtained in three to six independent biological experiments. Statistical differences were analysed by Welch Two Sample t-test in R.

We then algorithmically identify the enclosed regions formed by the boundaries and counted the number of puncta in each figure. For the case of co-localisation, the co-ordinates of the centres of the puncta/clusters from each channel were calculated and compared to see if they lie within a small tolerance for each puncta and channel.

Previous research from the group of Tolga Bozkurt already identified how PexRD54 counteracts Joka2-dependent selective autophagy and hence anti-microbial autophagy. However, the exact mechanism of how this effector activates autophagy and additional pro-microbial functions of autophagy during Phytophthora-host interaction remain elusive. The authors first clarify that the AIM motif of PexRD54 is not the feature that is responsible for autophagy activation. Surprisingly, they identify that this motif inactivates autophagy (and thus restricts pathogenicity of Phytophthora), which will be a valuable tool for the autophagy community in the future. Previous interaction studies revealed that a small Ras-related GTPase, Rab8 might interact with RexRD54 as it interacts with ATG8CL. Indeed, Rab8 associates with RexRD54 independent of its capacity to bind ATG8. Its association with autophagosomes is further increased by PexRD54. Loss of function mutants of Rab8 result in an impaired PexRD54-dependent induction of autophagosomes and provide a first evidence that Rab8 is required for PexRD54-triggered autophagy. The effector seems to activate autophagy that resembles carbon-starvation induced autophagy, which seems to be dependent on Rab8.</p><p>The paper is very well-written and provides a detailed, mechanistic analysis of the function of PexRD54. It proves, how powerful it is to work with effectors as tools to identify novel (autophagy) components. The conclusions of this paper are well supported by data, but some aspects need clarification or small additional control experiments.</p><p>Comments:</p><p>1) By using effectors as probes, the authors identify a novel tool (AIMp) to study the role of autophagy and also reveal a novel autophagy component. Both will have a major impact on the autophagy community in plants (and maybe beyond if the AIMp works across kingdoms). However, to me it is not 100% clear how the first part about the AIMp really connects to Rab8 and also subsequent analysis of carbon starvation-triggered autophagy. The authors claim at the end of the section that their analysis of the AIMp reveals that there must be other features within PexRD54 to stimulate autophagy (like association with Rab8). But AIMs are not really the autophagy-activating motif, they mediated interaction with ATG8 and enable specific degradation of cargos. Also, little evidence is provided how AIMp functions to block autophagy (additional control experiments might reveal this) and if its effect is really broad (other plant species) or only limited to <italic>N. benthamiana</italic>.</p><p>2) With Rab8, a small ras-related GTPase, the authors identify a novel autophagy component that might be involved in autophagosome biogenesis. The analysis of Rab8 is detailed and provides mechanistic insights how Rab8 contributes to the function of PexRD54 to boost autophagy. Most of the analysis is done with the potato Rab8. The in-planta analysis of Rab8 function in autophagy is performed by silencing Rab8 in <italic>N. benthamiana</italic>. However, no evidence is provided whether PexRD54 is interacting with the four NbRab8 proteins or whether Rab8 from potato and tobacco are very similar (phylogenetic analysis or similar).</p><p>3) In addition, to claim that RexRD54 is triggering an autophagy-response similar to carbon-starvation induced autophagy is a bit overinterpreted and lacks further experimental evidence. Additional proof is missing that the short dark period really induces carbon starvation in <italic>N. benthamiana</italic> leaves. PexRD54 might activate multiple (selective) autophagy pathways that are beneficial for the pathogen as autophagy has a very broad role and is implicated in many cellular processes. Additional small experiments (further analysis of hallmarks of carbon starvation e.g., induction of chlorophagy etc.) or adding a more in-depth discussion about the possibility that PexRD54 might induce more than carbon-starvation-triggered autophagy, will improve this section.</p><p>Specific points to the authors:</p><p>1) The section about the AIMp would profit from some additional small control experiments:</p><p>-Gene expression analysis of ATG8 and Joka2 (to exclude it is due to transcriptional activation of both genes).</p><p>-Block of autophagy in autophagy-inducing conditions: e.g. carbon starvation or AZD treatment in plants. Is it possible it blocks only specific autophagy responses?</p><p>2) Does the AIMp also work in Arabidopsis? I guess this would be great to know for the autophagy community and would highlight the broad function of the AIMp. It would be also good to elaborate a bit on the potential mechanism how AIMp inactivates autophagy. As autophagosomes are less formed it looks like biogenesis is affected, did the authors already investigate this or is this subject of future research?</p><p>3) The authors provide evidence that PexRD54 ends up in the vacuole and is degraded eventually. How does this fit into its function to boost pathogenicity and diverting autophagy to the infection interface to provide the pathogen with &quot;nutrients&quot;? If the effector is degraded it might not be able to boost autophagy anymore. I would elaborate on this a bit more.</p><p>4) Silencing of Rab8 in <italic>N. benthamiana</italic> nicely demonstrate that it is required for PexRD54-triggered autophagy. How similar are the Rab8s to the one from potato that was used in the interaction studies? Do they interact with ATG8 and with PexRD54? Considering also that there are 4 and silencing of all of them but not of 1+2 influences basal autophagy, it would be interesting to see whether PexRD54 interacts only with a subset of NbRab8s. I also don't agree with the last sentence on p15. As I understand silencing of 1+2 is not impacting basal autophagy but silencing of all of them does. Did the authors target 3+4 only to elucidate this? They might not have redundant function in the end if 2 influence basal autophagy and the other ones not.</p><p>5) In the last section, the authors conclude that PexRD54 triggers an autophagy response similar to carbon-starvation induced autophagy. McLoughlin et al., 2020 (TPC) covered maize leaves for 2d to induced carbon starvation. Of course, maize and <italic>N. benthamiana</italic> are different organisms but is 24 hours really sufficient to trigger a carbon starvation response? No evidence, apart from ATG8 puncta accumulation (which is also quite mild) is provided that carbon starvation is really ongoing. Theoretically, autophagy inducing conditions degrade ATG8 also more rapidly, thus inhibition of vacuolar degradation (e.g., E64d, or ConcA) should be included to assess the real flux of ATG8 during autophagy inducing conditions. It is also possible to provide transcriptional upregulation of the autophagy pathway during these conditions. The authors provide support for their carbon-starvation theory by showing that BODIPY co-localizes stronger with Rab8 in the presence of PexRD54. Still, I think that more data is required to be able to conclude that PexRD54 is triggering a carbon-starvation-like response (looking into chlorophagy, amino acid accumulation, sugars, metabolome analysis). I guess that this is not really the scope of this manuscript. Alternatively, the authors could add control experiments with AZD8055 or Tm (e.g., analyzing the BODIPY co-localization) and/or discuss the possibility that other autophagy responses might be triggered by PexRD54 that are beneficial for the pathogen.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>In this manuscript, authors analyzed biological significance of the interaction between an effector protein PexRD54 secreted by the Irish famine pathogen <italic>Phytophthora infestans</italic> and a host membrane trafficking regulator RAB8a. Authors demonstrated that expression of the ATG8 interacting motif (AIM) of PexRD54 and full-length PexRD54 distinctly affected autophagosome formation in N. bethamiana, and speculated that the distinct effects should be conferred by interaction of full-length PexRD54 with additional factors to ATG8. Authors then showed that the GDP-bound state of RAB8a, a member of RAB GTPases acting in membrane trafficking, interacted with PexRD54 at a distinct region from the AIM, and showed that RAB8a was required for PexRD54-induced autophagy, whereas RAB8a was not involved in Joka2-mediated antimicrobial autophagy. Autophagosomes induced by PexRD54 were stained by Bodipy C-12, and lipid droplets were observed closely associated to the autophagosomes. RAB8a knock down resulted in reduced association between PexRD54-positive autophagosomes and LDs, suggesting that RAB8a promoted recruitment of LDs to autophagosome formation sites. Furthermore, authors' finding that the AIM peptide from PexRD54 acts as a general inhibitor of autophagy would provide a powerful methodology to modulate autophagic activity at any tissues and developmental stages of users' interest.</p><p>The reported mechanism of autophagosome formation involving RAB8 and LDs induced by the pathogen is novel and interesting. A few supporting data addressing questions listed below, mainly on the RAB8 function, could make this work more convincing and solid.</p><p>a. Regarding the RAB8-positive punctate compartments. RAB8 has been localized to the Golgi apparatus (Speth et al., 2009, Plant Phys), peroxisome (Cui et al., 2013, JBC), and SCD-positive compartments (Meyers et al., 2017, Plant Cell). Are these compartments with RAB8 are recruited to autophagosome formation sites induced by PexRD54 or infection? Otherwise, RAB8a is recruited there irrespective of these compartments?</p><p>b. As long as I know, RAB GTPases with the N-to-I mutation frequently act as a dominant negative form because this mutant titrates molecules that preferentially interact with GDP-bound and/or nucleotide-free forms of RAB GTPases such as GEFs, similar to the GDP-freeze S-to-N mutant. Could authors provide discussion regarding why these mutant versions of RAB8a conferred distinct effects on autophagosome formation induced by PexRD54?</p><p>c. Related to the above, could authors include the result of the ATG8CL puncta in cells expressing HA:PexRD54 without GFP-RAB8a co-expression, which would be needed to evaluate the dominant-negative effect of the RAB8aNI mutant?</p><p>d. For the experiment presented in Figure 8—figure supplement 3. Have authors observed other organelles in this experiment? The data of organelles, which do not accumulate with RAB8a and LDs, would be a nice negative control.</p><p>e. I expect that mutant versions of RAB8a would also affect lesion formation when co-injected with the pathogen. Could authors provide a data using RAB8a such that presented in Figure 9C?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>In this study authors provide a mechanistic insight on the interplay between a <italic>Phytophthora infestans</italic> effector protein PexRD54, plant endomembrane trafficking system and the major catabolic pathway – autophagy. Authors build on their previous observations to demonstrate how the effector protein reroutes trafficking of host endomembranes to the benefit of the pathogen. Using a combination of mutagenesis, biochemistry and advanced microscopy methods authors show that PexRD54 effector protein triggers recruitment of plant Rab8 small GTPase and lipid droplets for formation of autophagosomes, which are then diverted from the typical route to degradation and are potentially delivering nutrients to the pathogen. Furthermore, authors confirm the physiological relevance of the molecular biology results for the <italic>P. infestans</italic> infection efficacy. These study adds a valuable insight on the complex role of the plant autophagy in plant pathogen interactions and demonstrates a potential across-kingdoms conservation of the Rab8 role in regulating fusion of lipid droplets and in polarized re-distribution of endomembranes.</p><p>The data is generally of a high quality and authors provide thorough verification for each hypothesis by implementing combinations of cell biology and biochemistry assays. To further strengthen the study authors could address the following issues:</p><p>1. Co-localization analyses could be more comprehensively conducted by implementing standard object- or pixel-based high throughput protocols.</p><p>2. Authors conclude that PexRD54 imitates carbon starvation conditions that trigger a specific type of autophagic response. However, no other types of autophagy-inducing conditions were compared to PexRD54 mode of actions.</p><p>3. PexRD54 is not only diverting autophagy but is also being degraded by it. To better clarify the dynamics of this balance, it would be beneficial to add to the current data a comparison of differences in the rate of autophagosome delivery to the vacuole under carbon starvation-induced autophagy and autophagy induced by PexRD54.</p><p>The manuscript is very well structured and written, the logic of the results is easy to follow and majority of the data is of a high quality.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.65285.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>All reviewers are enthusiastic about your manuscript, but some parts still need to be improved.</p><p>Here you find a list of essential revisions for the manuscript to become acceptable.

We used it as a tool to perturb PexRD54 activities without directly interfering with Rab8a functions.

We also tested autophagy activation by the aggrephagy cargo receptor Joka2 (Figure 6-7). We also had the data that there is no additive effects of carbon starvation or PexRD54 on ATG8 puncta (Figure 7A-B). Based on these findings, we concluded that PexRD54 triggered autophagy is reminiscent of autophagy induced by carbon starvation, but not to autophagy induced by the aggrephagy receptor Joka2/NBR1 (Jung et al., 2019, Journal of Experimental Botany). We revised the text to better explain this point in the relevant results and Discussion sections</p><p>In the earlier version of the manuscript, we quantified ATG8 puncta to determine the effect of carbon starvation. We now include new data that 24 hours of light restriction leads to enhanced ATG8 depletion (Figure 7—figure supplement 1)</p><p>However, we also agree that we have not tested whether PexRD54 could trigger responses similar to other potential autophagy inducing conditions. Therefore, we revised the text accordingly and toned down the statements as follows:</p><p>“Intriguingly, the autophagy pathway primed by PexRD54 resembles autophagy induced by carbon starvation, but not to autophagy induced by the aggrephagy cargo receptor Joka2. In contrast to Joka2, both PexRD54 and light restriction stimulated enhanced Rab8a-ATG8CL and Rab8a-LD associations (Figure 6 and Figure 7). Furthermore, their effects on autophagosome formation were not additive (Figure 7A-B)…… Therefore, we cannot exclude the possibility that PexRD54 could activate other host autophagy pathways that are beneficial to the pathogen. Further research is needed to determine whether PexRD54 could mimic other autophagy inducing conditions and exploit other host autophagy pathways.”</p><p>“Nevertheless, further assays are needed to determine whether Rab8a is implicated in other autophagy pathways.”</p><p>“However, it is possible that PexRD54 could activate other host autophagy pathways that favor pathogen virulence.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Determine whether RAB8 autophagosomes induced by PexRD54 or infection.</p></disp-quote><p>We detected at least two different sets of Rab8a puncta around the haustorium; some that are labeled by ATG8CL and some that are not (Figure 8A-D, Figure 8—figure supplement 2). In haustoriated cells AIMp only blocked the Rab8a puncta that is positive for ATG8CL (Figure 8B, Figure 8—figure supplement 2), indicating that Rab8a autophagosomes are induced by PexRD54. Likewise, upon overexpressing Joka2, which competes with PexRD54 for ATG8CL binding (Figure 8D), we did not see any ATG8CL puncta that is positive for Rab8a around the haustorium. Our data that PexRD54 expression (in the absence of infection) boosts Rab8a-ATG8CL colocalization and association (Figure 4) further supports the notion that Rab8 autophagosomes are induced by PexRD54.</p><p>In addition, Rev2 highlighted that other Rab8 members (RabE1 family) associate with Golgi and peroxisomes in Arabidopsis, and asked whether Rab8a autophagosome recruitment in infected cells could be associated with these compartments. As suggested, we checked the potential colocalization of perihaustorial Rab8a with organelle markers. We now provide data that Rab8a localizes to Golgi but not to peroxisomes or to mitochondria in both infected and uninfected cells. However, perihaustorial Rab8a/PexRD54 autophagosomes are not labeled by the Golgi marker (Figure 8—figure supplement 3). This also confirms our finding that at least two distinct Rab8a puncta target the pathogen interface and PexRD54 possibly directs a subpopulation of Rab8a from Golgi to PexRD54/ATG8CL autophagosomes. Therefore, we conclude that Rab8a localization to PexRD54 autophagosomes cannot be explained by Rab8a’s association with these organelles.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Evaluate a possible dominant-negative effect of RAB8aNI and whether they affect lesion formation by the pathogen.</p></disp-quote><p>We provide data that RAB8aNI has a dominant negative affect on PexRD54 triggered autophagy (Figure 5—figure supplement 8).</p><p>We also provide data that RAB8aNI leads to more susceptibility. Consistent with this data, silencing of Rab8a1-4 leads to enhanced susceptibly. We were able to rescue this phenotype by overexpressing a silencing resilient synthetic construct of Rab8a (Figure 8—figure supplements 6-8) These findings suggest that Rab8a plays a positive role in immunity, whereas PexRD54 could interfere with this process by diverting a subpopulation of Rab8a to the autophagosomes.</p><p>We updated the text accordingly and included a new section about the “role of Rab8a in immunity” in the discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Elaborate/discuss more on how PexRD54 may boost pathogenicity although it is degraded in the vacuole and try to accommodate reviewer #3's comments regarding the discussion.</p></disp-quote><p>We explained this by expanding the Discussion section (Page 34, “why does <italic>P. infestans activate autophagy?)” as follows:</italic></p><p>“… However, our data suggests that the fate of PexRD54 autophagosomes in infected and uninfected cells could be different, since in uninfected cells PexRD54 is degraded inside the plant vacuole following 4-6 days of ectopic expression (Figure 2—figure supplement 1-3). Therefore, PexRD54 may or may not be degraded in infected plant cells during infection. PexRD54 is a member of RXLR effectors which typically show high level of expression during 2-5 days of infection. Consequently, even if PexRD54 is depleted via host autophagy machinery during infection, there would be more of it secreted via the haustorium to maintain PexRD54 virulence functions as long as the haustorium is accommodated in the host cells. PexRD54 likely remodels the cargoes engulfed in ATG8CL<sup>-</sup>autophagosomes targeted to pathogen interface, which are subsequently assimilated by the parasite. Whether these cargoes are hydrolyzed in infected plant cells or directly absorbed by the pathogen remains to be determined.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>Comments:</p><p>1) By using effectors as probes, the authors identify a novel tool (AIMp) to study the role of autophagy and also reveal a novel autophagy component.

Please see responses to the editor point 1.</p><p>We agree with the reviewer that AIMs are not necessarily autophagy activating motifs. Our data that AIMp blocks autophagy activation is consistent with this notion. However, we already showed in an earlier study (Dagdas et al., 2016) that PexRD54 and Joka2 AIM motifs are required to stimulate ATG8CL puncta formation. This indicates that these proteins have additional features other than having an AIMp to stimulate autophagosome formation. This is also consistent with the recent findings by Chang <italic>et al.</italic> (Chang et al., 2021, Science Advances) which showed that autophagy cargo receptors, which bind ATG8 via AIMs, can stimulate ATG8 lipidation via different mechanisms.</p><p>We believe that the AIMp blocks autophagy by occupying the AIM binding pocket on ATG8 and thereby competing out the autophagy adaptors/receptors required to stimulate autophagy.

Alternatively, NbRab8a 3-4 might be involved in basal autophagy whereas NbRab1-2 are not, which needs to be tested in future.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) In the last section, the authors conclude that PexRD54 triggers an autophagy response similar to carbon-starvation induced autophagy. McLoughlin et al., 2020 (TPC) covered maize leaves for 2d to induced carbon starvation. Of course, maize and N. benthamiana are different organisms but is 24 hours really sufficient to trigger a carbon starvation response? No evidence, apart from ATG8 puncta accumulation (which is also quite mild) is provided that carbon starvation is really ongoing. Theoretically, autophagy inducing conditions degrade ATG8 also more rapidly, thus inhibition of vacuolar degradation (e.g., E64d, or ConcA) should be included to assess the real flux of ATG8 during autophagy inducing conditions. It is also possible to provide transcriptional upregulation of the autophagy pathway during these conditions. The authors provide support for their carbon-starvation theory by showing that BODIPY co-localizes stronger with Rab8 in the presence of PexRD54. Still, I think that more data is required to be able to conclude that PexRD54 is triggering a carbon-starvation-like response (looking into chlorophagy, amino acid accumulation, sugars, metabolome analysis). I guess that this is not really the scope of this manuscript. Alternatively, the authors could add control experiments with AZD8055 or Tm (e.g., analyzing the BODIPY co-localization) and/or discuss the possibility that other autophagy responses might be triggered by PexRD54 that are beneficial for the pathogen.</p></disp-quote><p>Overall, we agree with these points and we revised the text accordingly as explained in response to editor’s point no 3. We now provide evidence that ATG8 depletion is enhanced by light restriction (Figure 7—figure supplement 1). Throughout this work, we avoided using E64d and ConcA, as we did not obtain consistent results with these inhibitors. It is likely that they may not work with the same efficiency in <italic>N. benthamiana</italic> compared to Arabidopsis. There is also potential interference by Agrobacterium.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>In this manuscript, authors analyzed biological significance of the interaction between an effector protein PexRD54 secreted by the Irish famine pathogen Phytophthora infestans and a host membrane trafficking regulator RAB8a. Authors demonstrated that expression of the ATG8 interacting motif (AIM) of PexRD54 and full-length PexRD54 distinctly affected autophagosome formation in N. bethamiana, and speculated that the distinct effects should be conferred by interaction of full-length PexRD54 with additional factors to ATG8. Authors then showed that the GDP-bound state of RAB8a, a member of RAB GTPases acting in membrane trafficking, interacted with PexRD54 at a distinct region from the AIM, and showed that RAB8a was required for PexRD54-induced autophagy, whereas RAB8a was not involved in Joka2-mediated antimicrobial autophagy. Autophagosomes induced by PexRD54 were stained by Bodipy C-12, and lipid droplets were observed closely associated to the autophagosomes. RAB8a knock down resulted in reduced association between PexRD54-positive autophagosomes and LDs, suggesting that RAB8a promoted recruitment of LDs to autophagosome formation sites. Furthermore, authors' finding that the AIM peptide from PexRD54 acts as a general inhibitor of autophagy would provide a powerful methodology to modulate autophagic activity at any tissues and developmental stages of users' interest.</p><p>The reported mechanism of autophagosome formation involving RAB8 and LDs induced by the pathogen is novel and interesting. A few supporting data addressing questions listed below, mainly on the RAB8 function, could make this work more convincing and solid.</p><p>a. Regarding the RAB8-positive punctate compartments. RAB8 has been localized to the Golgi apparatus (Speth et al., 2009, Plant Phys), peroxisome (Cui et al., 2013, JBC), and SCD-positive compartments (Meyers et al., 2017, Plant Cell). Are these compartments with RAB8 are recruited to autophagosome formation sites induced by PexRD54 or infection? Otherwise, RAB8a is recruited there irrespective of these compartments?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for their careful evaluation and constructive criticism. As suggested, we checked the potential colocalization of perihaustorial Rab8a with organelle markers. We now provide data that Rab8a localizes to Golgi but not to peroxisomes or to mitochondria in both infected and uninfected cells. However, perihaustorial Rab8a/PexRD54 autophagosomes are not labeled by the Golgi marker (Figure 8—figure supplement 3). This also confirms our finding that at least two distinct Rab8a puncta target the pathogen interface and PexRD54 possibly directs a subpopulation of Rab8a from Golgi to PexRD54/ATG8CL autophagosomes. Therefore, we conclude that Rab8a localization to PexRD54 autophagosomes cannot be explained by Rab8a’s association with these organelles. (The results with the SCD marker were inconclusive as the construct for this we obtained was using the native Arabidopsis promoter and did not produce any signal in <italic>N. benthamiana</italic> in our hands)</p><p>In haustoriated cells AIMp only blocked the Rab8a puncta that is positive for ATG8CL (Figure 8B, Figure 8—figure supplement 2), indicating that Rab8a autophagosomes are induced by PexRD54. Likewise, upon overexpression of Joka2, which competes with PexRD54 for ATG8CL binding (Figure 8D), we did not see any ATG8CL puncta that is positive for Rab8a around the haustorium. Our data that PexRD54 expression (in the absence of infection) boosts Rab8a-ATG8CL colocalization and association (Figure 4) further supports the notion that Rab8 autophagosomes are induced by PexRD54.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>b. As long as I know, RAB GTPases with the N-to-I mutation frequently act as a dominant negative form because this mutant titrates molecules that preferentially interact with GDP-bound and/or nucleotide-free forms of RAB GTPases such as GEFs, similar to the GDP-freeze S-to-N mutant. Could authors provide discussion regarding why these mutant versions of RAB8a conferred distinct effects on autophagosome formation induced by PexRD54?</p></disp-quote><p>As highlighted by the reviewer Rab GTPase N-to-I mutants generally act as dominant negative forms and our data with this mutant is consistent with this notion (Figure 5—figure supplement 7-8). We were initially surprised by our data that S29N mutant showed enhanced PexRD54 puncta whereas the Q74L mutant did not. However, earlier work showed that these mutations cannot be generalized and could have different outcomes when introduced into different Rabs (Langemeyer et al., 2014, <italic>eLife</italic>; Pfeffer et al., 2014, e<italic>Life</italic>). Consitent with this view, Rab8-GDP mutant was found to have an unusual acitivty to promote LD fusions in mamallian cells, indicating that S-to-N mutation in this Rab functions differently. We included additional information in the relevant result section as follows:</p><p>“These findings were initially surprising given the general view that Rab S-to-N mutations in this position lead to less active (or inactive) forms that mimic the GDP bound state whereas the Q-to-L mutations in this site are assumed to be locked in GTP bound state that is more active. However, there are reports which revealed that these mutations cannot be generalized (Langemeyer et al., 2014; Pfeffer et al., 2014). Consistent with this view, the GDP bound form of the mammalian Rab8a was found to promote lipid droplet (LD) fusions, indicating that S-to-N mutation in this Rab functions differently. Therefore, further biochemical evidence is required to determine whether these mutations show perturbed GTPase activities.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>c. Related to the above, could authors include the result of the ATG8CL puncta in cells expressing HA:PexRD54 without GFP-RAB8a co-expression, which would be needed to evaluate the dominant-negative effect of the RAB8aNI mutant?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree this would be required to determine the dominant negative effect. We now provide this data in (Figure 5—figure supplement 8)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>d. For the experiment presented in Figure 8—figure supplement 3. Have authors observed other organelles in this experiment? The data of organelles, which do not accumulate with RAB8a and LDs, would be a nice negative control.</p></disp-quote><p>This is a good suggestion. We now included new panel in which mitochondria marker is used as a negative control. Please note that this is now labeled as Figure 8—figure supplement 4.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>e. I expect that mutant versions of RAB8a would also affect lesion formation when co-injected with the pathogen. Could authors provide a data using RAB8a such that presented in Figure 9C?</p></disp-quote><p>We provide data that RAB8aNI leads to more susceptibility. Consistent with this data, silencing of Rab8a1-4 leads to enhanced susceptibly. We were able to rescue this phenotype by overexpressing a silencing resilient synthetic construct of Rab8a (Figure 8—figure supplements 6-8) These findings suggest that Rab8a plays a positive role in immunity, whereas PexRD54 could interfere with this process by diverting a subpopulation of Rab8a to the autophagosomes.</p><p>We updated the text accordingly and included a new section about the “role of Rab8a in immunity” in the discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>The data is generally of a high quality and authors provide thorough verification for each hypothesis by implementing combinations of cell biology and biochemistry assays. To further strengthen the study authors could address the following issues:</p><p>1. Co-localization analyses could be more comprehensively conducted by implementing standard object- or pixel-based high throughput protocols.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that pixel-based colocalization analysis would generally be ideal to determine precise localization of fluorescently labeled proteins. In our manuscript, we used the colocalization macro reported in (Pampliega <italic>et al.,</italic> 2013, Nature) that is ideal to measure red/green puncta to quantify autophagosome colocalization. We were mainly interested in colocalization at the punctate structures, however the proteins that we study (PexRD4, Rab8a, ATG8CL, Joka2) have background cytoplasmic signals which perturbed colocalization analysis when using pixel-based measurements. The macro used for ATG8 puncta analysis was ideal in our case also because we looked at relative differences among different treatments that were quite substantial. We also provided biochemical evidence supporting these analyses.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. Authors conclude that PexRD54 imitates carbon starvation conditions that trigger a specific type of autophagic response. However, no other types of autophagy-inducing conditions were compared to PexRD54 mode of actions.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that we did not expensively looked into other autophagy inducing conditions and revised the text accordingly (Please see responses to editor/s comment point 3). However, we also looked at Joka2-induced autophagy pathway (aggrephagy) in Figure 6.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. PexRD54 is not only diverting autophagy but is also being degraded by it. To better clarify the dynamics of this balance, it would be beneficial to add to the current data a comparison of differences in the rate of autophagosome delivery to the vacuole under carbon starvation-induced autophagy and autophagy induced by PexRD54.</p></disp-quote><p>This is a good point. We will investigate this in a follow up manuscript.</p></body></sub-article></article>
