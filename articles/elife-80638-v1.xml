id="abs1"><title>Background:</title><p>Hepatic sarcopenia is one of many complications associated with chronic liver disease (CLD) and has a high mortality rate; however, the liver-muscle axis is not fully understood. Therefore, few effective treatments exist for hepatic sarcopenia, the best of which being branched-chain amino acid (BCAA) supplementation to help increase muscle mass. Our aim was to investigate the molecular mechanism(s) of hepatic sarcopenia focused on bile acid (BA) composition.</p></sec><sec id="abs2"><title>Methods:</title><p>The correlation between serum BA levels and psoas muscle mass index (PMI) was examined in 73 CLD patients. Gastrocnemius muscle phenotype and serum BA levels were assessed in CLD rats treated with BCAA.

Serum LCA levels were also shown to predict patient survival. Gastrocnemius muscle weight significantly increased in CLD rats treated with BCAA via suppression of protein degradation pathways, coupled with a significant increase in serum LCA levels. LCA treated C2C12 hypertrophy occurred in a concentration-dependent manner linked with TGR5-Akt pathways based upon inhibition results via a TGR5 antagonist.</p></sec><sec id="abs4"><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Our results indicate LCA-mediated skeletal muscle hypertrophy via activation of TGR5-IGF1-Akt signaling pathways.

Sarcopenia is classified into two categories, primary being age-related and secondary encompassing other causes such as chronic diseases. Hepatic sarcopenia differs from aging sarcopenia insofar as it is defined by a rapid decrease in muscle mass and power. Hepatic sarcopenia is one in the panoply of complications associated with chronic liver diseases (CLDs), in particular, liver cirrhosis, with its high mortality (or low survival rate) and poor post-liver transplantation outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Ebadi et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Hara et al., 2016</xref>). A variety of factors are altered in hepatic sarcopenia, including decreased serum branched-chain amino acid (BCAA) levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Tajiri and Shimizu, 2018</xref>), decreased serum vitamin D levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Okubo et al., 2020</xref>), increased bile acids (BAs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Kobayashi et al., 2017</xref>), abnormal insulin growth factor-1 (IGF-1) and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Allen et al., 2021</xref>), increased reactive oxygen species, and increased inflammatory cytokines and myostatin expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Ebadi et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Allen et al., 2021</xref>). BCAA supplementation has been shown to significantly improve skeletal muscle mass index measurements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Ismaiel et al., 2022</xref>). In contrast, anti-myostatin monoclonal neutralizing antibodies developed by several companies failed in clinical trials targeted to treat Duchenne muscular dystrophy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Wagner, 2020</xref>). The molecular mechanisms underpinning the muscle-liver axis involved in hepatic sarcopenia are not fully understood. Therefore, the elucidation of molecular mechanisms and effective treatment designs is required to prevent the progression of hepatic sarcopenia and to improve overall patient prognosis.</p><p>CLD has a major impact on BA composition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Sauerbruch et al., 2021</xref>). BAs are amphipathic steroid molecules synthesized from cholesterol and are categorized as being primary or secondary. Primary BAs are synthesized and conjugated in hepatocytes and secreted into the intestine. Most conjugated BAs undergo deconjugation and dehydration by intestinal bacteria, resulting in the production of secondary BAs. BA pools containing a mix of primary and secondary BAs are essential for solubilizing lipids and fat-soluble vitamins, thus promoting their absorption into the small intestine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arab et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Guzior and Quinn, 2021</xref>). In addition to their canonical function in digestion, BAs are known to act as signaling molecules that regulate metabolic pathways, such as glucose, lipid, and energy homeostasis, through various receptors including G-protein-coupled receptor 5 (TGR5), farnesoid X receptor, and vitamin D receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arab et al., 2017</xref>). TGR5 activation induced by cholic acid (CA), chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA), deoxycholic acid (DCA), and lithocholic acid (LCA) as part of the overall BA composition is a key event regulating skeletal muscle cells with the most potent endogenous ligand for TGR5 being LCA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Pols et al., 2011</xref>). Indeed, LCA, a secondary BA, induced TGR5 activation in skeletal muscle and enhanced muscle mass hypertrophy in mice through an increase in IGF-1, a known muscle hypertrophy-related gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Sasaki et al., 2018</xref>). However, the role of LCA in cirrhotic liver disease-related sarcopenia has not been fully clarified.</p><p>In this study, we investigate the interaction between BAs, including LCA, and skeletal muscle mass, in CLD patients, as well as CLD rats, and explore the molecular mechanism of LCA on skeletal muscle hypertrophy in cultured mouse myotubes, C2C12.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Patients and serum BA measurements in human</title><p>The study protocol (H2019-063) was approved by the Clinical Research Ethics Review Committee of Mie University Hospital. This study was performed retrospectively on stored samples, and subjects were allowed to opt out of their data being used. Written informed consent was obtained from all subjects at the time of blood sampling. A total of 113 treatment-naïve patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) hospitalized in the Department of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Mie University Hospital for treatment of HCC between January 2015 and January 2017 were included as a retrospective study. HCC diagnosis was based on clinical history, serologic testing, and radiologic imaging. 36 patients were excluded due to oral administration of ursodeoxycholic acid. Three patients who had other malignancies within the past 3 years were excluded. One patient was excluded due to kidney transplant. As a result, a total of 73 patients with CLD were analyzed for the current study. Patients positive for HBsAg were diagnosed with HBV infection, whereas those positive for anti-HCV were diagnosed with HCV infection. Alcohol associated liver disease was defined as alcohol consumption &gt;60 g/day. Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) was diagnosed based on pathological findings and/or fatty liver without any other evident causes of CLDs (viral, autoimmune, genetic, etc.). Hepatic functional reserve was categorized by albumin-bilirubin (ALBI) score (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Johnson et al., 2015</xref>). The psoas muscle mass index (PMI) (psoas muscle area at the middle of the third lumbar vertebra [L3] [cm<sup>2</sup>]/height [m<sup>2</sup>]) was manually calculated from CT images. All treatments were performed following the Japanese practical guidelines for HCC as possible (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Kokudo et al., 2019</xref>). Post-HCC treatment follow-up consisted of laboratory tests, including tumor markers, every 3 months and dynamic CT or MRI every 6 months.</p><p>BA concentrations were determined in a blind as described by Ando et al. with minor modifications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Murakami et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ando et al., 2006</xref>). After the addition of internal standards and 0.5 M potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4), BAs were extracted with Bond Elut C18 cartridges and quantified by Liquid Chromatograph-Mass Spectrometry(LC-MS)/MS. Chromatographic separation was performed using a Hypersil GOLD column (150×2.1 mm, 3.0 μm; Thermo Fisher Scientific) at 40°C. The mobile phase consisted of (i) 20 mM ammonium acetate buffer (pH 7.5)-acetonitrile-methanol (70:15:15, v/v/v) and (ii) 20 mM ammonium acetate buffer (pH 7.5)-acetonitrile-methanol (30:35:35, v/v/v). The following gradient program was used at a flow rate of 200 μL/min: 0–100% B for 20 min, hold 100% B for 10 min, and re-equilibrate to 100% A for 8 min.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Animal samples</title><p>Our animal protocol (HKD43046) was reviewed and approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at Hokudo Co., Ltd (Sapporo, Japan).

Briefly, Wister male rats (SPF, CLEA Japan: Tokyo, Japan) aged 7 weeks were fed solid normal diet, CE-2 (CLEA Japan), under conventional conditions and were orally administered carbontetrachloride (CCl<sub>4</sub>) at 1.0 mL/kg twice a week for 4 weeks to induce advanced fibrosis, or cirrhosis, at which point the animals were divided into two groups by weight stratified random sampling. The CLD rats then received daily oral administration of BCAA (10 g/kg/day) (n=10) or 0.9% saline solution (control) (n=10) for 6 weeks. The CLD state was maintained with twice weekly administration of CCl<sub>4</sub> at 0.5 mL/kg for 6 weeks (10 weeks total). The rats were individually maintained at a constant temperature (23±3°C), 50±20% relative humidity, and 12 hr light-dark cycles (lights on at 7 am) and had free access to food and water. Analysis of rat number was 9/10 in BCAA group and 8/10 in control group due to death by CCl<sub>4</sub> in the experimental term.

A portion of gastrocnemius muscle was fixed in 10% formalin for 24 hr and embedded in paraffin, and the remaining gastrocnemius muscle was flash frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at –80°C. The gastrocnemius muscle sections were prepared and stained for hematoxylin and eosin.

BCAA supplementation is approved for use in CLD patients within the clinical setting as a means to provide compensatory albumin, thus maintaining liver function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">European Association for the Study of the Liver. Electronic address: easloffice@easloffice.eu and European Association for the Study of the Liver, 2019</xref>), as well as increased muscle mass associated with an acceleration of the taurocholic acid cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Ismaiel et al., 2022</xref>). In our previous study, we reported that hepatocellular damage was attenuated using BCAA supplementation as a result of improved lipid metabolism and mitochondrial damage repair in CLD rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Tamai et al., 2021</xref>). Using the same CLD rat model in the current study, we revealed that gastrocnemius muscle mass was significantly increased using BCAA treatment. BCAA treatment has direct effects on liver and skeletal muscle; however, we hypothesized that one or more CLD-related molecules/factors might regulate skeletal muscle mass via a liver-muscle axis. Indeed, we found that the serum LCA ratio (LCA/total BAs) was significantly increased in CLD rats, which also showed an increase in gastrocnemius muscle mass. Furthermore, we showed that serum LCA and LCA ratio were significantly and positively associated with PMI in CLD patients. These results from CLD rats and human subjects suggest that LCA can regulate muscle mass via a liver-muscle axis, although further studies are warranted in the future using a greater number of patients as part of a multicenter study.</p><p>The role of LCA in the progression of CLD has not been fully developed due to the lack of general sensitivity in the system used to measure BA composition and is therefore not sufficient to detect low levels of LCA in the blood. Our established highly sensitive system for BA composition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Murakami et al., 2018</xref>) allows us to detect all aspects of BA composition resulting in the discovery of a new role for LCA, which is a positive correlation of serum BA composition with skeletal muscle mass in CLD patients. Furthermore, we revealed that a decrease in serum LCA level portends a worse survival outcome in CLD patients with associated low muscle mass. CLD patients with sarcopenia, defined by low muscle mass and power, also display decreased survival when compared to CLD patients without sarcopenia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Hara et al., 2016</xref>), thus serum LCA may be a useful measure to monitor sarcopenia in CLD patients. Current reports have also demonstrated that LCA is one of the most potent anti-bacterial agents, selective against gram-positive bacteria, resulting in a longer lifespan of centenarians (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Sato et al., 2021</xref>), and is one of the most potent endogenous ligands for TGR5, which protects against alcohol-induced liver steatosis and inflammation in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Iracheta-Vellve et al., 2018</xref>). This evidence clearly shows that LCA plays a critical role in the progression of CLD and intestinal microbiota as a function of the liver-gut axis. Our latest results presented here, associating LCA with skeletal muscle mass, will lead to new insights into the role of LCA as a component of the liver-muscle-gut axis.</p><p>In CLD rats and human subjects, we observed an association between gastrocnemius muscle mass and LCA only, although serum CA, CDCA, and DCA levels also showed a decreasing trend in CLD patients with low muscle mass. This result is reasonable since the hierarchy of BA affinity for TGR5 is as follows: LCA&gt;DCA&gt; CDCA&gt;CA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Sato et al., 2007</xref>). We also demonstrated that a TGR5 antagonist induced skeletal muscle cell hypertrophy through IGF-1 activation, but we need further studies to develop a new antagonist with similar affinity of LCA to the TGR5 binding pocket minus the cytotoxicity aspect.</p><p>In conclusion, we revealed new roles for LCA as a positive regulator of skeletal muscle mass in both CLD rats and human patients and as a mediator of skeletal muscle cell hypertrophy in differentiated C2C12 myoblasts (myotubes). The serum LCA ratio measurement was significantly decreased in CLD patients with low muscle mass. Current results suggest that serum LCA levels may be used as a prognostic factor of survival in CLD patients with sarcopenia, and a TGR5 agonist holds the potential to be a candidate as a therapeutic target in the prevention of sarcopenia in CLD patients.</p></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf2"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Data curation, Writing – original draft</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Conceptualization, Supervision, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Project administration</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Data curation, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Investigation, Methodology, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Data curation, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Data curation, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Formal analysis, Investigation, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con8"><p>Data curation, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con9"><p>Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con10"><p>Investigation, Writing - review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>Human subjects: The study protocol (H2019-063) was approved by the Clinical Research Ethics Review Committee of Mie University Hospital.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Mone Zaidi as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Major comments.</p><p>Reviewer 1 was positively impressed by the subject area and the detailed nature of the analysis but did not offer a detailed expert report.</p><p>Reviewer 2 had the following major comments to make that require addressing, relating to each of the broad issues in the paper:</p><p>(A) Tamai et al. aimed to investigate the association between bile acid concentration (lithocholic acid) in both humans and an in vivo rat model of chronic liver disease induced by CCl4 treatment. They show a decline in bile acid concentrations in CLD rats treated with BCAA, and an increase in concentrations in CLD rats, without BCAA treatment, compared to controls. This decline in LCA concentration was negatively associated with gastrocnemius muscle mass (i.e., muscle mass increased).</p><p>However, lithocholic acid was associated with an increase in gastrocnemius muscle mass in the CLD rats + BCAA group. The authors also highlight a significant, positive correlation between psoas muscle index in CLD patients and lithocholic acid concentrations.</p><p>(B) The authors also highlight a significant, positive correlation between psoas muscle index in CLD patients and lithocholic acid concentrations. Of interest, the authors treated C2C12 skeletal muscle cells, an immortalised rat cell line with lithocholic acid in order to investigate a mechanistic link between the associations observed within in vivo data. The authors suggest that the TGF5-IGF-1-Akt3 pathway may be linked to muscle hypertrophy.</p><p>However, these suggestions are not fully supported by the data within the manuscript and need to be extended further to downstream targets related to mTOR, and ultimately muscle protein synthesis.</p><p>(C) The multi-model approach is a clear strength of this manuscript. Both animal and human work were used to investigate associations in LCA concentration and muscle mass. The authors also use an in vitro model to investigate potential mechanistic links which may explain the associations identified within in vivo models.</p><p>However, the manuscript does have a number of flaws. Firstly, the authors do not set out specific and detailed aims in relation to their in vitro work. Secondly, the rationale for the inclusion of BCAA treatment in rats does not come across in the manuscript.</p><p>(D) Additionally, the flow throughout the manuscript, in particular, the Results section needs improvement.</p><p>Reviewer 3 had the following major comment to make:</p><p>Introduction</p><p>1. Page 4, line 66.</p><p>It has been reported that a decrease in vitamin D concentration is also associated with the cause of sarcopenia associated with liver disease. If possible, please describe this point and describe the reference (Okubo T et al., Hepatology Research 2020. PMID: 31914479).</p><p>Reviewer 2 had the following specific comments to make:</p><p>(A) Structure of the manuscript: There is a significant cause for concern in relation to the structure of the manuscript. Firstly, there are no hypotheses mentioned in the introduction, nor aims that support the inclusion of the in vitro listed. This manuscript should be proofread and undergo major revisions prior to any acceptance. Additionally, the authors make bold statements that are not supported by the data in this manuscript in relation to the in vitro data. They may wish to tone down the wording or remove certain statements to highlight certain associations.</p><p>(B) Detailed queries:</p><p>Comment 1: The title indicates that only rats and humans are used in this work. Do the authors also use an in vitro model? Could the title be altered the reflect the full multi-approach used here?</p><p>Comment 2: Page 4 line 62. Sarcopenia is the loss of muscle mass, strength, and physical function. The difference between 'hepatic' vs. 'aging' sarcopenia is in the definition of primary and secondary sarcopenia, with primary being age-related and secondary encompassing other causes such as chronic disease. Please amend.</p><p>Comment 3: Page 4 line 68. IGF-1 – mTOR pathway?</p><p>Comment 4: Page 4 line 72. Skeletal muscle mass index?</p><p>Comment 5: Page 5 lines 80-85. Please can the authors provide references for this passage of text?</p><p>Comment 6: Page 6: Can the authors please set out their aims to encompass all included work? At present there is no mention of C2C12s in this section, thus it is unclear what the point of their inclusion is without deducing further along.</p><p>Comment 7: Where appropriate, please can the authors provide actual p-values as opposed to p&lt; 0.05, etc. Additionally, the inclusion of effect size would be a valuable inclusion.</p><p>Comment 8: The Results section should be restructured. As a reader, it would make more sense to begin with human data to show the association with muscle mass in patients, prior to in vivo rat models and in vitro models. This is due to the animal work containing an additional arm (BCAA) to investigate the relationship between LCA and an increased muscle mass, in addition to a decline in muscle mass, which is only investigated in humans. Furthermore, this would follow nicely onto the C2C12 mechanistic data.</p><p>Comment 9: Page 18 Line 337. Can the authors please clarify what they are referring to when measuring 'cell strength'? Additionally, please can the authors clarify how width was quantified? If multiple measures were not taken across each myotube, and a significant number of fields of view imaged for analysis results will not be accurate.</p><p>Comment 10: Please can the authors provide a rationale for their inclusion of limited gene and protein analysis. It is unclear why the Akt gene expression was not expressed, nor other key markers at the protein level. The data in this manuscript does not support the conclusions drawn. An increase in MPS cannot be concluded from the investigation of only IGF and Akt. Other downstream proteins are required to reach such a conclusion with more support, most notably mTOR (Page 9 lines 159-161).</p><p>Reviewer 3 had the following specific comments to make:</p><p>Results (Page 11, line 194)</p><p>1. The authors described that 23 of 73 patients died. Were all the causes of death in these patients HCCs?</p><p>2. Regarding the paragraph and Figure 5, what is decreased group? 'Decreased' means muscle volume decreased? I think this point is difficult for readers to understand. Please describe this paragraph and Figure 5 including the legend a little more clearly (e.g. …LCA levels were decreased in the decreased group…).</p><p>3. The authors have shown that BAs are associated with survival, but was this confounded with other factors? So, were BAs an independent and significant factor related to survival?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>My wishing that this paper proceeds to review was based on my positive impression of this paper and the importance of the topic, but I shall defer to the detailed expertise of the reviewers in their reports.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>There is a significant cause for concern in relation to the structure of the manuscript.

Firstly, there are no hypotheses mentioned in the introduction, nor aims which support the inclusion of the in vitro listed. This manuscript should be proofread and undergo major revisions prior to any acceptance. Additionally, the authors make bold statements that are not supported by the data in this manuscript in relation to the in vitro data. They may wish to tone down the wording or remove certain statements to highlight certain associations.</p><p>Comment 1: The title indicates that only rats and humans are used in this work. Do the authors also use an in vitro model? Could the title be altered the reflect the full multi-approach used here?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your comment. We now changed the title “Association of lithocholic acid with skeletal muscle hypertrophy through TGR5-IGF-1 and skeletal muscle mass in cultured mouse myotubes, chronic liver disease rats and humans.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Comment 2: Page 4 line 62. Sarcopenia is the loss of muscle mass, strength, and physical function. The difference between 'hepatic' vs. 'aging' sarcopenia is in the definition of primary and secondary sarcopenia, with primary being age-related and secondary encompassing other causes such as chronic disease. Please amend.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your comments. We now amended the definition of primary and secondary sarcopenia “Sarcopenia is the loss of muscle mass, strength and physical function. Sarcopenia is classified into two categories, primary being age-related and secondary encompassing other causes such as chronic diseases.” (Page 4, line 67-69)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Comment 3: Page 4 line 68. IGF-1 – mTOR pathway?</p></disp-quote><p>We changed to IGF-1-mTOR signaling (Page 4, line 76-Page 5, line 77).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Comment 4: Page 4 line 72. Skeletal muscle mass index?</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate your comment. We now changed to skeletal muscle mass index (Page 5, line 80).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Comment 5: Page 5 lines 80-85. Please can the authors provide references for this passage of text?</p></disp-quote><p>We added references (Arab et al., 2017 and Guzior and Quinn, 2021).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Comment 6: Page 6: Can the authors please set out their aims to encompass all included work? At present there is no mention of C2C12s in this section, thus it is unclear what the point of their inclusion is without deducing further along.</p></disp-quote><p>We agreed with your comment and added the words“ in cultured mouse myotubes, C2C12”.</p><p>“In this study, we investigate the interaction between BAs, including LCA, and skeletal muscle mass, in CLD patients, as well as CLD rats, and explore the molecular mechanism of LCA on skeletal muscle hypertrophy in cultured mouse myotubes, C2C12” (Page 6, line 105-107).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Comment 7: Where appropriate, please can the authors provide actual p-values as opposed to p&lt; 0.05, etc. Additionally, the inclusion of effect size would be a valuable inclusion.</p></disp-quote><p>We provided actual p-values. We also calculated Cohen’s d in CLD patients and added d values in the Result sections (Page 13, line 244 and Page 14, line 255, 263 and 264).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Comment 8: The Results section should be restructured. As a reader, it would make more sense to begin with human data to show the association with muscle mass in patients, prior to in vivo rat models and in vitro models. This is due to the animal work containing an additional arm (BCAA) to investigate the relationship between LCA and an increased muscle mass, in addition to a decline in muscle mass, which is only investigated in humans. Furthermore, this would follow nicely onto the C2C12 mechanistic data.</p></disp-quote><p>We greatly appreciate your suggestion. We agreed and restructured the abstract, result and method sections from human, rats and C2C12 experiments.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Comment 9: Page 18 Line 337. Can the authors please clarify what they are referring to when measuring 'cell strength'? Additionally, please can the authors clarify how width was quantified? If multiple measures were not taken across each myotube, and a significant number of fields of view imaged for analysis results will not be accurate.</p></disp-quote><p>We measured cell strength at 5 days post-LCA addition. We took five images (fields) and measured length and width in each myotubes (total 96 myotubes in control, 109 myotubes in 70 nM LCA and 61 myotubes in 700 nM LCA) as shown in Figure 4-source data.</p><p>We now added detail information in the Method sections. “Changes in cell strength and width were quantified at 5 d post-LCA addition from five fields (total 96 myotubes in control, 109 myotubes in 70 nM LCA and 61 myotubes in 700 nM LCA) using NIH ImageJ software.” (Page 10, line 184-186)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Comment 10: Please can the authors provide a rationale for their inclusion of limited gene and protein analysis. It is unclear why Akt gene expression was not expressed, nor other key markers at the protein level. The data in this manuscript does not support the conclusions drawn. An increase in MPS cannot be concluded from the investigation of only IGF and Akt. Other downstream proteins are required to reach such a conclusion with more support, most notably mTOR (Page 9 lines 159-161).</p></disp-quote><p>We performed new experiment to address mTOR activation by western blotting and found that the ratio of mTOR phosphorylation against to total mTOR was increased in C2C12 myotubes treated with INT-777 as a TGR5 agonist (Figure 5D). This result suggest that the downstream protein is also activated through TGR5-IGF-1-Akt pathway.</p><p>We now added this result and changed words for tone down the conclusion in the Results section “As one of downstream proteins, the ratio of mTOR phosphorylation against to total mTOR was also increased in C2C12 myotubes treated with INT-777, although it was not significant (Figure 5D). These results suggest that the TGR5-IGF-1-Akt pathway have an important role in muscle hypertrophy.
