RNA-binding proteins contribute to specificity by interacting with both Ccr4-Not and target mRNAs, but this is not fully understood. Here, we reconstitute accelerated and selective deadenylation of RNAs containing AU-rich elements (AREs) and Pumilio-response elements (PREs). We find that the fission yeast homologues of Tristetraprolin/TTP and Pumilio/Puf (Zfs1 and Puf3) interact with Ccr4-Not via multiple regions within low-complexity sequences, suggestive of a multipartite interface that extends beyond previously defined interactions. Using a two-color assay to simultaneously monitor poly(A) tail removal from different RNAs, we demonstrate that Puf3 can distinguish between RNAs of very similar sequence. Analysis of binding kinetics reveals that this is primarily due to differences in dissociation rate constants. Consequently, motif quality is a major determinant of mRNA stability for Puf3 targets in vivo and can be used for the prediction of mRNA targets.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.40670.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>When a cell needs to make a particular protein, it first copies the instructions from the matching gene into a molecule known as a messenger RNA (or an mRNA for short). The more mRNA copies it makes, the more protein it can produce. A simple way to control protein production is to raise or lower the number of these mRNA messages, and living cells have lots of ways to make this happen. One method involves codes built into the mRNAs themselves. The mRNAs can carry short sequences of genetic letters that can trigger their own destruction. Known as “destabilising motifs”, these sequences attract the attention of a group of proteins called Ccr4-Not. Together these proteins shorten the end of the mRNAs, preparing the molecules for degradation. But how does Ccr4-Not choose which mRNAs to target?</p><p>Different mRNAs carry different destabilising motifs. This means that when groups of mRNAs all carry the same motif, the cell can destroy them all together. This allows the cell to switch networks of related genes off together without affecting the mRNAs it still needs. What is puzzling is that the destabilising motifs that control different groups of mRNAs can be very similar, and scientists do not yet know how Ccr4-Not can tell the difference, or what triggers it to start breaking down groups of mRNAs. To find out, Webster et al. recreated the system in the laboratory using purified molecules.</p><p>The test-tube system confirmed previous suggestions that a protein called Puf3 forms a bridge between Ccr4-Not and mRNAs. It acts as a tether, recognising a destabilising motif and linking it to Ccr4-Not. Labelling different mRNAs with two colours of fluorescent dye showed how Puf3 helps the cell to choose which to destroy. Puf3 allows Ccr4-Not to select specific mRNAs from a mixture of molecules. Puf3 could distinguish between mRNAs that differed in a single letter of genetic code. When it matched with the wrong mRNA, it disconnected much faster than when it matched with the right one, preventing Ccr4-Not from linking up.</p><p>The ability to destroy specific mRNA messages is critical for cell survival. It happens when cells divide, during immune responses such as inflammation, and in early development. Understanding the targets of tethers like Puf3 could help scientists to predict which genes will switch off and when. This could reveal genes that work together, helping to unravel their roles inside cells.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>gene expression</kwd><kwd>poly(A) tail</kwd><kwd>deadenylation</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic></kwd><kwd><italic>S. pombe</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000265</institution-id><institution>Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MC_U105192715</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Passmore</surname><given-names>Lori A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010661</institution-id><institution>Horizon 2020 Framework Programme</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>725685</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Passmore</surname><given-names>Lori A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004963</institution-id><institution>Seventh Framework Programme</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>261151</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Passmore</surname><given-names>Lori A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Biochemical reconstitution of deadenylation and analysis of binding kinetics reveals how RNA-binding proteins select their mRNA targets.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Shortening or removal of mRNA poly(A) tails (deadenylation) represses gene expression in eukaryotes. The Ccr4-Not complex is a conserved deadenylase that can initiate cytoplasmic mRNA decay and reduce translation by releasing poly(A)-binding protein (Pab1/PABPC1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Parker, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Tucker et al., 2001</xref>). Ccr4-Not contains seven core subunits, including two poly(A)-specific exonucleases, Ccr4/CNOT6/CNOT6L and Caf1/Pop2/CNOT7/CNOT8 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Wahle and Winkler, 2013</xref>). It can be specifically recruited to mRNAs by RNA-binding proteins and the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC). Ccr4-Not recruitment can also be modulated by codon optimality and covalent modifications of the RNA sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Du et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Eulalio et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Wahle and Winkler, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Webster et al., 2018</xref>). Diverse biological processes depend on deadenylation, including embryogenesis, germline maintenance, cell proliferation, and attenuation of the immune response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Carballo et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Leppek et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Subtelny et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Yamaji et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>RNA-binding proteins such as Pumilio/Puf and Tristetraprolin/TTP can recognize sequence motifs in mRNAs, and also bind Ccr4-Not to target those RNAs for deadenylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Wahle and Winkler, 2013</xref>). The set of transcripts targeted for repression and decay by a given RNA-binding protein is therefore defined by the distribution of its binding motifs across the transcriptome, and often includes groups of mRNAs that encode functionally related proteins. This generates RNA regulatory networks, structured such that a single protein can regulate the expression of numerous genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Joshi et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Keene, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lapointe et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Wilinski et al., 2015</xref>). Targets of RNA-binding proteins often include factors that regulate gene expression themselves, thereby forming gene expression cascades (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Barckmann and Simonelig, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lapointe et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Shyu et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Wells et al., 2012</xref>). Identification of the mRNAs within these networks allows a better understanding of gene expression and the roles of RNA-binding proteins that regulate them.</p><p>Recently, three sequence elements that strongly promote mRNA destabilization were identified in an unbiased screen in zebrafish embryogenesis: the Pumilio-response element (PRE), the AU-rich element (ARE) and the miR-430 seed sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Rabani et al., 2017</xref>). PRE- and ARE-mediated mRNA destabilization is conserved from yeast to human but the set of mRNAs that contain these motifs are different across species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brooks and Blackshear, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Wells et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Wickens et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Wilinski et al., 2017</xref>). Consequently, the biological processes regulated by orthologous RNA-binding proteins are diverse across organisms.</p><p>The PRE sequence motif is recognized by a conserved RNA-binding domain found within the Pumilio protein family. A direct interaction between the Pumilio RNA-binding domain and the CNOT7/Caf1 exonuclease has been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Van Etten et al., 2012</xref>), but it is unknown if this is the only site of interaction on Ccr4-Not. The PRE that interacts with human PUM1 and PUM2 (UGUANAUA) is found in mRNAs encoding proteins involved in signaling pathways and neuronal processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bohn et al., 2018</xref>). In <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> (<italic>Sc</italic>), there are six Pumilio proteins. Of these, <italic>Sc</italic>Puf3 is most closely related to homologs in higher eukaryotes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Wickens et al., 2002</xref>). The RNA motif recognized by <italic>Sc</italic>Puf3 resembles that of the human PUM proteins but, additionally, cytosine is preferred in the −1 and −2 positions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gerber et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kershaw et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lapointe et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Wickens et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Zhu et al., 2009</xref>). The closest homolog to human PUM in <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic> (Puf3) also contains residues that define this additional selectivity pocket, and is therefore predicted to bind sequences containing an upstream cytosine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Qiu et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> Puf3 is a key regulator of mitochondrial function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lee and Tu, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Saint-Georges et al., 2008</xref>). Consistent with this, its mRNA targets encode proteins localized to the mitochondria and involved in the oxidative phosphorylation pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gerber et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kershaw et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lapointe et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lapointe et al., 2018</xref>). Many transcripts proposed to be regulated by <italic>Sc</italic>Puf3 do not, however, show a clear link to this role (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kershaw et al., 2015</xref>). It is therefore unclear whether the function of <italic>Sc</italic>Puf3 is limited to mitochondrial regulation. Puf3 homologs in other organisms (including <italic>S. pombe</italic>) do not necessarily regulate mitochondrial function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hogan et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>The nine-nucleotide ARE motif (UUAUUUAUU) was identified in unstable mRNAs encoding cytokines and lymphokines in human cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Caput et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chen and Shyu, 1995</xref>). This sequence is recognized by tandem zinc finger (TZF) proteins including tristetraprolin (TTP). TTP attenuates immunological responses by binding directly to Ccr4-Not via the CNOT1 and CNOT9 subunits, targeting ARE-containing transcripts for degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brooks and Blackshear, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bulbrook et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fabian et al., 2013</xref>). Phosphorylation of TTP occurs as part of the p38 MAPK pathway, and this disrupts Ccr4-Not recruitment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Marchese et al., 2010</xref>). The <italic>S. pombe</italic> Zfs1 protein is homologous to TTP, and recognizes the same RNA motif (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cuthbertson et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Wells et al., 2015</xref>). An interaction between Zfs1 and Ccr4-Not has not been characterized in fission yeast and the Ccr4-Not-interacting amino acid sequences of TTP are not clearly conserved in Zfs1.</p><p>Understanding the molecular basis of accelerated deadenylation has been limited by the lack of a biochemical system containing purified components that reconstitutes this process. Previous studies have shown that a purified domain of the budding yeast Pumilio protein Mpt5 stimulates the activity of immunoprecipitated Ccr4-Not (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Goldstrohm et al., 2006</xref>), and that isolated Caf1 is stimulated by addition of purified BTG2 and PABPC1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Stupfler et al., 2016</xref>). We recently purified the complete seven-subunit <italic>S. pombe</italic> Ccr4-Not complex after overexpression of the subunits in insect cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Stowell et al., 2016</xref>). Biochemical assays revealed that this recombinant complex was substantially more active than the isolated nuclease enzymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Stowell et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Webster et al., 2018</xref>). Co-expression of the conserved subunits of Ccr4-Not with Mmi1, an RNA-binding protein found in fission yeast, generated a complex that deadenylated Mmi1-target RNAs more rapidly than non-target RNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Stowell et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Here, we reconstitute accelerated and selective deadenylation of PRE- and ARE-containing RNAs using recombinant <italic>S. pombe</italic> proteins. We find that Puf3 and Zfs1 act as molecular tethers capable of inducing accelerated and RNA-selective deadenylation by Ccr4-Not in vitro. Biochemical and biophysical analyses of Puf3 binding to RNA reveal a high degree of sequence selectivity. Correspondingly, in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> RNA motif quality is a critical determinant of the RNAs stably bound by Puf3 in vivo. Collectively, our findings show that a substantially improved understanding of RNA-binding protein regulatory networks can be obtained through detailed analysis of motif quality.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Deadenylation is stimulated by Puf3 and Zfs1 in vitro</title><p>To characterize substrate-selective deadenylation in the presence of RNA-binding proteins, we reconstituted this process using purified proteins.

To investigate whether Puf3 and Zfs1 stimulate the deadenylation activity of Ccr4-Not in vitro, we designed model RNA substrates containing the sequence motif recognized by either Puf3 or Zfs1 (PRE UGUAAAUA, or ARE UUAUUUAUU respectively, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). These motifs were embedded within a synthetic 23-nucleotide sequence, upstream of a 30-adenosine poly(A) tail. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays confirmed that Puf3 and Zfs1 bind stably to their respective target RNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). The 1:1 stoichiometric protein-RNA complexes formed under these conditions were used as substrates in assays measuring the deadenylation activity of Ccr4-Not.</p><p>Ccr4-Not removed the poly(A) tails of both Puf3 and Zfs1 substrate RNAs in vitro. Puf3 and Zfs1 each stimulated deadenylation of their target RNAs: In the absence of Puf3, complete removal of the poly(A) tail from PRE-containing RNA occurred in approximately 32 min, whereas in the presence of Puf3 the reaction was complete in less than 2 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D–E</xref>).

The exonucleases stop when they reach nucleotides that correspond to the binding site of the protein, suggesting that either the RNA-binding proteins cannot be released by Ccr4-Not, or that deadenylation becomes very slow after release of the RNA binding protein. This is consistent with a model in which the specificity of Ccr4-Not for adenosine is substantially less evident when it is tethered to the RNA substrate for a prolonged period of time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Finoux and Séraphin, 2006</xref>). In addition, the deadenylation reaction appeared to be more processive in the presence of Puf3 or Zfs1 because RNA lacking a poly(A) tail was visible when RNA with an intact tail was still present in the reaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1F</xref>).

It is generally believed that additional protein factors confer mRNA-selectivity to Ccr4-Not, but this finding indicates Ccr4-Not may possess a moderate degree of intrinsic mRNA selectivity. We previously observed that Ccr4-Not was less active on RNA substrates with secondary structure in the upstream 3ʹ-UTR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Stowell et al., 2016</xref>). The free energies of the predicted most stable structures calculated with RNAfold software are −1.2 kcal/mol (Puf3-target RNA) and −0.2 kcal/mol (Zfs1-target RNA). Thus, neither of the substrates tested here is predicted to form stable RNA secondary structure. Our data suggest that the rate at which different mRNAs are deadenylated in vivo may be modulated by sequence-selectivity intrinsic to the Ccr4-Not complex.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Puf3 and Zfs1 recruit Ccr4-Not via extended low-complexity sequences</title><p>As mentioned above, specific interactions between Ccr4-Not and Pumilio/TTP proteins had been previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fabian et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Goldstrohm et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Van Etten et al., 2012</xref>).

For both proteins, no single truncation accounted for the stimulatory effect on deadenylation. Instead, as the length of low-complexity sequence was reduced, the stimulatory effect on the deadenylation rate was also reduced. It is therefore likely that multiple sequence elements, distributed throughout the low-complexity regions, interact with Ccr4-Not.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Non-enzymatic subunits of Ccr4-Not contribute to the interaction with Puf3 and Zfs1</title><p>Two of the seven core subunits of Ccr4-Not are poly(A)-selective exonucleases, Caf1 and Ccr4.

Fully-deadenylated and non-deadenylated RNA was observed simultaneously during both reactions, suggestive of a processive reaction.

This suggests that Puf3 interacts with Caf1-Ccr4, but association occurs more slowly when these subunits are not incorporated into the intact Ccr4-Not complex.</p><p>Zfs1 did not substantially affect the deadenylation activity of the Caf1-Ccr4 dimeric complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, right).

It is not known, however, how Pab1 influences accelerated deadenylation.

Therefore, Puf3 can promote release of Pab1 by accelerating deadenylation by Ccr4-Not. Still, Pab1 slows the overall rate of Puf3-accelerated deadenylation, suggesting that the rate of Pab1 release limits the very fast rate of deadenylation that occurs when Ccr4-Not is recruited by Puf3.</p><p>We previously reported that Caf1 and Ccr4 have similar activities within the purified Ccr4-Not complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Stowell et al., 2016</xref>).

It is not known, however, whether Caf1 and Ccr4 are differentially active when RNA-binding proteins recruit Ccr4-Not to specific mRNAs.

In the presence of Puf3 and Pab1, Ccr4-inactive Ccr4-Not did not proceed beyond ~20 adenosines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2C</xref>). This is similar to when Puf3 was not present (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Webster et al., 2018</xref>).

We began by examining whether the presence of the target motif recognized by each protein was essential for accelerated deadenylation. The effect of Puf3 and Zfs1 on its own target RNA was compared with its effect on a non-target RNA. For the latter, we used the RNA target of the other protein (Puf3 with Zfs1-target RNA, and Zfs1 with Puf3-target RNA). We were surprised to find that each protein stimulated deadenylation of an RNA that did not contain its target motif (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>).

However, mutant Zfs1 that does not bind RNA doesn’t accelerate deadenylation. Thus, allosteric activation is not likely to be a general mechanism. Instead, we hypothesized that off-target stimulation of deadenylation in our in vitro experiments is due to off-target RNA binding.</p><p>To determine the binding affinities of full-length Puf3 and Zfs1 for the RNA substrates, we performed fluorescence polarization RNA binding assays with RNAs containing the target motif of Puf3 or Zfs1, as well as 30-mer polyadenosine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Each RNA-binding protein bound to its respective target RNA sequence with high affinity (<italic>K</italic><sub>D</sub> = 1–2 nM). In contrast, Puf3 bound to the off-target ARE sequence with <italic>K</italic><sub>D</sub> of 120 nM, while Zfs1 bound the off-target PRE sequence with <italic>K</italic><sub>D</sub> of 850 nM. In both cases, poly(A) was bound with ~100 fold lower affinity than the target RNA. Hence, both Puf3 and Zfs1 are selective in RNA binding, with &gt;100 fold higher affinity for their target RNA than off-target RNAs. Still, Puf3 and Zfs1 bind off-target sequences with nanomolar affinities and this could account for their abilities to stimulate deadenylation of off-target RNAs.</p><p>We hypothesized that Puf3 and Zfs1 would select their targets from a mixture of target and non-target RNAs to promote targeted deadenylation. To test this, we developed a system to directly examine selective deadenylation by Ccr4-Not. Two polyadenylated RNA substrates labelled with different fluorophores were combined in stoichiometric quantities before the addition of Ccr4-Not and analysis of deadenylation activity. The same gel could therefore be used to monitor deadenylation of both the fluorescein-labelled Puf3-target substrate, and the Alexa647-labelled Zfs1-target substrate, displayed in blue and red respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). In this two-color assay, the Zfs1-target RNA was deadenylated by Ccr4-Not 3-fold faster than the Puf3-target RNA in the absence of additional protein. This is consistent with intrinsic selectivity of Ccr4-Not that was observed when each RNA was examined in isolation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>).</p><p>We then performed a series of reactions using three different concentrations of Puf3 or Zfs1, and each RNA at 100 nM. With 50 nM Puf3 or Zfs1, deadenylation was accelerated only on the target RNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>, top; blue for Puf3-target and red for Zfs1-target). A fraction of the target RNA was unaffected, consistent with incomplete occupancy of the RNA-binding protein on its target. With 250 nM Puf3 or Zfs1, deadenylation of all target RNA was substantially increased while deadenylation of the non-target RNA was unchanged (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>, middle). Thus, Puf3 and Zfs1 promote selective, accelerated deadenylation.

These represent possible false-positives and false-negative predicted targets respectively. mRNAs with motif 1, 2 or 3 that were not related to mitochondrial biogenesis had significantly less <italic>Sc</italic>Puf3 association than those that were related to mitochondria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1B</xref>).

We show that multiple regions within fission yeast Puf3 and Zfs1 contribute to Ccr4-Not recruitment, and these are distributed throughout the 300–400 amino acid region that is predicted to be predominantly disordered. Thus, the multi-partite mode of interaction for Puf3 and Zfs1 may be a general feature of RNA-binding proteins that interact with Ccr4-Not. The in vitro deadenylation assays described here represent a powerful tool for testing the importance of particular sequence regions in interaction partners and evaluating their redundancy.</p><p>The Pumilio family of RNA-binding proteins appeared to represent an exception to the pattern that Ccr4-Not recruitment occurs exclusively via short linear motifs within intrinsically disordered regions. The RNA-binding Pumilio domain of human PUM1 and <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> Puf4 and Puf5 interacts directly with Caf1/CNOT8 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Goldstrohm et al., 2006</xref>). Consistent with this, in our study the <italic>S. pombe</italic> Puf3 PUM domain stimulated the rate of deadenylation by Ccr4-Not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref>), and full-length Puf3 stimulated deadenylation by a Caf1-Ccr4 subcomplex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Importantly, however, both of these effects were weak relative to the stimulation of intact Ccr4-Not by full-length Puf3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Thus, the low-complexity region of <italic>S. pombe</italic> Puf3 and the non-enzymatic subunits of Ccr4-Not play important roles in the interaction.

We found that Puf3 and Zfs1 stimulate deadenylation of off-target RNAs, but they can discriminate between mixtures of RNA substrates to select their target. Titration of Puf3 under conditions where two similar RNA sequences were present showed that binding of RNA occurs by a model of priority: Puf3 binds to an optimal target when it is available, but after saturation of all available sites, it will readily associate with a sub-optimal target (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). This model of RNA target selection, where an RNA-binding protein has a distribution of affinities for different RNA sequences, challenges the model where there is a sharp distinction between affinities for specific and non-specific RNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Jankowsky and Harris, 2015</xref>). The relative abundance of RNA-binding proteins and RNA therefore determines occupancy, and is integral to the definition of the target motif.</p><p>We propose that tight control of RNA-binding protein abundance in the cell is essential for maintenance of a stable set of target mRNAs. Interestingly, the mRNA encoding Puf3 in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> is itself a target of Puf3 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). This predicts a potential feedback mechanism by which <italic>Sc</italic>Puf3 protein abundance is auto-regulated. Furthermore, the <italic>Sc</italic>Puf3-recognition motif within the <italic>Sc</italic>Puf3 mRNA is within group 4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>) and this is at the boundary that separates targets from non-targets.

This haploinsufficiency produces severely impaired neuronal function that is due, at least in part, to impaired destabilization of the <italic>ATAXIN1</italic> mRNA. Thus, consistent with our model of RNA binding, the dosage of RNA-binding proteins is also important to maintain on-target mRNA expression.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Identification of mRNA targets of RNA-binding proteins</title><p>Even when the consensus motif recognized by an RNA-binding protein is known, it is often difficult to predict which transcripts are targeted by that protein in vivo: A high affinity interaction is not sufficient for the sequence to be a preferred target, as is exemplified by the tight binding of fission yeast Puf3 to the RNA motif recognized by <italic>Sc</italic>Puf5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Our kinetic analysis of Puf3 binding to RNA revealed a fast rate of association with RNA that does not contain the optimal sequence motif.

An important consequence of this is that RNA-immunoprecipitation (and especially use of covalent crosslinking) will detect mRNAs that are not genuine targets. An indication of in vivo dissociation rates of <italic>Sc</italic>Puf3 were previously obtained using RNA tagging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lapointe et al., 2015</xref>). In this method, an enzyme that adds uridines to the 3′ end of RNA is attached to the RNA-binding protein of interest. The length of the U-tail on an mRNA correlated with whether the mRNAs are regulated by <italic>Sc</italic>Puf3 in the cell and is also expected to correlate with the duration the RNA-binding protein is associated with it (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lapointe et al., 2015</xref>). This study differentiated between Puf3 ‘sampling’ of RNAs where the U-tails were short and the off-rate was too fast to allow regulation (deadenylation), and Puf3 ‘regulation’ where the U-tails were longer, the off-rate was slower, and the interaction leads to a productive output (deadenylation). In addition to cellular concentration of RNA binding proteins and their targets, competition among RNA binding proteins with similar sequence preferences will also influence this kinetic model for productive interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lapointe et al., 2017</xref>). Taken together, there is a striking convergence between the results of in vitro (this study) and in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lapointe et al., 2015</xref>) studies. Our analysis also correlates well with a more recent study that combined multiple methods to identify 91 Puf3 targets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lapointe et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>A major limitation in all experimental approaches is that the threshold separating genuine from non-genuine targets is difficult to define.

If, as our data suggests, the function of <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> Puf3 is limited to mitochondrial biogenesis,~88% of mRNAs with a high-quality motif are genuine targets. The workflow we have used should therefore be informative in defining the regulatory network of other RNA-binding proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>).</p><p>How specific mRNAs can be rapidly and specifically targeted for degradation in response to cellular signals remains a major question in understanding eukaryotic gene expression.

Transformed cells were grown at 37°C to an A<sub>600 nm</sub> of 0.6 before the temperature was reduced to 18°C and protein expression induced by the addition of IPTG to 0.5 mM. Growth was continued for 18 hr before cells were harvested by centrifugation and flash frozen for storage at −80°C. Cells were defrosted and lysed by sonication in lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8, 250 mM KCl, 1 mM TCEP) supplemented with protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche) and DNase I (5 μg/ml) (Sigma). The lysate was cleared by centrifugation at 40,000 × g for 30 min at 4°C. Supernatant was applied to amylose affinity resin (1 ml bed volume per 2 l culture; New England Biolabs), and incubated with rotation for 1 hr at 4°C. Resin was separated from lysate with an Econo-Column (Bio-Rad) and washed three times with 50 ml of RBP buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl pH 8, 50 mM NaCl, 0.1 mM TCEP). Protein was eluted from the resin with RBP buffer supplemented with 50 mM maltose. Sample was loaded onto a HiTrap Q HP 5 ml column (GE Healthcare), and the protein was eluted with a gradient of 20 column volumes into RBP buffer containing 1 M NaCl. Protein in the elution peak was concentrated to 0.5 ml with an Amicon Ultra concentrator (4 ml, 50 kDa MWCO, Millipore) by centrifugation at 3000 × g at 4°C. Sample was then applied to a Superdex 200 10/300 GL size-exclusion column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated in RBP buffer. The column was run at 0.5 ml/min at 4°C. Full-length protein eluted at 10–13 ml, typically together with smaller protein species identified by tandem mass spectrometry to be truncated protein lacking C-terminal residues. The sample was applied to a HiTrap Heparin HP 5 ml column (GE Healthcare), and the protein was eluted with a gradient of 20 column volumes into RBP buffer containing 1 M NaCl. Full-length protein eluted at ~250 mM NaCl, while shorter fragments eluted at 100–200 mM NaCl.

Clarified lysate was applied to glutathione sepharose 4B affinity resin (1 ml bed volume per 2 l culture; New England Biolabs), and incubated with rotation for 1 hr at 4°C. Resin was separated from lysate with an Econo-Column (Bio-Rad) and washed three times with 50 ml of RBP buffer. Protein was eluted from the resin in 20 ml of glutathione elution buffer (20 mM HEPES pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 0.1 mM TCEP, 50 mM glutathione). The GST tag was cleaved by incubation with 1 mg of 3C protease for 16 hr at 4°C. Cleaved protein was buffer-exchanged into 20 mM Bis-Tris pH 6.5, 50 mM NaCl, 0.1 mM TCEP with a HiPrep 26/10 desalting column (GE Healthcare). The sample was applied to a Mono S 5/50 GL cation-exchange column (GE Healthcare) and eluted over 20 column volumes into buffer supplemented to 1 M NaCl. Pure protein eluted at ~200 mM NaCl, and samples were pooled and stored at −80°C.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Deadenylation assays</title><p>Deadenylation activity was measured as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Webster et al., 2017</xref>).

Proportional Venn diagram of gene overlap was generated with Biovenn (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hulsen et al., 2008</xref>) and redrawn for publication. 3ʹ-UTR sequences were defined using poly(A) sites previously identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Ozsolak et al., 2010</xref>). The most statistically enriched RNA motif from the combined set of 1331 mRNAs was identified with MEME (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bailey et al., 2015</xref>). Analysis of sequence context around the target motifs (10 nucleotides in each direction) was performed with WebLogo 3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Crooks et al., 2004</xref>).</p><p>Motifs were identified in mRNA sequences with <italic>Geneious</italic> v 7.0.6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kearse et al., 2012</xref>) with the following general expressions: motif 1 (CNUGUAAAUA), motif 2 (CNUGUANAUA), motif 3 (UGUAAAUA) and motif 4 (UGUAAAUA). Sequences within motif category 1 are by definition within 2, 3 and 4. Once it was evident that mRNAs with motif 1 were significantly enriched in <italic>Sc</italic>Puf3 relative to the remainder of mRNAs in categories 2, 3 and 4, they were assigned to a distinct category. No significant differences in <italic>Sc</italic>Puf3 enrichment were detected between mRNAs with other permutations not presented (−2: A, U or G; −1 any nucleotide;+5 C, G or U). For this reason, these sequences were treated as equivalent and the mRNAs containing them analyzed as a group. We do not exclude the possibility that differences in <italic>Sc</italic>Puf3 binding exist because statistically evaluation is limited to the number of endogenous genes containing each permutation. Motifs were assigned to the category 3ʹ-UTR if at least part of the motif contained nucleotides 3ʹ of the coding sequence (including the stop codon). Statistical significance was evaluated with a Mann-Whitney rank comparison test in GraphPad Prism.</p><p>Gene ontology (GO) analysis was performed with PANTHER over-representation test using the dataset released on 2018-02-02 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Mi et al., 2017</xref>).

A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;The mechanism of Ccr4-Not recruitment to specific mRNAs involves sequence-selective tethering by RNA-binding proteins&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, including Rachel Green as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Kevin Struhl as the Senior Editor.</p><p>We have received reviewer comments and have discussed the manuscript together in coming to a decision. Overall, all three reviewers felt the manuscript detailing how RNA binding protein promote Ccr4-Not mediated deadenylation using a really beautiful in vitro reconstituted system was extremely well executed and brings to light important features of this biological interaction. Importantly, the dependence of the rates of deadenylation on the dissociation rates of the complexes is interesting, and nicely complements previously published in vivo work on this topic (Lapointe et al., 2017). The analysis of already published <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> CLIP data is seen to be strength, but the discussion needs some re-working to make connections between the in vitro and in vivo work clearer, and to acknowledge previous in vivo studies in the field that came to related conclusions.</p><p>We recommend that the manuscript be revised, taking into account the reviewers’ suggestions, and that it will then be appropriate for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>In this manuscript by Webster et al., the authors describe experiments that define how Ccr4-Not-promoted deadenylation is promoted by RNA binding proteins that recognize specific motifs on the targeted mRNAs. The experiments are entirely performed in vitro with purified proteins and clean kinetically-refined deadenylation assays. The studies show that the fission yeast protein Zfs1 and Puf3 increase the rates of deadenylation on mRNAs that contain a motif that they are known to recognize, and that this recruitment is primarily mediated by the very long disordered regions of these RNA binding proteins (in some opposition to earlier work from Goldstrohm's group). The specificity of the RNA binding protein is shown to be critical, but when concentrations become high, less optimal mRNA targets readily become targets (since binding affinities for optimal and non-optimal sequences only differ by about 100-fold). In the final section of the manuscript, the authors perform a detailed analysis of three different data sets in the literature defining the targets of these mRNA binding proteins in genome-wide experiments. Here the authors are able to better define that specificities of these proteins, and for Puf3, to rationalize how this protein is principally involved in regulating the stability of mRNAs associated with mitochondrial function. This final analysis lends some in vivo depth to the manuscript that raised its significance substantially. In general, the manuscript was very clearly written and the experiments nicely supported the stated conclusions. I recommend the paper for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>This manuscript presents biochemical evidence that the <italic>S. pombe</italic> Pumilio and Tristetraprolin homologs recruit the Ccr4-Not complex to deadenylate mRNAs.</p><p>While the biochemical data presented in this manuscript are of high quality, evidences that Pumilio and Tristetraprolin recruit the Ccr4-Not complex to deadenylate mRNAs in other species have been widely documented. In this context, the data described in this manuscript appear mostly confirmatory, even if they are based on a different, more direct, analysis. The conceptual advance brought by this manuscript is thus limited.</p><p>While the manuscript does bring new details, e.g. on the context effect on RNA binding, those are not unexpected and will be of interest only to specialists. Moreover, in some case, specific conclusions remain preliminary (e.g. the region of <italic>S. pombe</italic> Tristetraprolin interacting with the Ccr4-Not complex is not as well defined as the one described 5 years ago for its human homolog for which structural data were presented). Furthermore, a significant fraction of the manuscript focuses on analysis of published data emanating from <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> that are rather descriptive, not validated, and poorly connected to the experimental data presented in the rest of the manuscript.</p><p>Altogether, <italic>eLife</italic> cannot publish all manuscripts that it receives for review and, as a broad journal, should focus on articles of wide interest. In this specific case, given the background knowledge available in the current literature, it is difficult to argue why it should be published in <italic>eLife</italic>. Indeed, these data will be of interest mostly to a group of specialists. I recommend publication in a journal targeting a more restricted audience.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>Webster et al. is an important contribution to understanding mechanisms of mRNA control. The use of purified, reconstituted Ccr4-Not and two different RNA-binding proteins, and the care taken in experimental design, as in the dual reporter assays (Figures 3 and 4), make the data and conclusions compelling.</p><p>1) A central conclusion is that dissociation rates are a key contributor to rates of deadenylation. This important conclusion complements in vivo &quot;tagging&quot; experiments on Puf3<sup>PUM</sup> (Lapointe et al., 2017). In those studies, the number of uridines added in tagging very likely is related to PUF-RNA dissociation rates in vivo, which correlates well with whether the mRNAs are in fact regulated by Puf3 in the cell. It is in the authors’ interest to make the point that in vivo studies of tagging led to the suggestion of &quot;sampling&quot; vs. &quot;biological regulation&quot; as a function of off-rates; the convergence of the in vitro and in vivo data is striking.</p><p>2) The experiments use <italic>S. pombe</italic> Puf3<sup>PUM</sup> and <italic>S. pombe</italic> Ccr4-Not. This raises a potential confusion for the reader, in that the computational analyses done later in the paper focus on mRNAs that are bound and controlled in vivo in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> by the <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> protein. Unfortunately, this makes some of the discussion of Figure 6 a bit confusing, and needs clarification in the text. It is not that mRNAs that bind <italic>S. pombe</italic> Puf3 in <italic>S. pombe</italic> necessarily are mitochondrial in function, a point that is relevant to computational studies of site divergence during evolution (Jiang et al., 2012, Mol. Biol. Evol.; Hogan et al., 2015; Wilinski et al., 2017).</p><p>The data and analyses of Figure 6 certainly are informative, and the issue should be dealt with by clarifications in the Results and Discussion sections.</p><p>3) I may have missed this, but how do the authors quantify deadenylation &quot;rate&quot; (Figure 1—figure supplement 1, Figure 2B)? Does &quot;rate&quot; refer to moles of adenosine monophosphate released per unit time, or the amount of fully deadenylated product per unit time, or something else?</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;The mechanism of Ccr4-Not recruitment to specific mRNAs involves sequence-selective tethering by RNA-binding proteins&quot; for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been favorably evaluated by Kevin Struhl (Senior Editor), a Reviewing Editor, and two reviewers.</p><p>Overall, the reviewers felt that most comments had been adequately addressed. However, one reviewer feels that the title and Abstract of the manuscript must be altered to acknowledge what precisely is novel in the study which is the biochemical discrimination between target and non-target mRNAs. Once this issue has been addressed the manuscript should be ready for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>Passmore and colleagues have revised their manuscript, considering most referees' comments. Minor points have been clarified. In line with editorial recommendation, authors argue that their &quot;major conceptual advance is not that Pumilio and Tristetraprolin proteins promote deadenylation, but an improved understanding of two aspects of this process – (1) how RNA-binding proteins distinguish between target and non-target mRNAs, and (2) how RNA-binding proteins recruit Ccr4-Not to achieve rapid deadenylation&quot;.</p><p>As discussed earlier, our new understanding of interaction of RNA binding proteins with the Ccr4-Not is limited in the context of data already available in the literature (see below).

While the text has been improved to clarify this issue, the manuscript title &quot;The mechanism of Ccr4-Not recruitment to specific mRNAs involves sequence-selective tethering by RNA-binding proteins&quot; and Abstract are still confusing. They don't do justice to the numerous manuscripts and groups that have reported over the last 15 years that a wide range of RNA binding proteins recruit the Ccr4-Not complex to target mRNAs, in several cases in the recent years including structural details (a non-exhaustive list includes Semotok et al., 2005; Finoux et al., 2006; Goldstrohm et al., 2006; Chicoine et al., 2007; Goldstrohm et al., 2007; Rendl et al., 2008; Suzuki et al., 2010; Braun et al., 2011; Van Etten et al., 2012; Fabian et al., 2013; Bandhari et al., 2014; Raisch et al., 2016; Sgromo et al., 2017; Bulbrook et al., 2018; Sgromo et al., 2018…).

We describe this as a ‘priority model’ of RNA binding, which challenges the traditional distinction between specific and non-specific binding. This model is of general importance. By defining the RNA motifs recognized by <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> Puf3 in a priority order (categories 1 – 4 in Figure 6), we were able to ascertain an improved definition of its mRNA targets, and consequently its cellular role. While we have used Pumilio proteins as a model system, this method of analysis could be applied to any RNA-binding protein.</p><p>We did not attempt to define the interaction interface of RNA-binding proteins and Ccr4-Not at the resolution of amino acids. Instead, we show that multiple regions within the low-complexity regions of <italic>S. pombe</italic> Puf3 and Zfs1 contribute to Ccr4-Not recruitment, where each individual binding site is likely of relatively low affinity. (The interaction of TTP with CNOT1 described by Fabian et al. has an affinity (<italic>K<sub>D</sub></italic>) of ~2 µM. Other parts of TTP are likely to contribute to the interaction with Ccr4-Not). It is likely that these RNA-binding proteins interact with Ccr4-Not through an avidity driven mechanism, and a full understanding of this distributed binding will require studies of larger parts of the proteins.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Furthermore, a significant fraction of the manuscript focuses on analysis of published data emanating from S. cerevisiae that are rather descriptive, not validated, and poorly connected to the experimental data presented in the rest of the manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>Our analysis of published experimental data served to test whether our model of RNA-binding is important in vivo: do subtle differences in motif quality dictate which mRNAs are targets of Puf3?
