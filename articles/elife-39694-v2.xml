time-scales that compose cytoplasmic streaming. We characterise microtubule dynamics in two-dimensional systems by chronologically arranging five distinct processes of varying duration that make up streaming, from microtubule pairs to collective dynamics. The structures found were polarity sorted due to the propulsion of antialigned microtubules. This also gave rise to the formation of large polar-aligned domains, and streaming at the domain boundaries. Correlation functions, mean squared displacements, and velocity distributions reveal a cascade of processes ultimately leading to microtubule streaming and advection, spanning multiple microtubule lengths. The characteristic times for the processes extend over three orders of magnitude from fast single-microtubule processes to slow collective processes. Our approach can be used to directly test the importance of molecular components, such as motors and crosslinking proteins between microtubules, on the collective dynamics at cellular scale.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>computer simulations</kwd><kwd>microtubules</kwd><kwd>molecular motors</kwd><kwd>kinesin</kwd><kwd>cytoskeletal streaming</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>International Helmholtz Research School of Biophysics and Soft Matter</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Graduate Student Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Duman</surname><given-names>Özer</given-names></name><name><surname>Saggiorato</surname><given-names>Guglielmo</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The authors declare that there was no funding for this work.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Microtubule streaming driven by molecular motors covers characteristic times that span several orders of magnitude from fast, single-microtubule sliding on molecular scales to slow, collective motion on cellular scales.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The vigorous motion of the intracellular fluid, known as cytoplasmic streaming, is caused by cytoskeletal filaments and molecular motors. In <italic>Drosophila</italic> oocytes this cellular-scale fluid motion, which occurs over multiple time scales, is responsible for efficient mixing of ooplasm and nurse-cell cytoplasm, for long-distance transport of intracellular material, and for proper patterning of the oocyte (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Quinlan, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Palacios and St Johnston, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lu et al., 2016</xref>). Although cytoplasmic streaming is known for centuries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Berthold, 1886</xref>) and kinesin-1 molecular motors and microtubules (MTs) have been identified as the components responsible for ooplasmic streaming (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Quinlan, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Palacios and St Johnston, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gutzeit, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Serbus et al., 2005</xref>), there is considerable debate about the aetiological mechanisms for force generation. Namely, the constituent events, their order of occurrences, and their characteristic durations, which ultimately give streaming are not understood. Some studies suggest that streaming is caused by the hydrodynamic entrainment of motor-transported cargos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Monteith et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Theurkauf et al., 1992</xref>), others that it is due to the motor-mediated sliding of adjacent MTs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Jolly et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Winding et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Motor-mediated MT sliding occurs because molecular motors crosslink adjacent MTs and use ATP (adenosine triphosphate) molecules as fuel to 'walk’ on them unidirectionally in the direction of MT polarity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Vale and Milligan, 2000</xref>). This leads to significantly different active dynamics of MT pairs that are polar-aligned and antialigned (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gao et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Blackwell et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Ravichandran et al., 2017</xref>): Motors that crosslink polar-aligned MTs hold the polar-aligned MTs together, generating an effective attraction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Ravichandran et al., 2017</xref>). Active motors crosslink and slide antialigned MTs. The motors thus act as force dipoles that break nematic symmetry in MT solutions. In the absence of permanent crosslinkers, which are known to render the active network contractile (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Belmonte et al., 2017</xref>), this ultimately can cause large-scale flows in the cytoskeleton (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Jolly et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lu et al., 2016</xref>). Several approaches to analyse the collective motion, such as the displacement correlation function or the analysis of velocity distributions, are inspired by studies on collective motion of self-propelled agents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Duman et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Needleman and Dogic, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Zöttl and Stark, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bechinger et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Elgeti et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>In vivo, individual MTs are stationary most of the time before suddenly undergoing a burst of long-distance travel with velocities reaching <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf1"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mo>≈</mml:mo><mml:mn>10</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula> μm/s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Jolly et al., 2010</xref>). Also, fluorescence microscopy has shown the formation of long extended arms for an initially circular photoconverted area (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Jolly et al., 2010</xref>). A possible mechanism for such a behaviour is illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>: In the absence of active motor stresses, MTs in polar-aligned bundles diffuse slowly. When they encounter antialigned MTs, they can be actively and rapidly transported away from a polar-aligned bundle to another polar-aligned bundle where they again exhibit slow diffusive behaviour. These transitions between slow-bundling motion and fast-streaming bursts can give rise to Levy flight-like MT dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chen et al., 2015</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.39694.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Schematic illustrating MT bundling and streaming.</title><p>Polar-aligned MTs are coloured blue, and antialigned MTs are coloured red.

The systems often contain only a small number of different components and are usually also restricted in other respects, such as a reduced dimensionality or a lack of polymerization and depolymerization of the filaments. For example, a very well studied model system contains MTs and kinesin complexes at an oil-water interface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Sanchez et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">DeCamp et al., 2015</xref>), where poly(ethylene glycol)-induced depletion interaction both keeps the MTs at the interface and induces bundle formation. In contrast, coarse-grained computer simulations in 2D are used to study both structure formation on the bundle scale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">DeCamp et al., 2015</xref>) as well as single-filament dynamics, for example to quantify the effect of motor properties or of presence of passive crosslinkers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Ravichandran et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Blackwell et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gao et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Belmonte et al., 2017</xref>). Because such model systems are simpler than the cytoskeleton in biological cells, they are especially suited to study specific mechanisms in detail.</p><p>Cytoplasmic streaming is a complex multi-scale phenomenon that cannot be fully understood using antialigned filaments alone. The importance of a specific mechanism can only be studied in vivo for a specific system. This so-called ’top-down’ approach has been remarkably successful in describing streaming in the aquatic alga <italic>Chara coranilla</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Woodhouse and Goldstein, 2013</xref>) and <italic>Dropsophila</italic> oocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Khuc Trong et al., 2015</xref>). In the former case, theoretical models have showed the importance of coupling hydrodynamic entrainment and microfilament dynamics to capture pattern formation relevant for streaming. In the latter case, simulations mimicking streaming in <italic>Drosophila</italic> oocytes have emphasised the importance of cortical MT nucleation in anteroposterior axis definition. It was shown that nucleation of MTs from the periphery is important to induce cytoplasmic flow patterns and to localise mRNAs in specific areas of the cell.</p><p>Microtubule-motor systems are intrinsically out of equilibrium, which has been shown for example by monitoring the dynamics of motors that walk along MTs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Schnitzer and Block, 1997</xref>) and by the violation of the fluctuation-dissipation theorem for tracer particles embedded into acto-myosin systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Mizuno et al., 2007</xref>). Therefore, simulation approaches for systems of passive MTs at equilibrium have to be augmented with motor activity. Brownian dynamics simulations with MTs and explicit motors have been used to study network contractility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Belmonte et al., 2017</xref>), polarity-sorting, and stress generation at high MT densities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gao et al., 2015</xref>), persistent motion of active vortices in confinement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Head et al., 2011a</xref>) and anomalous transport in active gels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Head et al., 2011b</xref>). Recent simulations for the defect dynamics in extensile MT systems have been performed on the coarse-grained level of MT bundles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">DeCamp et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>We employ a ’bottom-up’ approach, where we study MT streaming induced by MT sliding using a model system. In order to characterize the dynamics in the system, we use a coarse-grained model to investigate whether a purely polarity-dependent MT-MT sliding mechanism, in the absence of any hydrodynamic forces, can be sufficient to capture large-scale streaming in bulk. We identify five distinct processes that comprise streaming with their characteristic times for various MT activities and surface fractions: (1) motor-driven MT sliding, (2) polarity-inversion, (3) maximal activity, (4) collective migration, and (5) rotation. Although various experimental studies have provided high spatial resolution to describe streaming phenomena (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Quinlan, 2016</xref>), MT dynamics for streaming is still poorly understood. Inspired by the biological mechanism for MT-MT sliding, we use computer simulations to provide a novel temporal perspective into streaming for a wide range of time scales, which has not been achieved so far due to limitations of experimental techniques.</p><p>In order to capture cellular-scale dynamics in computer simulations, modelling individual motors along with MTs, although done before in several studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Mizuno et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hiraiwa and Salbreux, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Ronceray et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Head et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Blackwell et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gao et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Freedman et al., 2017</xref>), can prove to be unwieldy due to the wide ranges of length and time scales involved. The sizes of individual kinesin molecules that crosslink and slide MTs are three orders of magnitude smaller than that of the cells within which they bring about large-scale dynamics. Also, there is a large disparity between the residence time of a cross-linking motor (10 seconds) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Toprak et al., 2009</xref>), and the characteristic time scale of motor-induced MT streaming or pattern formation in active gels (1 hr) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Ganguly et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Jolly et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">DeCamp et al., 2015</xref>). In order to capture motor-induced cellular-level phenomena, such as organelle distribution, cytoplasmic streaming, and active cytoskeleton-induced lipid bilayer fluctuations, a coarse-grained description of cytoskeletal activity seems therefore appropriate.</p><sec id="s1-1"><title>Coarse-grained model</title><p>Coarse-grained and continuum approaches are successfully applied to study cytoskeletal-motor systems. A well-developed model and simulation package is Cytosim that can be used to simulate flexible filaments together with further building blocks that, for example, act as nucleation sites, bind filaments together, and induce motility or severing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Nedelec and Foethke, 2007</xref>). It has been applied to study–among other processes in the cell–meiosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Burdyniuk et al., 2018</xref>), mitosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lacroix et al., 2018</xref>), and centrosome centering (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Letort et al., 2016</xref>). A different model that includes MT flexibility, MT polymerization and depolymerization, explicit motors, and hydrodynamics has recently been applied to study mitosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Nazockdast et al., 2017a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Nazockdast et al., 2017b</xref>). Because the MTs are mostly radially oriented, steric interactions between MTs can be neglected and have not been taken into account. However, MT-MT repulsion is important to obtain nematic order at high MT densities, an essential ingredient for the bottom-up model systems containing suspensions of MTs and kinesins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Sanchez et al., 2012</xref>). Our model includes MT flexibility, effective-motor potentials, and excluded-volume interactions. Polymerization and depolymerization does not occur in the model system and is not taken into account. Effective-motor models in general aim to reduce the computational effort to efficiently study large systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Swaminathan et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Jia et al., 2008</xref>). Including hydrodynamic interactions using a particle-based approach is straightforward (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Winkler and Gompper, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Müller et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gompper et al., 2009</xref>), but beyond the scope of this paper.</p></sec><sec id="s1-2"><title>Microtubules</title><p>In our two-dimensional model, MTs are modelled as impenetrable, semi-flexible filaments of length <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf2"><mml:mi>L</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula>, thickness <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf3"><mml:mi>σ</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula>, and aspect ratio <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf4"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>L</mml:mi><mml:mo>/</mml:mo><mml:mi>σ</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>.

Correlations in their motion can only manifest at longer lag times, since at short lag times the correlation contribution will be dominated by fast-moving antialigned MTs. We denote the lag time for the maximum of <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf312"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>N</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">d</mml:mi></mml:msub><mml:mo>⁢</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:mi>τ</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>, when collective migration occurs, <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf313"><mml:msub><mml:mi>τ</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">N</mml:mi><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mi>max</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:math></inline-formula>.</p><p>In order to explicitly show that positive neighbour displacement correlations observed in the intermediate time regime are due to collective migration of similarly oriented MTs, we can predict the results of photobleaching or photoactivation experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gao et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Mitchison, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hush et al., 1994</xref>). Experimentally, in a photobleaching experiment a high-intensity laser beam can be used to inactivate fluorescent molecules in a circular region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Axelrod et al., 1976</xref>). The time evolution of the distribution of the light-inactivated regions gives clues about the underlying mechanisms which mediate this motion. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7(a)</xref> illustrates that we expect little or no MT sliding to occur in a polar-aligned region, and the photobleached area maintains its shape. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7(b)</xref>, however, the photobleached area is antialigned and we expect bundles of antialigned domains to slide away, causing the photobleached spot to separate into two elongated regions. In our simulations, we perform a similar measurement, where instead of inactivating regions to inhibit fluorescence, we selectively label MT beads within a certain region. We then track their locations for <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf314"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>τ</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>N</mml:mi><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mtext>max</mml:mtext></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> and investigate their displacements.

Overall, the characteristic times increase with increasing MT surface density, because the lifetime and the coherence of the streams increases. However, our simulations also reveal details of the multi-scale process of streaming in MT-motor mixtures. For example, the time for an MT to transition from a polar-aligned to an antialigned environment is similar to the sliding time for low motor forces, where thermal motion dominates, and to the activity time for high motor forces when the streams are more stable.</p><p>The closest ’bottom-up’ experimental system to our simulation model is the in vitro model system of microtubule bundles, kinesin complexes, and depletants at the oil-water interface, investigated in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Sanchez et al.

The depletion-induced MT bundle formation in the experiments leads to a characteristic length scale of the order of <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf387"><mml:mrow><mml:mn>10</mml:mn><mml:mo>⁢</mml:mo><mml:mi>μ</mml:mi><mml:mo>⁢</mml:mo><mml:mi>m</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>, whereas the MTs in the simulations have lengths below <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf388"><mml:mrow><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mo>⁢</mml:mo><mml:mi>μ</mml:mi><mml:mo>⁢</mml:mo><mml:mi>m</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>. However, on a more qualitative level interesting correspondences are revealed. The transition between diffusive and ballistic MSDs in the simulations has also been reported for the in vitro model system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Sanchez et al., 2012</xref>). This allows the comparison of the active diffusive regime for times <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf389"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>τ</mml:mi><mml:mspace width="thinmathspace"/><mml:mo>&gt;</mml:mo><mml:mspace width="thinmathspace"/><mml:msub><mml:mi>τ</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>r</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula> and for lengths longer than a typical domain size. Whereas the motion in suspensions of passive MTs is diffusive, a ballistic regime at large lag times is found for increasing concentrations of active motors (simulations) and for increasing ATP concentration (experiment).</p><p>Some of our results can be used to interpret experimental results in vivo. For example, using Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) in <italic>Drosophila</italic> cells, fluid velocity distributions have been measured for wild-type oocytes and those lacking <italic>pat1</italic>, a protein required for kinesin heavy chain to maximise its motility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Ganguly et al., 2012</xref>). The main peak is close to a velocity of 10 nm/s, which hints that the majority of the MTs are propelled. As in our simulations, heavy tails in the velocity distribution have been reported in the experiments. A compariston of the experimental data for wild-type and <italic>pat1</italic>-deficient systems showed that for the wild-type system the mean speed was slower and the velocity distribution had heavier tails. This qualitatively agrees with our findings for varying <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf390"><mml:msub><mml:mi>p</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">a</mml:mi></mml:msub></mml:math></inline-formula>. It was suggested in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Ganguly et al. (2012)</xref> that the heavy tails in the velocity distribution of the cytosol reflect a combination of an underlying distribution of motor speeds, and a complex MT network geometry. From our simulations, we conclude that neither a complex three-dimensional cytoskeletal geometry nor a combination of different motor speeds are required to reproduce cytoskeletal velocity distributions with heavy tails.</p><p>We have studied the characteristic times of MT-motor dynamics relevant for the cytoskeleton using a coarse-grained motor model and Langevin Dynamics simulations in the overdamped regime. This allows us to access both the single-MT level as well as the collective-MT level. In previous studies that use a similar coarse-graining technique for the motor activity, the focus has been on understanding and capturing biologically relevant cytoskeletal structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aranson and Tsimring, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Jia et al., 2008</xref>). Here, for the first time, we have decomposed the time scales of activity from single MTs to system-scale ordering and streaming.</p><p>MT advection has also been analysed using photoconversion in interphase <italic>Drosophila</italic> S2 cells, where MTs were observed to buckle and loop (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Jolly et al., 2010</xref>). MT motion was visualised by photoconverting a circular region within the cell. These MTs were observed over a 7 minute period, during which 36% of the MTs were determined to be motile. It was observed that MTs spent most of the time not moving, but underwent abrupt long-distance streaming. They were found to achieve velocities up to 13 <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf391"><mml:mi>μ</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula>m/min, during these bursts of active motion. These observations are very similar to those in our simulations, where MTs spend most of their times in stable polar-aligned bundles, but when in contact with an antialigned MTs coherently stream over large distances. We find similar fractions of motile MTs between 30% and 40% also for <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf392"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>ϕ</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>0.3</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> in our simulations. Our study provides the basis for a more detailed quantitative comparison with experiments because the model can be easily extended to include further relevant aspects, such as a 3D cytoskeletal network, crosslinking proteins, and cellular confinement.</p><p>Our simulations show collective migration of MTs that is maximal at <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf393"><mml:msub><mml:mi>τ</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>N</mml:mi><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mi>max</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:math></inline-formula>. Using a FRAP-like visualisation of our data, we find elongated MT stream patterns similar to those observed in experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Jolly et al., 2010</xref>). This confirms that similarly oriented MTs move colletively in the same stream. Based on the polarity-sorting mechanism of MTs, qualitatively similar FRAP results have previously been predicted using computer simulations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gao et al., 2015</xref>). Experimental studies of a system on various length and time scales should allow testing the chronology that we predict. For example, systems with different fractions of fluorescent MTs with fixed lengths should give access to both collective as well as single-MT dynamics, for example using FRAP/photoactivation for systems with many labeled MTs to quantify collective dynamics and confocal microscopy for systems with few labeled MTs to investigate correlations in single-MT motion.</p><p>We have studied collective motion in active gels based on single MTs. Our spatio-temporal displacement correlation functions show that antialigned MTs slide away from each other in opposite directions for short time windows, while in agreement with experiments positive correlations occur for long time windows (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Ganguly et al., 2012</xref>). Our two-dimensional simulations resemble systems close to an interface that have been used to experimentally study hierarchically assembled active matter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Sanchez et al., 2012</xref>). They also lay the foundations for future studies of 3D systems and have allowed us to test parameter regimes using less computationally expensive, two-dimensional systems. Furthermore, although we observe streaming without hydrodynamics, hydrodynamic interactions may still be an important player for motor-MT systems, which can be investigated in future studies.</p><p>To summarize, our results provide a direct handle to fully characterise MT streaming over a wide range of time and length scales. Future experimental studies using modern microscopy techniques may allow testing our predictions. Future theoretical and computer simulation studies may provide further insights, such as the importance of the aspect ratio of the MTs, the presence of motors between polar-aligned MTs, and the effect of crosslinkers important for buckling and looping of flexible MTs.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Langevin dynamics</title><p>We simulate the MT-motor systems in two dimensions using periodic boundary conditions.

Your article is being evaluated by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation is being overseen by Anna Akhmanova as the Senior Editor.</p><p>Given the list of essential revisions, including new experiments, the editors and reviewers invite you to respond within the next two weeks with an action plan and timetable for the completion of the additional work. We plan to share your responses with the reviewers and then issue a binding recommendation.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This article describes a computational study of a model for cytoplasmic streaming, motivated by the phenomenology found in <italic>Drosophila</italic> oocytes. The authors introduce a coarse-grained model in which details of the molecular motors' activity that can lead to sliding between adjacent microtubules are subsumed into an effective orientation-dependent potential. The microtubules are modelled as linked spheres, and the whole setup is described by a Langevin equation. The results include many aspects of the correlation functions between the microtubules, with different regimes characterized by different types of alignments. Probability distribution functions of speeds are computed, of the kind that can be measured experimentally. The authors make some contact with experimental studies of streaming using PIV and advance the hypothesis that heavy-tailed velocity distributions arise without the previously conjectured need for varying motor speeds or complex cytoskeletal geometry.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Whereas the mechanism postulated by authors does produces streaming in the in silico system studied here, it is not guaranteed that the same mechanism occurs inside the cell or in vitro. Streaming occurs in a vast range of systems, from plants upwards, and in many of these systems the filaments are both organized and unchanging in their conformations. For sure in others the situation is different, but the present manuscript appears to suggest that cytoplasmic streaming is always associated with interfilament sliding, whereas that is not the case. This needs to be clarified.</p><p>The manuscript contains various measurements and predictions, but it is rather unclear which of them would unambiguously demonstrate the postulated mechanism if recovered in experiments. This point is crucial and should come across the manuscript with no ambiguity. In other words, the authors should clearly explain which one of their predictions an experimentalist should recover in order to verify that the mechanism behind MTs streaming is indeed that proposed in this paper.</p><p>There is a significant literature on the streaming problem in <italic>Drosophila</italic> that has not been cited. Examples include Woodhouse, et al., 2013 and Khuc Trong, et al. 2015, which discuss in detail self-organization processes and the role of cytoskeletal architecture on streaming patterns. Of particular interest in the case of <italic>Drosophila</italic> is the nucleation of microtubules from the periphery of the oocyte, leading to anchoring there. This is not accounted for in the present paper.</p><p>2) The authors do not explain what promotes short-ranged polar alignment in the absence of directed motion and cross-linking. In other words, why the polar bundles form in the first place? Can the authors exclude that the interlocking of the beads forming an individual MT has nothing to do with it?</p><p>3) While reading the manuscript, it is very tempting to think about the active suspensions of MT bundles and kinesin pioneered in the Dogic Lab. The authors do refer to some of this work and, toward the end of the manuscript, explicitly say that the collective motion found here resembles that observed in those experiments. Yet, it is rather puzzling that they avoid making a direct comparison. If the present numerical approach could serve as a particle model of these active suspensions, this should be clearly said and motivated (with an eye to the rich theoretical literature around the topic). If not, it would be useful to know where are the fundamental differences and how both these model systems compare to cytoplasmatic streaming in vivo.</p><p>4) It is somewhat unclear how the model outlined in Sec. II. reconciles with the non-equilibrium nature of kinesin-based propulsion. MT-kinesin interactions are modeled through conservative forces, that can be expressed as derivatives of of potential energy U_mot. Furthermore, the motor binding rate follows the Boltzmann distribution. This raises the question of whether the authors are attempting to describe cytoskeletal activity as an equilibrium process. Most models of cytoskeletal fluids (both discrete and continuous) are based on the assumption that kinesin moves at constant speed from the minus to the plus end (or vice versa for specific types of kinesin). This manifestly violates detailed balance and is consistent with experimental observations (see e.g. Schnitzer and Block, Nature 1997). One can debate on whether kinesin is in fact delivering a constant power, as opposed to move at constant speed, but both scenarios appear to lie outside of the scope of the present model.</p><p>5) The reviewers raised questions about the degree of novelty of your methodology. While recognizing that the specific results in the paper concerning sliding motility are new, they pointed to recent work published by the Shelley group (Nazockdast et al., 2017) which has introduced a 3D computational framework that accounts for polymerization and depolymerization kinetics of fibers, their interactions with molecular motors and other objects, their flexibility, and hydrodynamic coupling. Their model has been applied in (Nazockdast et al., 2017).</p><p>The present authors should clearly compare and contrast their work with these recent papers.</p><p>6) Regarding the simulations, the reviewers are unclear why a Langevin equation with a mass term was used in what is clearly an overdamped problem. It is also unclear why it is possible a priori to neglect hydrodynamic interactions between filaments, and the significance of working in only two dimensions. All of</p><p>these issues need clarification.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>This article describes a computational study of a model for cytoplasmic streaming, motivated by the phenomenology found in <italic>Drosophila</italic> oocytes.

MTs are modeled as spring chains with standard stretching and bending energy contributions, and steric MT-MT interactions are described by WCA repulsion. Motor activity is modeled by cross-linker springs between MTs that bind with exponential rates depending on relative orientation between motors and MT pairs. The model neglects hydrodynamics and does not account for MT nucleation and de/polymerization, although both effects could likely be added in future extensions of this framework. Simulations are restricted to 2D systems. Simulated MT numbers are O(1000) and the authors make a commendable effort to provide biologically relevant values for all model parameters.</p><p>The paper is clearly written and the numerical study has been performed carefully.</p><p>My main concern regarding suitability for publication in <italic>eLife</italic> is novelty.</p><p>Recent work published by the Shelley group, see Nazockdast et al., 2017, has introduced a 3D computational framework that accounts for polymerization and depolymerization kinetics of fibers, their interactions with molecular motors and other objects, their flexibility, and hydrodynamic coupling.

This process, observed both in vivo and in vitro, is generally ascribed to the sliding motion promoted by kinesin molecules, but the microscopic mechanism behind the kinesin-mediated MT-MT interactions is still debated. Numerical simulations suggest that streaming results from the interaction between bundles of polar-aligned MTs and is particularly sensitive to the time scale associated with the reorientation of individual MTs. The paper appears technically sound, clearly written and nicely illustrated. Unfortunately, there are various points where the authors have been too vague.</p><p>1) Whereas the mechanism postulated by authors does produces streaming in the in silico system studied here, it is not guaranteed that the same mechanism occurs inside the cell or in vitro. The manuscript contains various measurements and predictions, but it is rather unclear which of them would unambiguously demonstrate the postulated mechanism if recovered in experiments. This point is crucial in my opinion and should come across the manuscript with no ambiguity. In other words, the authors should clearly explain which one of their predictions should an experimentalist recover in order to verify that the mechanism behind MTs streaming is indeed that proposed in this paper.</p><p>2) The authors do not explain what promotes short-ranged polar alignment in the absence of directed motion and cross-linking. In other words, why the polar bundles form in the first place? Can the authors exclude that the interlocking of the beads forming an individual MT has nothing to do with it?</p><p>3) While reading the manuscript, it is very tempting to think about the active suspensions of MT bundles and kinesin pioneered in the Lab of Zvonimir Dogic and now investigated by various other groups around the world. The authors do refer to some paper by the Dogic Lab and, toward the end of the manuscript, explicitly say that the collective motion found here resembles that observed in those experiments. Yet, they avoid making a direct comparison. I find this puzzling. If the present numerical approach could serve as a particle model of Dogic's active suspensions, this should be clearly said and motivated (with an eye to the rich theoretical literature around the topic). If not, it would be useful to know where are the fundamental differences and how both these model systems compare to cytoplasmatic streaming in vivo.</p><p>4) It is somewhat unclear how the model outlined in Sec. II. reconciles with the non-equilibrium nature of kinesin-based propulsion. MT-kinesin interactions are modeled through conservative forces, that can be expressed as derivatives of of potential energy U_mot. Furthermore, the motor binding rate follows the Boltzmann distribution. This raises question on whether the authors are attempting to describe cytoskeletal activity as an equilibrium process. Most of models of cytoskeletal fluids (both discrete and continuous) are based on the assumption that kinesin moves at constant speed from the minus to the plus end (or vice versa for specific types of kinesin). This manifestly violates detailed balance and is consistent with experimental observations (see e.g. Schnitzer and Block, Nature 1997). One can debate on whether kinesin is in fact delivering a constant power, as opposed to move at constant speed, but both scenarios appear to lie outside of the scope of the present model.</p><p>In summary, whereas the authors have been quite meticulous in calibrating the parameters to experimental values, it is unclear to me whether what they present are indeed properties of MTs and kinesin or simply properties of their model. Therefore, I am unable to recommend this paper for publication in <italic>eLife</italic> in the present form.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.39694.047</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>[Editors' note: the authors’ plan for revisions was approved and the authors made a formal revised submission.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Whereas the mechanism postulated by authors does produces streaming in the in silico system studied here, it is not guaranteed that the same mechanism occurs inside the cell or in vitro. Streaming occurs in a vast range of systems, from plants upwards, and in many of these systems the filaments are both organized and unchanging in their conformations. For sure in others the situation is different, but the present manuscript appears to suggest that cytoplasmic streaming is always associated with interfilament sliding, whereas that is not the case. This needs to be clarified.The manuscript contains various measurements and predictions, but it is rather unclear which of them would unambiguously demonstrate the postulated mechanism if recovered in experiments. This point is crucial and should come across the manuscript with no ambiguity. In other words, the authors should clearly explain which one of their predictions an experimentalist should recover in order to verify that the mechanism behind MTs streaming is indeed that proposed in this paper.There is a significant literature on the streaming problem in Drosophila that has not been cited. Examples include Woodhouse, et al., 2013, and Khuc Trong, et al. 2015, which discuss in detail self-organization processes and the role of cytoskeletal architecture on streaming patterns. Of particular interest in the case of Drosophila is the nucleation of microtubules from the periphery of the oocyte, leading to anchoring there. This is not accounted for in the present paper.</p></disp-quote><p>We acknowledge that cytoskeletal streaming has been reported across multiple biological systems and that various mechanisms can account for this motion. Our goal is to isolate and address anti-aligned filament sliding as a relevant mechanism of activity, and to study whether it alone could be responsible for streaming. Through our findings, we wish to emphasize that this mechanism can singly bring about some of the hallmarks of MT streaming observed in experiments; however, it is largely underappreciated in both biological and soft-matter literature so far. We thus propose that further theoretical and experimental studies of filament sliding and MT streaming are required to exactly determine their role in long-range MT organization and transport in various contexts (e.g. neurons, <italic>Drosophila</italic> oocytes). We certainly do not want to claim that filament sliding is only and always responsible for MT streaming.</p><p>We agree with the reviewers that this point is not clearly discussed in our manuscript. We now state this more clearly in the Introduction by discussing other “bottom-up” in vitro and <italic>in silico</italic> approaches and contrasting them with “top-down” approaches. For the latter, we discuss other streaming mechanisms, such as the cargo transport reported for <italic>Chara corallina</italic> by Woodhouse et al., 2013, and nucleation of MTs from the periphery reported for <italic>Drosophila</italic> oocytes by Khuc Trong et al. 2015.</p><p>An important point is that we focus in our study on the motion on several scales far from boundaries. We have extended a paragraph in the Discussion section on how our model can be tested by experimentalists. We think here mainly about fluorescence experiments that compare both, collective and single-filament dynamics. Addition of small fractions of fluorescent filaments should allow the analysis of single-filament motion (Levy flight-like motion, velocity distributions), while photobleaching or photoactivation experiments can reveal collective motion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The authors do not explain what promotes short-ranged polar alignment in the absence of directed motion and cross-linking. In other words, why the polar bundles form in the first place? Can the authors exclude that the interlocking of the beads forming an individual MT has nothing to do with it?</p></disp-quote><p>We believe that this is a misunderstanding regarding the non-equilibrium nature of our simulations, see also point 4) of the essential revisions. In absence of directed motion (p<sub>a</sub>=0, thermal equilibrium) polar alignment cannot be obtained in our simulations. For suspensions of passive filaments, neighboring filaments do not experience sliding forces and therefore nematic and polar configurations are indistinguishable. For suspensions of active filaments, a filament in an oppositely-oriented region is propelled and transported after several simulation steps to an aligned region, in which case the active propulsion ceases.</p><p>Independent of polar alignment, potential interlocking of rough filaments is indeed an important issue to be considered carefully in the simulations. In previous work reported by Abkenar et al., 2013, Isele-Holder et al., 2015, Abaurrea Velasco et al. (Soft Matter 13, 5865 (2017)), and Duman et al., 2018, we have studied the effect of filament discretization on the dynamics of active systems. We found that by using overlapping beads within filaments, where the bond-length is half the cut-off of the excluded volume potential, the friction is strongly reduced. In particular the filament model in Isele-Holder et al. is exactly the same as the model used in this manuscript, which we now state in section Materials and methods, System parameters.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) While reading the manuscript, it is very tempting to think about the active suspensions of MT bundles and kinesin pioneered in the Dogic Lab.

The work of Dogic et al. has indeed been a very important motivation for us, and we completely agree that a more detailed comparison is desirable. Dogic’s studies of 2D model systems -- with MTs and kinesins at an oil-water interface – do not mimic or reproduce any specific biological cell in vivo but instead aim at a general understanding of self-organization and dynamics of MTs by the activity generated by molecular motors.</p><p>In the previous version of the manuscript, we referred to Dogic‘s active suspensions only for very specific results in the Introduction section. In the Discussion section, we referred to the hierarchical nature of the 2D systems. The main difference between both studies is a mismatch in system size between the experimental model system and our theoretical / numerical model. While the single-filament resolution of our simulations is not achieved in the experiments, the simulations deal with much smaller systems than the experiments. Furthermore, the two model systems are different regarding the filament aspect ratio (6:1) and the filament length to system size ratio. Filament and motor concentrations at the interface are unknown in the experiments and the filaments bundle. Therefore, a comparison of results for the two systems is at this stage only possible on a qualitative level.</p><p>We have added a new paragraph on in vitro and <italic>in silico</italic> approaches to the Introduction, where we introduce the active suspensions pioneered in the Dogic lab as well as computer simulations and where we highlight the single-filament vs. bundle nature. We contrast these “bottom-up” model systems with “top-down” studies for cytoplasmic streaming in vivoin the following paragraph. See also our reply to point 1).</p><p>We have also added a new paragraph to the Discussion section and Figure 3—figure supplement 10 that compares our results with Dogic’s results. Here, we focus on mean squared displacements.</p><p>In Figure 3—figure supplement 10, we compare the MSDs from our simulations to those measured experimentally by Dogic et al., in 2012. The MSDs have been measured using micron sized tracer particles immersed in the active nematic in Dogic’s work and using individual filaments in our work. The different system parameters make it difficult to find a common normalization of the lag time as well as of the MSDs. Following the concept of our manuscript, we have normalized time by the single-filament rotation time and the MSD by the filament length squared. Despite the difficulties to obtain a quantitative comparison, the qualitative features of the MSDs are very similar. For passive systems, the MSDs represent diffusive motion. When the motor probability p<sub>a</sub> in our model or the ATP concentration in the experiments is increased, the filaments become more active and the active velocity leads in both cases to an active ballistic motion. Our simulations, however, show in addition also very clearly the active diffusive regime at long times (the plateau). Here the filaments lose their orientational correlation. In contrast, in Dogic’s systems the filaments move mostly on straight trajectories for all studied lag times. The (active) rotational diffusion in our simulations is enhanced because of a lower filament density and a smaller MT aspect ratio compared with the experiments. The shorter active rotation time is also the reason why the active ballistic regime (MSD~(vt)<sup>2</sup>) is not fully developed in our simulations, but affected by crossover regimes to diffusive motion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) It is somewhat unclear how the model outlined in Sec. II. reconciles with the non-equilibrium nature of kinesin-based propulsion. MT-kinesin interactions are modeled through conservative forces, that can be expressed as derivatives of of potential energy U_mot. Furthermore, the motor binding rate follows the Boltzmann distribution. This raises the question of whether the authors are attempting to describe cytoskeletal activity as an equilibrium process. Most models of cytoskeletal fluids (both discrete and continuous) are based on the assumption that kinesin moves at constant speed from the minus to the plus end (or vice versa for specific types of kinesin).

One can debate on whether kinesin is in fact delivering a constant power, as opposed to move at constant speed, but both scenarios appear to lie outside of the scope of the present model.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for raising the issue that the current presentation of the model may be confusing regarding the implementation of the active motor force. The nonequilibrium activity is a key aspect of our model, and it fully captures the non-equilibrium nature of the MT-kinesin systems. The activity enters via a periodic switching on and off of harmonic potentials that are generated by the extension of the molecular motors – very similar to a ratchet model. Here, the requirement of acute angles between the stalks of the motors and the polar filaments generates net propulsion forces. To better highlight the non-equilibrium nature, we have added a new paragraph on the nonequilibrium nature of the system to the general part of the Introduction. In addition, we have added a short statement before Equation 6, which emphasizes that because of the temporary and orientation-dependent “motor bonds” the system is inherently out of equilibrium.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The reviewers raised questions about the degree of novelty of your methodology. While recognizing that the specific results in the paper concerning sliding motility are new, they pointed to recent work published by the Shelley group (Nazockdast, et al., 2017) which has introduced a 3D computational framework that accounts for polymerization and depolymerization kinetics of fibers, their interactions with molecular motors and other objects, their flexibility, and hydrodynamic coupling. Their model has been applied in Nazockdast, et al., 2017. The present authors should clearly compare and contrast their work with these recent papers.</p></disp-quote><p>The model of the Shelley group features several important aspects of cytoskeletal systems including filament flexibility, filament polymerization and depolymerization, and hydrodynamic interactions. Steric interactions between filaments are not included. Consequently, the authors have studied a system where steric interactions are not expected to play a major role, the mitotic positioning where the microtubules are oriented radially. Our model features filament flexibility, an effective-motor potential between neighboring antiparallel filaments that coarse-grains walking of the motors, and steric interactions between the filaments. Hydrodynamic interactions are not included. We study dense systems, where the screening of hydrodynamic interactions may decrease their importance and at the same time steric interactions are essential. Both simulation frameworks use parallelized codes to allow for investigation of large systems. Our code builds on the freely available LAMMPS simulation package. Together with the source code and the input file provided with this submission, the simulations can easily be implemented by other researchers.</p><p>We have added a new paragraph to the section Introduction, Coarse-grained model, where we compare and contrast our work with the model the Shelley group (New York) and the Cytosim simulation package of the Nedelec group (Heidelberg).</p><p>In particular, we also highlight that our filament-based simulations are dissimilar from calculations and simulations that strive to capture microscopic, biological details. We coarse-grain individual motor interactions into an anti-aligned motor potential, and we show that our model still captures hallmarks of MT streaming. A novel aspect is that we demonstrate that microscopic details of motor interaction might be unnecessary when trying to capture long length- and time-scale phenomena. Moreover, we distill processes occurring in various time scales into observables which can be identified and verified through other simulations and experiments.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Regarding the simulations, the reviewers are unclear why a Langevin equation with a mass term was used in what is clearly an overdamped problem. It is also unclear why it is possible a priori to neglect hydrodynamic interactions between filaments, and the significance of working in only two dimensions. All of these issues need clarification.</p></disp-quote><p>The referees are correct that the dynamics in the experimental system is overdamped. We use Langevin Dynamics (LD) simulations with a mass term instead of a Brownian Dynamics (BD) simulation because of the numerical stability of the Langevin approach. When the mass term is included, up to 100 times longer time steps can be used in the simulations. However, we operate the code with parameters that ensure that the systems are in the overdamped regime for the experimentally relevant time scales.</p><fig id="respfig1"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.39694.045</object-id><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Mean squared displacements of filaments obtained from Langevin Dynamics (LD) and Brownian Dynamics (BD), for single filaments (left) and filaments in suspensions with packing fraction 𝜙 = 0.3 (right).</title><p>The simulation parameters are the same as in the manuscript.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="jpeg" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-39694-resp-fig1-v2"/></fig><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref> shows a comparison of LD and BD simulations for (a) single filaments and (b) dense systems. The results demonstrate that our choice of parameters is justified because the crossover time from (inertial) ballistic to diffusive motion is at much shorter times than the time for a filament to diffuse over its own length. We have added a short paragraph to the section Materials and methods, Langevin Dynamics.</p><p>Hydrodynamic interactions between filaments may very well play an important role for cytoplasmic streaming. Nevertheless, there are several reasons why it makes sense to study a model in which hydrodynamic interactions are not taken into account:</p><p>1) Hydrodynamic interactions are long-ranged, and therefore induce coupling of motion not only of neighboring but also of distant filaments. Furthermore, they require numerically a significantly larger effort, as well as large system sizes. Simulations that include hydrodynamic interactions are therefore usually restricted to smaller number of particles.</p><p>2) In order to elucidate mechanisms, it is often helpful to start from simple systems, and to add additional features subsequently.</p><p>3) Boundary effect can strongly affect hydrodynamic flows, and hydrodynamic interactions are screened near surfaces and membranes.</p><p>4) In fact, our model for the filament-motor systems can be combined rather easily with particle-based mesoscale hydrodynamic approaches, which have been developed in recent years, and which are ideally suited for this purpose. Two examples for previous studies of filament hydrodynamics in a different context are:</p><p>&quot;Semidilute polymer solutions at equilibrium and under shear flow&quot;, C.-C. Huang, R.G. Winkler, G. Sutmann, and G. Gompper, Macromolecules 43, 10107 (2010);</p><p>“Migration of semiflexible polymers in microcapillary flow&quot;, R. Chelakkot, R.G. Winkler, and G. Gompper, EPL 91, 14001 (2010).</p><p>5) It will certainly be very interesting to investigate the effect of hydrodynamic interactions in our model, which we plan to do in the near future. However, this goes far beyond the current study.</p><p>We have studied 2D systems motivated by Dogic’s model systems for active suspensions. For these experimental model systems, the dynamics of the entire systems, i.e., of all filaments, can be followed using light microscopy. Furthermore, the 2D geometry might be relevant for filament-motor systems close to boundaries, such as for cytoskeletal filaments next to plasma membranes of cells. We now motivate the reduced dimensionality in the paragraph on in vitro and in silico models in the Introduction, where we highlight that such less complex bottom-up studies are especially suited to study specific mechanisms in more detail.</p></body></sub-article></article>
