The miracidium is the first larval stage of the life cycle. It swims and infects a freshwater snail, transforms into a mother sporocyst, where its stem cells generate daughter sporocysts that give rise to human-infective cercariae larvae. To understand the miracidium at cellular and molecular levels, we created a whole-body atlas of its ~365 cells. Single-cell RNA sequencing identified 19 transcriptionally distinct cell clusters. In situ hybridisation of tissue-specific genes revealed that 93% of the cells in the larva are somatic (57% neural, 19% muscle, 13% epidermal or tegument, 2% parenchyma, and 2% protonephridia) and 7% are stem. Whereas neurons represent the most diverse somatic cell types, trajectory analysis of the two main stem cell populations indicates that one of them is the origin of the tegument lineage and the other likely contains pluripotent cells. Furthermore, unlike the somatic cells, each of these stem populations shows sex-biased transcriptional signatures suggesting a cell-type-specific gene dosage compensation for sex chromosome-linked loci. The miracidium represents a simple developmental stage with which to gain a fundamental understanding of the molecular biology and spatial architecture of schistosome cells.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd><italic>Schistosoma mansoni</italic></kwd><kwd>miracidium</kwd><kwd>single-cell atlas</kwd><kwd>single-cell sequencing</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010269</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id award-id-type="doi">10.35802/098051</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Berriman</surname><given-names>Matthew</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010269</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id award-id-type="doi">10.35802/206194</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Berriman</surname><given-names>Matthew</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100006049</institution-id><institution>Marine Biological Laboratory</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rawlinson</surname><given-names>Kate A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100014013</institution-id><institution>UK Research and Innovation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MR/T020733/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Doyle</surname><given-names>Stephen R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100014013</institution-id><institution>UK Research and Innovation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MR/W013568/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rinaldi</surname><given-names>Gabriel</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection, and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.

The life cycle of <italic>S. mansoni</italic> is complex, involving parasitic stages in two hosts (a snail and a mammal), with short-lived, freshwater infectious larval stages in between. Mature male and female worms reside in the portal veins of the mammalian host, and fertilisation of the zygote occurs inside the female worm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Jurberg et al., 2009</xref>). Embryogenesis proceeds as the egg is laid in the host and continues over the ensuing 6 days (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ashton et al., 2001</xref>). During this time, the egg passes through the host vascular endothelium into the intestine and is passed in faeces into the outside environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Costain et al., 2018</xref>). If the egg lands in freshwater, a miracidium larva hatches out, swims and infects a snail host. Once inside the snail, the miracidium transforms into the mother sporocyst, and its stem cells (historically known as ‘germinal cells’) divide and differentiate to produce many daughter sporocysts that migrate within the snail. In the daughter sporocysts, a second round of embryogenesis generates the cercariae larvae by asexual reproduction from a stem cell. The cercariae emerge from the snail, swim towards and infect water-exposed mammals including humans, penetrating the skin. At the point of infection, the cercariae shed their tails, and once inside the mammal the tegument (skin) is remodelled during metamorphosis to the schistosomulum stage. The schistosomulum then moves into the blood vessels and, over the following 5 weeks, grows into a juvenile stage that migrates from the lungs to the liver and to the hepatic portal vein where sexually dimorphic male and female worms pair, mature, and mate. Thus, during the development from egg to adult, the body axes are established three times, once during the development of the miracidia, once during the development of the daughter sporocyst and finally during the development of the cercariae. Additionally, there are two rounds of embryogenesis, first from fertilised zygote to the mature miracidium, and second, the neo-embryogenesis from a single stem cell in the daughter sporocyst to a mature cercaria.</p><p>Enabled by the advent of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), molecular classification of cell types has been initiated for <italic>S. mansoni</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Wang et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Tarashansky et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Li et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Diaz Soria et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Wendt et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Diaz Soria et al., 2024</xref>). These studies have opened the door to investigate schistosome developmental cell biology and to identify new targets for controlling infection and transmission of the disease. To date, scRNA-seq studies have identified heterogeneity amongst stem cells that drive schistosome development and reproduction, classified a variety of differentiated cell types across the life cycle and revealed several key genes and their native cell types that are essential for parasite survival and propagation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Nanes Sarfati et al., 2021</xref>). Single-cell RNA-seq studies for the whole animal have only been carried out on intra-molluscan and intra-mammalian stages to date: the mother sporocyst (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Diaz Soria et al., 2024</xref>), the schistosomulum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Diaz Soria et al., 2020</xref>), juvenile (3.5 weeks post-infection of mouse, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Li et al., 2021</xref>), and adult (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Wendt et al., 2020</xref>). Single-cell studies on stem cells specifically, however, have only been undertaken in the mother sporocyst (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Wang et al., 2018</xref>) and juvenile stages (2.5 and 3.5 weeks post-infection)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Tarashansky et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>An obvious gap in the coverage of the life cycle is the lack of single-cell data for the earliest developmental time point currently accessible – the miracidium larva; earlier embryonic stages are inaccessible due to the impenetrable egg capsule. The miracidium is a short-lived, non-feeding stage that relies on internal stores of energy to sustain swimming, and host location and infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Maldonado and Acosta-Matienzo, 1948</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chernin, 1968</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Pan, 1980</xref>). The role of the miracidium and its differentiated somatic cells is to carry stem cells to a favourable environment inside the snail where they can proliferate to generate daughter sporocysts, and subsequently cercariae. If the miracidium fails to infect a snail within 12 hours it dies.</p><p>At the ultrastructural level, a rich set of cell types have been previously identified in the miracidium and classified into eight major systems: musculature, nervous, penetration gland cells, excretory, interstitial (parenchyma), stem/germinal cells, epithelial (ciliary plates and epidermal ridges of the tegument cells), and terebratorium (an apical modified epidermal plate with sensory structures and gland openings) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Pan, 1980</xref>).</p><p>To characterise this critical transmission stage, we have generated a single-cell transcriptome atlas for the miracidium. Our atlas provides molecular definitions for all described cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Pan, 1980</xref>) and indicates the functions of different cell types within tissues. Multiplexed in situ validation of cell-type marker genes enabled the cell types to be spatially resolved within the larva. Furthermore, the nuclear segmentation of the cells expressing tissue-specific genes has revealed the relative contribution of each tissue type to the animal and each cell in the larva has been assigned to a tissue. A key finding is the identification of two stem cell populations in a miracidium, and advances in our understanding of the genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Buddenborg et al., 2021</xref>) has enabled us to determine that these two stem populations are transcriptionally distinct between male and female larvae due to sex-linked gene expression. To predict the fate of these two stem populations we carried out a trajectory analysis, combining scRNA-seq data from miracidia and mother sporocysts, and this indicated that one stem cell population likely contains the pluripotent cells that will develop into the cercariae, while the other population gives rise to the somatic tissues, including the tegument. Similarities in gene expression with the adult suggest that there is a tegument developmental programme that is redeployed at multiple stages of the complex life cycle.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Single-cell RNA-seq of 20,478 miracidia cells reveals 19 cell types</title><p>There are ~365 nuclei in a miracidium (median = 365, larva #1: 342, larva #2: 365, larva #3: 377).

The expression of genes from both these lists in the miracidia single-cell data was then examined to identify the cell types that each Seurat cluster represented. Based on these markers, the 19 clusters were resolved into the following cell populations: two muscle-like (3934 cells), five resembling neurons (3255 cells), one ciliary plate (40 cells), one tegumental (366 cells), one protonephridial (539 cells), two parenchymal (1698 cells), and seven clusters resembling stem cells (10,686 cells) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>).</p><p>There were contributions from sorted and unsorted samples in almost all clusters (except ciliary plates). We found that some cell/tissue types had similar recovery from both methods (e.g. Stem A, Muscle 2, and Tegument), others were preferentially recovered by sorting (e.g. Neuron 1, Neuron 4, and Stem E), and some were depleted by sorting (e.g. Parenchyma 1, Protonephridia, and Ciliary plates) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1d</xref>).

Subcluster 7 also expressed other conserved phototransduction cascade genes, such as a 1-phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate phosphodiesterase (Smp_245900) and a beta-arrestin (Smp_152280) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1f</xref>).</p><p>Neuron 2 expressed two further rhabdomeric opsins (Smp_180030 and Smp_104210; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>), but across the cluster of 282 cells, the most expressed marker was Smp_201600, identified as the neuropeptide precursor NPP-43 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Koziol et al., 2016</xref>). ISH revealed three strongly Smp_201600<italic><sup>+</sup></italic> cells, with nuclei in a median posterior location of the brain, and three cells with weaker expression in a more anterior position (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig3video1">Figure 3—video 1</xref>). Other top markers include <italic>7B2</italic>, a guanylate kinase (Smp_137940) and a putative homeobox protein (Smp_126560).</p><p>Neuron 3 was a small cluster (47 cells) expressing <italic>complexin</italic> and <italic>7B2</italic>. The neuropeptide precursor NPP-26 (Smp_071050) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Koziol et al., 2016</xref>) was unique to and highly expressed throughout this population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). ISH showed expression in ~6 cells with projections that extended into the brain and to the periphery, three of which sat adjacent to three Neuron 2 cells. There was also weak expression in the four nuclei of the apical gland cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3Ci</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig3video1">Figure 3—video 1</xref>). STRING analysis of the top 100 markers of Neuron 3 predicted two protein interaction networks with functional enrichment; these were associated with ‘synapses’ and ‘calcium’ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4</xref>). In Neuron clusters 1, 2, and 3, there was an enrichment for genes annotated with gene ontology (GO) terms related to ‘neuropeptide signalling pathway’ and ‘neurotransmitter transport’ (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1g</xref>). There were, therefore, at least five, and likely several more, transcriptionally distinct cell types in the brain mass (we validated three subclusters of Neuron 1, as well as Neurons 2 and 3).</p><p>Cells from neuron clusters 4 and 5 had nuclei peripheral to the brain. Neuron 4 formed a large (1140 cells), discrete cluster. The top marker was an uncharacterised gene, Smp_319480 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>), that, based on protein-structure prediction using I-TASSER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Yang and Zhang, 2015</xref>), was similar to human mTORC1 (protein database [PDB] entry 5H64; TM-score 0.85). In situ expression revealed ~26 Smp_319480<sup>+</sup> cells; four at the anterior end, with projections leading to the body wall in the first tier of ciliary plates, and ~22 sat lateral and directly posterior to the brain. These latter cells formed four clusters of ~3–7 cells, with Smp_319480 transcripts distributed around the nuclei and along projections leading into the brain and extending out to the body wall terminating between the second and third tiers of ciliary plates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig3video4 fig3video5">Figure 3—videos 4 and 5</xref>). Twenty-three multi-ciliated nerve endings formed a girdle around the larva between the second and third tiers of ciliary plates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2C</xref>), and Smp_319480 transcripts were expressed at the base of these cilia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2D</xref>); some transcripts also reached the nuclei of circular BWMs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2E</xref>), suggesting these cells may function as sensory-motor neurons. Two genes, identified as top markers and co-expressed in many Neuron 4 cells, encode likely orthologues of <italic>Polycystin 1</italic> (Smp_165230) and <italic>Polycystin 2</italic> (Smp_165660) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s5">Figure 3—figure supplement 5</xref>), with the latter prediction strongly supported by a Foldseek search (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">van Kempen et al., 2024</xref>) against the PDB. Polycystins 1 and 2 form a heterodimeric ion channel required for oscillating calcium concentrations within vertebrate cilia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kim et al., 2016</xref>). A Sox transcription factor, Smp_301790, was also expressed in Neuron 4 and co-expressed with <italic>Polycystin 1</italic> and <italic>2</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s5">Figure 3—figure supplement 5B</xref>). Other top markers included a putative potassium channel (Smp_141570), a cAMP-dependent protein kinase (Smp_079010), a GTP-binding protein (Smp_045990), and an orthologue of human <italic>fibrocystin-L</italic> (Smp_303980). The GO terms ‘cilium’, ‘regulation of apoptotic process’, and ‘potassium ion transmembrane transport’ were significantly enriched, and STRING analysis showed networks enriched in ‘plasma membrane-bound cell projection’ (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1g</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4</xref>).</p><p>Neuron 5 cluster comprised 276 cells. An EF-hand domain-containing protein, Smp_343710, was highly expressed in 55% of these cells. ISH showed expression in 10–20 cells whose nuclei sat outside of, and anterior to, the brain, in and around the paired lateral glands and their secretory ducts (<xref ref-type="video" rid="fig3video6">Figure 3—video 6</xref>). There was also expression in a pair of bilaterally symmetrical bulbous protrusions (called lateral sensory papilla and thought to be depth sensors, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Pan, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). STRING analysis revealed networks associated with ‘synapses’, ‘ion channel binding’, and ‘cation transmembrane transporter activity’ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4</xref>).</p><p>We expected to find a discrete cluster(s) for the penetration glands, and that it would show similarities to the neural clusters (as glandular cells arise from neuroglandular precursor cells in other animals, such as the sea anemone, <italic>Nematostella vectensis</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Steger et al., 2022</xref>). There are three gland cells per miracidium – one apical and two lateral (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Pan, 1980</xref>). While the top marker gene for Neuron 3 was expressed in the four nuclei of the apical gland (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3Ci</xref>), and there was expression of a Neuron 5 marker in the lateral glands (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3Fi</xref>), these genes were expressed in many other cells as well. This suggests that gland cells are either subclusters of Neurons 3 and 5 or they were not captured in the 10X GEMs. To characterise the transcriptomes of the gland cells, we carried out plate-based single-cell RNA-seq (New England BioLabs) on 37 manually selected gland cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1h</xref>). The biological process GO terms enriched in the most abundant genes (top 200 genes by median transcripts per million [TPM], <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1h</xref>) included translation, protein folding and ATP synthesis coupled electron transport (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1i</xref>). The gland cells showed co-expression of neural markers (<italic>Complexin</italic> and <italic>7B2</italic>) and muscle markers <italic>Myosin light chain 1</italic> (Smp_045200), <italic>Troponin t</italic> (Smp_179810), and <italic>Actin-2</italic> (Smp_307020) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s6">Figure 3—figure supplement 6</xref>). To identify genes that were specific to gland cells, we searched for differentially expressed genes in the gland cells compared to the other cells in the plate-based scRNA-seq data (i.e. ciliary plates and unknown cells) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1j and k</xref>), and then looked at their expression in the 10X-based scRNA-seq data. A lack of, or minimal, expression of these markers in the 10X-based scRNA-seq data, would support the hypothesis that they were specific to the gland cells. Five venom antigen-like (VAL) genes (belonging to the SCP/TAPS or (CAP) superfamily) were expressed in the gland cells: Smp_120670 (VAL 5) and Smp_070250 (VAL 15) in over 60% of the gland cells, and Smp_176180 (VAL 9), Smp_002630 (VAL 2), and Smp_331830 (SCP protein) in less than 50%. Many gland cells expressed multiple VAL genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s6">Figure 3—figure supplement 6</xref>). In the 10X-based scRNA-seq data, very few cells expressed these VAL genes (one to five cells for each gene, distributed between Neurons 1 and 5, Muscle 1, Parenchyma 2, and Stems F and G clusters). The VAL genes expressed in the gland cells are uniquely expressed during the egg, miracidia, and sporocyst stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Yoshino et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lu and Berriman, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Buddenborg et al., 2023</xref>), and it has been reported that VAL 9 (Smp_176180) induces the differential expression of an extracellular matrix remodelling gene in the snail host (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Yoshino et al., 2014</xref>). Other differentially expressed genes in the gland cells included Smp_303400 (an HSP70 homologue), Smp_179250 (<italic>α-galactosidase/α-N-acetylgalactominidase</italic>), Smp_317530 (uncharacterised protein), and two putative major egg antigens Smp_185680 and Smp_303690 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s6">Figure 3—figure supplement 6</xref>). Eight putative secreted proteins previously identified in miracidia and in vitro transformed miracidia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Wang et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Wu et al., 2009</xref>) were expressed in the glands cells (and not in other cell types based on the 10X data), and five of these showed relatively high expression; Smp_302170 (<italic>HSP70</italic> homologue), Smp_303400 (<italic>HSP70</italic> homologue), Smp_049230 (<italic>HSP20</italic>), Smp_304250 (<italic>purine nucleoside phosphorylase</italic>), and Smp_302180 (putative heat shock protein 70)(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s6">Figure 3—figure supplement 6</xref>). Typical of venom glands in other animals, the transcriptomes of the miracidia gland cells are enriched in genes involved in protein translation, stabilisation, and stress response to cope with mass protein production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Zancolli et al., 2022</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Ciliary plate gene marker identifies six submuscular cell bodies</title><p>A small cluster of 40 cells (almost exclusively from the unsorted samples) was identified near the tegument cluster (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>).

Both genes were also expressed in six previously undescribed cells that sent a projection out to the exterior (between the first and second tiers of ciliary plates as seen with phalloidin staining, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>) and whose nuclei sat below the body wall musculature (<xref ref-type="video" rid="fig3video2 fig3video3">Figure 3—videos 2; 3</xref> ; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2F</xref>).

These parenchyma cells have long cytoplasmic protrusions that reach between all the other cells, filling the intercellular space (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4Fii, iii</xref>; <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig4video2 fig4video3">Figure 4—videos 2; 3</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Pan, 1980</xref> called these the interstitial cells and, observing abundant glycogen particles and lipid droplets, proposed they function as sources of energy for the non-feeding larva and as nurse cells for the stem cells during the first few days post-infection of the snail. We performed ISH for two Parenchyma 2 markers, Smp_191970 and Smp_320330, but the first showed no detectable signal, and the second had broad expression across all cells with no specific overlap with the pan-parenchymal marker Smp_318890. Therefore, by ISH, we could only identify parenchymal cells in general and could not identify the two clusters in situ.

The sex chromosomes are composed of sex-specific regions that are unique to each chromosome flanked by pseudoautosomal regions that are common to both Z and W. To unveil the genes contributing to the sex-driven clustering we removed in turn different sex chromosome regions from the analysis. When all Z-specific region (ZSR) and W-specific region (WSR) genes were removed from the dataset and the cells reclustered, the two Delta/Phi-like and two Kappa-like clusters each collapsed into single stem cell clusters, giving five stem cell clusters in total (i.e. Delta/Phi, Kappa, E, F, and G; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3</xref>). Removing from the dataset genes located solely on the WSR (<italic>n</italic> ≈ 35), the ZSR (<italic>n</italic> ≈ 900), or just the ~35 pairs of genes with homologous copies on the WSR and ZSR did not impact the overall UMAP topology, that is in all three scenarios the stem cell clusters remained separated by sex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>). ZSR or WSR expression is therefore sufficient on their own to split each of these stem clusters in two (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p>The unexpected subclustering of Delta/Phi and Kappa stem cells by sex could be either due to the contribution to each cell’s transcriptome by WSR genes (in females) that have diverged from their ZSR homologues, or by differences in expression of ZSR genes between male or female cells (see GO analysis of ZSR and WSR genes, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1m</xref>). Given the small number of WSR genes, differences in ZSR genes – caused by a difference in copy-number – seems likely to play a larger part. In many animals, dosage compensation equalises gene expression across the sex chromosomes that are unevenly distributed between the sexes. To investigate whether there is an incomplete or a lack of dosage compensation in the ZSR genes in the <italic>S. mansoni</italic> miracidium, we classified all cells based on the expression of WSR genes (i.e. only found in female individuals), so each cell was designated as W<sup>+</sup> (likely female) or W<sup>−</sup> (likely male) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2A, B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s4">Figure 5—figure supplement 4A, B</xref>). The difference in ZSR and WSR gene expression was most pronounced in the Delta/Phi- and Kappa-like cells, shown by the separation of W<sup>+</sup> and W<sup>−</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s4">Figure 5—figure supplement 4B</xref>). However, this analysis revealed other tissue-specific sex differences in ZSR gene expression for example in the protonephridia, which was evident through segregation of W<sup>+</sup> and W<sup>−</sup> cells within that cluster. We found that W<sup>+</sup> and W<sup>−</sup> cells were well mixed in the majority of the remaining clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s4">Figure 5—figure supplement 4B</xref>). Male cells have two copies of the ZSR (ZZ) and produce higher coverage across genes in this region compared to female cells, which have one ZSR and one WSR (ZW). These findings suggest that sex-linked gene dosage is not fully compensated in the miracidium, and there may be tissue-specific variation.</p><p>To identify the stem cells in situ, we investigated the expression of the pan-stem marker <italic>ago2-1.

GO analysis of differentially expressed genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1o</xref>) revealed that the most significantly upregulated genes in Delta/Phi were related to the structural component of the ribosome and translation; these are the first markers of a pre-activation stage in stem cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Shin et al., 2015</xref>).

There was sufficient sensitivity to detect cell types with as few as six cells per larva, for example, Neurons 2 and 3, and the protonephridial system. Some rarer cell types are embedded in existing clusters, particularly in Neuron 1, and a complete neural cell atlas and a study of the putative photoreceptor cells is in progress (Rawlinson et al., in prep). Some cell types were preferentially recovered, for example the stem cells; ISH revealed that they comprise only 7% of the total cell number in the larva, yet they accounted for ~52% of the scRNA-seq data (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1q</xref>). Preferential recovery may be due to differences in the robustness of different cell types to dissociation, cell sorting, and/or the microfluidics of the 10X GEM capture process. The ciliary plates, for instance, were only found in sufficient numbers to be defined as a cluster in unsorted samples. Therefore, there are clear benefits to including unsorted cell samples to discover the diversity of cell types in a tissue, organ, or organism, especially when cell types may be fragile, sticky, or unusually shaped. Even with the inclusion of unsorted cells, some known cell types were not captured, that is the penetration glands. With three gland cells per larva and a theoretical 56× coverage of each cell, we would have expected ~168 gland cells in the dataset. These cells were easily identified after dissociation by their distinct flask shape but were not identifiable in these 10X data. Perhaps, because of their large size (20 × 50 µm) and irregular shape, they were not incorporated into the 10X GEMs. Therefore, we used plate-based scRNA-seq for the penetration glands to complete the cell-type transcriptome atlas for all known cell types. Together, we have transcriptomically characterised the anatomical systems described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Pan, 1980</xref>, and we discuss key findings below.</p><p>The two muscle clusters in our dataset correspond to the circular and longitudinal muscles that comprise the orthogonal BWMs of the miracidium. We identified differences between circular and longitudinal muscle transcriptomes that have also been observed in planaria; for example <italic>MyoD</italic> and <italic>Wnt-11-1</italic> are expressed in longitudinal and circular muscles, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Scimone et al., 2017</xref>). Posterior Wnt signalling and anterior Wnt inhibition are commonly observed features of anterior–posterior body patterning in animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Petersen and Reddien, 2009</xref>). The expression of <italic>Wnt-11-1</italic> and a Wnt inhibitor, <italic>Notum,</italic> in the circular muscles at opposite poles of the miracidium suggested these muscles are involved in defining the anterior–posterior axis. Furthermore, the unilateral, asymmetrical expression of <italic>Notum</italic> at the anterior end is suggestive of a dorso–ventral axis and/or a left–right axis, neither of which have been identified in the miracidium before. Many axial patterning genes expressed in planaria muscles are essential for patterning during regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Witchley et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Vogg et al., 2014</xref>). The expression of orthologues in <italic>S. mansoni</italic> muscles, a nonregenerative animal, suggests that these genes may regulate stem cells during homeostasis in the adult (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Wendt et al., 2020</xref>). As the body axes of the miracidium were defined during embryogenesis, the expression of these genes in the muscles of the larva suggests they will provide positional information to the stem cells of the mother sporocyst in the axial patterning of the daughter sporocysts.</p><p>The nervous system accounts for over 50% of cells that make up the larva and is the most transcriptionally heterogeneous tissue, as observed in other animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Siebert et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Vergara et al., 2021</xref>). At the end of embryogenesis, at hatching, most of the miracidia neurons are fully differentiated and form the functional neural circuits of the larva. This is evident in our scRNA-seq data by the presence of discrete, well-defined neural cell clusters. In situ validation of marker genes revealed many of the nerves identified ultrastructurally; for example, the location and shape of Neuron 4 cells resemble that of the bipolar ganglion cells with multi-ciliated nerve endings described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Pan, 1980</xref>. Examination of their transcriptional profiles indicates their function; top markers include a putative <italic>mTORC1</italic>, two <italic>Polycystin</italic> genes, a <italic>GTP-binding ras-like</italic> and <italic>fibrocystin</italic>. Mammalian orthologues of these function in cells with primary cilia in the detection of flow sheer and regulate mTORC1 signalling to maintain the cell in a quiescent and functional state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lai and Jiang, 2020</xref>). Polycystins 1 and 2 expressed in ciliated neurons of the larva of the annelid <italic>Platynereis dumerilli</italic> are involved in mechanosensation, detection of water vibrations and mediate the startle response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bezares-Calderón et al., 2018</xref>). Furthermore, in planaria, SoxB1-2 regulates polycystin genes and together they function in ciliated cells that are involved in water flow sensation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Ross et al., 2018</xref>). The gene expression profile of Neuron 4 cells in the miracidium suggests they could function as flow and/or vibration sensors and may be specified by a Sox transcription factor. These multi-ciliated receptors degenerate 12 hr after the miracidia transform into a mother sporocyst (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Poteaux et al., 2023</xref>).</p><p>In situ validation of marker genes also revealed an undescribed cell type, namely the six submuscular cells that express the top marker genes for the ciliary plates (i.e. a 16 kDa CaBP and <italic>p25 alpha</italic>). The expression of these genes in both the ciliary plates and the submuscular cells suggests that these latter cells are transcriptionally similar and might play a role in the development and functioning of the ciliary plates. Their projection into the external environment suggests a sensory role, which, together with their location between the first and second tier of ciliary plates, could suggest a role in coordinating the movement of the motile cilia across the plates and tiers in response to sensory cues (i.e. similar in function to the ciliomotor pacemaker neurons in <italic>Platynereis</italic> larvae, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Verasztó et al., 2017</xref>). The ciliary plates are a miracidium-specific cell type (it is the only life cycle stage that uses motile cilia for locomotion), and once inside the snail, these plates are shed within 2–48 hr (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Meuleman et al., 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Poteaux et al., 2023</xref>). As expected, they are transcriptomically typified by enrichment with dynein and high metabolic activity. The 16 kDa CaBP (Smp_096390) is clearly important to the function of ciliary plates as it is highly expressed in data collected from both droplet- and plate-based scRNA-seq platforms. Accordingly, bulk RNA-seq data show this gene was previously detected in the late embryonic stage, miracidia, and early mother sporocyst stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lu et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Buddenborg et al., 2023</xref>).</p><p>Between all the ciliary plates sit the ridges of the tegumental cells. The ridges connect to the cell bodies beneath the body wall musculature, and their transcriptomes show a predicted network of genes involved in protein folding, export, and translocation. This is consistent with ultrastructural studies that have observed abundant RER, ribosomes, Golgi apparatus, and complex carbohydrates in these cell bodies, suggesting they are active in producing exportable proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Meuleman et al., 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Pan, 1980</xref>). Large numbers of membrane-bound vesicles were also observed and thought to become part of the new tegument membrane (syncytium) that rapidly forms around the mother sporocyst during the early stages of transformation, protecting the mother sporocyst from attack by the snails’ amoebocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Pan, 1980</xref>). The RNA velocity analysis has revealed dynamic genes that may be crucial in the maturation of the tegument cells across this life cycle transition, and in turn, for evasion of host defences and parasite survival. This analysis also suggests a developmental trajectory for the tegument cells from the miracidia Delta/Phi stem cells and follows their progeny to terminally differentiated tegument cells in the miracidium and 5-day-old sporocyst. Many of the molecular regulators and markers of adult tegument biogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Collins et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Wendt et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Wendt et al., 2022</xref>) are expressed in the miracidia and sporocyst stem and tegument cells, indicating that there is a conserved molecular programme for the development of the syncytial tegument in the mother sporocyst and its maintenance in the adult worm.</p><p>The transcriptomes of the two stem populations in the miracidium suggest they are in different activation states. This finding aligns with the discovery of two stem cell populations in the mother sporocyst that have different proliferation kinetics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Wang et al., 2013</xref>). The pre-activated state of Delta/Phi stem cells in the miracidia may signify that they are the first population to proliferate once the miracidium transforms into the mother sporocyst inside the snail. These two stem populations may also have different potency states; the co-expression of multiple transcription factors in Delta/Phi, including those specific to the tegument lineage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Wendt et al., 2018</xref>), indicates a multipotent progenitor stage. Whereas in the Kappa stem cells, the expression of genes that define the germline in the intra-mammalian stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Wang et al., 2018</xref>) suggest pluripotency. Supporting this, the RNA velocity analysis shows that <italic>p53-2</italic>, the genome protection gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Wendt et al., 2022</xref>), is most highly expressed, and being actively transcribed, in the Kappa population. The incorporation of miracidia single-cell data into existing stem cell scenarios on <italic>S. mansoni</italic> development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Wang et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Wang et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Li et al., 2021</xref>) shows the continuum of the Kappa population from hatching through the intra-molluscan stages to the adult stage inside the mammalian host (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). The finding that <italic>eled</italic>, and many of the germline-specific regulatory programme components, are expressed in some miracidia Kappa cells suggests that when a miracidium hatches, the cells that will contribute to the germline may already be segregated and the molecular regulatory programme that differentiates somatic (Delta/Phi) and germ cell (Kappa) lineages is present. Intriguingly, the presence of spliced-only copies of the germline defining genes <italic>eled</italic> and <italic>boule</italic> could suggest that they are maternal transcripts that have been restricted to the primordial germ cells during embryogenesis, as is the case in Zebrafish embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fishman et al., 2023</xref>). An alternative explanation is that unspliced transcripts exist for these lowly expressed genes but their abundance was below our threshold for detection.</p><p>An unexpected finding regarding the stem cells was the further clustering of the two populations by sex. This is the first identification of any sex differences in the miracidium. This degree of transcriptomic sexual difference was most evident in the Delta/Phi and Kappa stem cell clusters, with no distinct clustering by sex observed in other cell clusters. This could be explained by incomplete gene dosage compensation in the miracidium. Following investigations of differences in gene dosage compensation across developmental stages using bulk RNA-seq (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Picard et al., 2019</xref>), our study suggests tissue-specific variation could add a further dimension to the role of dosage compensation in schistosomes. A similar phenomenon has been described in mouse embryonic stem cells and in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, where a precise regulation of a gene-by-gene dosage compensation mechanism is critical to the proper development of specific tissues and organs, such as the wing and eye (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Valsecchi et al., 2018</xref>). In contrast to the miracidium, sex differences in undifferentiated stem cells have not been reported in later stages of the schistosome life cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Wang et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Diaz Soria et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Wendt et al., 2020</xref>). In fact, it may not have been possible to detect these differences in earlier studies because scRNA-seq data were mapped onto older versions of the genome, where the sex chromosomes were not as well defined (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Buddenborg et al., 2021</xref>). In addition to using an improved reference annotation, the present study has also benefited from a high level of coverage, enabling differences in stem cells to be more easily discerned. Whether these sex-linked gene expression and dosage differences have functional implications in developing male and female sporocysts remains to be investigated.</p><p>The current understanding of schistosome development is that differentiated somatic cells of the miracidium do not continue into the daughter sporocyst stage, the cercariae and beyond; it is the stem cells that persist and differentiate into the cell types of the subsequent life stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Wang et al., 2018</xref>). In this respect, all miracidium somatic cells are miracidium-only cells. Our atlas shows that their transcriptional signatures are similar to comparable tissue types at later stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Diaz Soria et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Wendt et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Diaz Soria et al., 2024</xref>) and that there may be conserved tissue-specific molecular developmental programmes that are deployed multiple times during the complex life cycle. Through this atlas, we have shown that even in this simple and sexually monomorphic short-lived stage, there are different populations of muscle, a diverse and distinct range of neural cell types, and that stem cell transcriptomes are already different based on the sex of the miracidium. The molecular definitions and spatial analyses of the miracidia cell types we have presented here allow us to explore the molecular processes and pathways to reveal cell functions and interactions. In addition, high coverage data from individual cells have allowed us to examine how gene expression changes across and within tissue types. Already, a picture is emerging of how the peripheral neurons may detect environmental cues, connect to the brain, muscles and ciliary plates to orientate in the water column; how the parenchymal cells supply nutrients to the surrounding cells; what the contents of the penetration glands may be; and how the tegumental and stem cells are primed for the transition to the intra-molluscan stage.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides"

Seurat’s IntegrateData function was then used to integrate the sorted and unsorted samples (with normalization.method = &quot;SCT&quot;). This resulted in 20,478 cells passing all the QC filters and going onto the primary analysis, 3849 and 3962 from the sorted samples and 6702 and 5965 from the unsorted samples.</p><p>Following integration, principal component analysis (PCA) was run for up to 100 PCs. The data were explored using a range of PCs and resolutions and using the tools listed above, 55 PCs and a resolution of 1 were selected for the analysis. We manually segmented out the cells in the Neuron 3 cluster based on clear differences in gene expression. Top markers were identified using Seurat’s FindAllMarkers (min.pct = 0.0, logfc.threshold = 0.0, test.use = &quot;roc&quot;) as recommended by Seurat best practices (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://satijalab.org/seurat/">https://satijalab.org/seurat/</ext-link>) to capture subtle differences in gene expression, and were sorted by AUC. We used the identity and expression of top marker genes (as identified by AUC), along with previously published cell- and tissue-type marker gene expression, to determine the identity of the cell clusters. To link gene description and chromosome locations to gene IDs, the GFF for the latest publicly available genome version was downloaded from WBPS (WBPS18 release, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Howe et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Howe et al., 2017</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Sex-effect analysis</title><p>To investigate sex effects on the single-cell transcriptome, the cells were categorised as W+ or W− (an approximation of female and male cells, respectively, as males lack WSR genes). As ground-truth data were absent, the % of reads mapping to ZSR and WSR was calculated using Seurat’s PercentageFeatureSet. Cells with 0.2% or more reads mapping to the WSR were classified as W+, and the remaining cells were classified as W−. The 0.2% threshold was selected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s4">Figure 5—figure supplement 4</xref>) to avoid classifying ZZ cells with a few transcripts erroneously mapping to a gene on the WSR as W+. This produced 8702 cells labelled as W+, and 11,776 cells labelled as W−.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>SAM algorithm</title><p>The count data from the QC-filtered Seurat analysis were exported for SAM (v1.0.1) analysis. For each SAM analysis, the raw count data were imported as a SAM object, standard preprocessing done (using default SAM parameters), and the SAM algorithm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Tarashansky et al., 2019</xref>) run. For further analysis, the object was converted into a Scanpy (v 1.8.2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Wolf et al., 2018</xref>) object, top markers extracted, and metadata from the Seurat analysis were attached. This method was repeated on the Neuron 1 cluster alone, to better understand the transcriptome heterogeneity.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>RNA velocity</title><p>All four miracidia samples and the raw data from the mother sporocyst (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Diaz Soria et al., 2024</xref>) were pseudo-mapped using kallisto bustools (v 0.27.3) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Melsted et al., 2021</xref> using the lamanno workflow to the version 10 <italic>S</italic>. <italic>mansoni</italic> genome (WBPS18 release <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Howe et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Howe et al., 2017</xref>, with the same amendments as listed above). The filtered spliced and unspliced matrices for each sample individually were imported to R. DropletUtils (v 1.20.0) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lun et al., 2019</xref>) and BUSpaRse (v 1.14.1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Moses, 2023</xref>) were used to process and QC the matrices, and filter out cells and genes with few reads. The matrices were then converted to Seurat objects and further filtered so only cells with the cell barcodes that passed QC filtering in the primary Seurat analysis were retained. The metadata and raw counts of the unspliced and spliced reads following filtering were exported as CSV files. The same method was performed on the mother sporocyst samples, which were combined before exporting. For the joint analyses of miracidia and sporocyst cells, the combined sporocyst Seurat object was merged with each of the four miracidia samples separately (due to the mismatch in sample size and batch effect between sorted and unsorted samples) and all were exported.</p><p>The CSV files containing spliced and unspliced reads, together with sample metadata were combined to make an AnnData object using Scanpy (v 1.8.2, Python v 3.8.5) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Wolf et al., 2018</xref>). Using scvelo (v 0.2.4) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bergen et al., 2020</xref>), the standard parameters were used to filter and normalise the data, compute moments, and recover dynamics. Velocity was calculated using the dynamical mode. Following PCA, a UMAP was generated (n_neighbors = 10, n_pcs = 40) and Leiden clustering was added (resolution = 0.8). The top-ranked dynamical genes for each cluster and known genes of interest were plotted. This was performed for each of the four miracidia samples combined with the sporocyst samples, with and without the use of combat for batch correction. As the sporocyst samples were also sorted, we used the sorted miracidia samples to reduce technical effects.</p><p>To focus on the stem/germinal and tegument clusters, the same method as above was used after subsetting the data in Seurat to contain only cells from the clusters Stem/germinal, Tegument 1, and Tegument 2 in the sporocyst samples, and only Stem A–G and Tegument clusters from the miracidia clusters.</p><p>We present the stem and tegument cells from the sporocyst stage merged with sample 1 (sorted). The equivalent results from sporocysts merged with sample 4 of the miracidia and results with all cells from those two conditions are available in the supplementary data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s4">Figure 6—figure supplements 4</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s6">6</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>EdU-staining experiment</title><p>Miracidia were collected as described above for 2 hr. As miracidia continually hatched over this time period, they ranged from 0 to 2 hr post-hatching. The miracidia were collected and split into two samples: one for EdU labelling and the second for a negative control (miracidia in water without EdU). Sample one was pulsed with 500 µM EdU in water for 4 hr. Sample two was kept in water for 4 hr. Both samples were fixed in 4% PFA for 30 min at room temperature. EdU incorporation was detected by click reaction with 25 µM Alexa Fluor488 Azide conjugates (Invitrogen) for 30 min. As a positive control, we pulsed freshly transformed mother sporocysts in EdU for 3 days (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Wang et al., 2013</xref>). Three biological replicates were carried out, with 20 miracidia and 20 mother sporocysts per treatment examined for each replicate.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Plate-based scRNAseq analysis of individually isolated cells</title><p>A sample of thousands of miracidia was dissociated into a single-cell suspension using the dissociation protocol described above. Individual gland cells, ciliary plates, and unknown cells were picked up one at time using an EZ Grip transfer pipette set to aspirate a 3-µl volume (Research Instruments Ltd 7-72-2800). Each cell was placed in a well of a 96-well plate containing a lysis buffer (NEBNext Cell Lysis Buffer, E6428). cDNA was generated using the NEB low input RNA kit (E6420). DNA library construction was carried out using the NEBNext Ultra II FS DNA Library Prep Kit for Illumina (E7805). The libraries were sequenced on one lane of NovaSeq SP.

These were imported into R (v4.3.1) and the metadata were inspected, after which only samples coming from a single cell with a minimum of 20% reads pseudoaligned were retained (<italic>n</italic> = 76). The samples were then processed using sleuth (v0.30.1) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Pimentel et al., 2017</xref> following guidance from sleuth tutorials, including the steps for normalising, fitting error models, and differential analysis. Differential analysis was used to identify significant genes between the cell types, which were visualised, along with known genes of interest, using sleuth’s heatmap function. Furthermore, the kallisto outputs were used to calculate the top 200 genes by median TPM of the two key cell types of interest, ciliary plates and gland cells, and these were used for GO term analysis following the method described below.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>In situ hybridisation</title><p>Miracidia collected as described above within 4 hr of hatching were fixed in 4% PFA in 2 μm filtered PBSTw (1× PBS + 0.1% Tween) at room temperature for 30 min on a rocker. The larvae were transferred to incubation baskets (Intavis, 35 µm mesh) in a 24-well plate, rinsed 3 × 5 min in PBSTw, and incubated in 5 μg/ml Proteinase K (Invitrogen) in 1× PBSTw for 5 min at room temperature. They were post-fixed in 4% Formaldehyde in PBSTx for 10 min at room temperature and then rinsed in PBSTw for 10 min. From this point on, the in situ hybridisation experiments followed the protocol described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Choi et al., 2016</xref> and developed for wholemount nematode larvae. We carried out fluorescent in situ hybridisation on 27 cell-type marker genes. Probes, buffers, and hairpins for third-generation in situ hybridisation chain reaction experiments were purchased from Molecular Instruments (Los Angeles, California, USA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Choi et al., 2018</xref>).

We subsequently labelled some larvae with phalloidin by adding 1 µl phalloidin to 1 ml 5× SSCT (Sodium Chloride and Sodium Citrate buffer [Invitrogen AM9763] + 0.1% Tween) (for an hour at room temperature in the dark, then rinsing 6 × 30 min in SSCT, incubating overnight at 4°C in DAPI fluoromount-G (Southern Biotech) and then mounting and imaging on a confocal laser microscope (Leica Sp8)). We carried out at more than three in situ hybridisation experiments for each marker gene we validated (each experiment was a biological replicate). From each experiment, we imaged (by confocal microscopy) 10 miracidia (technical replicates) per marker gene experiment. To count the number of cells belonging to each tissue type we imported confocal z-stacks of tissue marker gene expression (<xref ref-type="video" rid="fig8video1 fig8video2 fig8video3">Figure 8—videos 1–3</xref>) into ImageJ, and using the plugin TrakEM2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cardona et al., 2012</xref>), manually segmented each nucleus that was expressing, and was surrounded, by the transcripts.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Opsin phylogeny</title><p>Amino acid sequences for selected metazoan opsin proteins were obtained from the GenBank database and aligned using the – auto mode of MAFFT v7.450 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Katoh and Standley, 2013</xref>), then trimmed using trimAl v1.4.rev22 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Capella-Gutiérrez et al., 2009</xref>) to remove alignment columns with more than 50% gap characters ensuring at least 50% of alignment columns were maintained in the final alignment. Phylogenetic analysis of this alignment was performed using RaxML v8.2.12 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Stamatakis, 2014</xref>). The best-fitting empirical amino acid substitution model was identified as maximising the log-likelihood of the data under a model incorporating gamma-distributed variation in substitution rates across sites, and this optimal model (Le Gascuel,LG) was used for subsequent inference. The maximum-likelihood tree and branch lengths were identified as the highest likelihood from 25 independent searches starting from different random starting tree topologies, and support for partitions on this tree was estimated using 1000 bootstrap replicates of resampling alignment positions with replacement, using the fast bootstrap (−x) algorithm implemented in RaxML.</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>Protein–protein interaction analysis</title><p>Protein interactions were predicted using the online search tool STRING <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.string-db.org/">https://www.string-db.org/</ext-link>; V 11; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Szklarczyk et al., 2019</xref> for the following well-defined cell clusters: Neurons 3–5, ciliary plates, protonephridia, Parenchyma 1 and 2, tegument, and the two main stem cell populations, Delta/Phi and Kappa. Protein sequences for the top 100 marker genes for each cell cluster were collected from WormBase ParaSite. The protein sequences were entered as a multiple protein search.

Genes were retained for analysis if they had a minimum AUC score of 0.7. To compare the functional enrichment in Stem 1 vs Stem 2, Stem A was combined with Stem B and Stem C was combined with Stem D, and the differentially expressed markers were identified using Seurat’s FindMarkers. These markers were filtered (with adjusted p-values &lt;0.001) and used as the basis for GO enrichment analysis in the Delta/Phi and Kappa stem clusters.

Node size was set to a minimum of five terms, and analysis was run for each cluster on the Biological Process and Molecular Function categories. Fisher’s exact test was used to assess the statistical significance of overrepresented terms, with an FDR threshold set &lt;0.05. The same method was used to identify overrepresented terms in the WSR genes, ZSR genes, and WSR together with ZSR genes for the BP, MF, and Cellular Component categories.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology, Project administration, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Formal analysis, Data curation, Funding acquisition, Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Investigation, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Data curation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con8"><p>Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con9"><p>Formal analysis, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Methodology, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con10"><p>Supervision, Funding acquisition, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>All animal-regulated procedures, including the experimental mouse infections at the Wellcome Sanger Institute, were conducted under Home Office Project Licence No. P77E8A062 held by Gabriel Rinaldi.

Miracidia develop from eggs produced in the mammalian (human) host and are released into freshwater, where they can infect the parasite's intermediate snail host to continue the life cycle.

In addition to providing the field with markers for many of the cell types in the parasite at this stage, the authors use these markers to count the total number of various cell types in the organism. Because the authors realized that their cell isolation protocols were biasing the cell types they were sequencing, they applied a second method to help them recover additional cell types.</p><p>Schistosomes have ZW sex chromosomes and the authors make the interesting observation that the stem cells at this stage are already expressing sex (i.e. W)-specific genes.</p><p>Comments on revised version:</p><p>The manuscript has been improved after revisions.

The single-cell transcriptome inventory is beautifully supplemented with in situ hybridization, providing spatial information and absolute cell numbers for many of the recovered transcriptomic states. The identification of sex-specific transcriptomic states within the populations of stem cells was particularly unexpected. The work comprises a rich resource to complement the biology of this complex system, however falls short in some technical aspects of the bioinformatic analyses of the generated sequence data.</p><p>(1) Four sequencing libraries were generated and then merged for analysis, however, the authors fail to document any parameters that would indicate that the clustering does not suffer from any batch effects.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this comment which has given us the opportunity to elaborate on this interesting point. Consequently, we have added evidence to show that the data do not suffer from batch effects between samples (e.g. between sorted samples 1 and 4, and unsorted samples 2 and 3). We now show that there are contributions to all clusters from sorted and unsorted samples and highlight the benefits to using both conditions in a cell atlas with unknown cell types.</p><p>Accordingly, we have now added the following paragraph to line 153:</p><p>There were contributions from sorted and unsorted samples in almost all clusters (except ciliary plates). We found that some cell/tissue types had similar recovery from both methods (e.g. Stem A, Muscle 2, and Tegument), others were preferentially recovered by sorting (e.g Neuron 1, Neuron 4, and Stem E), and some were depleted by sorting (e.g. Parenchyma 1, Protonephridia, and Ciliary plates) (Supplementary Figure 1 , Supplementary Table 4). This variation in recovery, therefore, enabled us to maximise the discovery and inclusion of different cell types in the atlas.</p><p>We have now added a Supplementary Figure 1 showing the contribution of sorted and unsorted cells to the Seurat clusters. We have also included a Supplementary Table 4 detailing the cell number contribution for both conditions and the percentages in order to easily compare differential recovery between cell types.</p><p>These are added to the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) Additionally, the authors switch between analysis platforms without a clear motivation or explanation of what the fundamental differences between these platforms are. While in theory, any biologically robust observation should be recoverable from any permutation of analysis parameters, it has been recently documented that the two popular analysis platforms (Seurat - R and scanPy python) indeed do things slightly differently and can give different results (https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.04.04.588111v1). For this reason, I don't think that one can claim that Seurat fails to find clusters resolved by SAM without running a similar pipeline on the cluster alone as was done with SAM/scanPy here. The manuscript itself needs to be checked carefully for misleading statements in this regard.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this comment and agree that it’s important to increase the clarity on this matter. We have added additional detail to explain that results of subclustering Neuron 1 using Seurat and SAM/ScanPy were broadly similar, but that we presented the results from the SAM/ScanPy analysis due to the strengths of SAM in detecting small differences in gene expression (Tarashanky et al., 2019 PMID: 31524596). We have included here the UMAP showing subclustering of Neuron 1 in Seurat for comparison.</p><fig id="sa3fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>UMAP showing subclustering of Neuron 1 cluster in Seurat (SCT normalisation, PC = 19, resolution = 0.3).</title></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-95628-sa3-fig1-v1.tif"/></fig><p>We’ve added this additional text to the ‘Neuron abundance and diversity’ section on line 220:</p><p>We explored whether Neuron 1 could be further subdivided into transcriptionally distinct cells by subclustering (Supplementary Figure 2; Supplementary Table 6) using the self-assembling manifold (SAM) algorithm (Tarashansky et al., 2019) with ScanPy (Wolf et al., 2018), given its reported strength in discerning subtle variation in gene expression (Tarashansky et al., 2019), although a similar topology was subsequently found using Seurat.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) Similarly, the manuscript contains many statements regarding clusters being 'connected to', or forming a 'bridge' on the UMAP projection. One must be very careful about these types of statements, as the relative position of cells on a reduced-dimension cell map can be misleading (see Chari and Pachter 2023). To support these types of interpretations, the authors should provide evidence of gene expression transitions that support connectivity as well as stability estimates of such connections under different parameter conditions. Otherwise, these descriptors hold little value and should be dropped and the transcriptomic states simply defined as clusters with no reference to their positions on the UMAP.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this thoughtful comment. We agree and have rephrased those statements accordingly e.g. line numbers 218, 439, 543, and 557.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) The underlying support for the clusters as transcriptomically unique identities is not well supported by the dot plots provided. The authors used very permissive parameters to generate marker lists, which hampers the identification of highly specific marker genes. This permissive approach can allow for extensive lists of upregulated genes for input into STRING/GO analyses, this is less useful for evaluating the robustness of the cluster states. Running the Seurat::FindAllMarkers with more stringent parameters would give a more selective set of genes to display and thereby increase the confidence in the reader as to the validity of profiles selected as being transcriptomically unique.</p></disp-quote><p>The Reviewer is correct in noting that we used a permissive approach to enable a better understanding of the biology of each cluster, based on analysing enriched functions. However, we disagree about the suitability of the approach for finding markers. First, the permissive approach produced longer candidate lists, but those with the best AUC scores for each cluster are at the top of the list for each cluster. Second, some of the markers with lower expression also revealed interesting biology (e.g. Notum in the muscles). Furthermore, we used filtering on the marker genes lists to increase the minimum marker gene scores for analyses such as the GO analyses (details in the GO section of the methods). It’s important to stress that our approach also utilised validation by FISH for top marker genes, as well as biologically informative genes that were lower down the marker gene list.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) Figure 5B shows a UMAP representation of cell positions with a statement that the clustering disappears. As a visual representation of this phenomenon, the UMAP is a very good tool, however, to make this statement you need to re-cluster your data after the removal of this gene set and demonstrate that the data no longer clusters into A/B and C/D.</p></disp-quote><p>We’ve added Supplementary Figure 13 to show that after removing WSR and ZSR genes and reclustering, the data no longer clusters in A/B and C/D, even at a higher resolution where clusters appear oversplit.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Also, as a reader, these data beg the question: which genes are removed here? Is there an over-representation of any specific 'types' of genes that could lead to any hypotheses of the function? Perhaps the STRING/GO analyses of this gene set could be informative.</p></disp-quote><p>We have performed GO-enrichment analyses on W-specific genes, Z-specific genes and both together compared to the rest of the genome, but we did not find very informative results (see Supplementary Table 13 that we have now added, line 464). This may be due to the large difference in size. There are approx 900 Z-specific genes (males two copy, females one copy), while approx 30 W-specific genes many of which have homologs in the Z-specific region of the genome. Instead we suggest that tissue-specific regulation of gene dosage compensation is the more likely explanation as reported for other species (Valsecchi et al. 2018).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(6) How do the proportions of cell types characterized via in situ here compare to the relative proportions of clusters obtained? It does not correspond to the percentages of the clusters captured (although this should be quantified in a similar manner in order to make this comparison direct: 10,686/20,478 = ~50% vs. 7%), how do you interpret this discrepancy? While this is mentioned in the discussion, there is no sufficient postulation as to why you have an overabundance of the stem cells compared to their presence in the tissue. While it is true that you could have a negative selection of some cell types, for example as stated the size of the penetration glands exceeds both that of the 10x capabilities (40uM), and the 30uM filters used in the protocol, this does not really address why over half of the captured cells represent 'stem cells'. A more realistic interpretation would be biological rather than merely technical. For example, while the composition of the muscle cells and the number of muscle transcriptomes captured are quite congruent at ~20%, the organism is composed of more than 50% of neurons, but only 15% of the transcriptomic states are assigned to neuronal. Could it be that a large fraction of the stem cells are actually neural progenitors? Are there other large inconsistencies between the cluster sizes and the fraction of expected cells? Could you look specifically at early transcription factors that are found in the neurons (or other cell types) within the various stem cell populations to help further refine the precursor/cell type relationships?</p></disp-quote><p>Yes, it is really interesting that more than 50% of cells in the animal are neurons whereas more than 50% of cells in scRNAseq data are stem cells. This dataset provides a unique opportunity to compare tissue composition in the whole animal to the corresponding single cell RNAseq dataset.</p><p>The table (in Supplementary Table 17) shows the percentage of cells from each tissue type in the miracidium (identified via in situ hybridisation of tissue-type marker genes) and in the scRNAseq to understand this phenomenon.</p><p>This table shows that the single cell protocol used in this study negatively selected for nerves and tegument, and positively selected for stem and parenchyma. The composition of the muscle and protonephridia cells and the number of muscle and protonephridia transcriptomes captured are quite congruent.</p><p>This technical finding is also biologically consistent. For instance, the tegument cells span the body wall muscles, with the cell bodies below and a syncytial layer above. It is not known how the tegument fragments during the dissociation process, and which parts of the cells get packaged by the 10X GEMs. Because of tegumental structure, the cells are likely prone to damage, and therefore we speculate that is why the tegument cells are under-represented in our 10X data. Unusually shaped fragments may not have been captured in 10X GEMs and of those that were, damaged or distressed tegument cells/fragments may have been excluded post-sequencing, by QC filters including cell calling, mitochondrial percentage and low transcript count (e.g. if there there was a tegumental fragment with 100 transcripts it would have not passed QC). Stem cells are spherical with a large nucleus:cytoplasm ratio, likely making them more robust during dissociation and more likely to be captured in 10X GEMs.</p><p>We don’t think that a large fraction of the stem cells are actually neural progenitors because:</p><p>(1) we used previously reported marker genes of different tissue types to identify the single cell RNAseq clusters, e.g. Ago2-1 for stem cells, which has been used in multiple life stages.</p><p>(2) The stem cell transcriptomes express many previously reported stem cell marker genes.</p><p>(3) We found that the stem cells from the single cell data generally had higher numbers of transcripts than the other cell types which is consistent with the Wang et al. 2013 observation that RNA marker POPO-1 could distinguish germinal (stem) cells from other cell types as they are RNA rich.</p><p>(4) We also found higher numbers of ribosomal related transcripts in our stem cell transcriptomes, which is consistent with Pan’s observation that part of the distinct morphology of stem cells is densely packed ribosomes in the cytoplasm.</p><p>In order to elaborate on this discussion we have generated new visualisations:</p><p>(1) A UMAP of the stem cell marker ago2-1 (Supplementary figure 10), to further illustrate our evidence in classifying the stem cell clusters</p><p>(2) A co-expression plot of the stem cell marker ago2-1 with neural marker complexin to confirm that there is little coexpression (the most coexpression being in Neuron 1 and Stem F). We identified that 15.56% of cells in the Stem F cluster show some expression of complexin (neural marker), suggesting that a small fraction of Stem F may be early/precursor neurons, but the gene expression indicates that the majority of cells in Stem F are more likely to be stem cells than any other tissue type.

Miracidia develop from eggs produced in the mammalian (human) host and are released into freshwater, where they can infect the parasite's intermediate snail host to continue the life cycle. This study adds to the growing single-cell resources that have already been generated for other life-cycle stages and, thus, provides a useful resource for the field.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>Beyond generating lists of genes that are differentially expressed in different cell types, the authors validated many of the cluster-defining genes using in situ hybridization chain reaction. In addition to providing the field with markers for many of the cell types in the parasite at this stage, the authors use these markers to count the total number of various cell types in the organism. Because the authors realized that their cell isolation protocols were biasing the cell types they were sequencing, they applied a second method to help them recover additional cell types.</p><p>Schistosomes have ZW sex chromosomes and the authors make the interesting observation that the stem cells at this stage are already expressing sex (i.e. W)-specific genes.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>The sample sizes upon which the in situ hybridization results and cell counts are based are either not stated (in most cases) or are very small (n=3). This lack of clarity about biological replicates and sample sizes makes it difficult for the reader to assess the robustness of the results and the extremely small sample sizes (when provided) are a missed opportunity to explore the variability of the system, or lack thereof.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now added more details about the methods we used for validating cell type marker genes by in situ hybridisation. We have added to the methods that ‘We carried out at least three in situ hybridisation experiments for each marker gene we validated (each experiment was a biological replicate). From each experiment we imaged (by confocal microscopy) at least 10 miracidia (technical replicates) per marker gene experiment.’ on line 1036.</p><p>In the figure legends we have added the number of miracidia that were screened, and documented the percentage of the screened larvae that showed the in situ gene expression pattern that is seen in the images in the figures, and that we described in the text.</p><p>We manually segmented the nuclei of pan tissue marker genes, and we did this for one miracidium in the case of all tissues, except stem cells where we segmented stem cells in five larvae. Manual segmentation of gene expression in a confocal z-stack is very time consuming. We consider that the variability of different cell and tissue types (stereotypy) between miracidia is beyond the scope of this paper and can be investigated in future work.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Although assigning transcripts to a given cell type is usually straightforward via in situ experiments, the authors fail to consider the potential difficulty of assigning the appropriate nuclei to cells with long cytoplasmic extensions, like neurons. In the absence of multiple markers and a better understanding of the nervous system, it seems likely that the authors have overestimated the number of neurons and misassigned other cell types based on their proximity to neural projections.</p></disp-quote><p>This is a valid point, and we acknowledge the difficulties of assigning a nucleus to a cell using mRNA expression only and in the absence of a cell membrane marker. We tried to address this issue by labelling the cell membranes using an antibody against beta catenin after the HCR in situ protocol. This method has been used successfully on sections on slides (Schulte et al., 2024), but we failed to get usable results in our miracidia whole-mounts. The beta catenin localisation marked the membranes of the gland cells but didn’t do the same for the neurons or other cell types (see image below).</p><fig id="sa3fig4" position="float"><label>Author response image 4.</label><caption><title>Image showing a maximum intensity projection of a subvolume of a confocal z-stack of a miracidia wholemount in situ hybridisation (by HCR) for paramyosin counterstained with a beta catenin antibody (1:600 concentration of Sigma C2206).</title><p>The cell membrane of a lateral gland is clearly labelled, but those of the neurons of the brain and the paramyosin+ muscle cells are not.</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-95628-sa3-fig4-v1.tif"/></fig><p>Our observation that 57% of the cells in a miracidium are nerves is high compared to the <italic>C. elegans</italic> hermaphrodite adult in which 302 out of 959 cells are neurons (Hobert et al., 2016), few studies have equivalent data with which to make comparisons. Despite this, and the limitation described above, we believe that we have not overestimated the number of neural cells. During the process of validating the marker genes and closely examining gene expression in hundreds of miracidia, we noted that the nuclei of different tissue types are distinct and recognisable (see figure below). The nuclei of stem, tegument and parenchymal cells are comparatively large and spherical with obvious nucleoli (i). The four nuclei of the apical gland cell are angular, pentagonal in shape and sit adjoining each other (inside red dashed circle, i-iii), those of the two lateral glands are bilaterally symmetrical and surrounded by flask shaped cytoplasm (arrows, iv). The nuclei of the body wall muscle cells are peripheral and flattened on the outer edge (iii). The notum+ muscle cell nuclei are anterior of the apical gland (manuscript Figure 2E). The only other two tissue types are the nerves and protonephridia, and their nuclei are smaller and more compact/condensed. In situ expression of the protonephridia marker suggests that 6 cells make up the protonephridial system (manuscript Figure 4 B&amp;E). Therefore, by process of elimination, the remaining nuclei should belong to neurons. The complexin expression pattern supports this and we counted 209 nuclei that were surrounded by cpx transcript expression. To help the reader interpret this for themselves we have added confocal z-stacks of miracidia where tissue level markers have been multiplexed (supplementary videos 18-20). We counted all tissue type cells individually and the tissue type cell numbers added up to the overall cell count.</p><fig id="sa3fig5" position="float"><label>Author response image 5.</label><caption><title>Image showing the diversity of nucleus morphology between tissue types in the miracidium.</title></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-95628-sa3-fig5-v1.tif"/></fig><p>Biologically, it is not surprising that this larva is dominated by neural cells. It must navigate a complex aquatic environment and identify a suitable mollusc host in less than 12 hours. It is a non-feeding vehicle that must deliver the stem cells to a suitable environment where they can develop into the subsequent life cycle stage. Accordingly, the cell type composition reflects this challenge.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The conclusion that germline genes are expressed in the miracidia stem cells seems greatly overstated in the absence of any follow-up validation. The expression scales for genes like eled and boule are more than 3 orders of magnitude smaller than those used for any of the robustly expressed genes presented throughout the paper. These scales are undefined, so it isn't entirely clear what they represent, but neither of these genes is detected at levels remotely high (or statistically significant) enough to survive filters for cluster-defining genes.</p><p>Given that germ cells often develop early in embryogenesis and arrest the cell cycle until later in development, and that these transcripts reveal no unspliced forms, it seems plausible that the authors are detecting some maternally supplied transcripts that have yet to be completely degraded.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that the expression of genes such as eled and boule are low. We made this clear in the figure legends and text, and have now added scale information to the figure legends. We did not explore these genes as cluster-defining genes, partly due to their comparatively low levels of expression, but as genes already reported to be important in germ line specification. We found the expression of these genes to be consistent with our hypothesis that the Kappa stem cells may include germ line segregated cells, but our hypothesis does not rest on these lower-expressed genes.</p><p>It is certainly possible that we have detected some maternally supplied transcripts in the miracidia stem cells. However experiments to distinguish between zygotic and maternal transcripts using metabolic labelling of zygotic transcripts (e.g. Fishman et al. 2023) would be hard in this species due to the hard egg capsule and its ectolethical embryogenesis. Therefore this is out of scope for this work, but this would be a very interesting topic to follow up on and develop tools for.</p><p>We have added these sentences to the Discussion ln 746 ‘Intriguingly, the presence of spliced-only copies of the germline defining genes eled and boule could suggest that they are maternal transcripts that have been restricted to the primordial germ cells during embryogenesis, as is the case in Zebrafish embryos (Fishman et al., 2023). An alternative explanation is that unspliced transcripts exist for these lowly expressed genes but their abundance was below our threshold for detection.’</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>Ln 138: specify the version of Seurat used, and reference the primary papers for this software.

For example, previous work suggested that one of the sporocyst stem cell populations (phi) gives rise to tegument and other temporary larval structures; this appears not to be mentioned here. The model in Figure 7 suggests that two of the stem cell populations are gone at day 15 post-infection; the literature shows that those cells can still be detected at this stage (there are just far fewer of them).</p></disp-quote><p>We have added the definition of Kappa, Delta and Phi as per Wang et al (2018) in the stem cell results p13 ln 428.</p><p>We have amended Figure 7 to include further elements from the Wang et al (2018) paper that show that mother sporocyst stem cells classified as delta and phi are still detectable on day 15 post-infection in mother sporocysts.</p><p>We intentionally didn’t put too much emphasis on fitting our data to the model of Wang et al (2018), because (a) it’s a different life cycle stage and (b) the single cell data the model was based on was from 35 stem cells and gathered using a different method, (c) more recent data (Diaz, Attenborough et al. 2024) with 119 stem cells from sporocysts did not recover the same populations of stem cells. We therefore linked our data to previous literature where it was relevant but focused on being led by the data we gathered (&gt;10,000 stem cells).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) To add some detail to the public comment about the lack of clarity about sample sizes and biological replicates, and how this leads to questions about the robustness of the results, Figures 4 B and F show the expression pattern for the same parenchyma marker (Smp_318890) in two different samples. The patterns appear quite distinctive. In B, the cell bodies are so clearly labeled that the signal appears oversaturated. In F the cell bodies are barely apparent. Based on the single-cell clustering, it should be possible to distinguish between Parenchyma clusters 1 and 2 based on the levels of this transcript. Careful quantification of signal intensity from multiple samples across multiple experiments might enable the authors to detect such differences.</p></disp-quote><p>The reason the expression patterns look different between panels 4Bii and 4F is that in 4Bii we have manually segmented the nuclei of the parenchymal cells in order to count them, whereas in the images in 4F there is no segmentation. We have made this more clear in this legend now, and also in the legends of Figures 2,3, and 5. If there was any signal intensity difference between parenchyma 1 and 2 cells based on expression of the marker gene, Smp_318890, it was not obvious. We carried out 6 experiments for parenchyma markers, multiplexing the pan-parenchyma marker, Smp_318890, with markers for parenchyma 2 but we were unable to distinguish between the two populations.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) The authors find that the &quot;somatic&quot; stem cells in miracidia seem to combine attributes of the previously defined delta and phi stem cells from sporocysts. Because the 3 classes of sporocyst stem cells were defined by expression of nanos-2 and fgfrA, using those probes in in-situ experiments could have helped them resolve whether or not the miracidial cells represent precursors that can adopt either fate or if the heterogeneity is already present in miracidia.</p></disp-quote><p>In silico expression of the marker genes for the 3 classes of sporocyst stem cells didn’t support those three classes in the miracidia stem cells (See supplementary table 10). We further subclustered the delta/phi cells to see if we could recover separate delta and phi populations but we were unable to do so. We therefore did not pursue in situ experiments of these genes. We instead prioritised cluster-defining genes in the miracidia stem cell populations rather than cluster defining genes in the sporocyst (defined by Wang et al., 2018), but we still explored these in silico. For example, instead of using klf to define Kappa (Wang et al 2018), we used UPPA to validate the Kappa population as it showed similar expression to klf but higher expression levels and was specific to that population. However, like Wang et al 2018, we did use p53, which is a cluster marker of delta and phi in sporocysts, as it showed clear and high expression in our miracidia delta/phi population. We were guided by our data and our knowledge of the literature. More in depth single cell RNAseq is needed from the mother and daughter sporocyst stages to understand the heterogeneity and fates of these stem populations.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) Scale bars should be included throughout the figures and the scale should be defined either on the figure or in the legend.
