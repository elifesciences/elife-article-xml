The HBP is controlled by its rate-limiting enzyme glutamine fructose-6-phosphate amidotransferase (GFPT/GFAT) that is directly inhibited by UDP-GlcNAc in a feedback loop. HBP regulation by GFPT is well studied but other HBP regulators have remained obscure. Elevated UDP-GlcNAc levels counteract the glycosylation toxin tunicamycin (TM), and thus we screened for TM resistance in haploid mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) using random chemical mutagenesis to determine alternative HBP regulation. We identified the N-acetylglucosamine deacetylase AMDHD2 that catalyzes a reverse reaction in the HBP and its loss strongly elevated UDP-GlcNAc. To better understand AMDHD2, we solved the crystal structure and found that loss-of-function (LOF) is caused by protein destabilization or interference with its catalytic activity. Finally, we show that mESCs express AMDHD2 together with GFPT2 instead of the more common paralog GFPT1. Compared with GFPT1, GFPT2 had a much lower sensitivity to UDP-GlcNAc inhibition, explaining how AMDHD2 LOF resulted in HBP activation. This HBP configuration in which AMDHD2 serves to balance GFPT2 activity was also observed in other mESCs and, consistently, the GFPT2:GFPT1 ratio decreased with differentiation of human embryonic stem cells. Taken together, our data reveal a critical function of AMDHD2 in limiting UDP-GlcNAc production in cells that use GFPT2 for metabolite entry into the HBP.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>hexosamine pathway</kwd><kwd>AMDHD2</kwd><kwd>haploid mouse embryonic stem cells</kwd><kwd>mutagenesis screen</kwd><kwd>x-ray crystallography</kwd><kwd>gfat2</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002347</institution-id><institution>Bundesministerium für Bildung und Forschung</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>01GQ1423A EndoProtect</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ruegenberg</surname><given-names>Sabine</given-names></name><name><surname>Miethe</surname><given-names>Stephan</given-names></name><name><surname>Denzel</surname><given-names>Martin Sebastian</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>73111208-SFB 829</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Baumann</surname><given-names>Ulrich</given-names></name><name><surname>Denzel</surname><given-names>Martin Sebastian</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>H2020 European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ERC-2014-StG-640254-MetAGEn</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Denzel</surname><given-names>Martin Sebastian</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Max Planck Institute for Biology of Ageing</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Open Access Funding</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kroef</surname><given-names>Virginia</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SCHE1562/8-1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Schermer</surname><given-names>Bernhard</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SFB1403, 414786233, A09</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Schermer</surname><given-names>Bernhard</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DE 2326/3-1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Denzel</surname><given-names>Martin Sebastian</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>AMDHD2 restricts the activity of the essential hexosamine pathway in mouse embryonic stem cells where GFPT2/GFAT2 instead of the common paralog GFPT1/GFAT1 controls metabolite entry.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The hexosamine biosynthetic pathway (HBP) is an anabolic branch of glycolysis consuming about 2%–3% of cellular glucose (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Marshall et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Ghosh et al., 1960</xref>). It provides substrates for various posttranslational modification (PTM) reactions and has been strongly associated with stress resistance and longevity as well as cell growth and transformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Denzel et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Wellen et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Yamashita et al., 1985</xref>). Thus, the HBP plays an essential role for metabolic adaptations and cellular homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">McClain and Crook, 1996</xref>).</p><p>In the first and rate limiting step of the HBP, glutamine fructose-6-phosphate amidotransferase (GFPT) converts fructose-6-phosphate (Frc6P) and L-glutamine (L-Gln) to D-glucosamine-6-phosphate (GlcN6P) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Ghosh et al., 1960</xref>). The two mammalian GFPT paralogs GFPT1 and GFPT2 show 75%–80% amino acid sequence identity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Oki et al., 1999</xref>). While GFPT1 is ubiquitously expressed, GFPT2 is reported to be predominantly expressed in the nervous system. Notably, GlcN6P can be converted to Frc6P by glucosamine-6-phosphate deaminase 1 and 2 (GNPDA1/2), shunting metabolites back into glycolysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Arreola et al., 2003</xref>). In the second step of the HBP, glucosamine-phosphate N-acetyltransferase (GNA1) acetylates GlcN6P to N-acetylglucosamine-6-phosphate (GlcNAc-6P) using acetyl-CoA as the acetyl donor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Wang et al., 2008</xref>). This reaction is also presumed to be reversible through deacetylation of GlcNAc6P (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Weidanz et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bergfeld et al., 2012</xref>). After isomerization into GlcNAc-1-phosphate (GlcNAc-1P) mediated by GlcNAc phosphomutase (PGM3), UTP is used in a final step by UDP-N-acetylglucosamine pyrophosphorylase (UAP1) to synthesize the final product uridine 5′-diphosphate-N-acetyl-D-glucosamine (UDP-GlcNAc) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Ricciardiello et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Mio et al., 1998</xref>). UDP-GlcNAc can be reversibly interconverted to its epimer uridine 5′-diphosphate-N-acetyl-D-galactosamine (UDP-GalNAc) by the enzyme UDP-galactose-4′-epimerase (GALE) and the pool of both metabolites is termed UDP-HexNAc (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Thoden et al., 2001</xref>). The HBP is the only source for UDP-GlcNAc and relies on substrates from carbon, nitrogen, fatty-acid, and energy metabolism. It is therefore optimally positioned as a metabolic sensor that can modulate downstream cellular signaling through UDP-GlcNAc dependent PTMs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Marshall et al., 1991</xref>).</p><p>UDP-GlcNAc is a precursor of several important biomolecules, such as chitin, peptidoglycans, and glycosaminoglycans, and for a number of dynamic glycosylation events. Mucin-type O-glycosylation plays an important role in the extracellular matrix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hanisch, 2001</xref>). N-linked-glycosylation orchestrates protein folding in the endoplasmic reticulum and is therefore crucial in protein homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Parodi, 2000</xref>). N-glycans further contribute to the cell surface glycocalyx as structural components of proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Martinez-Seara Monne et al., 2013</xref>). Finally, the addition of single GlcNAc moieties to Thr/Ser residues, termed O-GlcNAcylation, occurs dynamically on hundreds of proteins, thus modulating a variety of downstream pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hart, 1997</xref>). Surprisingly, this dynamic PTM is accomplished by a single protein, O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT), and O-GlcNAcase (OGA) is the only known enzyme to remove O-GlcNAc modifications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Haltiwanger et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dong and Hart, 1994</xref>). While it is known that these glycosylation reactions are limited by intracellular UDP-GlcNAc, how the HBP is regulated to adapt UDP-GlcNAc levels according to nutrient availability is poorly understood. Due to the diverse function of UDP-GlcNAc, alterations in its abundance can have detrimental effects resulting in pathological conditions like diabetes, cancer, cardiovascular diseases, and neurodegenerative diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Marshall et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Oikari et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Arnold et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Champattanachai et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>In a previous chemical mutagenesis screen in <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans,</italic> we isolated mutants resistant to the toxin tunicamycin (TM) as a proxy for enhanced protein quality control and found that TM resistant mutants were enriched for longevity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Denzel et al., 2014</xref>). TM is a competitive inhibitor of UDPGlcNAc:dolichylphosphate GlcNAc-1-phosphotransferase (GPT), which catalyzes the first step of Nglycan synthesis utilizing UDP-GlcNAc (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Heifetz et al., 1979</xref>). TM thus disrupts N-glycosylation and leads to proteins misfolding and proteotoxic stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Parodi, 2000</xref>). We found that single amino acid substitutions in GFPT1 result in gain-of-function (GOF) due to loss of UDP-GlcNAc feedback inhibition, elevating cellular UDP-GlcNAc levels and thereby counteracting TM toxicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Ruegenberg et al., 2020</xref>). By introducing the same GOF mutation in GFPT1 of mouse neuroblastoma Neuro2a (N2a) cells, we confirmed a conserved mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Horn et al., 2020</xref>), suggesting that screening for TM resistance might be a suitable unbiased means to analyze the HBP through genetic approaches in mammalian cells. Based on this knowledge, we aimed to identify novel regulators of the HBP in mammalian cells, which could serve as potential drug targets for future therapeutic interventions.</p><p>In this study, we combined chemical mutagenesis with whole-exome sequencing in haploid murine cells and identified the N-acetylglucosamine-6-phosphate deacetylase AMDHD2 (Amidohydrolase Domain Containing 2) as a novel regulator of the HBP. Through AMDHD2 deletion, we discovered a configuration of the HBP that uses GFPT2 as the key enzyme. Functionally, GFPT2 shows a lower sensitivity to UDP-GlcNAc feedback inhibition compared to GFPT1 therefore requiring AMDHD2 to balance HBP metabolic flux.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Chemical mutagenesis screen for TM resistance in haploid mESCs identifies AMDHD2</title><p>Elevated HBP activity and high UDP-GlcNAc concentrations suppress TM toxicity, making TM resistance a proxy for HBP activity in genetic screens. To investigate HBP regulation in mammalian cells, we therefore performed an unbiased TM resistance screen. The mutagen N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea (ENU) induces single-nucleotide variants that enable a screen at amino acid resolution. Thus, we used ENU in haploid cells, which uniquely enable the identification of recessive alleles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Elling et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Horn et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Allmeroth et al., 2021</xref>). In order to reach a high degree of saturation, 27 million AN3-12 mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) were used for mutagenesis. This was followed by TM selection using a wild-type (WT) lethal dose (0.5 µg/ml) for 3 weeks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Twenty-nine resistant clones were randomly selected and picked to grow isogenic mutant lines. Whole-exome sequencing was done with four clones, which showed strong TM resistance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Two clones revealed independent missense mutations in the <italic>Amdhd2</italic> coding sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). A second round of whole-exome sequencing of the remaining 25 clones revealed in total 11 independent amino acid substitutions at 10 distinct positions in <italic>Amdhd2</italic> (38% of sequenced clones) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Surprisingly, we did not identify any mutations in the HBP’s rate limiting enzymes <italic>Gfpt1</italic> or <italic>Gfpt2</italic>. In addition, we performed a random insertional mutagenesis screen using an enhanced gene trapping system, which was previously established in haploid mESCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Elling et al., 2017</xref>). After selection for TM resistance and mapping of the insertion site by Sanger sequencing, we identified <italic>Amdhd2</italic> in 4 of the 20 analyzed clones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Since disruption of the <italic>Amdhd2</italic> locus by transgene insertion was sufficient to mediate TM resistance, we concluded that the identified mutations are loss-of-function (LOF) mutations.

However, a role of AMDHD2 in modulating cellular UDP-GlcNAc levels has not been recognized before. We hypothesized that AMDHD2 LOF might increase UDP-GlcNAc levels leading to TM resistance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). To test this, we measured UDP-GlcNAc levels via ionic chromatography/mass spectrometry (IC-MS) and found that TM resistant mutants identified in the insertional mutagenesis screen (clones 1–4) as well as the CRISPR/Cas9-generated AMDHD2 KO mutants showed a significant increase in UDP-GlcNAc concentrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). These data indicate that the TM resistance is mediated by elevated HBP product availability due to reduced catabolism of GlcNAc-6P. To further corroborate a causal role of AMDHD2 mutation in elevated UDP-GlcNAc levels and the accompanying TM resistance, we performed rescue experiments with N-terminally FLAG-HA-tagged human AMDHD2 (hAMDHD2). We compared the expression of WT hAMDHD2 and, based on information from the bacterial homolog N-acetylglucosamine-6-phosphate deacetylase (NagA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hall et al., 2007</xref>), a potential catalytically inactive mutant with a D294A substitution (hAMDHD2 D294A) in control WT and AMDHD2 KO mESCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A,B</xref>). Overexpression of WT or mutant hAMDHD2 did not affect UDP-GlcNAc levels or TM resistance in WT mESCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C and D</xref>). However, in AMDHD2 KO cells, only re-expression of functional WT hAMDHD2 reduced UDP-GlcNAc levels, while overexpression of the inactive hAMDHD2 D294A mutant still resulted in significantly elevated UDP-GlcNAc levels compared to WT cells. This observation was functionally supported by TM resistance assays using the same cell lines; overexpression of mutant hAMDHD2 D294A in the AMDHD2 KO background had no effect, but expression of WT hAMDHD2 reduced TM resistance. Taken together, these data emphasize the relevance of functional AMDHD2 for HBP activity and they show that AMDHD2 deletion results in TM resistance via increased HBP activity.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Disruption of <italic>Amdhd2</italic> mediates tunicamycin (TM) resistance via elevated HBP flux.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic overview of the hexosamine pathway (blue box).

Therefore, we performed a structural and a biochemical characterization of human AMDHD2. Initial apo AMDHD2 crystals diffracted poorly and no structure could be solved. Based on homology to bacterial NagA, human AMDHD2 is likely to bind a divalent cation in the active site, potentially stabilizing the protein and supporting co-crystallization. Consequently, we analyzed the stabilizing effect of several divalent cations. Addition of CoCl<sub>2</sub>, NiCl<sub>2</sub>, and ZnCl<sub>2</sub> to the size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) buffer increased the thermal stability of AMDHD2 by 3–4°C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Moreover, we tested the influence of CoCl<sub>2</sub>, NiCl<sub>2</sub>, and ZnCl<sub>2</sub> on the deacetylase activity of AMDHD2. For that purpose, the metal co-factor of AMDHD2 was first removed by incubation with EDTA and then CoCl<sub>2</sub>, NiCl<sub>2</sub>, or ZnCl<sub>2</sub> were added back. Addition of MgCl<sub>2</sub> served as negative control, while an untreated AMDHD2 was used as positive control. Both CoCl<sub>2</sub> and ZnCl<sub>2</sub> restored and ZnCl<sub>2</sub>even increased AMDHD2 activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Thus, Co<sup>2+</sup> or Zn<sup>2+</sup> might be the metal co-factor in human AMDHD2. We next tested co-crystallization of AMDHD2 with ZnCl<sub>2</sub> or CoCl<sub>2</sub>. While no crystals formed in the presence of CoCl<sub>2</sub>, the co-crystallization with ZnCl<sub>2</sub> yielded needle clusters in several conditions. Optimized crystals diffracted to a resolution limit of 1.84 Å (AMDHD2+Zn) or 1.90 Å (AMDHD2+Zn+GlcN6P). The data collection and refinement statistics are summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>. Human AMDHD2 is organized into two domains, a deacetylase domain responsible for the conversion of GlcNAc-6P into GlcN6P and a second small domain with unknown function (DUF) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). Residues from both the N-terminus and the C-terminus contribute to the DUF domain. The structure of AMDHD2 was almost completely modeled into the electron density map except for some N-terminal (1–5) and C-terminal residues (407–409). In the asymmetric unit, AMDHD2 forms a dimer through direct interactions of the deacetylase domains with an interface of 1117 Å<sup>2</sup> and this dimeric assembly was judged as biological relevant by the EPPIC server (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bliven et al., 2018</xref>). Although the dimer is formed by a rather small interface, this conformation is supported by the crystallographic B-factors, which show low values at the interface, indicating a mutual stabilization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>) and by dynamic light scattering (DLS) measurements, confirming the presence of AMDHD2 dimers in solution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>). A comparison between both monomers from the dimer in the crystal revealed no major structural differences between monomer A and monomer B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4</xref>). The structure of the deacetylase domain showed a TIM (triosephosphate isomerase) barrel-like fold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). A typical TIM-barrel has eight alternating β-strands and α-helices forming a barrel shape where the parallel β-sheet builds the core that is surrounded by the α-helices. In AMDHD2, the eight alternating β-strands/α-helices are interrupted after eight β-strands and seven α-helices by an insertion of three antiparallel β-strands (β15–β17), which form an additional β-sheet close to the active site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s5">Figure 3—figure supplement 5</xref>). In monomer B, this β-sheet shows the highest crystallographic B-factors within the structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>), indicating high flexibility and suggesting a functional role as a lid to the active site. The DUF-domain consists of two β-sheets, which are composed of three or six antiparallel β-strands each, and two small α-helices (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). Taken together, these β-sheets form a β-sandwich. A superposition of the Zn-bound and the GlcN6P- and Zn-bound structures of AMDHD2 indicated no structural changes by the binding of the product (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s6">Figure 3—figure supplement 6</xref>). Residues from both monomers contribute to GlcN6P-binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s7">Figure 3—figure supplement 7A</xref>). The phosphate group of the sugar is interacting via hydrogen bonds with Asn235 and Ala236, as well as ionic interactions to His242* and Arg243* of the other monomer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s7">Figure 3—figure supplement 7A, B</xref>). To assess a functional role of the residues His242* and Arg243*, and especially of the dimeric state on catalytic activity of AMDHD2, we generated the double mutant H242A/R243A and the mutants I280E and I280R, whose side chains might disrupt dimerization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). Analytical SEC measurements confirmed the presence of monomeric I280E (45.7±0.1 kDa) and monomeric I280R (44.4±0.5 kDa) compared to dimeric WT AMDHD2 (89.2±0.9 kDa) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G and H</xref>). In contrast, the H242A/R243A substitution did not clearly disrupt dimerization (79.4±0.8 kDa) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G and H</xref>). Strikingly, I280E, I280R, andH242A/R243A showed no catalytic activity, supporting that AMDHD2 must form a dimer to be active and that the residues His242* and Arg243* are indispensable for catalytic activity. GlcN6P binding to the active site is further mediated by hydrogen bonds between the hydroxyl groups of GlcN6P with Ala154 and His272. The catalytic Zn ion is coordinated via electrostatic interactions with Glu143, His211, His232, and two water molecules, which in turn are stabilized by interactions with GlcN6P and several amino acid side chains including Asp294 that might, based on the homology to bacterial NagA, act as the catalytic base (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hall et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s7">Figure 3—figure supplement 7A, B</xref>). We confirmed the presence of a single Zn ion in the human AMDHD2 active site by measuring an anomalous signal at the Zn-K edge (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3J</xref>). Given the conservation of all functional residues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s8">Figure 3—figure supplement 8</xref>), the human AMDHD2 reaction mechanism is likely to be very similar to the proposed mechanism for the enzyme from <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hall et al., 2007</xref>). In addition to GlcNAc-6P, bacterial NagAs are reported to use N-acetylgalactosamine-6-phosphate (GalNAc-6P) and N-acetylglucosamine-6-sulphate (GlcNAc-6S) as substrates, albeit with increased K<sub>m</sub> values (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hall et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ahangar et al., 2018</xref>). The high structural conservation of the side chains interacting with the sugar’s C4 for GalNAc-6P or the phosphate group prompted us to test whether human AMDHD2 can catalyze the deacetylation of GalNAc-6P and GlcNAc-6S as well. Of note, we did not observe activity toward these N-acetyl amino sugars that might be of physiological relevance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s9">Figure 3—figure supplement 9</xref>). In summary, our data show that human AMDHD2 is an obligate dimeric protein with high specificity for GlcNAc-6P that carries a single catalytic Zn ion in the active center.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Structural and biochemical characterization of human AMDHD2.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Influence of divalent addition (10 µM) on the stability of AMDHD2 in size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) buffer in thermal shift assays (mean + SEM, n=3, ns=not significant, ***p&lt;0.0001 versus wild-type (WT), one-way ANOVA).

the putative active site mutant D294A to understand how they might affect the function of AMDHD2. Many AMDHD2 variants were soluble upon bacterial expression, including F146L, A154P, T185A, S208T, and D294A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). These substitutions are located close to the active site of AMDHD2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>) and Ala154 is involved in ligand binding by donating an H-bond via its main chain NH group to the 3-OH group of the sugar (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s7">Figure 3—figure supplement 7A, B</xref>). In contrast, no soluble expression could be achieved for AMDHD2 G102D, G130R, G226E, and G265V (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). The substitution of the small, flexible glycine by charged and/or bigger residues are likely to be incompatible with the proper tertiary structure and/or the folding process, thus resulting in insoluble AMDHD2 protein variants that remain in the pellet fraction after sample lysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). The effect of the L142F mutation was even more severe as the substitution of Leu142 by the bigger phenylalanine resulted in AMDHD2 fragmentation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Also, the I38T and G265R substitutions reduced soluble expression, indicating disturbed protein folding. We next tested the consequences of the I38T, T185A, G265R, and D294A substitutions on AMDHD2 activity. AMDHD2 T185A showed reduced activity and no activity was detected for G265R and D294A, while the third substitution, I38T, remained active (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). This result indicates a functional role of Asp294 in the catalytic mechanism, confirming our idea that this substitution inactivates AMDHD2 and justifying its use in the rescue experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C and D</xref>). Asp294 is likely to act as catalytic base that activates the nucleophilic water molecule together with the metal ion, and later protonating the leaving group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hall et al., 2007</xref>). Moreover, the I38T substitution is the only identified mutation from the screen that is located in the DUF domain of AMDHD2. It reduced bacterial AMDHD2 expression yields, suggesting impaired protein folding. This is likely to result in a LOF in vivo, while the purified and soluble protein is active. Taken together, the structural and biochemical characterization of AMDHD2 revealed that LOF and subsequent HBP activation resulted from folding defects in AMDHD2 or it was caused by a loss of catalytic activity.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Characterization of AMDHD2 loss-of-function (LOF) mutants.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) SDS-gels stained with Coomassie brilliant blue of a representative bacterial test expression of the human AMDHD2 variants.

Under normal conditions, GFPT1 is constantly feedback inhibited by UDP-GlcNAc, crucially limiting HBP activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Ruegenberg et al., 2020</xref>). A GOF substitution in GFPT1 (G451E), however, increased HBP flux in nematodes and in murine cells, demonstrating a high degree of conservation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Horn et al., 2020</xref>). In AN3-12 cells, the G451E GOF substitution, introduced into the genomic locus by CRISPR/Cas9, as well as a <italic>Gfpt1</italic> KO did not affect UDP-GlcNAc levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>).

Since loss of GFPT1 did not affect HBP activity, we hypothesized that GFPT2 instead of GFPT1 might control metabolite entry into the HBP in AN3-12 mESCs. Indeed, <italic>Gfpt2,</italic> mRNA was abundantly expressed in AN3-12 cells, while expression levels of <italic>Gfpt1</italic> were comparatively low (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). Next, we performed Western blot analysis using pure purified human GFPT and compared those to the GFPT abundance in various cell lines. GFPT2 was found abundantly expressed, while GFPT1 was difficult to detect in AN3-12 mESCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). E14 mESCs likewise showed predominant GFPT2 expression and low GFPT1 abundance. In contrast, mouse neuronal N2a cells as well as muscle precursor C2C12 myoblasts showed predominant GFPT1 expression and GFPT2 was virtually undetectable. These data suggest an HBP configuration characterized by a high GFPT2:GFPT1 ratio in mESCs.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>AMDHD2 limits HBP activity when GFPT2 replaces GFPT1 as the first enzyme.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Relative <italic>GFPT1</italic> and <italic>GFPT2</italic> mRNA levels (qPCR) in WT AN3-12 cells (mean ± SEM, n=4, ***p&lt;0.001, unpaired t-test).

Mirroring GFPT2 levels, AMDHD2 protein abundance was higher in mESCs compared to N2a and C2C12 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). Moreover, the KO of AMDHD2 in AN3-12 mESCs resulted in a drastic elevation of UDP-GlcNAc levels, while the loss of AMDHD2 in N2a cells had no significant effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). In accordance, the loss of AMDHD2 in C2C12 myoblasts was not sufficient to increase UDP-GlcNAc levels compared to control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2A-B</xref>). This indicates that AMDHD2 was constitutively active in AN3-12 cells, while the catalysis of the reverse flux of the HBP by AMDHD2 seemed to be negligible in N2a and C2C12 cells. We therefore hypothesized that AMDHD2 plays a key role in the HBP when GFPT2 is its first enzyme instead of the more common GFPT1. Our previous data indicate that GFPT1 is under constant UDP-GlcNAc inhibition, sufficient for full suppression of GFPT1 activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Ruegenberg et al., 2020</xref>). We reasoned that higher UDP-GlcNAc levels in mESCs can only be achieved by differences in UDP-GlcNAc feedback inhibition between GFPT1 and GFPT2. To address this point, we generated recombinant human GFPT1 and GFPT2 with an internal His<sub>6</sub>tag and characterized the proteins in activity assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3A-B</xref>). Kinetic measurements confirmed that both proteins were fully functional and revealed different substrate affinities of GFPT2 compared to GFPT1 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3A-B</xref>). In a UDP-GlcNAc dose-response assay, we found a significantly higher IC<sub>50</sub> value for GFPT2 (367.3–43.6/+49.5 µM) compared to GFPT1 (57.0–8.3/+9.7 µM) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>). We conclude, first, that UDP-GlcNAc inhibition is weaker in GFPT2 compared to GFPT1 and, second, that AMDHD2 plays a crucial role in balancing GFPT2-mediated HBP flux. Consistent with lower feedback inhibition of GFPT2, UDP-GlcNAc levels in AN3-12 and E14 mESCs were significantly higher than in N2a and C2C12 cells with a GFPT1-regulated HBP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>). We also tested protein O-GlcNAc modification, which relies on UDP-GlcNAc as a precursor molecule, in the different cell lines via Western blot analysis with an O-GlcNAc specific antibody (RL2). Consistent with the elevated UDP-GlcNAc levels, we observed significantly higher O-GlcNAc modification in mESCs. Of note, both OGA and OGT were more abundant in the mESCs compared to N2a and C2C12 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G–J</xref>). Overall, these data demonstrate an mESC-specific configuration of the HBP, relying on the coexpression of GFPT2 and AMDHD2. This balance appears to be tuned to elevate UDP-GlcNAc levels and O-GlcNAc modification in ESCs.</p><table-wrap id="table2" position="float"><label>Table 2.</label><caption><title>Kinetic parameters of human GFPT1 and GFPT2.</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" rowspan="2" valign="bottom"/><th align="left" colspan="3" valign="bottom">L-Glu production</th><th align="left" colspan="3" valign="bottom">D-GlcN6P production</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">UDP-GlcNAc inhibition</th></tr><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom">K<sub>m</sub> L-Gln[mM]</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">k<sub>cat</sub>[s<sup>–1</sup>]</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">k<sub>cat</sub>/K<sub>m</sub>[mM<sup>–1</sup> s<sup>–1</sup>]</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">K<sub>m</sub> Frc6P[mM]</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">k<sub>cat</sub>[s<sup>–1</sup>]</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">k<sub>cat</sub>/K<sub>m</sub>[mM<sup>–1</sup> s<sup>–1</sup>]</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">IC<sub>50</sub>[µM]</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom"><bold>GFPT1</bold></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">1.1±0.19</td><td align="char" char="plusmn" valign="bottom">3.6±0.18</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">3.3</td><td align="char" char="plusmn" valign="bottom">0.08±0.01</td><td align="char" char="plusmn" valign="bottom">1.7±0.09</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">21.3</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">57.0–8.3/+9.7</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom"><bold>GFPT2</bold></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">0.5±0.06</td><td align="char" char="plusmn" valign="bottom">3.7±0.10</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">7.4</td><td align="char" char="plusmn" valign="bottom">0.29±0.05</td><td align="char" char="plusmn" valign="bottom">1.8±0.09</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">6.2</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">367.3–43.6/+49.5</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom"><bold>Unpaired t-test</bold>(<bold>two-sided</bold>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">**p=0.005</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="left" valign="bottom">**p=0.0027</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="left" valign="bottom">***p=0.0002</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Differentiation of ESCs induces an enzymatic reconfiguration of the HBP by reducing the GFPT2:GFPT1 ratio</title><p>In the next step, we asked if differentiation of mESC might affect the HBP’s enzymatic configuration.

We used this knowledge to interrogate the HBP for additional regulators in a forward genetic TM resistance screen using haploid mammalian cells. Random chemical DNA mutagenesis at high saturation in haploid cells is a unique strategy to identify recessive mutations including those leading to single amino acid substitutions. Using this approach, we identified the N-acetylglucosamine-6-phosphate deacetylase AMDHD2 as a novel regulator of the mammalian HBP. With an independent random insertional mutagenesis screen, we confirmed the importance of AMDHD2 for regulating HBP activity and confirmed the role of AMDHD2 through rescue experiments. We next solved the first crystal structure of human AMDHD2 and noted that resistance-associated substitutions disturb protein folding or cluster in the catalytic pocket, likely interfering with substrate binding or catalysis. Finally, we found that mESCs utilize GFPT2 for metabolite entry into the HBP instead of the more widely expressed GFPT1. GFPT2 is under considerably reduced UDP-GlcNAc feedback inhibition explaining why loss of AMDHD2 activity was sufficient for HBP activation without GFPT mutations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>).</p><p>Chemical mutagenesis-based screening in haploid cells represents a powerful and unique technique. This approach allows to dissect the entire spectrum of mutations including LOF, GOF, and neomorph alleles, and at the same time allows structure-function analyses due to its amino acid resolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Horn et al., 2018</xref>). The additional use of haploid cells not only enables detection of dominant but also recessive mutations due to the lack of a remaining and interfering WT allele. Of note, identification of AMDHD2 as a novel regulator of the HBP was only possible in this specific setup since <italic>Amdhd2</italic> mutations are recessive as shown in the AMDHD2 KO mouse.</p><p>Besides the function as GlcNAc-6P deacetylase, AMDHD2 was shown to be involved in the degradation of N-glycolylneuraminic acid (Neu5Gc) in mice and in human cell culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bergfeld et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Campbell et al., 1987</xref>). Nevertheless, mammalian AMDHD2 is rather unstudied and most knowledge is based on the bacterial homolog NagA. NagA catalyzes the deacetylation reaction in the HBP, contributing to recycling of cell wall components such as GlcNAc. Since breakdown of GlcNAc can be used as an energy source by bacteria and fungi, NagA plays a crucial role in their energy metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Liu et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Plumbridge, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Popowska et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Yadav et al., 2011</xref>). For this reason, HBP enzymes are attractive selective targets for antifungal and antibiotic drugs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Zhang et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Świątek et al., 2012a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Świątek et al., 2012b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lockhart et al., 2020</xref>). While catabolism of amino sugars connects GlcNAc with other important metabolic pathways, AMDHD2 had not been implicated in a regulatory role of the HBP and cellular UDP-GlcNAc homeostasis.</p><p>After identification of AMDHD2 as a key modulator of the mammalian HBP, we structurally and biochemically characterized human AMDHD2. We solved the structure of human AMDHD2, the first reported eukaryotic structure of an AMDHD2 homolog and confirmed that human AMDHD2 is an obligate dimeric enzyme. Residues from both monomers contribute to ligand binding in the active site, while the residues important for catalysis originate from one monomer. The oligomeric state of AMDHD2 is therefore a plausible target to modulate its catalytic properties.</p><p>We showed that the mutations identified in the screen cause a LOF in human AMDHD2 by disrupting its folding or activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). AMDHD2 is composed of a deacetylase domain and a small DUF. We identified only one mutation, I38T, within the DUF domain and this mutant showed diminished expression yields and low solubility, potentially explaining the LOF. Nonetheless, the soluble fraction of AMDHD2 I38T was as active as WT AMDHD2 in activity assays, indicating that the DUF domain might be dispensable for catalysis.</p><p>Further characterizing the HBP, we noticed a surprising configuration of HBP enzymes in AN3-12 and E14 mESCs. While N2a cells and C2C12 myoblasts rely on GFPT1 as the key HBP enzyme, the mESCs use GFPT2 that is abundantly expressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>). Consistently, genetic manipulation of GFPT1 did not show any effect on UDP-GlcNAc levels in AN3-12 mESCs, while introducing the G451E GOF mutation in GFPT1 of N2a cells leads to the previously reported boost of HBP activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Horn et al., 2020</xref>). Additionally, AMDHD2 abundance was higher in mESCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). In accordance, the AMDHD2 KO in AN3-12 mESCs massively elevated UDP-GlcNAc levels, while the loss of AMDHD2 in N2a cells and C2C12 myoblasts had no significant impact. Under physiological conditions, GFPT1 is strongly inhibited by UDP-GlcNAc (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Ruegenberg et al., 2020</xref>). In this scenario, as is the case in N2a and C2C12 cells, loss of the reverse flux by AMDHD2 KO showed no drastic effect on UDP-GlcNAc levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>). Moreover, we showed that GFPT2 has altered substrate affinities and is less susceptible to UDP-GlcNAc feedback inhibition. N- or C-terminal tags in GFPT disturb the catalytic function, therefore the GFPT preparations used here carry an internal tag for purification at a position that is reported not to interfere with the kinetic properties of GFPT1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Richez et al., 2007</xref>). Studies with other tagging strategies reported only a weak inhibition of GFPT2 by UDP-GlcNAc (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hu et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Oliveira et al., 2021</xref>). In contrast, we demonstrate that GFPT2 can be fully inhibited by UDP-GlcNAc with an approximately six-fold higher IC<sub>50</sub> value compared to GFPT1. Overall, our data suggest that GFPT1 is sufficiently regulated by feedback inhibition to determine HBP flux under physiological conditions. Cells using GFPT2 in the HBP, in contrast, rely on AMDHD2 to balance forward and reverse flux in the HBP.</p><p>This HBP configuration might be a general adaptation of mESCs as we could show similar results for AN3-12 and E14 mESCs. Differentiation might result in a switch of GFPT expression and indeed partial differentiation of AN3-12 cells by LIF removal induced a significant decrease in GFPT2 levels. GFPT1 and AMDHD2 levels were not affected likely due to the early differentiation state. Analysis of published data confirmed that GFPT2 is highly expressed in human ESCs, and abundance decreased during neuronal or myocyte differentiation, indicating a conserved mechanism in human ESCs. Consistent with these findings, intestinal stem cells in <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> likewise express GFPT2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Mattila et al., 2018</xref>). One potential consequence of this metabolic adaptation in ESCs is a higher baseline UDP-GlcNAc concentration compared to cells that use GFPT1 to control the HBP. This increase in UDP-GlcNAc concentration might affect downstream PTMs, which in turn can influence cell signaling. In particular, O-GlcNAc modifications already have been linked to stemness and pluripotency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Constable et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Jang et al., 2012</xref>). Indeed, we detected increased O-GlcNAc levels in mESCs compared to cells utilizing GFPT1 in the HBP. Of note, not only UDP-GlcNAc levels but also the two essential enzymes for O-GlcNAc cycling OGA/OGT where significantly increased in mESCs, indicating a multilayered mechanism of maintaining high O-GlcNAc levels in mESCs. Additional significance of an ESC-specific HBP configuration might come from an adaptation to their special nutrient and energy requirements. ESCs show a specialized metabolic profile that likely affect the concentrations of GFPT substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Intlekofer and Finley, 2019</xref>). The kinetic properties of GFPT2 might reflect an adaption to substrate availability in ESCs. Consistently, GFPT2 is also upregulated in other rapidly proliferating cells with similar metabolic profiles, like in various types of cancer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Oikari et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Shaul et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Zhang et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Szymura et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Taken together, we identify AMDHD2 as a novel essential gene in embryonic development and describe a cell type-specific role of AMDHD2 acting in tandem with GFPT2 to regulate the HBP in ESCs. Tuning HBP metabolic activity is relevant in cellular stress resistance, oncogenic transformation, growth, and in age-related diseases as cancer, diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, or neurodegenerative diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Marshall et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Oikari et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Arnold et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Champattanachai et al., 2007</xref>). Of note, eukaryotic AMDHD2 was barely characterized and the identification of its critical role in HBP regulation paves the way for novel approaches to tackle age-associated pathologies, among other potential interventions. Our work advances the understanding of HBP control and provides specific means to beneficially affect these processes in the future.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cell lines and culture conditions</title><p>AN3-12 mouse embryonic haploid stem cells were cultured as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Elling et al., 2011</xref>).

In other words, it addresses multiple different aspects, e.g. the HBP, UDP-GlcNAc-dependent glycosylation events, previous work leading up to the publications, without getting to the core of what the paper is about. Both GFAT1 and GFAT2 should be discussed, including known differential expression data on the latter. A clear rationale for the screen should be given. The section describing the steps of the HBP (second paragraph) is missing a lot of references, which must be added.</p><p>Figure 1 C:</p><p>The authors need to show the full western blot for their new AMDHD2 antibody – not just the AMDHD2 band. Otherwise, the reader is unable to assess the amount of non-specific binding by the antibody. Furthermore, the authors should test this antibody in cell lines derived from multiple species (e.g. Rat PC-12, Mouse N2A, Human SH SY5Y) so the reader is aware of the potential for this antibody to react with AMDHD2 homologs from different species. Can the antibody be used for IP or IF? Has this been tested?</p><p>Figure 1 D:</p><p>The authors should include a rescue experiment, where AMDHD2 KO's are transfected with AMDHD2. If the number of live cells is subsequently reduced to control levels, then it is acceptable to conclude that the increase in cell survival is due to the AMDHD2 KO, and not non-specific mutagenesis of another gene by CRISPR-Cas9.</p><p>Figure 1 G:</p><p>There are two controls that should be added here to confirm that AMDHD2 KO is the sole reason for TM resistance (and the up-regulated UDP-GlcNAc levels). Firstly, as for Figure 1 D, the authors need to transfect their AMDHD2 KOs with AMDHD2 and measure UDP-GlcNAc levels, to confirm that it is the KO of AMDHD2 that is causing the up-regulated UDP-GlcNAc levels. Secondly, UDP-GlcNAc levels in the TM resistant clones should be compared to the AMDHD2 KO. If UDP-GlcNAc levels in the TM resistant clones are higher, this contradicts the authors' assertion that TM-resistance is solely due to AMDHD2 LOF.</p><p>Figure 1 —figure supplement 1:</p><p>In part (a), the authors only assess cell viability in duplicate. Plotting error bars from duplicate measurements is not statistically sound, and this experiment should be done at least in triplicate, and given these are fairly routine assays having 6 independent measurements would be desirable. As for Figure 1 G, the authors need to confirm cell survival and UDP-GlcNAc levels in the same experiment, and plot the associated data as a single plot with the associated statistics.</p><p>Figure 2 B:</p><p>The authors need to show statistical significance on their graphs. In the text, the authors state that NiCl2 and CoCl2 &quot;restored and even increased the AMDHD2 activity&quot;. The authors need to show whether the differences between control and EDTA + NiCl2/ CoCl2 are statistically significant, and display this on the graph.</p><p>A comment of the AMDHD2 heterozygote KO mice:</p><p>The authors state that &quot;no obvious phenotype&quot; was observed. In the interests of transparency, the authors should provide the negative data and associated behavioural assays and/or anatomical measurements used to arrive at this conclusion.</p><p>Figure 2:</p><p>The authors state that AMDHD2 is an &quot;obligate dimer&quot;, and there are two points of feedback here.</p><p>1) The term &quot;obligate dimer&quot; specifically refers to proteins that must be dimers in order to either remain soluble or catalytically active. The authors report that AMDHD2 monomers form during SEC, indicating AMDHD2 folding is not dependent on dimerization.</p><p>2) The authors do not provide in vitro data showing the monomer is catalytically inactive – this is inferred from the crystal structure. Can the authors express a rational mutation of AMDHD2, where the dimer cannot form, and display its' catalytic inactivity in vitro? It could alternatively be hypothesised that AMDHD2 monomers display reduced, but not abolished, catalytic activity.</p><p>An alternative here might be to tone down the conclusions and suggest that these data are compatible with it being an obligate dimer.</p><p>Figure 3 A:</p><p>The authors should provide Coomassie stained gels including the pellet fractions for each constructs' expression, to clearly show accumulation of insoluble AMDHD2 mutations in the insoluble fraction.</p><p>Also, have the authors performed thermal shift assays (e.g. thermofluor) for the I38T and G256R mutants? These mutations are present in the soluble fraction following induction, and reduced stability in a thermofluor assay would support their assertion that protein folding is impaired.</p><p>Just because a missense variant of an enzyme cannot be expressed, does not mean that the mutation causes protein unfolding/ insolubility. Frequently, even catalytically inactive (rational, structural guided) mutants of enzymes prove harder to express and solubilise than their WT equivalents, even though the mutation itself does not impair protein folding. Have the authors tried any additional experiments to confirm the mutations reduce protein stability/ solubility?</p><p>Figure 4 A:</p><p>Why do the authors only use n = 2? This is statistically improper. Indeed, throughout the figure the n values are inconsistent (for example, in 4 H, n = 4 for a similar RT-qPCR experiment). The authors must include an extra biological replicate in Figure 4 A. This applies to all other figures in the paper – the same number of independent observations (and ideally, &gt;= 6) should be used when comparing experiments.</p><p>Figure 4 B:</p><p>The usage of recombinant hGAFT1 and 2 as standards is not useful here. In both cases, GFAT1 and GFAT2 signals from the cell lines samples are either significantly higher (GFAT2) or lower (GFAT1) than the standards used. This makes any comparison useless, as it is not clear what the concentration : signal relationship is for GFAT<sub>1/2</sub> during western blotting, and calibration is not possible. This should either be repeated with a range of standards where the GFAT<sub>1/2</sub> signals lie within the standard range.</p><p>There is a mouse monoclonal antibody for GFAT1 commercially available. Why didn't the authors just compare GFAT1 and GFAT2 in the same blot by using the rabbit GFAT2 and mouse GFAT1 antibody followed by multiplexing using secondaries conjugated to different fluorophores?</p><p>Figure 4 D:</p><p>Was there a specific reason the authors chose to KO AMDHD2 in N2A cells, and not C2C12 or myoblasts? Ideally, the authors should KO AMDHD2 in all the previously used cell lines and measure UDP-GlcNAc levels in all KOs. If UDP-GlcNAc levels are not elevated in C2C12 and myoblast cells (where GFAT1 is predominant), this adds extra strength to their proposed model.</p><p>Figure 4 —figure supplement 4:</p><p>The authors do not quantify their western blot signals, nor do they carry out their analysis of O-GlcNAc levels in triplicate. Both should be done in light of the fact that protein loading is uneven between different lanes.</p><p>Also, E14 mESCs seem to have O-GlcNAc levels that are comparable to N2A and C2C12 cells. This contradicts the authors assertion that O-GlcNAc levels are higher due to reduced feedback inhibition of GFAT2. Importantly, differences in O-GlcNAc levels could be due to different levels of OGT and OGA, and completely independent of the GFAT1/GFAT2 ratio. The authors need to address whether OGT/OGA levels are different in these cell lines, and whether this is the reason why O-GlcNAc levels are different between cell lines.</p><p>A comment on the proposed GFAT2 / AMDHD2 model:</p><p>To completely convince the reader that AMDHD2 only acts to regulate GFAT2 activity, and not GFAT1 activity, extra experiments are required. Can the authors knock down GFAT2 in mESCs, followed by transfection with GFAT1 in WT and AMDHD2 KO cells? If UDP-GlcNAc levels are still elevated in AMDHD2 KO cells, this means that AMDHD2 is not counteracting GFAT<sub>1/2</sub> activity (as you would expect GFAT1 to be feedback inhibited by UDP-GlcNAc). In WT cells, if you knock-down GFAT2 and transfect with GFAT1, UDP-GlcNAc levels should be lower than control cells (as AMDHD2 is still expressed and active, and GFAT1 is feedback inhibited by UDP-GlcNAc). This experiment would support that AMDHD2 is indeed acting to counter GFAT2 activity in pluripotent stem cells, and that this is only necessary for GFAT2 and not GFAT1.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.69223.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>Introduction:</p><p>The introduction, while informative, is &quot;scattergun&quot;.

We provide a full Western blot in the source data, which confirms the specificity of the antibody: we detect only one specific band in four distinct murine cell lines (AN3-12 mESC, E14 mESCs, N2a cells, C2C12 cells)(Figure 5-source data 10-11). Moreover, we tested the AMDHD2 antibody in a human cell line (H9 hESCs), and detect an additional band, which is in accordance with a human-specific AMDHD2 isoform of about 63 kDa (https://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/Q9Y303).</p><p>In addition, we performed a pulldown experiment with the newly generated antibody in WT and AMDHD2 KO mESCs to corroborate its specificity (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref>). We compared beads coupled to the AMDHD2 antibody (+AB) to beads without coupling to the AB (-AB) to exclude unspecific binding of proteins to the beads. Indeed, we were able to enrich for AMDHD2 protein in the eluate of WT cells but not of AMDHD2 KO cells, which serves as a negative control, confirming the high specificity of the AMDHD2 antibody.</p><fig id="sa2fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-69223-sa2-fig1-v3.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 1 D:</p><p>The authors should include a rescue experiment, where AMDHD2 KO's are transfected with AMDHD2.

In order to address this point, we generated mESC lines stably transfected with FLAG-HA-hAMDHD2 in the WT and in the AMDHD2 KO background. As a control, in parallel we generated cells stably expressing FLAG-HA-hAMDHD2 D294A. In bacteria, this is an inactive mutant<sup>3</sup> and we show for the first time that it also abolishes activity in human AMDHD2. Loss of activity was confirmed in Figure 4C. In line with our model, expression of mutant AMDHD2 D294A did not alter cell viability of AMDHD2 disrupted cells. In contrast, overexpression of WT FLAG-HA-hAMDHD2 indeed results in a significant rescue in the AMDHD2 KO line, decreasing cell viability in a TM resistance assay, while no effect was observed in WT cells (Figure 2D). In accordance, we observed a similar pattern when we measured UDP-GlcNAc levels (Figure 2C). The missing full rescue to WT levels despite the high rate of overexpression could be caused by differences of human vs. mouse AMDHD2 (although 90% conservation, see alignment Figure 3—figure supplement 8). Additionally, we cannot exclude that the N-terminal tag might disturb enzyme functionality in vivo.</p><p>However, we can exclude non-specific effects by the mutagenesis of other loci during CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing, since we analyzed 3 independent AMDHD2 KO lines that were generated using different combinations of target guides. All show similar tunicamycin resistance and UDP-GlcNAc levels (Figure 1E, Figure 1—figure supplement 1D, Figure 2B, Figure 2—figure supplement 1).</p><p>Together the new rescue data as well as the use of three independent AMDHD2 KO lines, generated with different guide combinations, with a similar phenotype, confirm the phenotype’s dependence on AMDHD2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 1 G:</p><p>There are two controls that should be added here to confirm that AMDHD2 KO is the sole reason for TM resistance (and the up-regulated UDP-GlcNAc levels).

Unfortunately, the initial clones from our ENU screen were not available to perform further experiments. However, it is worth pointing out that we generally avoid performing additional follow up work in the original ENU-generated cells, as these carry up to 100 additional SNPs that might affect protein function. After the first identification of AMDHD2 as a candidate by sequencing, it was therefore much better to target the locus specifically by CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing and then do follow up work in this clean cell line. It is these cells that establish a role of AMDHD2 in the HBP of mESCs.</p><p>Second, to further corroborate our data we performed an additional insertional mutagenesis screen. In this screen, that is based on a gene trapping method, 20% of all tested TM resistant clones showed an insertion in AMDHD2. Four independent clones derived from this screen showed similar TM resistance and UDP-HexNAc levels as CRISPR/Cas9 generated AMDHD2 KO cells (Figure 2B, Figure 2—figure supplement 1).</p><p>Together, these data provide evidence that AMDHD2 is the sole cause for elevated HBP flux, mediating TM resistance.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 1 —figure supplement 1:</p><p>In part (a), the authors only assess cell viability in duplicate. Plotting error bars from duplicate measurements is not statistically sound, and this experiment should be done at least in triplicate, and given these are fairly routine assays having 6 independent measurements would be desirable. As for Figure 1 G, the authors need to confirm cell survival and UDP-GlcNAc levels in the same experiment, and plot the associated data as a single plot with the associated statistics.</p></disp-quote><p>As discussed in the comment for Figure 1G, the initial clones from our ENU screen were not available to perform further replicates. To avoid confusion, we removed the error bars and only display the data of one representative experiment (Figure1—figure supplement 1A).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 2 B:</p><p>The authors need to show statistical significance on their graphs.

We implemented these and rephrased our manuscript to “Both CoCl2 and ZnCl2 restored and ZnCl2 even increased the AMDHD2 activity (Figure 3B).”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>A comment of the AMDHD2 heterozygote KO mice:</p><p>The authors state that &quot;no obvious phenotype&quot; was observed.

As of now, we did not perform further experiments such as behavioral, anatomical, histological or molecular analyses. A detailed analysis of a conditional AMDHD2 KO mouse is planned for future experiments but not focus of this study. To be transparent with our data, we rephrased the manuscript to “Heterozygous animals however, did not show any macroscopic changes, although further analysis is still missing and alterations on a behavioral, anatomical, histological or molecular level cannot be excluded.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 2:</p><p>The authors state that AMDHD2 is an &quot;obligate dimer&quot;, and there are two points of feedback here.</p><p>1) The term &quot;obligate dimer&quot; specifically refers to proteins that must be dimers in order to either remain soluble or catalytically active. The authors report that AMDHD2 monomers form during SEC, indicating AMDHD2 folding is not dependent on dimerization.</p><p>2) The authors do not provide in vitro data showing the monomer is catalytically inactive – this is inferred from the crystal structure. Can the authors express a rational mutation of AMDHD2, where the dimer cannot form, and display its' catalytic inactivity in vitro? It could alternatively be hypothesised that AMDHD2 monomers display reduced, but not abolished, catalytic activity.</p><p>An alternative here might be to tone down the conclusions and suggest that these data are compatible with it being an obligate dimer.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this nice suggestion! As part of the revision process, we generated three mutants to further analyze the role of dimerization for AMDHD2’s catalytic activity and characterized them in analytical size-exclusion chromatography measurements and activity assays (new Figures 3 F-I). Ile280 is located at the dimer interface and we introduced Glu and Arg side chains to disrupt dimerization (Figure 3F). We confirmed by analytical size-exclusion chromatography that the dimer cannot form in the I280E and I280R mutants (Figure 3 G,H). Indeed, the mutants I280E and I280R completely lose catalytic activity in activity assays (Figure 3I) showing that AMDHD2 forms an obligate dimer. Two side chains, His242 and Arg243, are of particular interest in this dimerization, because they mediate interactions from one monomer to the active site at the other monomer and are involved in the phosphate binding of the sugar (Figure 3E). Therefore, we generated a double mutant H242A/R243A, whose dimerization seemed not to be disturbed according to analytical size-exclusion chromatography measurements (Figure 3G,H). Interestingly, also this mutant showed no activity in our in vitro assay, indicating an essential role of those two residues for the catalytic activity of AMDHD2.</p><p>In the first version of the manuscript, we included a representative chromatogram of a preparative size-exclusion chromatography from the wildtype protein, which corresponded to a monomeric AMDHD2 and showed a dynamic light scattering measurement, which corresponded to a dimeric protein. Based on this, we speculated that the dimer might not be very stable. Because the new analytical size-exclusion chromatography measurements were much more accurate than our previous preparative size-exclusion chromatography, we decided to exclude the previous SEC chromatogram (previous Figure 2—figure supplement 3A) and re-phrased our manuscript accordingly.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 3 A:</p><p>The authors should provide Coomassie stained gels including the pellet fractions for each constructs' expression, to clearly show accumulation of insoluble AMDHD2 mutations in the insoluble fraction.</p></disp-quote><p>Prompted by the reviewers comment we repeated the test expressions for the AMDHD2 loss-of-function mutants, which showed a reduced solubility in the first version of the manuscript and included now the new Figure 4 —figure supplement 1, showing Coomassie stained gels including the pellet fractions of insoluble AMDHD2. AMDHD2 G265R, which was previously observed to be partially soluble was more difficult to express during the revision experiments. However, we stated before “Also, the I38T and G265R substitutions reduced soluble expression, indicating disturbed protein folding” and our new data support this conclusion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Also, have the authors performed thermal shift assays (e.g. thermofluor) for the I38T and G256R mutants? These mutations are present in the soluble fraction following induction, and reduced stability in a thermofluor assay would support their assertion that protein folding is impaired.</p><p>Just because a missense variant of an enzyme cannot be expressed, does not mean that the mutation causes protein unfolding/ insolubility. Frequently, even catalytically inactive (rational, structural guided) mutants of enzymes prove harder to express and solubilise than their WT equivalents, even though the mutation itself does not impair protein folding. Have the authors tried any additional experiments to confirm the mutations reduce protein stability/ solubility?</p></disp-quote><p>We fully agree with the reviewer that additional data supporting a reduced stability of our mutants would strengthen our manuscript. We now performed these thermal shift assays (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig2">Author response image 2</xref>) and find a reduced stability for the catalytic inactive mutants T185A and G265R. A destabilization in the T185A could be explained by its close proximity to the Zn2+ co-factor, which stabilizes AMDHD2. The replacement of Gly by Arg in G265R might be incompatible with the tertiary structure. The stability of I38T and the known inactive D294A mutant was not affected in these thermal shift assays.</p><fig id="sa2fig2" position="float"><label>Author response image 2.</label><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-69223-sa2-fig2-v3.tif"/></fig><p>However, we were concerned about the informative value from these measurements, because the thermal shift assay most likely reflects the unfolding of the bigger deacetylase domain of AMDHD2. I38T is located in the DUF domain, which is smaller as the deacetylase domain and formed by residues of the N- and C-terminus (Figure 3—figure supplement 8). Therefore, the unfolding of the DUF domain might be dependent on the unfolding of the deacetylase domain or the DUF domain unfolding might be masked by the fluorescence signal of the bigger deacetylase domain. Given these concerns, we decided to exclude the thermal shift assays from the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 4 A:</p><p>Why do the authors only use n = 2? This is statistically improper. Indeed, throughout the figure the n values are inconsistent (for example, in 4 H, n = 4 for a similar RT-qPCR experiment). The authors must include an extra biological replicate in Figure 4 A. This applies to all other figures in the paper – the same number of independent observations (and ideally, &gt;= 6) should be used when comparing experiments.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer and increased the number of replicates accordingly. We replaced the graph with new measurements repeated in a set of n=4 (Figure 5A).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 4 B:</p><p>The usage of recombinant hGAFT1 and 2 as standards is not useful here. In both cases, GFAT1 and GFAT2 signals from the cell lines samples are either significantly higher (GFAT2) or lower (GFAT1) than the standards used. This makes any comparison useless, as it is not clear what the concentration : signal relationship is for GFAT<sub>1/2</sub> during western blotting, and calibration is not possible. This should either be repeated with a range of standards where the GFAT<sub>1/2</sub> signals lie within the standard range.</p><p>There is a mouse monoclonal antibody for GFAT1 commercially available. Why didn't the authors just compare GFAT1 and GFAT2 in the same blot by using the rabbit GFAT2 and mouse GFAT1 antibody followed by multiplexing using secondaries conjugated to different fluorophores?</p></disp-quote><p>Indeed, the protein concentrations of GFPT<sub>1/2</sub> of our cell lysates are not within the range of the used standards of purified human protein. However, we do not use the curve to quantify the absolute amount of protein within our lysates but rather just give an indication of the approximal protein amount. We removed these lanes and only show the band for 10ng of pure hGFPT<sub>1/2</sub> as a standard (Figure 5B). We highly appreciate the reviewer’s suggestion to detect both GFPT signals on one membrane. However, the use of both antibodies on one membrane is not required, since the comparison between the tested cell lines on each membrane respectively is sufficient to confirm the higher abundance of GFPT2 and lower abundance of GFPT1 in mESCs compared to the other cell lines.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 4 D:</p><p>Was there a specific reason the authors chose to KO AMDHD2 in N2A cells, and not C2C12 or myoblasts? Ideally, the authors should KO AMDHD2 in all the previously used cell lines and measure UDP-GlcNAc levels in all KOs. If UDP-GlcNAc levels are not elevated in C2C12 and myoblast cells (where GFAT1 is predominant), this adds extra strength to their proposed model.</p></disp-quote><p>In our previous work in N2a cells, we confirmed a conserved mechanism of HBP activation by GlcNAc supplementation and by introducing the G451E gain-of-function substitution into GFPT1 that was identified in a previous TM resistance screen in <italic>C. elegans</italic><sup>4-6</sup>. Based on this knowledge and the already existing GFPT1 gain-of-function cell line, we considered the N2a cell line as a suitable model for further investigation of the HBP regulation.</p><p>However, we fully agree with the reviewer’s comment and generated two AMDHD2 KO lines in the C2C12 myoblasts. In accordance with our model, UDP-GlcNAc measurements revealed no significant increase in the AMDHD2 KO cells compared to the WT control (Figure 5—figure supplement 2A-B). These data strengthen the hypothesis that AMDHD2 is not as important for regulation of the HBP in cells relying on GFPT1, as in both cell lines (N2a, C2C12) the deletion of AMDHD2 had no significant effect on UDP-GlcNAc levels.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 4 —figure supplement 4:</p><p>The authors do not quantify their western blot signals, nor do they carry out their analysis of O-GlcNAc levels in triplicate. Both should be done in light of the fact that protein loading is uneven between different lanes.</p><p>Also, E14 mESCs seem to have O-GlcNAc levels that are comparable to N2A and C2C12 cells. This contradicts the authors assertion that O-GlcNAc levels are higher due to reduced feedback inhibition of GFAT2. Importantly, differences in O-GlcNAc levels could be due to different levels of OGT and OGA, and completely independent of the GFAT1/GFAT2 ratio. The authors need to address whether OGT/OGA levels are different in these cell lines, and whether this is the reason why O-GlcNAc levels are different between cell lines.</p></disp-quote><p>We highly appreciate this suggestion and have performed additional experiments to address them. We provide now the data of four replicates that reveal a significant decrease in the level of O-GlcNAcylated proteins in N2a and C2C12 cells compared to AN3-12 and E14 mESCs (Figure 5G-H). These data are in accordance with the increased levels of UDP-GlcNAc in mESCs, due to the reduced feedback inhibition of the predominant GFPT2 paralog.</p><p>Moreover, we thank the reviewer for the insightful comment about the O-GlcNAc regulation by OGT and OGA. To address this point, we measured OGT and OGA levels of the different cell lines via Western blot (Figure 5 I-J). We observed a significant reduction in OGT and OGA protein levels in the more differentiated N2a and C2C12 cells, which interestingly coincides with the reduced O-GlcNAc levels.</p><p>As the OGT/OGA ratio is generally thought to determine O-GlcNAcylation levels, we found it noteworthy that the analyzed cells show similar OGT and OGA ratios despite the differences in O-GlcNAc levels. We conclude that indeed the elevated UDP-GlcNAc levels are responsible for O-GlcNAc elevation in mESCs.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>A comment on the proposed GFAT2 / AMDHD2 model:</p><p>To completely convince the reader that AMDHD2 only acts to regulate GFAT2 activity, and not GFAT1 activity, extra experiments are required. Can the authors knock down GFAT2 in mESCs, followed by transfection with GFAT1 in WT and AMDHD2 KO cells? If UDP-GlcNAc levels are still elevated in AMDHD2 KO cells, this means that AMDHD2 is not counteracting GFAT<sub>1/2</sub> activity (as you would expect GFAT1 to be feedback inhibited by UDP-GlcNAc). In WT cells, if you knock-down GFAT2 and transfect with GFAT1, UDP-GlcNAc levels should be lower than control cells (as AMDHD2 is still expressed and active, and GFAT1 is feedback inhibited by UDP-GlcNAc). This experiment would support that AMDHD2 is indeed acting to counter GFAT2 activity in pluripotent stem cells, and that this is only necessary for GFAT2 and not GFAT1.</p></disp-quote><p>In our proposed model AMDHD2 is not only important to regulate GFPT2 activity but is also expressed in cells using GFPT1. Supporting this notion, in cells using GFPT1 the loss of AMDHD2 increases UDP-GlcNAc levels but not significantly (Figure 5D, Figure 5—figure supplement 2B). Moreover, AN3-12 mESCs show a high abundance and constitutive activity of AMDHD2, resulting in a drastic increase of UDP-GlcNAc levels upon loss of AMDHD2.</p><p>Thus, in our model, we describe the following scenarios: in GFPT1 cells, a steady UDP-GlcNAc concentration is achieved by strong product feedback inhibition and an AMDHD2-dependent reverse flux. In GFPT2 cells in contrast, the feedback inhibition is much weaker, resulting in elevated UDP-GlcNAc levels and a stronger reliance on the AMDHD2 reaction (Figure 6E). This configuration enabled identification of AMDHD2 in the initial screen.</p><p>References</p><p>1 Horn, M. et al.
