immunometabolite itaconate. Itaconate is well established to possess immunomodulatory and metabolic effects within myeloid cells and lymphocytes, however, its effects in other organ systems during sepsis remain less clear. Utilizing <italic>Acod1</italic> knockout mice that are deficient in synthesizing itaconate, we aimed to understand the metabolic role of itaconate in the liver and systemically during sepsis. We find itaconate aids in lipid metabolism during sepsis. Specifically, <italic>Acod1</italic> KO mice develop a heightened level of hepatic steatosis when induced with polymicrobial sepsis. Proteomics analysis reveals enhanced expression of enzymes involved in fatty acid oxidation in following 4-octyl itaconate (4-OI) treatment in vitro. Downstream analysis reveals itaconate stabilizes the expression of the mitochondrial fatty acid uptake enzyme CPT1a, mediated by its hypoubiquitination. Chemoproteomic analysis revealed itaconate interacts with proteins involved in protein ubiquitination as a potential mechanism underlying its stabilizing effect on CPT1a. From a systemic perspective, we find itaconate deficiency triggers a hypothermic response following endotoxin stimulation, potentially mediated by brown adipose tissue (BAT) dysfunction. Finally, by use of metabolic cage studies, we demonstrate <italic>Acod1</italic> KO mice rely more heavily on carbohydrates versus fatty acid sources for systemic fuel utilization in response to endotoxin treatment. Our data reveal a novel metabolic role of itaconate in modulating fatty acid oxidation during polymicrobial sepsis.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>itaconate</kwd><kwd>inflammation</kwd><kwd>fatty acid oxidation</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100008478</institution-id><institution>Wake Forest School of Medicine</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Start-Up Funds</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Quinn</surname><given-names>Matthew A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000054</institution-id><institution>National Cancer Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P30CA012197</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Furdui</surname><given-names>Cristina</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>T32GM127261</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mainali</surname><given-names>Rabina</given-names></name><name><surname>Furdui</surname><given-names>Cristina</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Proteomic-based discovery of a novel mechanism of action affording anti-steatotic properties of itaconate through stabilization of fatty acid oxidation enzyme protein abundance.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Sepsis is described as a life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by a dysregulated host response to infections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Singer et al., 2016</xref>). Our understanding of sepsis has shifted to incorporate metabolic dysfunction as a central component of its pathogenesis. Inflammation-driven metabolic reprogramming and its consequences in the immune compartment have been investigated extensively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hu et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arner and Rathmell, 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Mohammadnezhad et al., 2022</xref>). However, our understanding of metabolic derangements in central organs like the liver is limited. We have previously shown the liver is a target for profound transcriptional and metabolic remodeling in response to polymicrobial sepsis. Specifically, we observe an alteration in mitochondrial function, TCA cycle remodeling, and hepatic lipid accumulation following sepsis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Mainali et al., 2021</xref>). Additionally, we have extended these findings to show that hepatic metabolic dysregulation contributes to altered systemic metabolism during sepsis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Oh et al., 2022</xref>). Our previous work is consistent with human studies indicating hepatic steatosis is induced during sepsis and an independent predictor of 30 day mortality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hou et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Koskinas et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Guirgis et al., 2021</xref>). Furthermore, inhibition of the master lipid sensor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARα) within hepatocytes exacerbates sepsis-induced pathology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Paumelle et al., 2019</xref>). Collectively, these studies highlight the essential role of hepatic lipid metabolism in maintaining organismal adaptations to sepsis. However, molecular regulators coordinating hepatic metabolic responses to sepsis remain largely unknown.</p><p>Immune response and metabolic alterations are coupled during inflammation. Of particular interest, is the extensive reprogramming of mitochondrial metabolism in cells of myeloid lineage favoring the production of metabolites with immunomodulatory properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Zuo and Wan, 2019</xref>). Itaconate is one such metabolite produced by the decarboxylation of cis-aconitate via aconitase decarboxylase 1 (Acod1), also known as immuno-responsive gene 1 (Irg1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bentley and Thiessen, 1957</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bonnarme et al., 1995</xref>). Numerous studies have shown itaconate exerts anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative effects via multiple mechanisms including the induction of Nrf2<sup>14</sup> and ATF3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bambouskova et al., 2018</xref>), as well as inhibition of succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lampropoulou et al., 2016</xref>), NLRP3 inflammasome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hooftman et al., 2020</xref>), glycolysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Peace and O’Neill, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Liao et al., 2019</xref>). Additionally, the therapeutic potential of itaconate derivatives has shown promise in a variety of pre-clinical models of inflammatory diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Peace and O’Neill, 2022</xref>).</p><p>While studies have focused on the role of itaconate’s within the immune compartment, its role in metabolically active tissues such as the liver is less defined. We have previously demonstrated sepsis elicits significant accumulation of itaconate within hepatocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Mainali et al., 2021</xref>). Utilizing <italic>Acod1</italic> knockout mice we aimed to address the effects of itaconate on hepatic and systemic metabolism in response to polymicrobial sepsis.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title><italic>Acod1</italic> deficiency exacerbates hepatic lipid accumulation during sepsis</title><p>We have previously reported sepsis induces a state of hepatic steatosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Mainali et al., 2021</xref>). Given itaconate accumulates within hepatocytes during sepsis and previous reports demonstrating the ability of itaconate to modulate lipid metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Frieler et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Li et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hall et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chu et al., 2022</xref>), we sought to determine its role, if any, in altering the course of steatosis during sepsis. To achieve this, we subjected 8–10 weeks old male C57BL/6NJ (WT) and C57BL/6NJ-<italic>Acod1<sup>em1(IMPC)J</sup></italic>/J (<italic>Acod1</italic> KO) to sepsis via cecal slurry injection for 24 hr as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gong and Wen, 2019</xref>). To further investigate the role of itaconate in modulating hepatic lipid homeostasis during sepsis, we first evaluated the level of triglyceride accumulation. Consistent with our previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Mainali et al., 2021</xref>), we find sepsis-induced hepatic lipid accumulation as shown by increased oil red O staining and quantification in WT mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a–b</xref>). Remarkably, septic <italic>Acod1</italic> KO mice exhibited enhanced lipid droplet accumulation and significantly higher triglyceride levels compared to WT littermates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a–b</xref>). Given the aberrant steatosis observed in response to <italic>Acod1</italic> deficiency in male mice, we next evaluated if inflammation drives the development of hepatic steatosis in a sex-dependent manner. Parallel to male mice, female <italic>Acod1</italic> KO mice injected with endotoxin exhibited a higher degree of lipid droplet accumulation compared to endotoxin-treated WT littermates as demonstrated by enhanced BODIY staining in liver sections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Next, we determined if itaconate is directly modulating hepatocyte lipid metabolism or our observed phenotype is driven by secondary effects such as hyperinflammation as previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lampropoulou et al., 2016</xref>). To achieve this, we employed an in vitro model of steatosis via oleate loading in AML12 cells and primary hepatocytes. Utilizing the cell-permeable itaconate derivative, 4-octyl itaconate (4-OI), we find that both primary hepatocytes and AML12 cells pretreated with 4-OI (250 μM) demonstrate lower oleate-induced lipid droplet formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>). Taken together, our data demonstrate itaconate acts as an anti-steatotic metabolite within the liver both in vivo and in vitro.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title><italic>Aconitase decarboxylase 1</italic> (<italic>Acod1)</italic> deficiency exacerbates hepatic lipid accumulation during sepsis.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Oil red O staining of liver sections of wild-type (WT) and <italic>Acod1</italic> KO control and cecal slurry (CS) injected mice (5 μl/kg).

To gain mechanistic insight into the anti-steatotic effects of itaconate, we performed discovery-based untargeted proteomic analysis of AML12 cells treated with 4-OI for 24 hr. Analysis of our proteomic data indicated significant regulation of several pathways related to lipid metabolism by 4-OI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>). Notably, we find enhanced expression of proteins involved with oxidative phosphorylation such as COX7A2L, ATPAF1, NDUFAB1, as well as the fatty acid β-oxidation enzymes ACSL3-5, CPT1a, CPT2, and ACAA2 following 4-OI stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>). Enhanced expression of CPT1a, CPT2, and SLC25a20 were verified in independent experiments via western blot analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref>). Given the stimulatory effect of 4-OI on carnitine shuttle enzyme expression, we hypothesized loss of endogenous itaconate during inflammatory settings would result in impaired expression. Assessing the protein expression of these enzymes in endotoxin-treated WT and <italic>Acod1</italic> KO mice revealed loss of <italic>Acod1</italic> significantly decreased the expression of CPT1a, CPT2, and SLC25a20 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d</xref>). These data reveal a stimulatory effect of 4-OI and endogenous itaconate on the expression of carnitine transport enzymes within hepatocytes. Lastly, we investigated whether the regulation of CPT1a by itaconate is linked to its anti-steatotic effects. We repeated the lipid loading experiment, however, this time we inhibited CPT1a via pharmacological inhibition with etomoxir. We find etomoxir treatment reverses the anti-steatotic effects of 4-OI resulting in lipid droplet formation similar to oleate-loaded control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2e</xref>). Collectively, our data demonstrates upregulation of β-oxidation enzymes in response to itaconate, which affords, at least in part, its anti-steatotic effects.</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>4-octyl itaconate (4-OI) promotes mitochondrial fatty acid uptake and clearance.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Pathway analysis of significantly altered proteins from global proteomics of AML12 cells stimulated with 4-OI for 24 hr. n=5 biological replicates per group.

Therefore, we aimed to determine the mechanism underlying this upregulation. Initially, we assessed transcript levels of CPT1a, CPT2, and SLC25a20 in AML12 cells stimulated with 4-OI. We find very modest induction of these genes, however, not to the extent we observe at the protein level. Furthermore, gene expression of these enzymes in liver lysates of endotoxin-stimulated WT and <italic>Acod1</italic> KO mice do not support the repression we observe in vivo (Data not shown). These data indicate itaconate may upregulate the expression of these enzymes at the post-translational level. Increased protein expression can be conferred through enhancing protein stability. Therefore, we first tested the stability of CPT1a in response to 4-OI stimulation in the presence of the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide (CHX). CPT1a displayed a prolonged half-life of about 24 hr in vehicle-treated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>). In contrast, stimulation with 4-OI significantly extended the half-life of CPT1a protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>). The stability of proteins is regulated at the post-translational level through activation of the ubiquitin system. Activation of E1-E3 ubiquitin ligases leads to ubiquitination of target substrates and subsequent proteasomal degradation. Given the extended half-life of CPT1a in the presence of 4-OI, we sought to determine if this is mediated via alterations in its ubiquitination status. To achieve this, we immunoprecipitated CPT1a in vehicle and 4-OI-stimulated cells in the presence of proteasome inhibitor MG132. Immunoprecipitation of CPT1a and subsequent western blotting of ubiquitin revealed little to no ubiquitination in both vehicle and 4-OI treated groups in the absence of MG132 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>). However, in the presence of MG132 we observe robust polyubiquitination of CPT1a in the vehicle-treated group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>). In contrast, 4-OI stimulation drastically reduced levels of CPT1a polyubiquitination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>). Taken together, our data indicate 4-OI interferes with CPT1a ubiquitination promoting its stabilization.</p><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>4-octyl itaconate (4-OI) stabilizes CPT1a protein expression.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Western blot and quantification of CPT1a in AML12 cells that were pretreated with vehicle or 4-OI for 24 hr, then stimulated with cycloheximide (CHX).

Given the highly nucleophilic nature of thiol sidechains, they can participate in Michael’s reaction and undergo conjugation with molecules like itaconate that have an electrophilic α,β−unsaturated carboxylic acid to form adducts. Given that itaconate and its derivatives have been shown to modulate biological function via the alkylation of numerous proteins, we next tested the hypothesis that itaconate interacts with CPT1a and hinders ubiquitination. This is based on previous reports in macrophages in which CPT1a was shown to interact with itaconate via the biorthogonal probe iTalk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Qin et al., 2020</xref>). To determine initially if itaconate interacts with the hepatic proteome we labeled AML12 cells with iTalk for 4 hr followed by a click reaction to an azide-rhodamine probe. In-gel fluorescence of both Raw Macrophages and AML12 cells treated with iTalk display a banding pattern compared to vehicle-treated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c</xref>). Additionally, pre-treatment with the competitive inhibitor 4-OI blocks this banding pattern, indicating the specificity of the iTalk probe for itaconation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c</xref>). These data indicate that hepatic proteins are indeed subject to itaconation. Next, we performed iTalk labeling in AML12 cells followed by subsequent azide-agarose click reaction to allow for mass spectrometry identification of hepatic itaconated proteins. We identified 123 proteins that had ≥1.5 fold enrichment over vehicle-treated cells. We initially surveyed the hepatic itaconated proteins to determine if CPT1a was enriched. Contrary to our hypothesis and previous reports, we did not identify CPT1a as a hepatic itaconation substrate. Therefore, we next performed pathway analysis to gain insight into biological pathways that may afford itaconate’s ability to stabilize CPT1a protein. Consistent with previous reports, we find enrichment in proteins involved in glutathionylation and NRF2-mediated oxidative signaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3d</xref>). Additionally, we found proteins involved in protein ubiquitination to show enrichment in the itaconation group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3d</xref>). These proteins range from E1-E3 ubiquitin ligases as well as various components of the proteasome and ubiquitin peptidases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3d</xref>). Identification of these components involved in proteasomal turnover of proteins within the liver is the first to our knowledge to be demonstrated. We hypothesize itaconation of ubiquitin ligases and proteasome components may confer the stabilizing effects of itaconate on CPT1a.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title><italic>Acod1</italic> deficiency impairs the thermogenic program during sepsis</title><p>Apart from the liver, adipose tissues also play a central role in the maintenance of whole-body energy homeostasis.

Therefore, given the importance of thermogenesis during sepsis and our findings that <italic>Acod1</italic> deficiency impairs hepatic β-oxidation, we endeavored to determine if this has effects on BAT function. We assessed core body temperature in response to an endotoxin challenge in WT and <italic>Acod1</italic> KO mice.

We find <italic>Acod1</italic> KO mice have a significantly more dramatic drop in body temperature following LPS treatment compared to their WT littermates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref>). Next, we aimed to characterize potential mechanism underlying the hypothermic phenotype in <italic>Acod1</italic> KO mice. To this end, we assessed the protein expression of UCP1.

Lastly, we demonstrate systemic defects in lipid metabolism and thermogenesis in itaconate-deficient mice following the endotoxin challenge. These studies extend our understanding of itaconate as a metabolic regulator in response to inflammation.</p><p>Mitochondrial bioenergetics and metabolic reprogramming play a crucial role in promoting both immune and non-immune changes in response to inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Mainali et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Weinberg et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Choi et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Paumelle et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chouchani and Kajimura, 2019</xref>). Furthermore, metabolic dysregulation in the context of sepsis can profoundly contribute to impaired lipid metabolism, which can enhance sepsis severity and mortality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Oh et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Amunugama et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Sharma et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Barker et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Mainali et al., 2021</xref>). We previously demonstrated sepsis elicits a systemic increase in fatty acid mobilization and utilization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Mainali et al., 2021</xref>), which supports a systemic shift in fuel preference from glucose to fatty acid oxidation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Oh et al., 2022</xref>). Additionally, we have shown sepsis induces dyslipidemia, which in turn promotes the development of hepatic steatosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Oh et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Mainali et al., 2021</xref>). While the exact mechanisms driving alterations of hepatic lipid metabolism during inflammation are not fully understood, dysregulation of hepatic PPARα signaling has been implicated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Paumelle et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lewis et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Van Wyngene et al., 2020</xref>).

Our data identifies itaconate as a novel pathway for the regulation of hepatic lipid metabolism during sepsis.</p><p>The role of itaconate in modulating fatty acid oxidation is becoming more appreciated. Several previous studies have demonstrated itaconate promotes β-oxidation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hall et al., 2013</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Weiss et al., 2018</xref>). Our studies demonstrate itaconate protects against aberrant hepatic steatosis during sepsis. Furthermore, we identify the β-oxidation pathway as a target of itaconate. Interestingly, <italic>Acod1</italic> KO mice have been shown to have decreased fatty acid oxidation and enhanced glucose oxidation compared to wild-type mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Frieler et al., 2022</xref>). Our data sheds insight into the mechanism by which this may be afforded. Specifically, the modulation of CPT1a and other carnitine shuttle enzymes underlies, at least in part, the regulatory role of itaconate on the β-oxidation pathway.</p><p>Previously, it has been reported that itaconate plays a role in regulating the β-oxidation of fatty acids to fuel OXPHOS. This has been observed in various cell types, including hepatocytes from mouse models of NAFDL, tissue-resident macrophages in peritoneal tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Weiss et al., 2018</xref>), macrophages from zebrafish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hall et al., 2013</xref>) as well as T cell subsets Th17- and Treg- polarizing T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Aso et al., 2023</xref>). This is in conjunction with our observations given significant upregulation in proteins governing the β-oxidation and OXPHOS pathway by itaconate. Interestingly, we also observed itaconate regulation of key steps within cholesterol biosynthesis in ALM12 cells when assessing pathways involved in cellular metabolism. We hypothesize this is due to the inactivation of vitamin B<sub>12</sub> by itaconyl-CoA, resulting from itaconate activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cordes and Metallo, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Shen et al., 2017</xref>). This can cause impairment of methionine synthase activity, an enzyme dependent on vitamin B<sub>12</sub>, leading to dysregulation in the conversion of homocysteine to methionine, and ultimately, alterations in the abundance of S-adenosylmethionine (SAM), a methyl donor in numerous biological and biochemical processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Froese et al., 2019</xref>). Interestingly deficiency in B<sub>12</sub> has been found to induce cholesterol biosynthesis by limiting SAM and modulating the methylation of SREBF1 and LDLR genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adaikalakoteswari et al., 2015</xref>). Additionally, alteration in intracellular SAM abundance and reduction in SAM/SAH ratio by itaconate was found to influence TH17 /Treg cell differentiation as a result of tri-methylation of histone H3 protein-induced epigenetic reprogramming (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Aso et al., 2023</xref>). However, the exact mechanism by which itaconate regulates metabolic and epigenetic reprogramming to enhance hepatic cholesterol synthesis is not known and needs to be further investigated given the crucial role of cholesterol in maintaining cellular organization, steroid hormone, bile acids, and vitamin D synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Röhrl and Stangl, 2018</xref>).</p><p>Frieler et al. recently uncovered a protective role of endogenous itaconate in regulating adipocyte metabolism through altering glucose homeostasis, lipolysis, and adipogenesis during HFD-induced obesity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Frieler et al., 2022</xref>). Furthermore, they demonstrated endotoxin induces the expression of <italic>Acod1</italic> in brown adipose tissue (BAT). However, the biological function of inflammation-induced <italic>Acod1</italic> in BAT was not studied. A previous study demonstrated improved body temperature and clinical scores in septic mice upon exogenous 4-OI administration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Mills et al., 2018</xref>). However, the role of endogenous itaconate in modulating body temperature in response to inflammation has yet to be investigated. Our study begins to fill this gap by showing a pro-thermogenic effect of itaconate during an endotoxin challenge. While the mechanism underlying these effects were not investigated in the current study, we show a defect in the primary thermogenic mediator UCP1. Research has demonstrated that inter-organ crosstalk between BAT and the liver is essential to elicit non-shivering thermogenesis. Specifically, BAT utilizes hepatic-derived acylcarnitines released in response to cold stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Simcox et al., 2017</xref>), Intriguingly, these studies demonstrated a reliance on hepatic CPT1 function to mediate cold stress-induced acylcarnitine secretion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Simcox et al., 2017</xref>). Our data demonstrates impaired CPT1a expression in the liver of endotoxin-challenged <italic>Acod1</italic> KO mice. These findings in conjunction with previous literature may provide a potential physiological mechanism by which itaconate deficiency hinders hepatic acylcarnitine production due to impairment in CPT1a expression. Future studies targeting hepatic CPT1a expression in <italic>Acod1</italic> KO mice would uncover causal links between hepatic fatty acid oxidation and thermogenesis in response to endotoxin. This is important, as clinically and in murine models of sepsis, the onset of hypothermia is observed and considered a predictor of mortality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lewis et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kushimoto et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Given its electrophilic properties and its ability to directly alkylate cysteine residues, we initially hypothesized regulation of FAO was driven by enhancement of CPT1a due to its itaconation. Contrary to our hypothesis, proteomic profiling of ITalk substrates in AML12 cells did not reveal CPT1a as a target of itaconation. However, proteomic analysis revealed enrichment of the protein ubiquitination pathway by ITalk. We found this of interest, as this may explain the stabilizing effects of itaconate on CPT1a protein expression. The regulation of protein ubiquitination by itaconate is a mechanism that has been implicated in numerous models of inflammation. The first is the classical upregulation of NRF2 due to the alkylation of cysteine residues of KEAP1<sup>23</sup>, which functions as an adaptor of the Cul3-based ubiquitin E3 ligase complex. This covalent modification promotes the dissociation of KEAP1 from CUL3 to inhibit the conjugation of ubiquitin onto the N-terminal domain of NRF2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Mills et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Yamamoto et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Canning et al., 2015</xref>). Additionally, 4-OI has been shown to negatively regulate osteoclastogenesis and inflammatory response by suppressing E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase HRD1 to activate Nrf2 signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Sun et al., 2019</xref>). However, the mechanism underlying the inhibition of HRD1 by itaconate was not investigated or discussed. Our data extends these findings and indicates an interaction between itaconate and multiple components involved in proteasomal turnover of proteins. Future studies aimed at dissecting the regulatory role of these enzymes in the proteasomal turnover of CPT1a and the anti-steatotic effect of itaconate are warranted.</p><p>Accumulation of itaconate in the mouse liver during sepsis has highlighted the necessity to understand its functional role within this compartment. By endeavoring to uncover the biological role of itaconate in hepatocytes, we have uncovered a novel function of itaconate within the liver and systemically, to aid in fatty acid processing in the face of inflammation. Furthermore, our work identifies a potentially new mechanism of action via the stabilization of CPT1a. Finally, our work has uncovered the systemic effects of endogenous itaconate on metabolic flexibility and thermogenesis in response to inflammation. Overall, these findings suggest that interventions aimed at regulating the <italic>Acod1</italic>/itaconate axis may hold potential therapeutic advantages in regulating dyslipidemia at both the local and systemic levels observed during sepsis. Future work is necessary to understand cellular sources of itaconate, and the role of this immunometabolite in coordinating interorgan crosstalk during sepsis.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals experiments</title><p>Male and female <italic>Acod1</italic> KO and WT littermates aged 8–10 weeks were purchased from The Jackson Laboratory (<italic>Acod1<sup>em1(IMPC)J</sup></italic>/J) (Bar Harbor, ME).

The rationale is that if itaconate is stabilizing fatty acid oxidation, it would be necessary to fuel thermogenesis, a process dependent on fatty acid utilization. Our data support a role for itaconate in stabilizing body temperature following inflammation, potentially through enhanced fatty acid oxidation. This is evidenced by the hypothermic response to LPS in Acod1 KO mice. Furthermore, Mills et al. Nature 2018 show 4-OI injection boosts body temperature following LPS stimulation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2:</bold></p><p>Some conclusions involving the Irg1 knockout mice require important controls and clarifications to be fully convincing and some controls are missing.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the needs for appropriate controls. Negative controls were omitted when baseline phenotypes were not observed. Due to time and resource limitations we were unable to repeat the experiments.</p></body></sub-article></article>
