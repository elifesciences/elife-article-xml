healthy volunteers (150 left-Handers (LH)) of language task-induced asymmetries and intrinsic connectivity strength of the sentence-processing supramodal network, we show that individuals with atypical rightward language lateralization (N = 30, 25 LH) do not rely on an organization that simply mirrors that of typical leftward lateralized individuals. Actually, the resting-state organization in the atypicals showed that their sentence processing was underpinned by left and right networks both wired for language processing and highly interacting by strong interhemispheric intrinsic connectivity and larger corpus callosum volume. Such a loose hemispheric specialization for language permits the hosting of language in either the left and/or right hemisphere as assessed by a very high incidence of dissociations across various language task-induced asymmetries in this group.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>language</kwd><kwd>hemispheric specialization</kwd><kwd>handedness</kwd><kwd>fmri</kwd><kwd>intrinsic connectivity</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001665</institution-id><institution>Agence Nationale de la Recherche</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ANR 16-LCV2-0006-01</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Joliot</surname><given-names>Marc</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Left-hander's atypical language brain organization, revealed by task-induced rightward asymmetry, is underpinned at rest by homotopic networks wired for language bilaterally and strong intrinsic connectivity through a large corpus callosum.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Hemispheric specialization, and more particularly hemispheric specialization for language, can be defined as <italic>“... a hemisphere-dependent relationship between a cognitive, sensory, or motor function and a set of brain structures. It includes both the hosting by a given hemisphere of specialized networks that have unique functional properties and mechanisms that enable the inter-hemispheric coordination necessary for efficient processing&quot;</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hervé et al., 2013</xref>). Major issues on the topic of hemispheric functional segregation have been listed in a recent review article (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Vingerhoets, 2019</xref>). Highlighting the importance of in-depth investigations of individuals exhibiting atypical hemispheric lateralization for language production, several burning questions related to this atypical phenotype were identified including the characterization of its regional pattern, its relationship with handedness, its structural underpinnings, whether such atypicality holds for other cognitive functional phenotypes, and whether it is associated with variations in behavior and/or cognitive abilities.</p><p>To comprehensively understand typical and atypical hemispheric organization for high-order language processing, it is necessary to examine the functional organization of the language network in the dominant hemisphere together with its interhemispheric coordination with the mirroring network in the opposite hemisphere. Such an approach can be completed by integrating different and complementary neuroimaging information provided by resting-state and task-induced activation investigations.</p><p>Task-induced functional asymmetries are reliable markers for assessing individuals’ hemispheric specialization for language, as attested by the very good concordance between fMRI asymmetries measured during language tasks and Wada testing, which is considered the gold standard to measure dominance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dym et al., 2011</xref>). This methodology makes it possible to revisit the incidence of atypical organization in healthy individuals in relationship with handedness. The earliest research on this topic reported that rare individuals presenting a shift in lateralization—having rightward asymmetry during language tasks—can be found in left-handers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hund-Georgiadis et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Pujol et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Szaflarski et al., 2002</xref>). This last observation is consistent with previous aphasia studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hécaen and Sauguet, 1971</xref>) and investigations of epileptic patients with Wada testing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Isaacs et al., 2006</xref>), but the very low incidence of atypical individuals coupled with the low incidence of left handedness is a difficulty in the assessment of language lateralization variability in healthy individuals. To overcome this issue, we gathered a database of healthy volunteers specifically enriched in left-handers (BIL and GIN; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Mazoyer et al., 2016</xref>) and measured the Hemispheric Functional Lateralization index (HFLI; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Wilke and Schmithorst, 2006</xref>) for sentence production in 297 of its participants. We thereby uncovered 3 patterns of language lateralization, namely, 10 strong-atypical individuals with strong rightward lateralization that included only left-handers, 37 ambilateral individuals, including 23 left-handers, with weak or no lateralization and 250 typical individuals with strong leftward lateralization, including 120 left-handers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Mazoyer et al., 2014</xref>). In a subsequent investigation of regional asymmetries in these same participants, we provided evidence that there were no differences between typical right- and left-handers in terms of regional patterns of asymmetry. In contrast, left-handed ambilaterals were not lateralized unlike right-handed ambilaterals who showed a modest leftward asymmetry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Tzourio-Mazoyer et al., 2016</xref>). Left-handed ambilaterals were also characterized by higher connectivity at rest across homotopic language regions suggesting that enhanced interhemispheric cooperation at rest is a marker of increased interhemispheric cooperation associated with decreased asymmetries during sentence minus list production contrast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Tzourio-Mazoyer et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>This last result highlights the importance of resting-state fMRI for the investigation of language network organization, as it makes it possible to measure the functional intrinsic connectivity of networks within each hemisphere and the differences in connectivity between the hemispheres. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Raemaekers et al., 2018</xref> showed a significant association across individuals between the asymmetry in functional connectivity scores and the asymmetries in language task lateralization scores measured in language regions located along the longitudinal fissure in 423 healthy volunteers. Consistent with the Raemaekers et al. report, we have recently shown that in the left hemisphere, the resting-state degree centrality (Rs_DC), or strength of connectivity, was significantly correlated with task-induced activations in the supramodal network of regions dedicated to sentence processing (SENT_CORE; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Labache et al., 2019</xref>). Moreover, the Reynolds' study involving 117 children demonstrated that asymmetry in the strength of connectivity between language areas followed the same developmental pattern of increases in asymmetry between 2 and 7 years old (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Reynolds et al., 2019</xref>) as that reported with task-induced activations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Friederici et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Perani et al., 2011</xref>). Finally, such asymmetries in within-hemisphere intrinsic connectivity at rest are modified in individuals with rightward lateralization for language production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Joliot et al., 2016</xref>). Taken together, these studies demonstrate that language network intrinsic connectivity and its asymmetry are important markers to characterize the variability in language organization in the brain.</p><p>A key issue that remains unresolved regarding the typical and atypical organization for language in healthy individuals is that of dissociation. Actually, there is very little knowledge on homogeneity in lateralization across different language components in healthy individuals. Neuropsychological studies such as the seminal study conducted by Hécaen in left-handers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hécaen and Sauguet, 1971</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hécaen et al., 1981</xref>) have shown that hemispheric dominance is not a property of a given hemisphere but rather that the dominant hemisphere may shift for different language functions in some individuals. After left hemisphere lesions, left-handed aphasic patients can show rare deficits in comprehension, while deficits in production are constant, indicating a dissociation of these two language components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hécaen et al., 1981</xref>). PET studies with healthy volunteers have provided evidence of dissociations between production and comprehension in rare left-handers, with a leftward asymmetry during production and a rightward asymmetry during comprehension (for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Tzourio-Mazoyer et al., 2004</xref>). In pathological states, particularly epilepsy, several studies have reported dissociations between asymmetries for language production and those for listening (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baciu et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kurthen et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kurthen et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lee et al., 2008</xref>), and the results of a longitudinal study of Wada testing in four of these patients suggested that language production was more likely to shift hemispheres than speech comprehension (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lee et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>The occurrence of dissociation, particularly in some healthy individuals, suggests a potential independence of different language components in terms of hemispheric dominance, which calls for the search for factors in brain organization that could allow different language components to be hosted in different hemispheres. One hypothesis could be that a loose organization in terms of lateralization, marked by some bilateral involvement of language areas and strong interhemispheric connectivity, would make it possible for different language components to be lateralized in different hemispheres. In such a case, one should observe an increased occurrence of dissociations in atypicals, and a better knowledge of the characteristics of the individuals who are more likely to host dissociations will make it possible to optimize the neuroimaging paradigm used to determine language lateralization. For example, as implemented in presurgical evaluations of epileptic patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baciu et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baciu et al., 2005</xref>), a paradigm that includes a battery of language tasks in addition to production could be designed for this subpopulation.</p><p>Regarding these matters, the present study, which includes measures of lateralization during production, listening and reading tasks in the same participants, is an opportunity to refine the understanding of dissociations. Reading is the last language function acquired through development, since the emergence of this language component relies on strong interactions between speech, eye motor systems, and preorthographic processing by visuospatial attentional areas whose lateralization is located in different hemispheres (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lobier et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Petit et al., 2015</xref>). One might suggest that dissociations between the lateralization of speech comprehension and production could occur from two different sources of variability: speech perception (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Zatorre et al., 2002</xref>) and motor control of speech (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lieberman et al., 2007</xref>), respectively. Nevertheless, examining reading lateralization, which is established later on the basis of comprehension and production lateralization, will allow us to enlarge the question of the possible sources of interindividual variability in language lateralization to that of the relationships between rightward lateralized visuospatial functions and leftward lateralized language functions.</p><p>Hemispheric asymmetries in gray and white matter have been used to investigate variability in hemispheric specialization for language, although these measures mainly provide information on inherited gross anatomical differences between the two hemispheres, which are observable at the whole brain level as a global torsion of the brain (i.e. the Yakovlevian torque; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Toga and Thompson, 2003</xref>). In areas related to language processing, such as the <italic>planum temporale</italic> close to the sylvian fissure, leftward asymmetries of fissure depth are seen in utero (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Habas et al., 2012</xref>), and these asymmetries are of the same amplitude at birth as in adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hill et al., 2010</xref>), showing no subsequent modifications during development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Li et al., 2014</xref>). Notably, in adults, the gross leftward asymmetry of the <italic>planum temporale</italic> does not have the characteristics of a marker of hemispheric dominance at the individual level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Tzourio-Mazoyer et al., 2018</xref>). Even if some local relationships were found between gray matter and language task-induced functional asymmetries during word-listening, they explain only a small fraction of the interindividual variability of local functional asymmetries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Josse et al., 2009</xref>). The <italic>corpus callosum,</italic> made of fibers connecting both hemispheres, has also been investigated as it is the main anatomical support for interhemispheric connectivity. The <italic>corpus callosum</italic> surface or volume has thus been measured as a potential anatomical marker of this interhemispheric connectivity. Actually, during the course of phylogenesis, increasing brain volumes go along with decreasing corpus callosum volumes relative to brain size (review in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hopkins and Cantalupo, 2008</xref>). On this basis, one should expect that a strong lateralization would be associated with a smaller corpus callosum volume, as previously observed in males for anatomical hemispheric asymmetries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dorion et al., 2000</xref>). To date, no studies have investigated the direct relationships between the interindividual variability in hemispheric specialization for language and anatomical hemispheric asymmetries or <italic>corpus callosum</italic> volume, so there is still no evidence of a direct association between anatomical and functional asymmetries.</p><p>This survey of previous findings can be summarized in the following way: leftward lateralized typical individuals can be right- or left-handers, they have leftward anatomical asymmetries both at the hemispheric level and at the regional level, they are leftward asymmetrical during language production and leftward asymmetrical for Rs_DC at rest, and they show lower intrinsic interhemispheric connectivity than individuals who are symmetrical during language production. In contrast, the type of organization in individuals who are not leftward lateralized is difficult to summarize because of the low incidence of atypical language lateralization and its heterogeneity. For instance, either a rightward asymmetry or an absence of asymmetry during language production can be observed in atypical individuals, corresponding either to a shift in the dominant hemisphere or to bilateral dominant or nondominant hemispheres, as we have previously shown using support vector machine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Zago et al., 2017</xref>). Moreover, to our knowledge, there is a lack of information on the lateralization of language comprehension and reading and the occurrence of dissociations in relation to typical or atypical language organization.</p><p>Another open question is the relationship between typical and atypical hemispheric specialization for language and cognitive performance that can be envisioned within different frameworks. Some authors have proposed that the decreased verbal performance observed in language developmental disorders may be related to a lack of lateralization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bishop, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Tallal, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Tallal and Schwartz, 1981</xref>). In healthy volunteers, there is some evidence of such a relationship but with a moderate impact on performance not specific to verbal abilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Mellet et al., 2014b</xref>). A larger framework would be the possible association between defects in complementary specialization and nonoptimal cognitive functioning (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Vingerhoets, 2019</xref>), with such an abnormal setting of complementary specialization being expected to occur in individuals with atypical hemispheric specialization for language brain organization.</p><p>To address these important questions regarding the interindividual variability in language organization in healthy individuals, we investigated 287 participants from the BIL and GIN who completed both resting-state fMRI and task-related fMRI during sentence-production, sentence-listening and sentence-reading tasks. These participants were also mapped for their anatomical hemispheric asymmetries and completed a battery of seven verbal and four visuospatial tests (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Mazoyer et al., 2016</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Descriptive statistics of the groups identified by hierarchical clustering</title><p>The agglomerative hierarchical procedure resulted in the identification of 3 clusters; three clusters were found to be optimal by 14 R statistical indices (from over 30 that were used to assess the quality of the classification).

Two clusters of similar sizes aggregated 257 (90% of the sample) leftward lateralized individuals. The 132 TYP_STRONG individuals (of which 46.4% were left-handers) were highly leftward lateralized for both task-induced asymmetry and intrahemispheric intrinsic connectivity, while showing low interhemispheric connectivity. This pattern of language organization was associated with strong leftward asymmetry of gray and white matter hemispheric volumes and with high visuospatial performance. The 125 TYP_MILD individuals (including 50.7% left-handers) differed from the TYP_STRONG individuals by their moderate leftward task-induced asymmetries, lower left hemisphere degree of connectivity and larger interhemispheric homotopic connectivity. The moderate leftward language organization in the TYP_MILD individuals was more frequent in women and was associated with a larger occurrence of dissociations than in the TYP_STRONG individuals (7% compared to 1.6%). Visuospatial cognitive abilities were lower in the TYP_MILD group than in the TYP_STRONG group. The third (ATYP) cluster of 30 individuals included the highest proportion of left-handers (83%). Mean asymmetry in the ATYP group was rightward lateralized during the three language tasks, with a striking lack of differences in asymmetry strengths across tasks, in contrast to the two groups of typicals. Organization at rest in the ATYP group was marked by bilateral high intrahemispheric connectivity and strong interhemispheric connectivity. Such a low hemispheric specialization pattern was associated with a high occurrence of dissociations among the functional asymmetries in the three language tasks (40%), lower leftward asymmetries of gray and white matter hemispheric volumes, and when dissociated, larger corpus callosum volumes. Finally, the ATYP cluster showed lower verbal memory abilities than the two other clusters. Comparison of the present classification to previous classifications based only on PROD<sub>SENT-WORD</sub> revealed the importance of the multitask approach conjointly with resting-state measures of Rs_DC in the language network to segregate the atypicals within the individuals with low PROD<sub>SENT-WORD</sub> hemispheric asymmetries.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><sec id="s3-1"><title>A multimodal multitask classification provides an enhanced definition of atypical language organization</title><p>Compared to the high consistency of the classification of individuals having typical language organization, the definition of atypicality for language lateralization based on neuroimaging investigations is complex, and the type of brain organization supporting language functions in atypical individuals is still not comprehensively understood.</p><p>All individuals having a rightward hemispheric lateralization of language production as measured with Gaussian mixture modeling were classified into the ATYP group in the present study, suggesting that having a rightward lateralization for production is a clear criterion of atypicality, as already validated by Wada studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dym et al., 2011</xref>). However, the present classification did not individualize a cluster resembling the group of 37 ambilaterals identified in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Mazoyer et al., 2014</xref>, which indicated that not being clearly lateralized by production was not sufficient to ascertain atypicality. The difficulty in asserting language dominance in individuals with little fMRI lateralization during production is consistent with Bauer et al.’s meta-analysis showing that fMRI is more accurate in assessing language dominance in cases of strong leftward asymmetry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bauer et al., 2014</xref>). However, the Bauer study involved patients suffering from epilepsy and thus likely to have language network reorganization.</p><p>To identify the discriminative variables that split the 37 ambilaterals into the 3 ‘language organization’ groups, we conducted an additional analysis entering the nine variables we used for the multitask multimodal hierarchical classification as repeated measures, and we found in the 37 individuals classified ambilaterals in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Mazoyer et al., 2014</xref> a very significant ‘language organization’ main effect and interaction with the repeated measures (both p&lt;0.0001). Post hoc analyses revealed that among these 37 ambilaterals, the 12 individuals classified as ATYP had significantly lower task-induced asymmetry in SENT_HUBS and SENT_CORE (all p&lt;0.001) and a significantly lower Rs_DC asymmetry (p=0.002) than those classified as TYP_MILD or TYP_STRONG. In contrast, there was no difference in averaged Rs_DC or Rs_mIHHC values. These findings thus confirmed that, in order to comprehensively describe the dominance for language in individuals having low HFLI during language production, it is useful to apply a multitask battery as has been proposed by some authors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baciu et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Niskanen et al., 2012</xref>), which particularly allows the detection of individuals with dissociations as demonstrated by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baciu et al., 2003</xref>. Importantly, the present study also demonstrated that resting-state connectivity variables, measured at the language network level, particularly Rs_DC asymmetry, in association with task-induced asymmetry, are of interest for the identification of atypical individuals.</p><p>In left-handers, a weak functional asymmetry during language production makes atypical organization with rightward asymmetry for other language components highly probable (80%), whereas the same weak functional asymmetry in right-handed individuals is associated with a TYP leftward lateralization in most cases (86%). Such observations are consistent with the classification by support vector machine showing that all ambilateral right-handers had a left hemisphere with a dominant pattern (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Zago et al., 2017</xref>), whereas the eight left-handed ambilaterals as classified with Gaussian mixture modeling and who had a dominant right-hemisphere pattern with support vector machine, were classified into the ATYP group by the present method.</p><p>The fact that 80% of the ATYP individuals were left-handed is consistent with previous research showing that reverse lateralization is mainly seen in left-handers, whether in adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Króliczak et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Somers et al., 2015a</xref>) or in children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Szaflarski et al., 2012</xref>). Here, a right shift in hemisphere dominance for language was found in 12% of left-handers (when taking into account the different language components, as done in the present study), compared to only 6% when considering their HFLI for production only (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Mazoyer et al., 2014</xref>). The difference between these two proportions provides an estimate of the decreased sensitivity when detection of atypicals among left-handersLH is performed using a production task only rather than a multitask multimodal approach as we implemented in the present study. The present multimodal classification identified five right-handed ATYP individuals (3.6%, compared to 16.7% of left-handers), a phenomenon as rare as the published case reports of crossed aphasia in right-handers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alexander and Annett, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hindson et al., 1984</xref>), raising the question of whether this is a pathological state rather than part of interindividual variability of language organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Coppens et al., 2002</xref>). Among these five right-handed ATYP individuals, three had been previously classified as ambilaterals and two as typicals by Gaussian mixture modeling of the PROD<sub>SENT-WORD</sub> HFLI, with the latter two individuals having negative asymmetries during LISN<sub>SENT-WORD</sub> and READ<sub>SENT-WORD</sub>. It is noticeable that these five right-handers had lower task-induced asymmetry strength than the 25 left-handed ATYP individuals, independent of the task, leaving open the question of whether right- and left-handed ATYP individuals are actually comparable.</p><p>Finally, the present classification sheds some light on the brain organization for language in individuals as defined by the support vector machine approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Zago et al., 2017</xref>). Actually, the ATYP cluster aggregated 77% of the 22 participants labeled as having a right dominant hemisphere by support vector machine. This is very consistent with the high Rs_DC found for the right SENT_CORE network of the ATYP individuals. One should also note that 41% (7 among 17) of these right-hemisphere dominant ATYP individuals also had a dominant left hemisphere (i.e. were codominant), whereas the ATYP cluster aggregated 77% of the 12 participants labeled as having a codominant hemisphere. This strong association between atypicality and codominance is also consistent with the finding that ATYP individuals were characterized by high bilateral connectivity of their SENT_CORE network, which is likely to reduce the bias toward the dominance of a given hemisphere and attest to a more bilateral organization for language.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Organization of intrinsic connectivity in atypical individuals: although they show rightward task-induced asymmetries, their left hemisphere is also wired for language</title><p>In a previous study, we noted that the 10 left-handers with strong rightward HFLI exhibited a pattern of regional asymmetries that was the reverse of the pattern observed in typical individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Tzourio-Mazoyer et al., 2016</xref>), a result in line with cortical stimulation findings suggesting that individuals shifting their dominant hemisphere actually have a reverse regional organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chang et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Drane et al., 2012</xref>). The present study results, although consistent with this view in terms of task-induced asymmetries, demonstrated that, by contrast, the SENT_CORE network intrinsic connectivity properties of ATYP individuals did not mirror those of individuals with leftward task-induced asymmetries. Although the mean of the group was strongly rightward asymmetrical in the three tasks, the ATYP individuals showed high and symmetrical Rs_DC values, meaning that the SENT_CORE network was highly connected in both hemispheres, and it is remarkable that their left hemisphere Rs_DC value was not different from that of the TYP_STRONG individuals, whereas their right hemisphere Rs_DC value was higher than that of the TYP_STRONG individuals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). The ATYP individuals thus had a significantly larger mean Rs_DC value of SENT_CORE in both hemispheres, making them highly connected individuals and suggesting that their left hemisphere could be organized in a way similar to that of the TYP individuals, that is as a potentially dominant hemisphere for language. In addition, the ATYP individuals showed the highest interhemispheric connectivity across SENT_CORE homotopic areas, constituting a highly efficient network for sentence processing that straddled the two hemispheres. The fact that even in individuals shifting their task-induced lateralization to the right, the left hemisphere is wired for high-order language processing leads to the hypothesis that the left hemisphere is the language hemisphere by default.</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Summary figure illustrating the different SENT_CORE intra- and inter-hemispheric organizations observed in the three groups identified by hierarchical clustering.</title><p>The left column shows the group mean activation maps during PROD<sub>SENT-WORD</sub> (BOLD activation amplitude is given by color scale) of the left hemisphere and the right column the mean activation map of the right hemisphere superimposed on the white matter surface rendering of the BIL and GIN template obtained with the Surf Ice software (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.nitrc.org/projects/surfice/">https://www.nitrc.org/projects/surfice/</ext-link>).

In right-handers, we observed a positive correlation across individuals between asymmetries of activations and Rs_DC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Labache et al., 2019</xref>), while the ATYP group showed an absence of mean Rs_DC asymmetry but mean rightward task-induced symmetries. Notably, both the CROSSED and CONGRUENT ATYP individuals had a left hemisphere Rs_DC as strong as that in the TYP_STRONG individuals, meaning that their left SENT_CORE network connectivity was not different from that of strong leftward lateralized individuals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>) supporting the hypothesis that ATYP left hemisphere is wired for language as it is for typical individuals. Actually, ATYP differed from typicals in their right-hemisphere organization at rest that exhibited a high strength of intrinsic connectivity, in agreement with their task-induced rightward activations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>).</p><p>The pattern of ATYP individual network intrinsic organization is thus a networking of both hemispheres profiled for the processing of high-order language, combined with strong anatomical and functional underpinning of interhemispheric interactions as evidenced by higher correlations across homotopic regions of SENT_CORE and larger corpus callosum in the DISSOCIATED_ATYP individuals. The ATYP group also showed a more bilateral anatomical organization with decreased leftward gray and white matter hemispheric asymmetries likely to result in more flexibility in the side hosting the different language tasks and therefore allowing dissociations. In fact, the ATYP group hosted the largest proportion of participants showing dissociations and thus relying on one or the other hemisphere as the dominant hemisphere depending on the language component, which may be related to their stronger interhemispheric connectivity. Such a hypothesis was partly confirmed by the comparison of individuals with dissociations in the three groups that demonstrated that CROSSED ATYP individuals had significantly higher interhemispheric connectivity and more variation in the strength of asymmetries when DISSOCIATED than the two other groups. These strong between-task differences in asymmetry strengths reflect an important shift in hemispheric control, which were particularly seen between PROD<sub>SENT-WORD</sub> and the two other tasks underpinned by the strong interhemispheric connectivity allowing for cooperation across the bilaterally located task-dependent dominant language networks.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Two types of leftward organization for language, with an overrepresentation of women but not of left-handers in mildly lateralized typical individuals</title><p>The present segregation of leftward lateralized individuals in the two groups is consistent with the two Gaussian components of the PROD<sub>SENT-WORD</sub> HFLI distribution in typical individuals observed in our previous work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Mazoyer et al., 2014</xref>). However, these two Gaussian components showed too much overlap to allow a clear separation of the two groups of typical individuals. One original observation of the present study is thus the evidence of differences in terms of functional connectivity between two groups of typical individuals. Although leftward lateralized and showing the same gradient of asymmetry across the three tasks, the TYP_MILD individuals exhibited significant particularities in their inter- and intrahemispheric—although typical—intrinsic connectivity organization with lower asymmetries of task-induced activations but also lower Rs_DC and higher Rs_mIHHC within SENT_CORE. In other words, their decreased strength in task-induced functional asymmetries was associated with an intra- vs. interhemispheric intrinsic connectivity pattern showing less differentiation across hemispheres together with increased connection between them. Such a pattern of looser hemispheric specialization for language in the TYP_MILD group is consistent with a higher occurrence of dissociations than in the TYP_STRONG group, although those dissociations were of moderate intensity and mainly observed for the reading task.</p><p>The proportion of women was larger in the TYP_MILD cluster (58%) than in either of the two other clusters (38% in the TYP_STRONG and 50% in the ATYP clusters), as well as in the whole sample (49%), consistent with previous reports of reduced language lateralization in women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Levy and Reid, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">McGlone and Davidson, 1973</xref>). Interestingly, gender differences in cluster constitution in the present work were present only in the two groups of typicals but not in the ATYP group. Such a subtle association between sex and language lateralization may explain the inconsistency in the reports of a sex effect in hemispheric specialization for language (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Sommer et al., 2004</xref>) since, in contrast to handedness, it is not associated with the occurrence of critical changes in language lateralization. Actually, the proportion of left-handers was not increased in the TYP_MILD group (compared to the TYP_STRONG group), confirming that the relationship between handedness and language lateralization is better grounded in the large occurrence of left-handers among rightward lateralized individuals rather than by a decreased lateralization for language in left-handers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Mazoyer et al., 2014</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Dissociations of lateralization across language components are of different natures in typical and atypical individuals with a particular status for the lateralization of reading</title><p>Dissociations were detected with higher sensitivity when considering the SENT_HUBS hROIs rather than the whole set of SENT_CORE area ROIs. This is the reason why we considered a participant dissociated if they had opposed asymmetry across tasks on either one or both variables.</p><p>The low incidence of dissociations that we observed in the TYP individuals and, in particular, in the TYP right-handers (4%) was consistent with the literature that reports rare cases of dissociations of production and comprehension in healthy right-handed participants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Jansen et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Tzourio-Mazoyer et al., 2004</xref>). A point of interest was the occurrence of dissociation between the lateralization for reading and the lateralization for production and listening, which, to our knowledge, has not yet been reported. In leftward lateralized TYP individuals, dissociations were mainly observed in the TYP_MILD individuals for whom, as in the TYP_STRONG individuals, reading was on average more lateralized than listening (although less than production).</p><p>Dissociations in this TYP_MILD cluster more often involved reading (5 out of 9 in SENT_HUBS; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Such a larger occurrence of dissociations involving reading may be related to the late acquisition of this language function. Indeed, the first phase of language development is perceptual, as revealed by studies showing that the auditory system of the fetus at 30-week gestation is mature enough to detect complex sounds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">McMahon et al., 2012</xref>) and to differentiate phonemes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hepper and Shahidullah, 1994</xref>). After only a few hours of postnatal exposure, newborns respond specifically to speech (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dehaene-Lambertz et al., 2002</xref>). Then, because of maturation of the vocal tract, the second phase is production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Mowrer, 1980</xref>). From the second half of the first year of life, the child enters the babbling phase proper and begins to make choices specific to the structures of his or her mother tongue at the prosodic, phonetic and syllabic levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Oller, 1980</xref>). These first steps toward articulation are an essential step that reflects the existence of a functional link between the processes of perception and the production of vocal sounds and gives the child the opportunity to receive proprioperceptive feedback (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Rodgon, 1976</xref>).</p><p>While speech perception and production tightly codevelop very early in the establishment of language, reading is based on both the ability to hear and segment words into phonemes and then to associate these phonemes with graphemes, with the mapping of orthographic to phonological representations during reading being intrinsically cross-modal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">McNorgan et al., 2014</xref>). In fact, reading develops in interaction with object recognition in the left fusiform gyrus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kassuba et al., 2011</xref>) and rightward lateralized visuospatial and visuomotor processes such as the saccadic system supporting eye movement during reading (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Petit et al., 2009</xref>). More particularly, during reading, eye movements are not only an oculomotor ability but also the integration of visual and language processes at the word level and at the syntactic level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Richards et al., 2017</xref>). In fact, reading depends on an alternation of fixations and saccades, the latter being defined as forward progressions or backward regressions. Even if forward progressions are the most common eye movements, backward regressions have been revealed to be correlated with the syntactic complexity of sentences, suggesting that these eye regressions depend on the relationships that the words making up the statement have to each other (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lopopolo et al., 2019</xref>). Thus, reading ability involves both visuospatial and language processes. Such a late specialization could lead to the possibility that different factors could intervene in the establishing of reading lateralization, with these factors being different from those acting during the first stages of language development.</p><p>The picture was very different for ATYP individuals, whose predominant dissociation pattern was a leftward lateralization for production and a rightward lateralization for both reading and listening (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, left). Considering the developmental timing of language components mentioned above, this could be an indication that ATYP lateralization for language perception and production is established early in different hemispheres. The second observation is that in the ATYP individuals, the lateralization of heteromodal areas during reading follows that of auditory sentence comprehension, demonstrating the prevalence of sensory integration over action in these individuals, which is different from the lateralization organization in the TYP_MILD individuals. The fact that reading lateralization has different relationships with production and listening according to the sentence lateralization organization can provide new insight into the variability in the establishing of reading dominance and, potentially, a possible relationship between atypicality and dyslexia, since there is still a great debate between lateralization and reading impairments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Wilson and Bishop, 2018</xref>). Assessing the type of dissociations would be of great interest for shedding new light on language impairments.</p><p>The more frequent rightward lateralization during LISN than during PROD in the ATYP left-handers was consistent with the observation of Hécaen of a high occurrence of production deficits after left-hemisphere lesions in left-handers, while comprehension deficits were rare (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hécaen et al., 1981</xref>). Such a dissociation corresponds to that of action vs. perception as defined by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fuster, 2009</xref>, with sentence reading and listening being colateralized. It is remarkable that, when compared to both TYP groups, the ATYP group showed a decrease in (absolute value) asymmetry strength that was larger for production than for the other tasks, leading to an absence of a difference between the asymmetries in production, listening, and reading. Such a diminished asymmetry during production is striking because of the link existing between hand preference and language production, with both functions being on the action side and being localized in close frontal areas. One should have expected left-handers to have stronger rightward asymmetry during language production than during the other tasks in relation to their left-hand dominance. This was not the case, even when considering only the CONGRUENT_ATYP individuals. However, handedness was associated with a stronger mean rightward asymmetry in the left-handed ATYP individuals and stronger leftward asymmetry in the right-handed TYP_STRONG individuals, independent of the task, as if the hemisphere controlling the dominant hand is a slight attractor for language lateralization. This modest effect of handedness is consistent with the observation that patients who had suffered from right plexus brachial injury at birth, therefore disabled in the use of their right hand, present a shifting of their language production asymmetries toward the right hemisphere, although without a complete shift (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Auer et al., 2009</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Are different language organizations associated with differences in cognitive abilities?</title><p>Better visuospatial performance was present in the TYP_STRONG individuals, who had the largest between-hemisphere differences and lower interhemispheric connectivity. Such a result suggests that the better spatial abilities reported in RHright-handers in a meta-analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Somers et al., 2015b</xref>) might have been related to the fact that the TYP_STRONG group hosted the highest proportion of right-handers. The present results suggest that strong leftward lateralization of both language task-induced and resting-state connectivity asymmetries in the core language network is associated with better visuospatial performance, as if less involvement of the right hemisphere in sentence processing was facilitating visuospatial processing. Such an observation can be viewed as an argument in favor of the ‘crowding effect’ theory stating that an optimal split of functions across the two hemispheres facilitates cognitive functioning (review in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Vingerhoets, 2019</xref>). Of course, further exploration of the relationships between the different aspects of visuospatial cognitive abilities and the strength of both leftward lateralization for language and rightward lateralization for visuospatial functions, as well as their interindividual variability, is needed to confirm this hypothesis.</p><p>Decreased verbal memory abilities in the ATYP group suggest that the reorganization occurring on top of the language organization by default in this group is at the cost of suboptimal cognitive functioning, while mild, although leftward, lateralization for language appears to be as efficient for language processing as strong leftward lateralization. Considering that the ATYP group included 15 of the ambilateral individuals defined in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Mazoyer et al., 2014</xref>, the present observation is consistent with those of Mellet et al reporting lower performance in ambilaterals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Mellet et al., 2014b</xref>) concerning both verbal memory and visuospatial abilities.</p></sec><sec id="s3-6"><title>Conclusions</title><p>The joint investigation of language task-induced asymmetries and intrinsic connectivity strength in the sentence-processing supramodal network, showed that individuals with atypical rightward language lateralization do not rely on an organization that simply mirrors that of typical leftward lateralized individuals but rather is associated with a loose hemispheric specialization for language. The fact that these individuals had lower leftward gross macroscopical hemispheric anatomy than typical individuals suggests that such organization was supported, at least in part, by early developmental events resulting from a different trajectory or from the occurrence of plastic changes. Support for the hypothesis of the early establishment of this atypical organization comes from the coinvestigation of the lateralization of production and comprehension with reading. In atypicals, dissociations were observed between sentence production and comprehension (whether read or listened to), two functions known to be tightly coupled and early developing. By contrast, the rare dissociations found in typicals occurred for reading, a later acquired competence. Moreover, atypical organization occurring mainly in left-handers has a cost in terms of language abilities with less efficient verbal memory. Finally, the present results argue for multitask measures of language lateralization for evaluating hemispheric specialization for language in individuals with low lateralization for language production, especially if they are left-handed.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Participants</title><p>The study sample was part of the BIL and GIN database that has been fully described elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Mazoyer et al., 2016</xref>).

We selected the number of clusters that satisfied a maximum of indices and found it to be equal to 3.</p><p>Hierarchical classification was completed with R (R version 3.5.1; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">R Development Core Team, 2013</xref>), while other statistical analyses were performed using JMP15 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jmp.com">http://www.jmp.com</ext-link>, SAS Institute Inc, 2018).</p></sec><sec id="s4-7-2"><title>Identification of individuals with dissociations of lateralization across tasks</title><p>In a second step, we identified individuals exhibiting at least one dissociation in their lateralization among the three language tasks, which means those who exhibited SENT_CORE functional asymmetries larger than 0.05 in amplitude in the opposite direction in one task compared to the others. We also searched for individuals exhibiting a dissociation in their SENT_HUB asymmetries, which led to the definition of two categories of individuals: 1. those exhibiting a dissociation for either SENT_CORE or SENT_HUB or both, who were named ‘CROSSED’; 2. those showing either leftward lateralization for all tasks for both SENT_CORE and SENT_HUBS or right lateralization for all tasks for both SENT_CORE and SENT_HUBS, who were named ‘CONGRUENT’.</p><p>Pearson's chi-square tests were conducted to compare the proportion of ‘dissociation’ across the clusters identified by the classification.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Characterization of the groups provided by the classification with different brain organization of the language network</title><sec id="s4-8-1"><title>Task performance, demography and handedness</title><p>To ensure that potential differences in the asymmetries measured during the language tasks were not related to group differences in task execution time that was recorded during the task-induced fMRI session, response times were compared across ‘language organization’ groups (corresponding to the clusters of the hierarchical classification) taking into account sex, age, and brain volume. In addition, within each ‘language organization’ group, we compared the groups of ‘CONGRUENT’ and ‘CROSSED’ individuals.</p><p>The different ‘language organization’ groups were compared with variables known to be associated with variability in language lateralization, namely, handedness, sex, age, and brain volume. To complete these analyses, Pearson's chi-square tests were applied for discrete variables (handedness and sex) and ANOVA with Tukey's HSD post hoc tests for continuous variables (age and brain volume).</p></sec><sec id="s4-8-2"><title>Task-induced and resting-state organization of the SENT_CORE network in groups varying in their language network organization</title><p>We first comprehensively described the different types of organization of the sentence networks in the groups issued from the hierarchical classification.</p><p>We used two repeated measures MANOVA to examine the task-induced asymmetries within SENT_CORE and SENT_HUBS in the three language tasks searching for ‘task’ (three levels), ‘language organization’ (three levels, that is, a number of levels corresponding to the number of identified clusters) and ‘handedness’ main effects and their interactions.</p><p>Note that to ensure that this between-group difference was not due to a difference in the occurrences of dissociations across ‘language organization’ groups, the statistical analysis was completed on the absolute values of asymmetries within SENT_CORE and SENT_HUBS. We also examined in the ATYP and TYP_MILD groups the effect of ‘dissociation’ and its interactions with ‘task’ on the strength of task-induced asymmetries. The TYP_STRONG group was not considered in this analysis because there were only 2 DISSOCIATED individuals in this group.</p><p>In the same way, we examined the resting-state variables, that is the Rs_DC asymmetries, Rs_DC mean and Rs_mIHHC. For Rs_mIHHC, we performed the Fisher z-transformation to conduct the analysis.</p><p>Finally, using repeated measures MANOVA, we searched whether there was a difference in resting-state organization with the occurrence of ‘dissociations’ depending on ‘language organization’ (restricted to two factors ATYP and TYP, as the TYP_STRONG and TYP_MILD groups that were not different for Rs_DC and Rs_mIHHC were merged) by comparing their mean Rs_DC values and asymmetries (including a main effect of ‘side’ in the MANOVA), and SENT_CORE Rs_mIHHC.</p><p>All post hoc analyses were conducted using Tukey's HSD test for multiple comparisons.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8-3"><title>Anatomical variables</title><p>To investigate the brain structural differences in groups with different functional organization of language lateralization, we compared <italic>corpus callosum</italic> volume (CCvol) and asymmetries (left <italic>minus</italic> right) in gray matter (GMasym) and white matter (WMasym) hemispheric volumes. In this analysis, ‘CROSSED’ or ‘CONGRUENT’ was studied in interaction with the ‘language organization’ main effect restricted to two factors (‘TYP’ and ‘ATYP’).</p><p>First, to take into account variables that were found to covary with GMasym, WMasym and CCvol, we computed the residuals of MANCOVAs that included age, sex, total brain volume and handedness. These residuals of GMasym and WMasym were then entered in repeated measures ANOVA including a ‘language organization’ main effect restricted to two factors (‘TYP’ and ‘ATYP’) and dissociation (‘CROSSED’ or ‘CONGRUENT’) and their interaction as fixed factors and their interaction with the anatomical compartment (gray matter or white matter).</p><p>The residuals of CCvol were entered in ANOVA searching for an effect of a ‘language organization’ main effect restricted to two factors (‘TYP’ and ‘ATYP’), an effect of dissociation with two factors (‘CROSSED’ or ‘CONGRUENT’) and their interaction.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8-4"><title>Cognitive variables</title><p>First, we performed a multiple linear regression analysis of the scores of the 11 tests of the cognitive battery, including sex, manual preference, age, education level and total intracranial volume as predictors since these variables have been shown to partly explain the variance in these scores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Mellet et al., 2014a</xref>). Residuals of the 11 regression analyses were then entered into PCA with a promax rotation. We used the <italic>scree</italic> criterion to determine the number of components to be retained.</p><p>The ‘language organization’ groups were compared with regard to their cognitive abilities through repeated measures MANCOVA including the four components of the PCA obtained from the residuals of the 11 scores. Finally, an impact of ‘dissociation’ on cognitive abilities was also tested in the ATYP and TYP_MILD groups (only two dissociations in TYP_STRONG).</p><p>Post hoc analyses were conducted using uncorrected Student’s t-tests.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Comparison of the different classifications for language lateralization</title><p>We also compared the present classification based on a multitask and multimodal approach to two other classifications that were previously applied to the same group of individuals, namely, the Gaussian mixture modeling classification on the HFLI obtained with the PROD<sub>SENT_WORD</sub> contrast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Mazoyer et al., 2014</xref>) and an support vector machine approach applied at the voxel level, allowing us to classify the dominant and nondominant hemispheres of each participant according to their spatial pattern of activation during PROD<sub>SENT_WORD</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Zago et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>To compare these three different classifications obtained in the 287 subjects, we used the ‘<italic>ggalluvial’</italic> R library to make an alluvial plot (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brunson, 2020</xref>). The alluvial plot allowed us to visualize, for each subject, their classification as TYP_STRONG TYP_MILD or ATYP issued from the present work, as typical, ambilateral (AMB), or strong-atypical (SA) based on HFLI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Mazoyer et al., 2014</xref>), and the classification of each of the hemispheres as dominant or nondominant obtained with support vector machine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Zago et al., 2017</xref>).

The present study offers novel insight into this old problem, by examining a large sample of healthy volunteers, including over 50% LH, using several fMRI paradigms as well as structural MRI, and conducting exhaustive data analyses. The primary finding is of three different phenotypes characterised by different proportions of left handedness, different language-task based asymmetry, intra- and interhemispheric connectivity, and other measures including cognitive tasks. This work will serve as an important reference point for future studies involving both basic and clinical research, as it advances our understanding of the patterns of language organization in the brain.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) A central claim made in the paper, to explain the results, is that &quot;the dominant hemisphere may shift for different language functions in some individuals&quot;. This claim does not appear to be well supported and the authors are encouraged to consider an alternate, perhaps more parsimonious alternative which is that individuals rely to varying degrees on a variety of (non-linguistic) systems (with independent lateralization patterns) for different linguistic functions.</p><p>2) The finding of differences in the proportion of women between the language lateralization groups is consistent with prior findings of sex differences in language lateralization, which have in some instances been attributed to sex differences in the engagement of non-linguistic systems (e.g., Ullman, Nature Review Neuroscience, 2001; Kansaku et al., Cerebral Cortex, 2000; Kitazawa and Kansaku, Brain, 2005). Sex differences in the engagement of non-linguistic system may contribute to the differences in lateralization observed in the present study. For example, sex differences in visuospatial skills could contribute to the differences seen in this skill between the Typ_strong and Typ_mild groups (which have different proportions of women in the present study).</p><p>3) The various paradigms compared here may differ in their sensitivity and/or specificity for language mapping, which may lead to inconsistencies between them in activation lateralization. For example, the resting-state paradigm has been suggested to yield more bilateral language activation than explicit language tasks (Rolinski et al., Human Brain Mapping, 2020). Thus, dissociations in lateralization between paradigms may be explained (at least in part) by technical differences in the paradigms, rather than physiological shifts in lateralization for different language functions.</p><p>4) Provide additional explanation and justification for the classification into three groups, since this is central to the paper. The classification seems reasonable and yields interesting results. However, the three clusters do seem to overlap substantially in features (at the boundaries), bringing into question whether the data are best characterized as discrete categories or as a continuous distribution.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.58722.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) A central claim made in the paper, to explain the results, is that &quot;the dominant hemisphere may shift for different language functions in some individuals&quot;.

First, we would like to apologize if the way we phrased our results leads the reader to the conclusion that the existence of dissociations was the central claim of the paper. Notwithstanding their importance, such dissociations concerned only 23 participants (8%) of the sample. Strikingly, while dissociations happened in 40% of atypicals, they were only present in 4% of “typicals” (merging TYP_mild and TYP_strong), i.e. 10 times less frequent. So, the central claim of our paper is actually that co-lateralization of the 3 language functions is the rule, whereas their dissociation is rare in healthy volunteers, although they exist.</p><p>To illustFigure 8 rate that co-variation of lateralization is the rule, we plotted the between-tasks correlation graphs of BOLD signal asymmetries, (typicals are in green and atypicals in red) for the reviewer information (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref>).</p><fig id="sa2fig1"><label>Author response image 1.</label><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-58722-resp-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig><p>Note also that we ensured that the lateralization measurements across tasks were comparable by setting a paradigm with close conditions across tasks and with the aim of limiting the potential differences in the engagement of attention and executive functions (that could lead to the right hemisphere involvement):– the tasks were very similar, involving single sentence processing whatever the modality;</p><p>– the control task we designed involves word-lists which is a high order language task that also calls for intentional processes;</p><p>– asymmetries were not calculated on the whole hemisphere, rather we targeted the areas involved in sentence processing.</p><p>It seems thus unlikely that some individuals shifted their asymmetry because of higher attention control for one language component relative to the others.</p><p>Actually, it has been shown that asymmetries measured during language tasks compared to a high reference condition (see Binder for example) are an appropriate marker of language dominance (see Dym). In the clinical literature, but also in healthy volunteers’ studies, dissociations have been previously observed. We thus believe that the change in dominance is the most likely hypothesis for the change in lateralization we observed in case of dissociation. As developed in the manuscript, the fact that it is more frequent in atypicals is also consistent with the fact that we have shown that their intrinsic connectivity at rest attests for a bilateral organization of language network and a strong inter-hemispheric correlation. Indeed, concordance of asymmetries in the 3 tasks is the rule as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref>.</p><p>Following the advice of the reviewer we have simplified the Abstract of the revised version of the manuscript (see below) and we hope it makes the major points of the results of the present work clearer, including the observation that while colateralization across tasks is the rule, dissociations are rare and mainly observed in ATYP individuals.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The finding of differences in the proportion of women between the language lateralization groups is consistent with prior findings of sex differences in language lateralization, which have in some instances been attributed to sex differences in the engagement of non-linguistic systems (e.g., Ullman, Nature Review Neuroscience, 2001; Kansaku et al., Cerebral Cortex, 2000; Kitazawa and Kansaku, Brain, 2005). Sex differences in the engagement of non-linguistic system may contribute to the differences in lateralization observed in the present study. For example, sex differences in visuospatial skills could contribute to the differences seen in this skill between the Typ_strong and Typ_mild groups (which have different proportions of women in the present study).</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer is right as regards the existence of sex differences on visuospatial skills. However, there is no evidence in the literature of an association between asymmetries of activation during language tasks and visuo-spatial performance in TYP individuals. Moreover, we have shown in Mellet et al., 2014, that individuals with low hemispheric lateralization during language production have lower performance in all domains (verbal and visuo-spatial), whereas in the present study, a sex-related difference in lateralization is seen in TYP individuals with leftward lateralization.</p><p>In addition, we have previously reported (Beaucousin et al., 2011) that men tend to recruit more attentional and executive areas of the right hemisphere when processing emotional sentences. Such a larger involvement of attentional areas during sentence processing would lead to lower leftward asymmetries in men than in women (note that this reasoning only works if considering global hemispheric asymmetries, while in the present paper we targeted sentence areas).</p><p>Overall, this is why we believe that we observed here a genuine lower leftward lateralization in TYP_mild that, as mentioned by the reviewer, is associated with a higher proportion of women in that group. In other words, we report that in typicals, women are more frequently of the mild type while men are more frequently strongly lateralized, although we have no data in the present study allowing us to interpret or find a potential cause to this observation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The various paradigms compared here may differ in their sensitivity and/or specificity for language mapping, which may lead to inconsistencies between them in activation lateralization. For example, the resting-state paradigm has been suggested to yield more bilateral language activation than explicit language tasks (Rolinski et al., Human Brain Mapping, 2020). Thus, dissociations in lateralization between paradigms may be explained (at least in part) by technical differences in the paradigms, rather than physiological shifts in lateralization for different language functions.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer is right when mentioning that the resting-state is less lateralized and it is actually what is shown in the present work where ATYP individuals, although having a rightward lateralization during the language tasks, have symmetrical DC at rest in the sentence core network.</p><p>However, in our study, the definition of dissociation was based only on the task-induced asymmetries measured during the 3 language tasks, and did not concern resting state. Accordingly, there was no between-paradigms element in this observation. As developed in the answer to point 1, the 3 language tasks were elaborated to conduct such comparisons since they had the same structure, were constituted of equivalent tasks, and of equivalent reference tasks.</p><p>In addition, although the phenomenon of dissociations is of interest, recall that it concerns only a fraction of 23 participants which represents 8% of the sample, including 40% of individuals with ATYP organization.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Provide additional explanation and justification for the classification into three groups, since this is central to the paper. The classification seems reasonable and yields interesting results. However, the three clusters do seem to overlap substantially in features (at the boundaries), bringing into question whether the data are best characterized as discrete categories or as a continuous distribution.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer and added the following explanation and justification for the classification at the beginning of the “Statistical Analysis” section:</p><p>“In a previous work (Mazoyer et al., 2014), we have shown that the distribution of lateralization for sentence production, although of continuous nature, could be used to classify individuals into 3 discrete categories. […] Rather, the optimal number of clusters for this multivariate classification was obtained using a fully unsupervised methodology and a combination of 30 statistical criteria.”</p><p>That an unsupervised classifier succeeded at characterizing this multivariate dataset in 3 discrete categories only constitutes by itself a validation of our approach. This being said, as pointed out by the reviewers, classification methods based on multiple continuous variables almost inevitably lead to clusters that overlap at their boundaries for some of these variables. Such overlaps do not invalidate the classification approach. Rather they reflect the importance of simultaneously accounting for all variables, as opposed to classifying by looking at each variable separately.</p></body></sub-article></article>
