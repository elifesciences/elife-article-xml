of these signals during development is unknown. We determined the expression profile of astrocyte synapse-regulating genes in the developing mouse visual cortex, identifying astrocyte signals that show differential temporal and layer-enriched expression. These patterns are not intrinsic to astrocytes, but regulated by visually evoked neuronal activity, as they are absent in mice lacking glutamate release from thalamocortical terminals. Consequently, synapses remain immature. Expression of synapse-regulating genes and synaptic development is also altered when astrocyte signaling is blunted by diminishing calcium release from astrocyte stores. Single-nucleus RNA sequencing identified groups of astrocytic genes regulated by neuronal and astrocyte activity, and a cassette of genes that show layer-specific enrichment. Thus, the development of cortical circuits requires coordinated signaling between astrocytes and neurons, highlighting astrocytes as a target to manipulate in neurodevelopmental disorders.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>astrocytes</kwd><kwd>synaptic terminals</kwd><kwd>visual development</kwd><kwd>gene expression</kwd><kwd>neuronal

rid="bib81">Petzoldt and Sigrist, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Südhof, 2018</xref>). Synapse development occurs in several molecularly and functionally defined stages, which include initiation, maturation, and pruning steps prior to stabilization and establishment of mature circuits. In the rodent cortex, this occurs over the period of the first postnatal month, initiating at around postnatal day (P) 7, peaking at P14, and stabilizing towards P28 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Blue and Parnavelas, 1983a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Blue and Parnavelas, 1983b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Farhy-Tselnicker and Allen, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Li et al., 2010</xref>). Synaptic deficits, for example, caused by mutations in synapse-related genes, are associated with developmental disorders such as autism spectrum disorder and epilepsy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Lepeta et al., 2016</xref>). Therefore, understanding how synaptic development is regulated will provide important insights into how circuits form and function in health and are altered in disease.</p><p>The majority of synapses in the mammalian cortex are contacted by astrocytes, a type of glia and key regulators of circuit development and function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Allen, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Batool et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bernardinelli et al., 2014a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Genoud et al., 2006</xref>). Astrocytes express many genes encoding proteins that regulate distinct stages of synapse formation and maturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Baldwin and Eroglu, 2017</xref>). For example, thrombospondin family members induce formation of structurally normal but functionally silent synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Christopherson et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Eroglu et al., 2009</xref>). Glypicans induce the formation of active synapses by recruiting GLUA1 to the postsynaptic side (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Allen et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Farhy-Tselnicker et al., 2017</xref>) and chordin-like 1 induces synapse maturation by recruiting GLUA2 to the postsynaptic side (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Blanco-Suarez et al., 2018</xref>). These and other signals have been identified using in vitro cell culture approaches and analyzed individually across ages and brain regions in vivo. Yet, a systematic analysis of their expression patterns in a complete circuit in vivo, which would reveal distinct regulatory roles for specific synaptic connections, has not been attempted.</p><p>The mouse visual circuit is a well-characterized and powerful model to investigate the role of astrocytes in regulating different stages of synaptogenesis. Visual information perceived by the retina is relayed to the visual cortex (VC) via the neurons of the thalamic lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN). Before eye opening (from birth to ~P12 in mice), spontaneous retinal activity evokes correlated cortical responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Gribizis et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Hanganu et al., 2006</xref>) that are important for the correct establishment of thalamocortical synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Cang et al., 2005</xref>). Eye opening marks a step towards synapse maturation in the VC, with the appearance of visually evoked neuronal responses across the retinal-LGN-VC circuit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Espinosa and Stryker, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Hooks and Chen, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Hooks and Chen, 2020</xref>). Perturbing this process by methods of visual deprivation, such as dark rearing, delays both synaptic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Albanese et al., 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Desai et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Freire, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Funahashi et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Hsu et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Ishikawa et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Ko et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Majdan and Shatz, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Tropea et al., 2006</xref>) and astrocyte maturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Müller, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Stogsdill et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>The VC’s glutamatergic neurons are arranged in spatially defined layers, with distinct transcriptomic, functional, and connectivity profiles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bannister, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Douglas and Martin, 2004</xref>). For example, neurons in layers 1 and 4 receive input from the LGN, while layer 5 neurons, the main output to subcortical regions, send their dendrites to layer 1, where they receive input from both local and subcortical projections. Recent work has shown that cortical astrocytes are also spatially arranged in diverse populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Batiuk et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bayraktar et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">John Lin et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Lanjakornsiripan et al., 2018</xref>), in line with evidence from other brain regions showing astrocyte heterogeneity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Chaboub and Deneen, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Chai et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Khakh and Deneen, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Oberheim et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Rusnakova et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Schitine et al., 2015</xref>). However, whether this astrocyte diversity is reflected in their regulation of synapses across the distinct layers of the VC is unknown. To understand how the diverse astrocytic signals act together to regulate formation of a complete circuit, it is important to determine both temporal and spatial expression patterns of astrocytic synapse-regulating genes in vivo as well as identify the mechanisms that control their level of expression and the subsequent effect on synapse formation.</p><p>Here, we use RNA sequencing and in situ hybridization to obtain the developmental transcriptome of astrocytes in the mouse VC in vivo. We find that astrocyte synapse-regulating genes display differential temporal and spatial expression patterns, which correspond to stages of synapse initiation and maturation. Furthermore, we find that developmental regulation of these genes, namely glypican 4 and chordin-like 1, depends on thalamocortical neuronal activity, with additional regulation by astrocyte IP3R2-dependent Ca<sup>2+</sup> activity. Manipulating either neuronal or astrocytic activity leads to shifts in synaptic development and maturation. Finally, single-nucleus RNA sequencing analysis reveals diverse populations of astrocytes in the developing VC and identifies novel groups of genes that are regulated by neuronal and astrocyte activity. These findings demonstrate how astrocyte expression of synapse-regulating genes is controlled during development, and how synapse maturation is dependent on neuron-astrocyte communication. These data further provide an important resource for future studies of astrocyte development and astrocyte regulation of synapse formation.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>To address key questions regarding astrocyte regulation of synapse development, this study has three major goals. First, to characterize the spatio-temporal profile of astrocyte development during distinct stages of cortical synaptogenesis at the transcriptomic level. Second, to investigate the mechanisms that influence spatio-temporal expression levels of select astrocytic synapse-regulating genes, focusing on neuronal and astrocyte activity. Third, to determine the global dependence of the astrocyte transcriptome on neuronal and astrocyte activity using an unbiased RNA sequencing approach. All analyses were performed in the mouse VC to enable comparison of these metrics within a defined circuit, providing a blueprint for future analysis of the functional roles of astrocytes in synaptic development.</p><sec id="s2-1"><title>Developmental profiling of the astrocyte transcriptome in the postnatal VC</title><p>Astrocytes appear in the cortex at birth, and migrate, proliferate, and mature throughout the first postnatal month (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Ge et al., 2012</xref>), coincidently with the stages of synapse development. To determine the transcriptomic profile of astrocytes at these stages (P7, P14, P28, and adult, P120), we used the astrocyte Ribotag mouse model to isolate mRNA for bulk RNA sequencing (B6N.129-Rpl22<sup>tm1.1Psam/J</sup> crossed to B6.Cg-Tg(Gfap-cre)73.12Mvs/J – labeled Astrocyte-RiboTag) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata1">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Boisvert et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Chai et al., 2017</xref>). In this mouse line, cre recombinase drives the expression of an HA-tagged ribosomal subunit, enabling purification of cell-type-specific ribosomes and associated mRNA for analysis by RNA sequencing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and B</xref>).

This showed that P7 and P14 astrocytes form distinct clusters, while P28 and P120 astrocytes cluster together. To investigate this further, we analyzed the number of differentially expressed genes (DEGs; fragments per kilobase of exon per million mapped fragments [FPKM] &gt; 1; false discovery rate [FDR] &lt; 0.05) between each age group. DEGs are classified into total genes (all changes detected), genes that are expressed by astrocytes (IP/input &gt; 0.75), and genes that are enriched in astrocytes (IP/input &gt; 3; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, for definitions, see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Boisvert et al., 2018</xref>). The largest number of DEGs is between P7 and P28 (~6000 total genes), and smallest numbers between P14 and P28 (~1000 total genes), and P28 and P120 (~2000 total genes). Analysis of astrocyte-enriched genes (IP/input &gt; 3) showed that ~60% of all astrocyte-enriched genes are significantly changed from P7 to P14, while only ~20% are changing between P28 and P120 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). This shows that most changes in astrocyte gene expression are occurring between the first and second postnatal weeks, a time of transition from synapse formation to synapse maturation, and in the VC, from spontaneous to visually evoked neuronal activity.</p><p>To determine the different astrocyte functions at each age, we focused on the astrocyte-enriched gene lists (~1000 total genes FPKM &gt;1, astro IP/input &gt; 3). To identify common genes expressed at all ages, as well as astrocyte-enriched genes that are most highly expressed at each age, we performed Gene Ontology (GO) analysis, focusing on Biological Process (BP) terms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F–H</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1F and G</xref>). This showed that genes common to all ages are enriched in GO terms related to cholesterol processing and serine synthesis, confirming the previously established important role of astrocytes in regulating brain cholesterol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Orth and Bellosta, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). Analysis of GO terms unique to each age showed that at P7 astrocyte genes are enriched in GO terms related to cortical development, while at P14 astrocyte genes are enriched in GO terms related to Wnt and BMP signaling pathways. Conversely, adult astrocytes (P120) are enriched in terms related to regulation of extracellular matrix assembly and contact inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>). In all we found both the number of genes and the GO terms common to all ages constitute about 50% of all terms identified for each age, while genes and GO terms unique to each age consist less than 10% of all terms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1F and G</xref>). These results demonstrate that astrocytes perform their core functions across all developmental stages similarly, with several age-specific functions that turn on and off depending on the developmental stage and the environment in the VC.</p><p>An important analysis to be performed with this dataset is determining the temporal expression changes of known astrocyte genes, for example, to identify potential astrocyte markers that are either global or age specific. We found that <italic>Apoe</italic> and <italic>Cst3</italic> are the most highly expressed genes in astrocytes at all ages (peak FPKM ~10,000; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata1">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>), while amongst highly expressed astrocyte genes (FPKM &gt;100) <italic>Lars2</italic> is the most astrocyte-enriched gene at all ages (astro IP/ input ~40; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E</xref>). These genes are highly expressed in adult astrocytes across multiple brain regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Morel et al., 2017</xref>), thus can be potentially utilized to mark or target astrocytes globally. The expression of another well-known astrocytic gene <italic>Aldh1l1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Morel et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref>) is stable across all ages, making it an optimal marker for astrocytes during both development and in the adult (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Srinivasan et al., 2016</xref>). On the other hand, <italic>S100b</italic> expression is upregulated later in development, making it more suitable to mark adult astrocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref>). For genes that encode proteins important for astrocyte function, we found that the metabotropic glutamate receptor <italic>Grm5</italic> (mGluR5) is most highly expressed at P7 and then declines with maturation, confirming previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Catania et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Sun et al., 2013</xref>), while the glutamate transporter <italic>Slc1a2</italic> (Glt1) and the connexins (<italic>Gja1</italic>, <italic>Gjb6</italic>) are significantly upregulated from P14 onwards (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Astrocytic synapse-regulating genes show differential spatio-temporal expression patterns</title><p>Our goal is to characterize how astrocytes regulate synapses, so we next used the astrocyte Ribotag dataset to investigate the developmental expression changes of key synapse-regulating genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1J</xref>). These include astrocyte-secreted thrombospondins (<italic>Thbs</italic>), which induce silent synapse formation. The family members expressed by astrocytes in the CNS show divergent expression, with <italic>Thbs1</italic> being significantly higher at P7 than later ages, whereas <italic>Thbs4</italic> is significantly higher at P120 than P7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1J</xref>). This temporal expression profile fits with previous studies that have demonstrated important roles for <italic>Thbs1</italic> in initial synapse formation at P7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Christopherson et al., 2005</xref>), and suggested roles for <italic>Thbs4</italic> in the adult brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Benner et al., 2013</xref>). Similarly, glypican (<italic>Gpc</italic>) family members have a divergent expression. Though redundant in culture for their ability to regulate immature synapse formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Allen et al., 2012</xref>), <italic>Gpc4</italic> and <italic>Gpc6</italic> show different temporal expression in vivo. While <italic>Gpc4</italic> is most highly expressed at P7 and gradually declines with maturation, <italic>Gpc6</italic> peaks at P14–P28. <italic>Gpc5</italic>, a glypican family member with yet unknown function, has low expression at P7, and is significantly increased at all later ages. Astrocyte-secreted chordin-like 1 (<italic>Chrdl1</italic>) regulates synapse maturation and its expression peaks at P14, confirming previous analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Blanco-Suarez et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1J</xref>). These temporal expression profiles are not limited to factors that promote synapse formation. Astrocyte phagocytic receptors involved in synapse elimination, <italic>Megf10</italic> and <italic>Mertk</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Chung et al., 2013</xref>), significantly increase in expression between P7 and P14, coincident with the initiation of synapse elimination.</p><p>Our RNA sequencing analysis demonstrates that in the developing VC synapse-regulating genes show differential temporal expression patterns. However, whether these levels are equal across astrocytes in all cortical layers throughout development is unknown. During the first postnatal weeks, when astrocytes regulate synapse development, they are still migrating and dividing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Ge et al., 2012</xref>). Yet, how developing astrocytes populate each of the cortical layers, and their ratio relative to other cortical cells across development has not been quantified. To address this, we utilized the well-established mouse line where astrocytes express GFP under the <italic>Aldh1l1</italic> promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Cahoy et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Dougherty et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">John Lin et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Stogsdill et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Tien et al., 2012</xref>). Immunostaining of brain sections from Aldh1l1-GFP mice at P7 and P28 with antibodies against known astrocyte markers ALDH1L1, S100β, and SOX9 showed high overlap between GFP and marker-positive cells, suggesting the majority of astrocytes in the VC express GFP in this mouse line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A–C</xref>), further validating its usage. We quantified astrocyte numbers within each of the six neuronal layers at the developmental time points, which correspond to astrocyte and synapse development throughout the first postnatal month (P1, P4, P7, P14, P28; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A–C</xref>). At birth (P1), very few astrocytes are present, comprising 0.5–2% of the total cell number in the VC (represented as GFP-positive cells as a percentage of all cells marked by the nuclear dye DAPI), with a significantly higher percentage of astrocytes in deeper layers than upper layers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C and D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2sdata1">Figure 2—source data 1A</xref>). The astrocyte percentage increases with development in all cortical layers, peaking at P21–P28. At this time, astrocytes are ~10% of total cell number in layers (L) 2–6, and ~50% in L1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C and D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2sdata1">Figure 2—source data 1A</xref>). As the brain develops, the distance between cells grows to accommodate the increase in cell size and complexity, as evident by a significant decrease in DAPI-positive nuclei per mm<sup>2</sup> of VC that occurs from P1 to P14–P28 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2sdata1">Figure 2—source data 1A</xref>). Despite this decrease in total cell density, the proportion of astrocytes remains constant in all cortical layers and across ages, with the exception of L1–2/3, where it is significantly lower at P1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C and E</xref>). This stability in astrocyte density is likely explained by new astrocytes still being generated in the weeks after birth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Ge et al., 2012</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Astrocytic synapse-regulating genes show differential spatio-temporal expression patterns.</title><p>See also <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplements 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2sdata1">Figure 2—source data 1</xref>.

We have further determined the spatio-temporal expression profile of key astrocyte synapse-regulating factors, identifying divergent developmental and layer-specific expression patterns within the same families of genes. These findings strongly suggest that astrocyte expression of synapse-regulating genes is closely tied to the developmental stage of the cortex, which features both changes in neuronal and astrocyte activities across development. In addition to revealing important information about the developmental changes in expression of synapse-regulating genes, these transcriptomic data can be further utilized to inform further studies on astrocyte development.

Our experiments using cultured astrocytes and neurons show that GPC4 protein secretion from astrocytes is significantly reduced in the presence of neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig4s1sdata1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1—source data 1</xref>) or when astrocytes are incubated with neurotransmitters including glutamate, adenosine, or ATP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig4s1sdata1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1—source data 1</xref>). Others have reported a similar effect on <italic>Gpc4</italic> mRNA expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Hasel et al., 2017</xref>), suggesting that neuronal activity can influence expression and release of synapse-regulating factors from astrocytes. Indeed, significant alterations in the activity patterns of both glutamatergic and GABAergic neurons occurs in the VC at around P14 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Espinosa and Stryker, 2012</xref>). Since the developmental expression changes in <italic>Gpc4</italic> and <italic>Chrdl1</italic> occurred mostly in the upper cortical layers innervated by thalamic neurons, we hypothesized that levels of these genes may be regulated by changes in the activity of thalamic neurons that occur upon eye opening at ~P12, when there is a transition from spontaneous to visually evoked activity in the retina that is relayed via the thalamus to the VC.</p><p>To investigate this, we generated mice where the release of glutamate from thalamocortical terminals in the VC is perturbed by knocking out the vesicular glutamate transporter VGlut2 (<italic>Slc17a6</italic>) from neurons in the dLGN. Knockout of VGlut2 has been previously shown to abolish presynaptic release of glutamate in VGlut2-expressing neurons, in full or conditional knockout mouse models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Wallén-Mackenzie et al., 2010</xref>).

Immunostaining experiments showed a significant decrease in VGLUT2 signal in the VC of VGlut2 cKO mice compared to WT at P14 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). Notably, VGlut2 cKO did not strongly affect the levels of VGLUT1, which marks cortico-cortical connections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Wallén-Mackenzie et al., 2010</xref>), though a small but significant increase in VGLUT1 immunoreactivity was observed in L4, a major target of thalamocortical projections. This suggests that the normal upregulation in VGLUT1 that occurs at P14 across all other cortical layers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) is either intrinsic to the cortical neurons and/or regulated by mechanisms other than dLGN-VC-evoked activity.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Thalamic glutamate release tunes astrocyte expression of synapse-regulating genes.</title><p>See also <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplements 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig4sdata1">Figure 4—source data 1</xref>.

By comparing the genes enriched in each cluster with datasets in the literature, we determined these to anatomically correspond to upper (L1–2/3), middle (mid; L2/3–5), deep (L5–6) layer, and white matter (WM) astrocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Batiuk et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bayraktar et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Lanjakornsiripan et al., 2018</xref>).

We also determined the fractions of astrocytes present in each group and found that this corresponds to the fractions we identified via anatomical cell counts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2D</xref>), showing that the process of nuclear isolation has captured astrocytes in levels that reflect their in vivo abundance. To validate the layer-enriched genes, we took advantage of publicly available in situ hybridization datasets generated by the Allen Brain Institute (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Allen Brain Institute, 2008</xref>; available from <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://developingmouse.brain-map.org/">https://developingmouse.brain-map.org/</ext-link>).

On the other hand, upper and mid astrocytes are the most similar, with about 200 DEGs and twofold log2 FC maximal difference in mRNA level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2E</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig6sdata1">Figure 6—source data 1A and B</xref>). GO terms analysis of genes enriched in each cluster identified between 300 and 600 terms significantly enriched per cluster, with 140 terms that are common to all four clusters, and between 40 and 120 terms that are unique to each cluster (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2F</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig6sdata1">Figure 6—source data 1C</xref>). Terms with the highest gene ratio in the upper astrocyte cluster include pathways related to signal transduction and membrane biogenesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2G</xref>), whereas mid astrocytes are enriched in terms related to GABAergic signaling and PSD95 clustering. Genes belonging to the deep astrocyte cluster are enriched in GO terms related to the regulation of pre- and postsynapse organization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2F</xref>), while WM astrocyte genes are enriched with pathways related to axonal guidance, maintenance, and signaling (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig6sdata1">Figure 6—source data 1C</xref>). Importantly, while there are differences in astrocyte gene expression across layer groups, these are mostly gradients of gene expression, suggesting that the astrocyte layer groups are on a continuum rather than distinct cell types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bayraktar et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">John Lin et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Next, we asked how astrocyte marker, function, and synapse-regulating genes highlighted in the bulk RNAseq dataset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G and H</xref>) are expressed across layers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2I</xref> and J). Overall, we found a positive correlation between levels of gene expression obtained by the two sequencing methods, meaning that genes that were shown to be highly expressed in the bulk dataset (such as <italic>ApoE</italic>) were also highly expressed in the snRNAseq dataset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2I</xref>). Unsurprisingly, sequencing of bulk RNA samples was more sensitive in detecting the low expressed genes, such as <italic>Gpc4</italic>, <italic>Tgfb1,</italic> and <italic>Thbs1</italic>, which were close to the detection threshold in the snRNAseq dataset, precluding statistical analysis. Nevertheless, plotting the total counts per million mapped reads (CPM) levels for <italic>Gpc4</italic>, <italic>Gpc6,</italic> and <italic>Chrdl1</italic> revealed that they matched the spatial analysis performed at the same age (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). <italic>Gpc4</italic> expression is lowest in the upper layer cluster, <italic>Chrdl1</italic> expression is highest in the upper layer cluster, while <italic>Gpc6</italic> levels are similar across all four populations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2J</xref>). For other astrocyte marker, function, and synapse-regulating genes detected in the snRNAseq dataset, most exhibited similar levels of expression in all layer groups, with some notable exceptions. For example, <italic>Gfap</italic> and <italic>Aqp4</italic> expression is higher in deep and WM astrocytes than in upper and mid groups, while the expression of connexin 43 (<italic>Gja1</italic>) is highest in deep layer astrocytes compared to all other groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2I</xref>). Taken together, these results show that wild-type astrocytes are transcriptomically diverse, but not distinct, in the developing VC, in accordance with previous studies in which astrocyte diversity was assessed at a similar developmental stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bayraktar et al., 2020</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>Neuronal and astrocyte activity induces global transcriptomic changes in astrocytes</title><p>Given that we found that astrocyte synapse-regulating genes are regulated by both neuronal and astrocyte activity, we next asked what other astrocyte genes are affected by these activity manipulations. To increase the power of our analysis, we combined the four astrocyte subpopulations into one group for each genotype and used this combined group to identify DEGs between the WT and KO. We found 61 DEGs for the VGlut2 cKO model and 131 DEGs for the Ip3r2 KO model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E–H</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig6sdata1">Figure 6—source data 1D</xref>). Performing the same analysis on two other abundant glial populations, OPCs and microglia, showed 28 DEGs for OPCs and 24 DEGs for microglia in the VGlut2 cKO model, and 38 DEGs for OPCs and 29 DEGs for microglia in the Ip3r2 KO model (not shown), 20–50% of the astrocyte DEG level. This suggests that astrocytes are more sensitive to neuronal activity changes, as well as more profoundly affected by silencing their calcium activity. GO analysis of astrocyte DEGs in both models revealed a broad range of BPs, which go beyond terms that may be associated with synapse regulation, such as ‘response to stimulus,’ ‘cell communication,’ or ‘retrograde axonal transport.’ For example, DEGs in the VGlut2 cKO model are also enriched for BP terms related to nuclear envelope disassembly, and nitric oxide metabolism in the upregulated genes, and copper and zinc ion processing in the downregulated genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig6sdata1">Figure 6—source data 1G</xref>). In the Ip3r2 KO model, upregulated genes are enriched for organic acid biosynthesis, while downregulated genes are enriched in histone modification-related BPs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig6sdata1">Figure 6—source data 1G</xref>).</p><p>Next, as our smFISH analysis of <italic>Gpc4</italic>, <italic>Gpc6,</italic> and <italic>Chrdl1</italic> showed that they are regulated in opposite ways by neuronal and astrocyte activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref>), we asked whether the DEGs identified by snRNAseq show any overlap between the two models. We found a total of 19 DEGs common to both the VGlut2 cKO and Ip3r2 KO models (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6H</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig6sdata1">Figure 6—source data 1D</xref>). Only one gene was commonly upregulated, and only three genes commonly downregulated (21% of total common DEGs), while the remaining 15 genes showed opposing changes, similar to <italic>Gpc4</italic> and <italic>Chrdl1</italic> (79% of common DEGs; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6H</xref> heatmap). The same effect of opposing changes is observed when the overlap between the enriched GO terms was compared (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3C</xref>). For example, the term ‘intracellular signal transduction’ (GO:0035556) is enriched in the downregulated gene list in the VGlut2 cKO model, whereas in the Ip3r2 KO model it is enriched in the upregulated gene list (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig6sdata1">Figure 6—source data 1G</xref>).</p><p>Since we found that neuronal but not astrocyte activity is important for regulating layer-specific expression of <italic>Gpc4</italic>, <italic>Gpc6,</italic> and <italic>Chrdl1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>), we next asked if this is true for other DEGs identified in the snRNAseq dataset in each model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6I and J</xref>). To address this, we compared the list of neuronal or astrocyte activity-regulated genes with the list of layer-enriched genes from the WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6I and J</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig6sdata1">Figure 6—source data 1E</xref>) and identified 43 common genes in the VGlut2 cKO model (70% of all cKO/WT DEGs; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6I</xref>) and 101 common DEGs in the Ip3r2 model (77% of all KO/WT DEGs; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6J</xref>). In contrast to our expectation of finding layer-dependent expression changes only in the VGlut2 cKO model, we found that in each model a subset of genes show a dysregulated layer expression when activity is altered. For example, expression of <italic>Mapk10</italic> is lowest in WM astrocytes in the WT; however, in astrocytes from the VGlut2 cKO <italic>Mapk10</italic> is upregulated in WM astrocytes compared to deep (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6I</xref>). Similarly, the expression of <italic>Pde10a</italic> in the Ip3r2 KO model WT group is higher in the upper astrocyte group than other groups, while in the KO the level in that group is now low (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6J</xref>). WT expression of the gene <italic>Gm47283</italic> is higher in the upper than deep layer group, while in the VGlut2 cKO, <italic>Gm47283</italic> is upregulated in all groups, and the relative expression between layers is maintained (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6I</xref>). A similar pattern is observed in the Ip3r2 KO model for the gene <italic>Stk38I</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6J</xref>). Thus, perturbation of neuronal or astrocyte activity influences the layer enrichment of some but not all genes, without causing gross rearrangement of overall astrocyte spatial identity.</p><p>Further, while the expression of <italic>Gpc4</italic>, <italic>Gpc6,</italic> and <italic>Chrdl1</italic> shows opposite levels in VGlut2 cKO mice to those seen during normal development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>), astrocyte activity does not regulate these genes in the same way (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). To test if this is a general phenomenon beyond synapse-regulating genes, we took advantage of the bulk RNAseq dataset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata1">Figure 1—source data 1A</xref>) and calculated the FC in gene expression of WT astrocytes between the time points P7 and P14 (FC P14/P7; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3D and E</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig6sdata1">Figure 6—source data 1F</xref>). We compared the DEG lists of VGlut2 cKO and Ip3r2 KO models against the genes that are significantly up- or downregulated at P14 compared to P7 in the bulk data in search for common genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3D and E</xref>). This identified 30 DEGs from the VGlut2 cKO dataset (52% of all cKO/WT DEGs, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3D</xref>) and 57 genes from the Ip3r2 KO dataset (44% of all KO/WT DEGs, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3E</xref>). Comparing the direction of expression changes between normal development and the VGlut2 cKO DEGs, we observed that 70% of common genes were regulated in the opposite direction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3D</xref>, middle panel), similar to <italic>Gpc4</italic>, <italic>Gpc6,</italic> and <italic>Chrdl1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>), suggesting strong dependence of astrocyte developmental maturation on neuronal cues. On the other hand, Ip3r2 KO data showed 50% of genes displaying the same directionality as during normal development, and the other 50% showing the opposite regulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3E</xref>). Taken together, these results show that during development astrocyte-neuron communication enacts global gene expression changes in astrocytes, going beyond synapse-regulating genes.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In this study, we demonstrate how astrocytes and synapses develop together in the postnatal mouse VC, signaling to one another to ensure correct development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>).

During this time, many changes are occurring in astrocytes, as well as in the synapses between neighboring neurons. We observed that the most significant change in astrocytes at the transcriptome level occurred between the first and second postnatal weeks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Similarly, an analysis of the synaptic proteome during development showed the largest difference between P9 and P15 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Gonzalez-Lozano et al., 2016</xref>), suggesting similar or overlapping regulatory mechanisms in both astrocytes and neurons. In addition to the transcriptomic changes, astrocyte numbers are also strongly regulated during development. Indeed, genes upregulated at P14 are uniquely enriched in GO terms related to cell proliferation and migration (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata1">Figure 1—source data 1B</xref>). Interestingly, the density of astrocytes remains fairly constant throughout development, suggesting that their expansion rate is correlated with the overall expansion of the brain tissue. The mechanisms that regulate these migration patterns are still unknown and seem to be largely unaffected by neuronal or astrocyte activity, as evident from the similar numbers of astrocytes within each cortical layer in both neuronal and astrocyte activity manipulation models tested here (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). Future studies will determine the factors or sets of factors that regulate the number and location of astrocytes within defined domains.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Astrocytes form diverse populations in the developing mouse VC</title><p>The diversity of neurons based on location, morphology, connectivity, and activity patterns has been extensively studied for decades, with multiple subtypes of excitatory and inhibitory neurons identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Kepecs and Fishell, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Migliore and Shepherd, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Zeisel et al., 2015</xref>). For a long time, cortical protoplasmic astrocytes were viewed as a homogeneous population. However, recent studies looking in-depth at astrocyte heterogeneity using both bulk and single-cell sequencing approaches have shown that within the cortex astrocytes form a heterogeneous population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Batiuk et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bayraktar et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Lanjakornsiripan et al., 2018</xref>). Unlike neurons, astrocytes do not fall into the six-layer categories, but rather exist on a gradient of transcriptomically separable yet overlapping groups. Indeed, our snRNAseq data shows that the biggest differences are between astrocytes of the upper and deep layer groups, while upper and mid-layer groups are the most similar (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C and D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2A and E</xref>). Nevertheless, we have identified several astrocyte population marker genes (such as <italic>Dcc</italic> or <italic>Kcnd2</italic>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig6sdata1">Figure 6—source data 1A and B</xref>), which are significantly enriched in one group over others. Before performing functional studies based on these genes, further characterization is required, for example, cross-referencing these genes with our bulk RNA sequencing dataset to identify astrocyte-enriched genes and performing immunohistochemistry (IHC) to determine if protein expression is also heterogeneous. These validated genes could then be used to target specific populations of astrocytes, similar to the methods employed for neurons, in order to manipulate astrocytes that interact with specific synapse types or circuits. Importantly, while blocking thalamocortical activity did alter the expression of multiple genes in astrocytes, it did not alter the layer patterning of the cells, showing that this is not a major factor in driving layer-enriched gene expression. Indeed, altering the identity of local cortical neurons by using <italic>Dab1</italic> KO mice, in which cortical layer neurons are reversed, does alter astrocyte layer identity, suggesting a role for local cues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Lanjakornsiripan et al., 2018</xref>). Our findings further suggest that neuronal activity acts to fine-tune the level of astrocyte genes that are important for neuronal function, rather than determining their presence or absence. Functional studies are further needed to identify the precise neuronal activity patterns that govern astrocyte-neuron reciprocal communication.</p><p>Moreover, some of the synapse-regulating genes we profiled display layer-specific expression changes across development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). We found a correlation between <italic>Chrdl1</italic> upregulation in the upper layers with that of GLUA2, consistent with our previous findings regarding <italic>Chrdl1</italic> regulation of GLUA2 levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Blanco-Suarez et al., 2018</xref>). A more complex picture emerges for <italic>Gpc4</italic>, <italic>Gpc6</italic>, and GLUA1, the AMPAR subunit regulated by these factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Allen et al., 2012</xref>). GLUA1 protein levels steadily increase across development, peaking in most layers at P7, and do not show downregulation at P14 in L1 (as was observed for <italic>Gpc4</italic>), or upregulation in deeper layers (as was shown for <italic>Gpc6</italic>). Still, changes in <italic>Gpc4</italic> expression are contributing to the levels of GLUA1, as GLUA1 is affected in correlation with changes in <italic>Gpc4</italic> expression in the neuronal and astrocyte activity-deficit models (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref>), and GLUA1 levels are reduced in the VC of <italic>Gpc4</italic> KO mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Farhy-Tselnicker et al., 2017</xref>). One possibility is that <italic>Gpc4</italic> and <italic>Gpc6</italic> may regulate GLUA1 levels at specific synapses, such as glutamatergic terminals onto interneurons in L1, or deep layer cortical neurons, making it hard to distinguish their specific effect when analyzing synapses as a group. Alternatively, they may be required to induce initial recruitment of GLUA1 to synaptic sites, but not for its maintenance, so GLUA1 levels remain stable when <italic>Gpc4</italic> is downregulated with development.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Neuronal and astrocyte activity modulate transcriptomic changes in astrocytes</title><p>Ever since the astrocyte-derived factors that promote synapse formation were identified, an outstanding question in the field has been, how are they regulated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Baldwin and Eroglu, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Farhy-Tselnicker and Allen, 2018</xref>)? Is it astrocyte-intrinsic, or is it driven by changes in neuronal activity that occur as synapses develop? Our in vitro work, together with previously published studies, has provided evidence that neuronal activity can influence astrocyte gene expression and function at the synapse (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Benediktsson et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Bernardinelli et al., 2014b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Durkee and Araque, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Hasel et al., 2017</xref>). However, how this occurs in the developing brain in vivo has not been systematically addressed. Here, we approached this question by perturbing the activity of thalamocortical projections (through VGlut2 knockout), with a goal of manipulating signals that have the potential to regulate astrocytic developmental gene expression under physiological conditions. Indeed, this perturbation resulted in attenuation of the developmental expression changes in astrocyte genes as well as AMPAR subunits at P14 but not at P7, suggesting a disruption in circuit maturation. A similar outcome on neuronal and astrocyte maturation was observed in studies employing visual deprivation methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Albanese et al., 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Desai et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Freire, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Funahashi et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Ishikawa et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Ko et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Müller, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Stogsdill et al., 2017</xref>). Future strategies including manipulation of neuronal and astrocyte function using opto- or chemogenetic approaches will further elucidate the role of astrocyte-neuron interaction in circuit development and maturation.</p><p>An additional important regulation of astrocyte gene expression (including <italic>Gpc4</italic> and <italic>Chrdl1</italic>) revealed here is by IP3R2-mediated astrocyte calcium activity, a central mechanism for astrocytic somal calcium increases, and as such, a likely candidate to modulate gene expression changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Petravicz et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Srinivasan et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Yu et al., 2020</xref>). Interestingly, blunting store-mediated astrocytic calcium release (through Ip3r2 knockout) resulted in an opposite regulation of gene expression to the ones observed in the VGlut2 cKO mice and did not correspond to layer-specific developmental changes, suggesting a more global role of astrocyte calcium activity in the regulation of gene expression. This is likely due to the overall diminished signaling that occurs in this knockout model in response to multiple neurotransmitters that rely on calcium increases, and in future, systematic deletion of individual receptors will be necessary to tease out the impact of each neurotransmitter on astrocyte gene expression and synapse regulation. Notably, while we observed significant effects on <italic>Gpc4</italic> and <italic>Chrdl1</italic> mRNA levels, <italic>Gpc6</italic> expression was unaltered in Ip3r2 KO VC at P14, suggesting distinct regulation of expression of the two glypican family members, and synapse-modulating genes in general. The mechanisms underlying these effects are unknown and likely involve activation of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent cellular cascades and transcription factors. Indeed, several such genes were identified in our snRNAseq dataset including <italic>Mapk10</italic> and <italic>Pde4b</italic>, and will form the focus of future studies. Previous work in the adult striatum found that increasing astrocytic calcium through activation of exogenous Gi-GPCRs using DREADDs induces transient synapse formation by regulating expression of thrombospondin 1, with no effect on <italic>Gpc4</italic> or <italic>Chrdl1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Nagai et al., 2019</xref>), suggesting specific dependence of age, region, and environmental cues on types of genes regulated by calcium activity. Furthermore, in addition to altered gene expression in astrocytes, we observed diminished levels of presynaptic markers VGLUT1 and VGLUT2 in Ip3r2 KO mice, suggesting that in addition to having intrinsic roles in regulating astrocytic gene expression IP3R2-mediated activity has a non-cell-autonomous effect on nearby neurons. These data may suggest that behavioral deficits observed in Ip3r2 KO mice could stem from the developmental alterations in synaptogenesis caused by lack of astrocyte calcium responses. Importantly, the activity-mediated regulation of astrocytic gene expression observed here appears to extend beyond synapse development as DEGs identified in the snRNAseq analysis of VGlut2 cKO and Ip3r2 KO mice span multiple cellular processes, including signal transduction, metabolism, and gene regulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3A–C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig6sdata1">Figure 6—source data 1G</xref>). Many of these genes may potentially be involved in regulating synapses, and further studies are required to characterize the most promising candidate genes identified here (such as <italic>Sltm</italic>, <italic>Gm47283</italic>). This will help to determine the precise role of thalamocortical and astrocytic calcium-dependent transcriptomic changes in regulating the different aspects of both astrocyte and synapse function.</p><p>In all, this study demonstrates that the correct formation of synapses and hence neuronal circuit connectivity depends on precise communication between neurons and astrocytes, where disruption in one cell type leads to disruption in the other and an overall dysregulation of synapse formation. It further shows that astrocyte regulation of synapses is intimately linked to environmental changes. Thus, an image of astrocyte identity emerges as highly plastic and dynamic cells, actively perceiving and responding to their environment. Future studies employing functional approaches such as electrophysiology, optogenetic manipulations, and behavior are needed to determine the precise nature of astrocyte plasticity and to further distinguish intrinsic and extrinsic influences on these cells, giving further insight into their function in both health and disease.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4"

Using a combination of bulk RNAseq and detailed histology, the authors report the changing astrocyte transcriptome during VC development and show the expression of key synaptogenic genes are both timepoint and layer specific during development. This study provides an essential resource for understanding how astrocytes change and impact the development of VC circuits.The authors further demonstrate that neuronal cell-type and astrocyte interactions drive VC development and has implications for brain development. This study will be of broad interest to the fields of neuroscience and glial biology.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Activity-Dependent Modulation of Synapse-Regulating Genes in Astrocytes&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, including Beth Stevens as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Lu Chen as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>This is an excellent paper that will provide a new framework for understanding how neurons shape developing astrocytes in the cortex. The experiments are well done and rigorous.</p><p>Overall, this is a very valuable study that needs some clarification and follow up that could be accomplished with a straightforward set of revisions without the necessity of new experiments.

There are a few minor comments that would be worth fixing or clarifying:</p><p>1. Could the authors comment on the potential astrocyte coverage of Aldh1l1-Cre v Gfap-Cre? Why did the authors use the latter? Figure S1 does go into detail regarding specificity of this line, but I wonder how many of these stainings label astrocyte subtypes v pan astrocytes?</p><p>2. When describing the RNAseq results, could the authors avoid the term &quot;most astrocyte specific&quot; when describing eg. Lars2. Given the absence of other cell-types analyzed, maybe highly enriched would be more appropriate.</p><p>3. In the paper, the authors show beautiful GFP+smFISH images. However, the protocol section of paper does not appear to describe how they did this? In our experience RNAscope on fresh frozen tissue with the protease digestions described results in no endogenous GFP signal. Could the authors clarify this? If they developed a modified protocol it would be of immense use to the field.</p><p>4. For the scRNAseq analysis, it would be helpful for reader to display some of the astrocyte subclustering in a 2-dimensional fashion (eg. UMAP/tSNE) with the conditions and clusters labelled.</p><p>5. Finally give the extensive data in this paper and the lack of figure limits at <italic>eLife</italic>, could the authors create a summary schematic of their work and model? I think this would be very helpful for the reader.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>This is an excellent paper that is appropriate for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>. Just a few minor points that need to be addressed:</p><p>1) In Figure 4 they manipulate neuronal activity and in parallel assess how the expression of synaptogenic genes expression. In this experiment, they should demonstrate that neuonral activity is actually altered. This can be done with field recordings with ephys or cFos staining of neurons. Also, have the authors considered a gain of neuronal activity experiment? The Vglut2-KO is a classic loss of neuronal activity paradigm, but it would be interesting to see what happened to these important genes with a gain of activity study---this could be achieved with a GqDREADD or ChR manipulation. I would predict that increased neuronal would have the opposite effect on these important genes.</p><p>2) They infer in figures 4/5 that astrocyte or neuronal activity regulates expression of GPC or Thbs family members, but there is no molecular or transcriptional mechanism pursued. This is totally fine, but I think a few sentences in the discussion that speculates about transcription factors regulate these genes and how their expression is linked to Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses in astrocytes will help the reader.</p><p>3) The data in figure 6 is quite nice. However it seems like the authors should attempt to validate some top genes or layer specific genes. It would be great if they could unequivocally prove that some of these genes that came up in their profiling studies are in fact activity or layer specific.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Specific changes and clarifications:</p><p>1. Since the authors clearly showed distinct spatial transcriptional profiles of synapse-regulating genes in VC of VGlut 2 cKO and Ip3r2 cKO mice in Figure 4 and Figure 5 and investigated transcriptional changes in astrocytes of these mice by snRNA-seq in Figure 6 and Figure S9, it would be useful to pick two genes from Figure 6h (e.g. Sltm and Gm47283) that are clearly different from genotypes and validate them with FISH. If they have data along these lines they should add it. If they don't they could mention this as future hypothesis-driven work enabled by the current work.</p><p>2. In relation to Figure 6c, it would be useful to show gene expression of Gpc4, Gpc6, Chrdl1 in these cell clusters. This could be added to the sup info.</p><p>3. Figure 1, Figure S1: Do they have immunohistochemical analysis for cell-type specific expression of Rpl22-HA for P7 mice like they showed for P28? Or is the specificity based on RNA-seq from Figure S1D? Just a few clarification sentences needed.</p><p>4. Figure S1E: Rational for definition of astrocyte-specific genes (FPKM&gt;100) is not clear compared with astrocyte-enriched genes. Please add a few clear sentences to the results about what is meant by astrocyte-specific versus astrocyte-enriched and how these two things were defined.</p><p>5. Figure S2A: Please clarify the cortical layer from which the image panels were gathered.</p><p>6. In Figure 4C, the vGlut1 expression in deep layers in VC looks lower in VGlut2 cKO mice, although the average data clearly show this is not the case. Could this be due to gray scale pixel values for the representative images? Please double check.</p><p>7. In Figure 4J and 4N, the colocalization of VGlut1/GluA or VGlut1/GluA2 is unclear. It is probably necessary to show zoomed-in images to make this cleaerer. This is also true for Figure 5I and 5M.</p><p>8. In Figure 4B, C what are the units of the x-axis? Is it VGlut2 signal intensity (a.u.) / um<sup>2</sup>? Something seems to be missing from the label. Also in Figure 4C.</p><p>9. On page 7 and in other places, when reporting data from FISH, best to show areas rounded up to 1 decimal place for areas rather than 2 decimal places? For small areas of a couple of um, it is unlikely that areas are accurate to two decimal places.</p><p>10. The discussion could include a paragraph discussing the limitations of the study that could be addressed in future work (e.g. functional studies and validation with immunohistochemistry).</p><p>11. One of the interesting findings from the work is that astrocytes and other cells from Ip3R2 ko mice display changes in synapse-regulating molecules as well as broad changes in gene expression (this latter point was also made recently in pubmed ID 33086039, and this could be cited but it is not critical to do so). This is important for the interpretation of studies where these mice have been used to either show or not show changes in mouse behavior from the angle of astrocyte calcium signals. The authors should add a couple of sentences to the discussion to indicate that behavioral changes may have been due to synaptogenic effects rather than astrocyte calcium signaling as such. This would be valuable to include as a discussion point.</p><p>12. I wonder if panels Figure 1SG and H could be added to Figure 1 to round it out from the view of common and age specific GO terms and pathways? Also in Figure 1F, how many genes were shared between developmental stages and how many were unique to each? Could this be shown near Figure 1F.</p><p>Overall, this is a very valuable study that needs a few more clarifications that could be accomplished with a straightforward set of revisions without the necessity of new experiments.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.70514.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>This is an excellent paper that will provide a new framework for understanding how neurons shape developing astrocytes in the cortex.

Why did the authors use the latter? Figure S1 does go into detail regarding specificity of this line, but I wonder how many of these stainings label astrocyte subtypes v pan astrocytes?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for raising this important point. In our previous work, we characterized the Aldh1l1-cre line and found a robust neuronal recombination at P3 in the visual cortex (Farhy-Tselnicker et al. Neuron. FigS6<sup>1</sup>), making this line unsuitable for targeting astrocytes in this region during early postnatal development. In the same study, we compared two GFAP-cre lines, GFAP-cre 77.6 and GFAP-cre 73.12, and found that while both had high specificity for astrocytes at P3, they had differing efficiency, with the 77.6 line labeling far fewer astrocytes than the 73.12 line. This led us to choose the GFAP-cre 73.12 line for the Ribotag experiments in this study presented in Figure 1. As shown in Figure 1 —figure supplement 1C, greater than 95% of astrocytes in the visual cortex at P28 (marked by S100β) are also immuno-positive for HA-tagged ribosomes, demonstrating the majority of astrocytes are expressing the transgene showing high coverage. We have added a sentence highlighting this point into the Results section lines 109-113. In the case of the Aldh1l1-GFP line used for smFISH analysis of astrocyte genes in Figure 2, we performed immunostaining against a panel of astrocyte markers (Figure 2—figure supplement 1 S2A-C), finding a high overlap between GFP expressing cells and astrocyte markers. These results suggest high coverage of the astrocyte population in this mouse line, a point we have emphasized on lines 201-204.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. When describing the RNAseq results, could the authors avoid the term &quot;most astrocyte specific&quot; when describing eg. Lars2. Given the absence of other cell-types analyzed, maybe highly enriched would be more appropriate.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for pointing out that this term could be misconstrued. We have updated the text accordingly (lines 155-158) and added the fold change level to emphasize the level of enrichment in astrocytes vs all cortical cells.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. In the paper, the authors show beautiful GFP+smFISH images. However, the protocol section of paper does not appear to describe how they did this? In our experience RNAscope on fresh frozen tissue with the protease digestions described results in no endogenous GFP signal. Could the authors clarify this? If they developed a modified protocol it would be of immense use to the field.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this comment, and apologize for the lack of clarity in the methods section. The smFISH was performed on 4% PFA fixed tissue that was processed using cryo-sectioning to generate brain sections. We then followed the ACDbio protocol for fixed-frozen tissue with some modifications. We found this method to be very robust for young mice (up to P28) used in this study. For older ages an antigen retrieval step is required, which quenches the endogenous GFP signal. We have revised and expanded this part of the methods section under “single-molecule fluorescent in situ hybridization (smFISH) (line 1132) to further explain the modifications used.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. For the scRNAseq analysis, it would be helpful for reader to display some of the astrocyte subclustering in a 2-dimensional fashion (eg. UMAP/tSNE) with the conditions and clusters labelled.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this suggestion. We have added UMAP plots showing the 4 astrocyte clusters for each genetic model to Figure 6C and Figure 6—figure supplement 2A.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. Finally give the extensive data in this paper and the lack of figure limits at eLife, could the authors create a summary schematic of their work and model? I think this would be very helpful for the reader.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this excellent suggestion. We created an additional figure (Figure 7) containing the schematic of the work.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>This is an excellent paper that is appropriate for publication in eLife. Just a few minor points that need to be addressed:</p><p>1) In Figure 4 they manipulate neuronal activity and in parallel assess how the expression of synaptogenic genes expression. In this experiment, they should demonstrate that neuonral activity is actually altered. This can be done with field recordings with ephys or cFos staining of neurons. Also, have the authors considered a gain of neuronal activity experiment? The Vglut2-KO is a classic loss of neuronal activity paradigm, but it would be interesting to see what happened to these important genes with a gain of activity study---this could be achieved with a GqDREADD or ChR manipulation. I would predict that increased neuronal would have the opposite effect on these important genes.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for these insightful comments. Diminishing neuronal activity via VGlut2 knockout is an established paradigm that has been validated in other studies, as cited in the manuscript (lines 329-331), prompting us to use this same approach for our study. However, we agree that determining the specific change in neuronal activity pattern in the visual cortex in the absence of thalamic glutamate release, and how this regulates astrocyte gene expression, is an important next step. We have added a sentence to the Discussion explaining this point, lines 702-703.</p><p>Concerning gain of neuronal activity, we completely agree with the reviewer’s prediction. This is further supported by our experiments using cultured neurons and astrocytes, which show a decrease in Gpc4 protein secretion from astrocytes co-cultured with neurons compared to cultured alone (Figure 4—figure supplement 1A). To investigate if this is due to neurotransmitters acting on astrocytes, and thus linked to neuronal activity, we performed an additional set of experiments where we treated cultured astrocytes with neurotransmitters to mimic increased neuronal activity (new Figure 4—figure supplement 1B). These data show that Gpc4 secretion from astrocytes is also decreased in the presence of the neuro-transmitters glutamate, adenosine or ATP (Figure 4—figure supplement 1B; line 315). This suggests, that in vivo, the decrease observed in Gpc4 expression at P14 stems from alterations in the neuronal activity pattern between P7 and P14. Future work employing neuronal and astrocyte activation in vivo using the methods suggested by the reviewer is needed to further expand on these findings. We have added sentences to the Discussion about this point, lines 739, 785.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) They infer in figures 4/5 that astrocyte or neuronal activity regulates expression of GPC or Thbs family members, but there is no molecular or transcriptional mechanism pursued. This is totally fine, but I think a few sentences in the discussion that speculates about transcription factors regulate these genes and how their expression is linked to Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses in astrocytes will help the reader.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this important comment. We revised the discussion to include these points (lines 757-760).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The data in figure 6 is quite nice. However it seems like the authors should attempt to validate some top genes or layer specific genes. It would be great if they could unequivocally prove that some of these genes that came up in their profiling studies are in fact activity or layer specific.</p></disp-quote><p>To validate this data, we took advantage of the publicly available in situ hybridization database of the developing mouse brain generated by the Allen Brain Institute (https://mouse.brain-map.org/). This dataset contains in situ hybridization images for a selection of genes important for brain development, including at P14, the time when our snRNAseq analysis was performed. Cross-referencing the putative layer-enriched genes against the developmental database identified several genes including Kcnd2, Id3 and Gfap, whose expression pattern in the VC matched their predicted layer localization in our dataset. These images are added to Figure 6—figure supplement 2B and text modified accordingly on lines 518-523.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>Specific changes and clarifications</p><p>1. Since the authors clearly showed distinct spatial transcriptional profiles of synapse-regulating genes in VC of VGlut 2 cKO and Ip3r2 cKO mice in Figure 4 and Figure 5 and investigated transcriptional changes in astrocytes of these mice by snRNA-seq in Figure 6 and Figure S9, it would be useful to pick two genes from Figure 6h (e.g. Sltm and Gm47283) that are clearly different from genotypes and validate them with FISH. If they have data along these lines they should add it. If they don't they could mention this as future hypothesis-driven work enabled by the current work.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this important comment. We agree that upon validation, these data may form the basis of important functional studies around the roles of activity-regulated genes in astrocytes. We have updated the discussion to emphasize these points and to discuss potential future directions (line 689; line 774).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. In relation to Figure 6c, it would be useful to show gene expression of Gpc4, Gpc6, Chrdl1 in these cell clusters. This could be added to the sup info.</p></disp-quote><p>These data are shown as dot plots in Figure 6—figure supplement 2I. Unfortunately, the sensitivity of the snRNAseq assay resulted in low detection of Gpc4 and Chrdl1 genes. Nevertheless, we plotted total CPM values of these genes as a heatmap, and found that their expression levels in each cluster match up to our in situ hybridization data at P14, namely, Gpc4 expression is lowest in the upper layer cluster, Chrdl1 expression is highest in the upper layer cluster, and Gpc6 expression is similar across all clusters. While the lack of statistical significance precludes making strong conclusions based on these data, the trend and similarity to the smFISH results are reassuring. The heatmap is shown in Figure 6—figure supplement 2J, and text edited accordingly (lines 551-557).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. Figure 1, Figure S1: Do they have immunohistochemical analysis for cell-type specific expression of Rpl22-HA for P7 mice like they showed for P28? Or is the specificity based on RNA-seq from Figure S1D? Just a few clarification sentences needed.</p></disp-quote><p>The specificity at P7 is based on the RNAseq data from Figure S1D (moved to Figure 1—figure supplement 1A in the revised version of the manuscript). While we did obtain IHC example images showing HA tag expression in astrocytes for P7 (as shown in Figure 1B), quantification was only performed at P28. To clarify this, we edited the text accordingly (lines 107-113), and edited the figure to show the RNA-seq data first, and IHC data second.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. Figure S1E: Rational for definition of astrocyte-specific genes (FPKM&gt;100) is not clear compared with astrocyte-enriched genes. Please add a few clear sentences to the results about what is meant by astrocyte-specific versus astrocyte-enriched and how these two things were defined.</p></disp-quote><p>We have edited the text to clarify this point and removed the wording “astrocyte specific” as suggested by Reviewer 1 (lines 155-158). In this dataset genes with an FPKM&gt;100 were ranked by their enrichment score (FPKM in astrocyte/all cells i.e. input). These criteria were chosen to emphasize genes that are robustly expressed by and enriched in astrocytes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. Figure S2A: Please clarify the cortical layer from which the image panels were gathered.</p></disp-quote><p>The images were taken from mid cortical layers L2-4. We added this information to the panel header in Figure 1—figure supplement 1D.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. In Figure 4C, the vGlut1 expression in deep layers in VC looks lower in VGlut2 cKO mice, although the average data clearly show this is not the case. Could this be due to gray scale pixel values for the representative images? Please double check.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for pointing this out. Upon inspection of the representative images we found that indeed, the gray scale values were not the same in the two images. We corrected this issue, as can be seen in the revised image in Figure 4C.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7. In Figure 4J and 4N, the colocalization of VGlut1/GluA or VGlut1/GluA2 is unclear. It is probably necessary to show zoomed-in images to make this cleaerer. This is also true for Figure 5I and 5M.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added a new panel showing zoomed in colocalization images of synaptic markers in Figures 4, 5, Figure 4—figure supplement 2 and Figure 5—figure supplement 1. For images in Figure 4—figure supplement 2 which show triple colocalization, we changed the pseudo-color of Bassoon to green to further enhance visibility of colocalization.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8. In Figure 4B,C what are the units of the x-axis? Is it VGlut2 signal intensity (a.u.) / um<sup>2</sup>? Something seems to be missing from the label. Also in Figure 4C.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for this oversight, and have corrected the X axis label in both Figure 4B and C to the correct units: thresholded area per um<sup>2</sup>.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9. On page 7 and in other places, when reporting data from FISH, best to show areas rounded up to 1 decimal place for areas rather than 2 decimal places? For small areas of a couple of um, it is unlikely that areas are accurate to two decimal places.</p></disp-quote><p>We have rounded all the smFISH data presented in the manuscript to 1 decimal place.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10. The discussion could include a paragraph discussing the limitations of the study that could be addressed in future work (e.g. functional studies and validation with immunohistochemistry).</p></disp-quote><p>We revised the Discussion section as suggested, and added future experiments to expand and support this study’s findings for each subsection, including:</p><p>Line 689: “Before performing functional studies based on these genes further characterization is required, for example cross-referencing these genes with our bulk RNA sequencing dataset to identify astrocyte-enriched genes, and performing immunohistochemistry to determine if protein is also heterogeneous.”</p><p>Line 702: “Functional studies are further needed to identify the precise neuronal activity patterns that govern astrocyte-neuron reciprocal communication.”</p><p>Line 739: “Future strategies including manipulation of neuronal and astrocyte function using opto- or chemogenetic approaches will further elucidate the role of astrocyte-neuron interaction in circuit development and maturation”.</p><p>Line 785: “Future studies employing functional approaches such as electrophysiology, optogenetic manipulations and behavior are needed to determine the precise nature of astrocyte plasticity and to further distinguish intrinsic and extrinsic influences on these cells giving further insight into their function in both health and disease.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>11. One of the interesting findings from the work is that astrocytes and other cells from Ip3R2 ko mice display changes in synapse-regulating molecules as well as broad changes in gene expression (this latter point was also made recently in pubmed ID 33086039, and this could be cited but it is not critical to do so). This is important for the interpretation of studies where these mice have been used to either show or not show changes in mouse behavior from the angle of astrocyte calcium signals. The authors should add a couple of sentences to the discussion to indicate that behavioral changes may have been due to synaptogenic effects rather than astrocyte calcium signaling as such. This would be valuable to include as a discussion point.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for raising this important point. It is clear that Ip3r2 is crucial for mediating multiple types of astrocyte function, the breadth of which are just now beginning to be elucidated. We have added this point to the Discussion section on lines 764-769 of the manuscript. We also added the suggested citation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>12. I wonder if panels Figure 1SG and H could be added to Figure 1 to round it out from the view of common and age specific GO terms and pathways? Also in Figure 1F, how many genes were shared between developmental stages and how many were unique to each? Could this be shown near Figure 1F.</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested, we have added these panels to the main figure (Figure 1G, H), and created a new venn diagram showing the number of astrocyte enriched genes unique to each age, and common (Figure S1F new label: Figure 1—figure supplement 1F). In addition, we generated a heatmap showing the top 5 genes uniquely enriched in astrocytes at each age, which is presented in Figure 1F. The text has been modified accordingly (Lines 134-151).
