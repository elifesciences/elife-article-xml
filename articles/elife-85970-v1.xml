the stable execution of learned motor skills, and its loss can severely disrupt motor performance. The neural mechanisms that mediate sensorimotor stability have been extensively studied at systems and physiological levels, yet relatively little is known about how disruptions to sensory input alter the molecular properties of associated motor systems. Songbird courtship song, a model for skilled behavior, is a learned and highly structured vocalization that is destabilized following deafening. Here, we sought to determine how the loss of auditory feedback modifies gene expression and its coordination across the birdsong sensorimotor circuit. To facilitate this system-wide analysis of transcriptional responses, we developed a gene expression profiling approach that enables the construction of hundreds of spatially-defined RNA-sequencing libraries. Using this method, we found that deafening preferentially alters gene expression across birdsong neural circuitry relative to surrounding areas, particularly in premotor and striatal regions. Genes with altered expression are associated with synaptic transmission, neuronal spines, and neuromodulation and show a bias toward expression in glutamatergic neurons and <italic>Pvalb/Sst-</italic>class GABAergic interneurons. We also found that connected song regions exhibit correlations in gene expression that were reduced in deafened birds relative to hearing birds, suggesting that song destabilization alters the inter-region coordination of transcriptional states. Finally, lesioning LMAN, a forebrain afferent of RA required for deafening-induced song plasticity, had the largest effect on groups of genes that were also most affected by deafening. Combined, this integrated transcriptomics analysis demonstrates that the loss of peripheral sensory input drives a distributed gene expression response throughout associated sensorimotor neural circuitry and identifies specific candidate molecular and cellular mechanisms that support the stability and plasticity of learned motor skills.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>sensorimotor plasticity</kwd><kwd>songbird</kwd><kwd>gene expression</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>F32NS098809</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Colquitt</surname><given-names>Bradley M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Investigator</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Brainard</surname><given-names>Michael S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Large-scale gene expression analysis of the songbird brain identifies the molecular and cellular features of vocal motor circuits that are altered by the loss of hearing.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The accurate and stable performance of motor skills relies on sensory feedback (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib119">Todorov, 2004</xref>). The loss of this feedback, for example through hearing or vision loss from injury or neurodegeneration, can lead to increased errors in the execution of even well-learned motor behaviors, such as speech and walking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Lane and Webster, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib126">Waldstein, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib137">Wood et al., 2011</xref>). Yet it is poorly understood how such peripheral sensory loss influences the properties of central motor circuits to drive neural plasticity and how these effects in turn influence motor output.</p><p>The courtship song of songbirds, a learned motor skill subserved by a dedicated and discrete neural architecture, offers a tractable system in which to characterize the neural mechanisms that underlie sensorimotor integration and motor skill stability. Juvenile birds produce unstructured and variable vocalizations that, over the course of several months of learning, become more structured, less variable, and more similar to adult song (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Brainard and Doupe, 2013</xref>). In finches, after this developmental learning period, birdsong performance remains extraordinarily consistent from rendition-to-rendition over the course of a bird’s life and is said to be ‘crystallized.’ However, auditory feedback plays an essential role in maintaining this stability; modifying auditory feedback or completely removing auditory input through deafening can drive changes to birdsong (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brainard and Doupe, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brainard and Doupe, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Fukushima and Margoliash, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Leonardo and Konishi, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Lombardino and Nottebohm, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Nordeen and Nordeen, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Okanoya and Yamaguchi, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib120">Tschida and Mooney, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib138">Woolley and Rubel, 1997</xref>). The neural mechanisms that underlie these changes have been studied in terms of physiology and morphology, yet we lack a transcriptome- and circuit-wide understanding of how altered auditory feedback influences gene expression in song sensorimotor circuitry — a critical biological vantage point to understand how sensory information intersects with the nervous system to influence motor plasticity.</p><p>To gain insight into the molecular and cellular factors that regulate the stability of adult birdsong, we analyzed gene expression alterations in birdsong sensorimotor circuitry and surrounding non-song regions in response to deafening, a strong driver of song destabilization. We developed a gene expression profiling approach that enabled large-scale analysis of gene expression in spatially defined brain regions. Using this technique, we identified a suite of expression changes across the song system, including region-specific and common transcriptional responses as well as altered gene expression correlations across regions. Using a previously generated single-cell atlas of the premotor portion of song neural circuitry, we identified the cellular types that experience the greatest transcriptional change following deafening. Finally, we examined how input from a song region required for deafening-induced song plasticity influences gene expression in its song premotor target and found a diverse set of expression changes, with substantial overlap with those elicited by deafening.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Deafening destabilizes birdsong and increases song variability</title><p>Songbirds rely on auditory feedback to maintain the quality of their songs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).

We, therefore, generated a cohort of eighteen adult male Bengalese finches (<italic>Lonchura striata domestica</italic>) that were either deafened through bilateral cochlear removal or underwent a sham surgery (nine birds for each condition, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). This cohort was further divided into sets of birds that were euthanized 4, 9, or 14 days post-procedure (three birds per procedure type and time point). This range of time points was used to generate a diversity of song destabilization values for subsequent gene expression analysis. Birds were euthanized two hours after lights-on. As in previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brainard and Doupe, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Okanoya and Yamaguchi, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib120">Tschida and Mooney, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib138">Woolley and Rubel, 1997</xref>), deafening caused a gradual decay of song quality over the course of several days, while sham surgery induced relatively little song change (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B–H</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A–C</xref>). To visualize deafening-induced changes to a song, we calculated spectrograms for each syllable and used uniform manifold approximate projection (UMAP) to project these spectrograms onto a latent space, using an approach described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Sainburg et al., 2020c</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A–C</xref>). Following deafening, the projections of syllable spectrograms gradually shifted to occupy different locations, indicating a change from a pre-procedure song (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D–H</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A and B</xref>). Syllable spectral changes after deafening were complex but generally trended toward an increase in syllable ‘noisiness’ (Wiener entropy) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D and E</xref>).</p><p>Although adult birdsong is a highly precise motor skill, its features vary slightly from rendition-to-rendition, similar to other motor skills. Past work has demonstrated that this variability is in part generated by central neural mechanisms in the forebrain and is modulated by social context, indicating that song variability is an actively regulated component of birdsong (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Kao et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Kao and Brainard, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Kojima et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Moorman et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Sakata et al., 2008</xref>). To assess how song variability changes following deafening, we focused on a single spectral feature, fundamental frequency (FF), and calculated its coefficient of variation (CV) across renditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1J and K</xref>). Deafening resulted in a gradual increase in the CV of FF (day 7–9 post-procedure mean ± SEM, 57 ± 18%) while sham surgery elicited no change (0.11 ± 2.3%). This increase in rendition-to-rendition FF variability is consistent with reports describing an increase in within-syllable frequency modulation following deafening (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brainard and Doupe, 2001</xref>). These results indicate that deafening elicits both shifts in the structure of song as well as decreases in stereotypy across renditions.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Neural circuit-wide analysis of gene expression</title><p>Birdsong is generated by a dedicated and anatomically discrete neural circuit called the song system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A and B</xref>). This defined architecture allows interrogation of how the molecular and cellular properties of each region (termed ‘song nuclei’) influence and is influenced by birdsong performance and learning. Four primary song nuclei reside in the telencephalon: HVC (proper name), RA (robust nucleus of the arcopallium), LMAN (lateral magnocellular nucleus of the anterior nidopallium), and Area X. HVC and RA comprise the song motor pathway (SMP) and are necessary for song performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Nottebohm et al., 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib111">Simpson and Vicario, 1990</xref>). HVC influences the timing and temporal structure of song and projects to RA, which provides descending motor control of song via projections to syringeal and respiratory brainstem regions, which send recurrent connections back into the SMP to influence spectral and temporal features of the song (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Goldberg and Fee, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib124">Vicario, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib135">Wild, 1993</xref>). HVC also projects to the striatal nucleus Area X that, together with the pallial region LMAN and thalamic region DLM, form the ’anterior forebrain pathway (AFP),’ which contributes to song plasticity both during song acquisition in juveniles and song adaptation in adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Andalman and Fee, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bottjer et al., 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brainard and Doupe, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Charlesworth et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Nordeen and Nordeen, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Scharff and Nottebohm, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib112">Sohrabji et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib130">Warren et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib136">Williams and Mehta, 1999</xref>). Each region is embedded in a larger anatomical domain that lies outside of song control circuitry but shares similar molecular, connectivity, and functional properties (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Feenders et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Helduser et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Kröner and Güntürkün, 1999</xref>). HVC is located in the dorsal part of the caudal nidopallium (NC); RA is located in the arcopallium (Arco.); Area X is located in the striatum (Stri.); and LMAN is located in the rostral nidopallium (NR).

To examine how song destabilization influences gene expression in the song system at both local and circuit levels, we developed a protocol for sample collection and RNA-seq library construction that addresses three goals: (1) precise collection of histologically defined samples, (2) ease of collecting multiple replicates per animal and brain region, and (3) reduced per-sample cost for library preparation and sequencing. This approach, termed Serial Laser Capture RNA-seq (SLCR-seq), combines the anatomical precision of laser capture microdissection (LCM) with the capacity to work with large numbers of low-input RNA samples provided by single-cell RNA-sequencing protocols (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, see Methods). Brains were flash-frozen without fixation and then cryosectioned onto slides suitable for LCM. We visualized song nuclei using an optimized rapid Nissl staining protocol, collected single cryosections from regions of interest in 96-well plates using LCM, then purified total RNA using a custom solid phase reversible immobilization protocol. The preparation produces high-quality RNA (RIN = 9.1 ± 0.5) and yields that are sufficient for library preparation (one 20 μm-thick section with an area of 100,000 μm<sup>2</sup> yields 1–2 ng; RA area is ~125,000 μm<sup>2</sup>). From this total RNA, we then prepared 3’-localized RNA-seq libraries containing unique molecular identifiers adapted from protocols previously developed for single-cell RNA-sequencing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Islam et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Kivioja et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Picelli et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>We used SLCR-seq to generate RNA-seq libraries for each bird from eight brain regions — HVC, RA, LMAN, and Area X, and four paired non-song regions — (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>) with multiple LCM sections (2–6) collected per region per bird, yielding 598 samples after quality control filtering for the number of detected genes in each sample (mean ± s.d. number of sections per region per bird = 4.5 ± 1.5). Gene expression variation across this dataset segregated samples into three broad clusters corresponding to the region of origin — arcopallium (RA and Arco.), nidopallium (HVC, NC, LMAN, and NR), and striatum (Area X and Stri.) — consistent with the different functional properties and developmental origins of these regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). Furthermore, these broad clusters were subdivided into adjacent but distinct song/non-song pairs, reflecting known similarities between song nuclei and adjacent neural regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Nevue et al., 2020</xref>). To further validate this approach, we inspected the SLCR-seq expression values of genes with known variation across the songbird brain or enrichment in the song system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E and F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). The glutamatergic neuron marker <italic>SLC17A6</italic> was strongly depleted in the striatal regions Area X and Stri, consistent with the relative scarcity of excitatory neurons in these regions.

Here, higher values indicate a larger divergence of post-procedure songs compared to pre-procedure songs, therefore providing a measure of song change from baseline. The UMAP quantification used in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> was used to summarize this condensed visual representation into a single statistic. However, we choose Song D<sub>KL</sub> for subsequent analysis over the UMAP-based quantification because Song D<sub>KL</sub> is a previously validated statistical modeling approach that robustly captures alterations to a wide range of song types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Mets and Brainard, 2018</xref>). For each bird, we calculated Song D<sub>KL</sub> between songs recorded during the two days before the procedure (deafening or sham) and those recorded on the day of euthanasia and the preceding day. Deafening resulted in a significant increase in Song D<sub>KL</sub> relative to sham (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, hearing 0.14 ± 0.041 log Song D<sub>KL</sub> mean ± SEM; deaf 0.52 ± 0.085 mean ± SEM, two-sided Wilcoxon rank-sum test p=5e−4).

A subset of hearing and deaf birds showed overlapping Song D<sub>KL</sub> values (three birds in each condition). To detect genes with expression differences associated with song destabilization, we compared birds in each group that had Song D<sub>KL</sub> values outside of this overlapping range (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, six hearing birds with ‘low’ Song D<sub>KL</sub> values, and six deaf birds with ‘high’ Song D<sub>KL</sub> values). In general, birds that had been deafened for longer (9 and 14 days) had Song DKL values outside of the hearing Song D<sub>KL</sub> range while those deafened for less time (4 days) showed less song destabilization. Exceptions to this pattern include one 4-day-deafened bird that showed particularly strong song destabilization and one 9-day-deafened bird that showed modest song change. To identify regional patterns of differential expression, we used a differential expression gene (DEG) score that incorporates the number of differentially expressed genes and their adjusted p-values (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>, see Methods).

Across the song regions, the largest changes to gene expression between high and low Song D<sub>KL</sub> occurred for the forebrain motor output nucleus RA and the striatal component of the song system Area X (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>, red and green bars).

Song destabilization-associated differential gene expression was more similar between song regions than between both song and non-song pairs and non-song regions with each other (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>), indicating that the song system exhibits, in part, a common transcriptional response to song destabilization that is not shared in adjacent regions.

To better identify groups of differentially expressed genes with similar responses to song destabilization, we leveraged the large sample numbers of the SLCR-seq dataset to perform gene-gene correlation network analysis for each region separately using MEGENA (Multiscale Embedded Gene Co-expression Network Analysis), an approach that generates sparse networks of covarying genes by applying a topological constraint to co-expression networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib113">Song and Zhang, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). Using this method, we constructed gene-gene correlation networks for each song and non-song region separately, combining SCLR-seq samples across all birds, both hearing and deafened. Mapping song destabilization fold-change of each gene onto the RA network showed a segregation between genes with increased and decreased expression, indicating that expression differences associated with song destabilization state are prominent drivers of network structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>).

However, the song system is an interconnected neural circuit, and gene expression in one region could be correlated with that in others due to shared patterns of neural activity, common responses to hormonal signaling, or to baseline expression differences across regions that vary in a concerted fashion across individuals. By similar logic, manipulations such as deafening that could disrupt global patterns of neural or hormonal signaling might result in alterations in the patterns of inter-region correlations in gene-expression.</p><p>To determine whether and how deafening alters inter-region correlations in gene expression, we first identified genes that have correlated expression between brain regions across birds.

We identified significant correlations as those that were less than the 2.5% quantile or greater than the 97.5% quantile of a shuffled distribution (see Methods). We calculated the across-bird gene expression similarity between regions as the number of thresholded correlations. This analysis revealed several notable relationships among brain regions. First, each song nucleus had the highest gene correlation strength with its paired non-song region (with the exception of HVC which had generally weaker correlation strengths with other regions), consistent with the shared molecular profiles of each song nucleus with the surrounding tissue. Second, the nuclei of the vocal motor pathway (HVC and RA) and anterior forebrain pathway (LMAN and Area X) were more correlated with each other than with nuclei in the other pathway. Third, normalizing correlation strength for each song nucleus recovered known connections between nuclei (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>): HVC displayed strong correlations with its target RA, and LMAN was strongly correlated with both of its direct targets, RA and Area X.

It is an open question how the different components of speech production neural circuitry respond to hearing loss at various biological levels, from molecular to physiological.</p><p>For the songbird, prior studies have identified a variety of circuit, cellular, and molecular mechanisms that may contribute to deafening-induced song-destabilization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brainard and Doupe, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Kojima et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Mandelblat-Cerf et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Mori and Wada, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Peng et al., 2012a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Peng et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Peng et al., 2012b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Scott et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib120">Tschida and Mooney, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib127">Wang et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib131">Watanabe et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib141">Zhou et al., 2017</xref>). These prior demonstrations, which have focused on a disparate set of song control structures and specific candidate mechanisms, motivated our interest in applying a circuit-wide and unbiased approach in this system to identify molecular responses to auditory deprivation-induced motor destabilization. Understanding these responses in the songbird vocal control system could provide insight into the neural mechanisms underlying the plasticity and resilience of both learned vocalizations and other well-learned motor skills.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Molecular localization of song destabilization</title><p>Past work on the neural mechanisms underlying song plasticity has largely focused on changes occurring in one or two brain regions at a time. Song destabilization in adult songbirds is associated with a variety of changes to the morphology and physiology of neurons in the song system including changes to dendritic spine stability and synapse densities in HVC and RA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib120">Tschida and Mooney, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib141">Zhou et al., 2017</xref>); alterations to song tuning responses in LMAN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Roy and Mooney, 2007</xref>) and decreased synaptic inputs onto and increased intrinsic excitability of HVC projection neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hamaguchi et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib120">Tschida and Mooney, 2012</xref>). Our neural circuit-wide analysis of gene expression responses to deafening allowed us to investigate which regions of the song system show the strongest transcriptional changes during song destabilization, providing a readout of the molecular correlates of neural plasticity. We found that the motor output nucleus RA showed the highest differential expression upon song destabilization, with substantial changes also found in Area X and to a lesser extent in HVC and LMAN. RA lies at the nexus of the motor pathway and the anterior forebrain pathway, a circuit required for song plasticity, and is a major locus of neural plasticity during juvenile song learning and adult song adaptation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Garst-Orozco et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Miller et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Ölveczky et al., 2011</xref>). This position in the song neural circuit makes it well situated to integrate neural activity associated with the stable motor program with AFP-generated contributions to deafening-induced plasticity.</p><p>Some of the most salient pathways upregulated in RA were associated with synaptic transmission and neuron spines, consistent with previous reports that found that deafening increases synapse densities, spine densities, and spine lengths in RA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Peng et al., 2012a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib141">Zhou et al., 2017</xref>). These terms were also enriched to some extent for differentially expressed genes in HVC, in which neurons projecting to Area X exhibit decreased spine stability following deafening (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib120">Tschida and Mooney, 2012</xref>). Past work on several of the top differentially expressed genes in RA supports a general role for altered synapse and spine dynamics during deafening-induced song plasticity. In particular, stathmin 1 (<italic>STMN1</italic>) is located at synapses and binds to tubulin to inhibit microtubule formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Curmi et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">Shumyatsky et al., 2005</xref>). Knockout of <italic>STMN1</italic> in mice results in impaired long-term potentiation in the amygdala and reduced memory in fear-conditioning tasks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">Shumyatsky et al., 2005</xref>). Furthermore, <italic>STMN1</italic> is differentially phosphorylated during fear conditioning, altering its activity and AMPA receptor localization to the synapse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib122">Uchida et al., 2014</xref>). Similarly, the surface glycoprotein <italic>CD24</italic>, which is upregulated in RA, influences neurite outgrowth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Gilliam et al., 2017</xref>) as well as synapse formation and transmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Jevsek et al., 2006</xref>). Lastly, the lipid processing enzyme lipoprotein lipase (<italic>LPL</italic>) is upregulated in RA during song destabilization. Knockouts of <italic>LPL</italic> in mice result in impaired learning and memory, decreased presynaptic vesicles in the hippocampus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib139">Xian et al., 2009</xref>), and reduced AMPA receptor expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib140">Yu et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>The expression of neuropeptides was also broadly reduced following deafening across multiple song nuclei. This result suggests that song plasticity is a product of not only alterations to synapse structure and neurotransmitter-mediated signaling but also changes in neuromodulation. It has not been well-examined how secreted neuropeptides influence birdsong plasticity and neural activity in birdsong neural circuitry. However, extensive evidence garnered in other systems indicates that neuropeptide signaling has a powerful effect on neural circuit activity, plasticity, and behavioral output (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bargmann, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Marder, 2011</xref>). The specific signaling systems altered following deafening in this study provide a set of candidate mechanisms that may influence song. For example, corticotropin-releasing hormone binding protein (<italic>CRHBP</italic>) , one of the most strongly downregulated genes in RA following deafening, modulates activity in the CRH signaling pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Kemp et al., 1998</xref>), which has diverse effects on long-term potentiation, neuronal excitability, and spine dynamics in central circuits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aldenhoff et al., 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Blank et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chen et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Fox and Gruol, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Kratzer et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Li et al., 2016</xref>). Such evidence suggests that the dynamic modulation of neuropeptides could play a prominent role in regulating birdsong stability and plasticity and may similarly influence the control of other stable sensorimotor skills such as human speech.</p><p>Although we included the amount of singing in the two hours prior to euthanasia (a proxy for neural activity in the song system) as a variable in our regression analysis, we cannot fully dissociate the influences of motor destabilization per se and alterations to neural activity driven by the loss of auditory activity. Future work could combine similar circuit-wide gene expression analysis with disruptions to auditory input that do not alter hearing generally (such a delayed auditory feedback [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Leonardo and Konishi, 1999</xref>]) to further characterize song plasticity-specific expression responses. Similarly, manipulations that induce song plasticity without altering hearing, such as tracheosyringeal nerve cuts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Roy and Mooney, 2007</xref>), may help disambiguate motor-vs-auditory expression responses. Ultimately, direct manipulations of gene expression in song regions (through knockdown or overexpression) combined with analyses of song destabilization would help clarify the causal roles of candidate genes in promoting or limiting song plasticity.</p><p>A previous study examined how the loss of auditory input before song learning in juveniles influences gene expression in HVC and RA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Mori and Wada, 2015</xref>). In that work, the authors identify a strong gene expression signature that varies with developmental age but is independent of whether the birds are hearing or deaf. Follow-up experiments examined the expression of a subset of developmentally-regulated genes between hearing and adult-deafened birds (similar to the approach used here) and found no significant change. That work identified an important separation between developmentally-driven and experience-dependent molecular responses in the song system, but its aims were distinct from the present study, which sought to identify gene expression responses to deafening-induced song plasticity.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Neuronal contributors to song plasticity</title><p>By integrating song system-wide and cell-resolved expression profiles, we can make initial predictions about which cell classes exhibit transcriptional changes during song destabilization. Glutamatergic projection neurons in RA are similar to layer 5 extratelencephalic neurons in the mammalian neocortex, both in terms of their projections to subcerebral structures and their expression profiles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Colquitt et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Nevue et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Pfenning et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib124">Vicario, 1991</xref>). A number of differentially expressed genes showed biased expression toward glutamatergic neurons in RA, including protein kinase C β (<italic>PRKCB</italic>), a calcium sensor associated with short-term plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Chu et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Fioravante et al., 2014</xref>) and previously shown to be upregulated in RA following deafening (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib131">Watanabe et al., 2002</xref>), as well as the lipid processing enzyme <italic>LPL</italic>, discussed in the previous section of the Discussion.</p><p>Our results also point to a prominent role for GABAergic interneurons in deafening-induced song plasticity. In particular, genes that had reduced expression with song destabilization showed an expression bias toward <italic>Sst</italic>- and <italic>Pvalb-</italic>class interneurons in RA. The interneuron subclasses present in the song system are strongly similar to well-characterized interneuron types in the mammalian neocortex, suggesting deep conservation of inhibitory networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Colquitt et al., 2021</xref>). How these specific subclasses influence network activity in the song system is an open question; however, previous work has established a general role for local inhibition in the regulation of song learning and stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Kosche et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib123">Vallentin et al., 2016</xref>). In particular, song learning in juveniles — during which song becomes more structured and less variable — refines the synaptic connectivity between glutamatergic projection neurons in RA and an inhibitory neuron type that has electrophysiological properties similar to fast-spiking <italic>Pvalb</italic>-class interneurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Miller et al., 2017</xref>). Similarly, inhibitory input to HVC projection neurons increases and becomes more precise as song performance improves during juvenile song learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib123">Vallentin et al., 2016</xref>). Many of the <italic>Sst/Pvalb</italic>-biased genes affected by deafening-induced song plasticity are secreted neuropeptides that are sensitive to levels of neural activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Hou and Yu, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib121">Tyssowski et al., 2018</xref>), suggesting that their reduced expression reflects reduced activity in these populations during birdsong destabilization. Moreover, several of these neuropeptides, including SST and CRHBP, act to inhibit neural activity, either directly through receptor binding or indirectly through interactions with other neuromodulators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Hou and Yu, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Li et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Pittman and Siggins, 1981</xref>).</p><p>This role of inhibition in maintaining birdsong structure has parallels to the role of inhibition during neural plasticity in mammals. For instance, the density of synapses from <italic>Sst</italic>- and <italic>Pvalb-</italic>class interneurons onto pyramidal neurons in the mammalian motor cortex is modulated during motor learning in mice, with an overall reduction of <italic>Sst</italic>-class input during motor plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Chen et al., 2015</xref>). Likewise, low <italic>Pvalb</italic>-class network activity in the hippocampus is associated with increased synaptic plasticity, and low <italic>Pvalb</italic> expression, itself sensitive to neural activity, is found in the motor cortex during early motor learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Donato et al., 2013</xref>). Similarly, increased neuronal excitability and decreased inhibition have also been found in the mammalian auditory cortex following deafening or noise trauma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Kotak et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Kotak et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">Seki and Eggermont, 2003</xref>). Together, these results suggest that reduced inhibition, either through altered synaptic transmission or neuromodulation, is a key component of neural plasticity in both the mammalian and avian central nervous systems.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Circuit contributions to transcriptional state</title><p>By sampling gene expression across the different connected components of birdsong neural circuitry in individual birds, our study allowed us to examine the correlation of gene expression in one brain area with that in another. Regions with direct projections to each other, for instance, HVC to RA and LMAN to RA, tended to have a higher number of genes with correlated expression across individuals than song or non-song regions that are not directly connected. Moreover, genes with correlated expression across the three pallial (cortical-like) song regions HVC, RA, and LMAN were enriched for activity-dependent genes and secreted neuropeptides. These results could reflect the presence of a shared molecular state across the song system, perhaps established by singing-related neural activity or a common response to a general hormonal factor reflecting some aspect of a given bird’s state (e.g. testosterone levels which may in turn be affected by sensory deprivation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Livingston et al., 2000</xref>]). Two results further support that these correlations reflect some aspect of shared activity across regions. First, deafened birds exhibited, on the whole, reduced gene expression correlation between song regions, suggesting that either the loss of auditory information or associated song destabilization disrupts inter-region coordination of gene expression. Second, lesions of LMAN altered gene expression specifically in RA, one of its primary efferents, but not other brain regions to which it does not directly project. This analysis highlights the importance of considering inter-regional influences in understanding the mechanistic basis of transcriptional responses across an integrated neural circuit.</p><p>The structure of the song system offers an opportunity to better understand this general issue of how connected neural components mutually influence local properties. In particular, HVC and LMAN converge onto RA and have distinct roles in song production and learning. A number of studies have examined how disrupting these inputs influences RA neural activity, synaptic transmission, neuronal morphology, and cell survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Akutagawa and Konishi, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Johnson et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Johnson and Bottjer, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Kittelberger and Mooney, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Ölveczky et al., 2011</xref>), yet little is known about how each afferent differentially influences the molecular features of RA. A joint analysis of how each afferent alters gene expression across diverse RA neuronal types, using circuit-wide and cell-resolved gene expression approaches such as those described here, could yield insight into how converging neural inputs are integrated in target structures at the molecular level. Our current analysis focused on the transcriptional effects of unilateral LMAN lesions on target structures in hearing birds. We found that expression differences in RA following LMAN lesions were broadly the inverse of those following deafening, suggesting that the loss of LMAN establishes a transcriptional state characteristic of reduced plasticity. An informative followup experiment would be to perform bilateral lesions of LMAN before cochlear removal — a manipulation known to prevent deafening-induced song destabilization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brainard and Doupe, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Kojima et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Scott et al., 2000</xref>) — and compare expression profiles in RA in these birds to those in birds with only bilateral LMAN lesions, only cochlear removal, or unmanipulated controls. We predict that this approach would uncover genes whose expression tracks with song destabilization across manipulations, further pinpointing relevant plasticity-associated molecular factors.</p><p>These cross-regional patterns of gene expression relate to a central question of this study: how does the loss of sensory input influence gene expression in sensorimotor circuits? Our results suggest a model in which altered activity propagates through existing circuits, such that the state of one circuit component progressively modifies gene expression in its targets. Local mechanisms engaged within each region, such as synapse/spine remodeling and neuropeptidergic signaling implicated here, could then alter circuit connectivity and function, leading to behavioral plasticity. Identifying how neural activity influences gene expression across neural circuits and what specific molecular and cellular factors in turn shape circuit function will be instrumental to better understand the neural mechanisms that underlie sensorimotor stability and its impairment following sensory loss.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and

Before dimensionality reduction, these 128 × 128 spectrograms were further reduced to 16 × 16 matrices and then flattened yielding a 256-length feature vector for each syllable. Syllable x feature vector matrices were then processed using the single-cell analysis framework <italic>Seurat v3</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib116">Stuart et al., 2019</xref>).

A baseline UMAP structure was calculated as the mean density across the 2–4 days of singing before the manipulation, then density differences were calculated by subtracting this baseline density from each per-day density plot.

We then identified a time within the syllable (relative to syllable onset) with stable FF and defined minimum and maximum frequency bounds to define a frequency band containing the FF. A short-time Fourier transform (STFT) was then calculated at this time point using function <italic>spec</italic> from R package <italic>seewave</italic> v2.1.8 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib117">Sueur et al., 2008</xref>) (1024 window size, 44,100 frames per second). FF was estimated by interpolating the frequency spectrum on an output vector spanning the minimum and maximum frequency bounds with a resolution of 1 Hz (function <italic>aspline</italic> from R package <italic>akima</italic> v0.6–2.2). The maximum value of this interpolated frequency spectrum was taken as the FF. Rolling variability of FF was calculated as the coefficient of variation (CV, standard deviation/mean) over a set of FF values for a given syllable and the 10 prior syllables (of the same type). To compare variability relative to a baseline period, FF CV values were transformed to a percentage relative to the average variability before manipulation.

Songs for a given bird were divided into ‘pre’ and ‘post’-procedure groups. The ‘pre’ group consisted of songs from at most four days before the procedure up to the day preceding the procedure. The ‘post’ group contained song from two days before the day of euthanasia to the day of euthanasia. A maximum of 50 songs were sampled from each day. Syllables were identified in song WAV files by amplitude thresholding using a manually defined threshold for each bird. Mean power spectral densities (PSD) were computed for each segmented syllable using short-time Fourier transforms via R package seewave v2.1.8 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib117">Sueur et al., 2008</xref>) and function meanspec (window length ‘wl’=512, overlap ‘ovlp’=0%, normalized ‘norm’=T). Syllables in each dataset were split into a training dataset of 500 syllables and a held-out dataset of the remaining syllables. 50 PSDs were randomly selected from the ‘pre’ training dataset to serve as reference syllables for distance calculations. Inter-syllable spectral distances were calculated as Euclidean distances between this reference syllable set and each PSD, generating distance matrices for the ‘pre’ training and held-out datasets and the ‘post’ training and held-out datasets. Gaussian mixture models (GMMs) were fit to the ‘pre’ training distance matrix using function Mclust (5–12 mixture components, diagonal multivariate mixture model with varying volume, varying shape ‘VVI’) from R package mclust v5.4.7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Scrucca et al., 2016</xref>). Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) was computed for each model and second-order differences (difference of the difference) were calculated between the BICs for models with increasing numbers of mixture components. The model with minimum second-order BIC difference was selected for further use. A GMM was likewise fit to the ‘post’ training distance matrix using the same number of mixture components as in the selected ‘pre’ training model. The likelihood of generating each syllable in the ‘pre’ held-out dataset under the ‘pre’ and ‘post’ GMMs was calculated. This procedure was repeated ten times with different randomly selected reference syllables.

The tympanic membrane was ruptured, and the columella was removed using forceps. Cochlea were removed using a fine tungsten wire shaped into a hook. The incision was then resealed using VetBond (3M).

LMAN was electrolytically lesioned using a 100 kOhm platinum/iridium electrode. LMAN was stereotactically located at 4.7 mm AP, 1.7 mm ML, and 2.1 mm DV using a beak angle of 50 degrees. In one hemisphere, five penetrations were made, one at the given coordinates and four more +/-300 microns from this center position. At each penetration, 100 μA of current at the anode was passed for 60 s. At the experiment end, birds were euthanized as described in <italic>Euthanasia and brain preparation</italic>. To assess lesion completeness, 20 um coronal cryosections were collected at 100 um intervals across the anterior-posterior extent of LMAN onto SuperFrost Plus slides (FisherBrand), then Nissl stained as described in <italic>Standard Nissl stain, fresh-frozen cryosections</italic>. The volume of LMAN was estimated in ImageJ/Fiji (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Schindelin et al., 2012</xref>) by calculating the area of LMAN on the unlesioned side in each section that it was visible, interpolating a smooth curve in R across these measured areas and the known distance between cryosections, then calculating the area under the curve. This procedure was repeated for any residual LMAN visible on the lesioned side, and the lesion percentage was calculated as 100 * (1 - [volume LMAN lesioned] / [volume LMAN unlesioned]).

Flash-frozen brains were removed from –80 °C storage and allowed to equilibrate in a cryostat chamber set to –18 °C for ~30 min. PEN membrane slides for LCM (Leica) and Superfrost Plus glass slides for histology (Fisherbrand) were placed in the cryochamber to chill. Once equilibrated, the brain was mounted onto a cryostat chuck using a small amount of OCT (TissueTek) with the posterior surface down and the anterior surface available for coronal sectioning. The brain was trimmed approximately 1.8 mm until reaching the anterior-posterior position of LMAN and Area X, which were visible as slightly darker regions. Sections were cut at 20 μm, transferred to pre-chilled membrane or glass slides, then melted onto the slides using a metal dowel that was pre-warmed on a slide warmer. Once a section was fully melted, the slide was transferred to a metal block in the cryostat chamber to refreeze the section. After sectioning through LMAN and Area X, the brain was detached from the chuck and remounted along the cut anterior surface for sectioning from the posterior surface. The brain was trimmed until reaching the anterior-position for RA (~0.8 mm from the posterior surface of the forebrain), which was also evident as a slightly darker region. Sections were collected onto membrane and glass slides as described through the level of HVC (~2.3 mm from the posterior surface) or Field L (visible as a dark curve extending from the medial surface). Once the collection was finished, slides were transferred to plastic slide mailers and stored in freezer boxes at –80 °C. Remaining brain tissue was re-wrapped in aluminum foil, placed back into a 15 mL conical tube, and stored at –80 °C.

We used the consensus correlation approach implemented in limma/voom to estimate the within-block (bird/region) expression similarity. To calculate the within-block correlation between samples, the resulting voom object was passed to <italic>duplicateCorrelation</italic> with block specified as the bird ID and brain region (for the deafening samples) or bird ID and brain hemisphere (for the unilateral LMAN lesion samples).

For each brain region, we then selected the top 2000 variable genes as defined using the <italic>Seurat</italic> function <italic>FindVariableFeatures</italic> v4.0.4 and the ‘vst’ method. Signed Pearson correlations between every pair of genes were then calculated using the function <italic>calculate.correlation</italic> from <italic>MEGENA,</italic> which calculates false discovery rates by permutation (50 permutations). Correlations with an FDR less than 0.05 were retained. We passed these pairwise correlations to function <italic>calculate.PFN</italic> to generate a more sparse network that retains information edges using the MEGENA Planar Filtered Network algorithm. Module detection was then performed on this filtered network using the function <italic>do.MEGENA</italic>.</p><p>To identify modules associated with behavioral features, we calculated the average of log-transformed estimates for a given coefficient across genes in a given module. To identify modules with greater (or lesser) than expected fold-changes, for each module we randomly selected the same number of genes and averaged their log-transformed coefficient estimates 100 times. Modules that had averages less than 1% or greater than 99% of this null distribution were considered significant. Hub genes were designated using the approach defined in MEGENA. For each module, the link weights of the planar filtered network were permuted 100 times to generate a set of random networks. Within-module connectivities, defined as the sum of link weights with each other gene in a gene’s module, were calculated for each gene in each random network. The p-value was calculated as the probability of finding within-module connectivity values from this null distribution equal to or greater than the observed within-module connectivity. These p-values were then adjusted using the Benjamini-Hochberg method and genes with adjusted p-values less than 0.05 were designated hub genes.</p><p>To compute gene module memberships, eigengenes were first determined for each module using the R package <italic>WGCNA</italic> v1.70–3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Langfelder and Horvath, 2008</xref>), and function <italic>moduleEigengenes</italic> then the Pearson correlation was computed between each module eigengene and each gene.

For each gene, we calculated Pearson correlation values for each pairwise combination of brain regions, yielding region-by-region correlation matrices. To generate null distributions for each gene, we shuffled bird identities for each pairwise region-region comparison 100 times and computed Pearson correlations. We thresholded observed correlations using statistics from these shuffled distributions (correlation lesser or greater than the 2.5% or 97.5% shuffled quantiles). We calculated the across-bird expression similarity between regions as the number of thresholded correlations.</p><p>To determine if deafening alters inter-region gene expression coupling in the song system, we computed pairwise Pearson correlations for each gene between each region for hearing and deaf birds separately, then took the absolute value for each matrix. The hearing absolute correlation matrix was then subtracted from the deaf absolute correlation matrix. This procedure was repeated on 100 shuffled distributions to generate a null distribution of differential absolute correlations. Differentially correlated genes were called as those with a deaf versus hearing value less than (decorrelation) or greater than (correlation gain) extreme values of a shuffled distribution calculated for each pairwise comparison (2.5% or 97.5%, respectively).</p></sec><sec id="s4-23"><title>Cell type specificity and differential expression scores</title><p>For each gene, a specificity score was calculated as <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf5"><mml:mrow><mml:mo>∑</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>x</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>n</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mi>l</mml:mi><mml:mi>o</mml:mi><mml:mi>g</mml:mi><mml:mfenced separators="|"><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>x</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>n</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow><mml:mo>/</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mover accent="false"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>x</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>n</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow><mml:mo>¯</mml:mo></mml:mover></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:mfenced></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> , where <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf6"><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>x</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>n</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:math></inline-formula> is expression divided by the sum of expression across all clusters and <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf7"><mml:mover accent="false"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>x</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>n</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow><mml:mo>¯</mml:mo></mml:mover></mml:math></inline-formula> is the mean of this value.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Andrew King as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) All three reviewers raised questions about how gene expression changes related to aspects of neural circuit function and song production. Please read the comments below and address these points in a revised manuscript.</p><p>2) The reviewers offer suggestions for some minor corrections/clarifications for the figures.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>I have no concerns with the data or the analysis, but just one question that the authors may want to consider discussing. Especially in the case of gene expression changes in the interneurons following deafening or in RA following LMAN lesions, could the gene expression changes the authors see primarily result from a decrease in neuronal firing? Expression of some neuropeptides is known to be activity-dependent, and the identification of the activity-dependent gene BDNF as one that shows reduced correlations between RA and LMAN after deafening could also reflect changes in neuronal firing rather than being a plasticity factor that drives adaptations in the circuit. I am curious if the authors can discuss possible ways to disambiguate whether the transcriptional changes are a cause or an effect of the change in song structure.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>This study tackles a significant question, introduces a novel and innovative methodology to do so, and is clearly written and beautifully presented. The findings of the study are compelling and will be of broad interest to scientists studying the genetics of vocal communication, as well as scientists studying the genetics of motor skill learning more generally. I have only a small number of comments/questions for the authors:</p><p>Major comments</p><p>– What is the rationale for including 3 time points post-deafening, given that time post-deafening isn't explicitly considered in most of the analyses of gene expression changes? Are the deaf and hearing birds that overlap in Dkl values those that were sacrificed at the earliest post-procedure timepoint (and that were subsequently excluded from gene expression analyses)? I am not suggesting that the authors change the design or perform additional experiments, but it would be helpful for the reader to more clearly explain the rationale behind including 3 post-procedure time points.</p><p>– Can we rule out the possibility that changes in gene expression are due to song destabilization vs. the complete absence of auditory input? Would the authors expect to observe similar changes in gene expression if an alternate method were used that disrupted song stability but preserved hearing (ts nerve cut, etc.)? Conversely, I'm curious what the authors think they would see if they combined bilateral LMAN lesions with deafening (a combination of manipulations that should block song degradation but will still abolish hearing). Again, I'm not suggesting that the authors would perform these additional experiments, but perhaps an expanded discussion of these possibilities added to the discussion would be of interest to readers.</p><p>– What is the significance of the relationship of pre-procedure singing rate on LMAN gene expression (measured 9-14 days later; Supplemental Figure 3-1B)? I'm unclear on why singing rates so far in the past would relate LMAN gene expression measured days/weeks later. This is confusing/interesting, particularly given that LMAN gene expression seems much more weakly related to the pre-euthanasia singing rates.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The manuscript is extremely well written, the figures are clear and visually compelling, and the existing analysis is reasonable and rigorous. The code is available via GitHub, and methodological details including reagent sources are sufficient. A minor suggestion would be to clarify instances of &quot;described above&quot; (example: line 644) as there is a lot of information here and many things could have been previous. Addressing the outstanding questions outlined in the Public Review would increase the impact of this study, as it would deepen some of the analysis and connect potential mechanisms to long-standing data in the songbird system, and tighten the relationship between the current findings and behavioral outcomes.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.85970.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>I have no concerns with the data or the analysis, but just one question that the authors may want to consider discussing.

We controlled for recent singing-elicited neural activity by including the number of songs sung in the two hours prior to euthanasia in our regression analysis. We found no significant difference between hearing and deafened birds for this value (Figure 3B). This singing-based measure is a useful proxy for neural activity in the song system, however it is true that variation in other activity patterns, e.g. spontaneous activity, could also contribute to the observed gene expression differences. A useful set of future experiments could help resolve this issue by directly altering neural activity in the song system and analyzing its effects on expression. We now describe alternative methods to drive song destabilization (e.g. delayed auditory feedback and tracheosyringeal nerve cut) that would alter neural activity in a different manner than deafening and could be combined with gene expression analysis approaches used in this study (lines 842-850). Furthermore, we discuss using direct manipulations of the expression of candidate genes to test their causal roles in promoting or limiting song plasticity (lines 850-853).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>This study tackles a significant question, introduces a novel and innovative methodology to do so, and is clearly written and beautifully presented.

We selected these timepoints to generate a cohort of animals with a broad range of song destabilization. Generally, the longer a bird was deafened the higher its Song D<sub>KL</sub> values (now explained in more detail in the revised manuscript, lines 321-325). As to the hearing and deaf birds that had overlapping Song D<sub>KL</sub>, this group had representatives from all three time-point groups and did not show a bias toward early time points.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Can we rule out the possibility that changes in gene expression are due to song destabilization vs. the complete absence of auditory input?

Motor-specific manipulations such as tracheosyringeal nerve cut would be an excellent complementary approach to resolve this issue. In the revised manuscript, we have noted this caveat and have presented experiments, such as TS cut, as ways to address it (Discussion, lines 842-850).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Conversely, I'm curious what the authors think they would see if they combined bilateral LMAN lesions with deafening (a combination of manipulations that should block song degradation but will still abolish hearing).

Coupling LMAN lesions with deafening, a manipulation that largely prevents song degradation, would be a strong approach to identify genes whose expression is closely tied to song destabilization. We now discuss the possibility of this approach to further identify genes linked with song destabilization in the Discussion (lines 939-946).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– What is the significance of the relationship of pre-procedure singing rate on LMAN gene expression (measured 9-14 days later; Supplemental Figure 3-1B)?

We included pre-procedure singing rate in the regression to control for gene expression related to a bird’s propensity to sing, which would be distinct from expression induced by recent singing (separately quantified as the amount of singing in the 2 hours prior to euthanasia). We rechecked the results for LMAN and did not find anything which could have generated aberrant results (e.g. extreme outliers or poor quality data). Because we primarily included this variable as a control, we did not delve deeply into this finding, but agree that it could be worth further investigating this finding in follow-up work.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>The manuscript is extremely well written, the figures are clear and visually compelling, and the existing analysis is reasonable and rigorous.
