Current models only partially recapitulate key disease features, and pathophysiology is poorly understood. Through development and validation of zebrafish (<italic>Danio rerio</italic>) models of VWM, we demonstrate that zebrafish <italic>eif2b</italic> mutants phenocopy VWM, including impaired somatic growth, early lethality, effects on myelination, loss of oligodendrocyte precursor cells, increased apoptosis in the CNS, and impaired motor swimming behavior. Expression of human <italic>EIF2B2</italic> in the zebrafish <italic>eif2b2</italic> mutant rescues lethality and CNS apoptosis, demonstrating conservation of function between zebrafish and human. In the mutants, intron 12 retention leads to expression of a truncated <italic>eif2b5</italic> transcript.

VWM disease is caused by bi-allelic recessive variants in any of the five genes encoding subunits (1-5) of the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2B (eIF2B) complex. Symptoms of VWM include ataxia, spasticity, seizures, cognitive impairment, and motor problems. While there are no sex differences seen in VWM patients, females can experience ovarian failure. In patients, autopsies have revealed affected oligodendrocytes and astrocytes, myelin loss, and cystic cavitations of white matter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">van der Knaap et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">van der Knaap et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Pronk et al., 2006</xref>). Genotype-phenotype correlations of mutation severity have been shown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">VWM Research Group et al., 2018</xref>), and severe multi-organ involvement is characteristic of fetal and neonatal forms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">van der Knaap et al., 2003b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Song et al., 2017</xref>). Disease onset &lt;4 years of age is followed by a rapid deterioration of symptoms, while disease onset &gt;4 years of age shows greater variability in disease course (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">VWM Research Group et al., 2018</xref>). There is no treatment for VWM disease, and current mouse models only partially recapitulate disease pathophysiology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Geva et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dooves et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>The eIF2B complex is a heteropentameric guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) for eukaryotic initiation factor 2 (eIF2), which governs the rate of global protein synthesis and cap-dependent translation initiation. The eIF2B complex also functions to displace eIF5 from inactive GDP-bound eIF2 to allow its recruitment to the ribosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Jennings and Pavitt, 2014</xref>). Importantly, the eIF2B complex plays a central role in the cellular integrated stress response (ISR). Stress-dependent kinase activation leads to phosphorylation of eIF2, which binds eIF2B more tightly and reduces overall protein synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Krishnamoorthy et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Pakos-Zebrucka et al., 2016</xref>). In human cell lines, it has been shown that translation is suppressed to a greater degree after stress in VWM patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Moon and Parker, 2018</xref>). This suppression of translation lasts for a longer period of time in VWM cells, and the protein responsible for de-phosphorylating eIF2 and allowing translation recovery, GADD34, was found in lower quantities.</p><p>Mouse lines with knock-in/knock-out mutations in <italic>Eif2b5</italic><sup>R132H</sup>, a common allele of VWM patients, have impaired motor function, growth deficits, delayed development of white matter, and abnormal abundance of oligodendrocytes and astrocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Geva et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Atzmon et al., 2018</xref>). This developmental role for eIF2B was further confirmed in a mouse model with developmental misexpression of pancreatic endoplasmic reticulum kinase (PERK) in oligodendrocytes. PERK is one of the stress-responsive kinases that activate the ISR via phosphorylation of eIF2. PERK misexpression caused hypomyelination, oligodendrocyte damage, and myelin loss (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Lin et al., 2014</xref>). However, this result was only seen in young mice, and could not be induced in mature animals.</p><p>ISR activation has been identified in VWM patient brain autopsy samples (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">van Kollenburg et al., 2006</xref>) and in mouse VWM models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Wong et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abbink et al., 2019</xref>). A small molecule inhibitor of the ISR, ISRIB, has been shown to bind to and activate the decameric, functional eIF2B complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Sidrauski et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Sidrauski et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Wong et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>There are key aspects that remain unclear about eIF2B function and its involvement in VWM pathophysiology. eIF2B is expressed globally but VWM primarily affect the CNS, including differential effects in the CNS. For example, oligodendrocyte numbers are decreased in affected white matter, but they are increased in other areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Van Haren et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bugiani et al., 2010</xref>). GEF activity of the eIF2B complex does not appear to correlate with VWM disease severity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Liu et al., 2011</xref>), suggesting that the overall protein translation is not the key component of VWM pathophysiology. Another unusual and poorly understood aspect of VWM is that rapid clinical deterioration and white matter loss can be provoked by a stressor, such as minor head trauma or mild illness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">van der Knaap et al., 2006</xref>). This is consistent with models in which chronic ISR activation causes cellular apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bond et al., 2020</xref>), but the mechanism by which VWM mutation affects ISR response is unclear. Further, there is some evidence that a de-regulated ISR is not alone sufficient to cause VWM pathology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Wisse et al., 2017</xref>), and in fact blocking the ISR worsens VWM pathology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Sekine et al., 2016</xref>). Thus, current models and approaches have left key questions unanswered.</p><p>We report the development and characterization of a small vertebrate (zebrafish – <italic>Danio rerio</italic>) model of VWM. We have generated and characterized mutant alleles in zebrafish <italic>eif2b</italic> subunits 1, 2, and 4, and an allelic series in subunit 5. We demonstrate that the <italic>eif2b</italic> mutants exhibit a range of phenotypic severity, including changes in growth, lethality, behavior, myelination, apoptosis, and proliferation in the CNS. We also show conservation of function of <italic>eif2b2</italic> between zebrafish and humans, validating the zebrafish model for understanding human VWM. We find that the <italic>eif2b</italic> mutants at baseline have activated induced stress response (ISR). The zebrafish <italic>eif2b</italic> mutants have impaired swimming motor behavior, a phenotype that could be used in a phenotype-based screen. Finally, we found that in the zebrafish <italic>eif2b</italic> mutants, a truncated <italic>eif2b5</italic> transcript is generated. The truncated <italic>eif2b5</italic> is capable of activating the ISR, and can impair motor behavior, suggesting that a feedback loop with truncated <italic>eif2b5</italic> may play an important role in disease pathology. Our work reveals a similar role for the <italic>eif2b</italic> complex in zebrafish and in humans, identifies a novel mechanism of VWM pathophysiology, and provides a useful model of VWM for future therapeutics screening.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Phylogenetic analysis of EIF2B sequence homology and expression in zebrafish development</title><p>We characterized the sequence and developmental expression of the five Eif2b subunit orthologs in zebrafish, <italic>eif2b1-5</italic> (<italic>eif2b1</italic>, ENSDARG00000091402; <italic>eif2b2</italic> ENSDARG00000041397; <italic>eif2b3</italic>, ENSDARG00000018106; <italic>eif2b4</italic>, ENSDARG00000014004; <italic>eif2b5</italic>, ENSDARG00000074995).

Further, using rescue with expression of the human EIF2B2 cDNA, we demonstrate functional conservation in the zebrafish <italic>eif2b2</italic> mutant. The mutations we have generated are not specifically homologous to known human VWM patient disease alleles. For therapeutic tests and similar studies future work will benefit from having zebrafish mutants that are homologous to known disease alleles. However, the range of phenotypes in our zebrafish mutants, from lethality in the first several weeks of life, to viability and fecundity, provide an opportunity to further study genotype-phenotype relationships in VWM, which have been noted in patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">van der Lei et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>Importantly, our data reveals a novel potential mechanism of VWM pathophysiology: ISR activation in the <italic>eif2b</italic> mutants causes abnormal splicing and generation of a truncated <italic>eif2b5</italic> transcript, which is capable of further activating the ISR and impairing motor behavior. Thus, in healthy individuals, stress would activate the ISR but would appropriately be terminated through down-regulation of the ISR by dephosphorylation of eIF2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Pakos-Zebrucka et al., 2016</xref>). But in VWM patients, stress would activate the ISR, and would also lead to expression of truncated EIF2B5 expression; which would cause a feed-forward mechanism of further and chronic ISR activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). This chronic activation of the ISR is observed in human autopsy samples and in a mouse VWM model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">van der Voorn et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">van Kollenburg et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Wong et al., 2019</xref>).</p><fig id="fig9" position="float"><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><title>Feed-forward effect of truncated EIF2B5.</title><p>(<bold>A–C</bold>) Under normal conditions, stress leads to activation of the ISR, which is terminated by dephosphorylation of eIF2a by PP1 (protein phosphatase one complex) and resumption of normal cap-dependent translation.

VWM can be caused by autosomal recessive mutations in any of the five subunits of eIF2B. Zebrafish show expression of the <italic>eif2b</italic> genes at 24 hpf through 7 dpf including in the CNS. Mutations in the most commonly affected patient subunits, <italic>eif2b2</italic> and <italic>eif2b5,</italic> showed growth deficits and decreased survival, mimicking clinical features of VWM. Interestingly, we found that human EIF2B2 expression in zebrafish can rescue the increased apoptosis and early lethality phenotype of <italic>eif2b2 <sup>sa17223</sup></italic> homozygous mutants, but not human EIF2B5. The difference between the EIF2B2 and EIF2B5 rescues might be due to the fact that EIF2B5 is the key catalytic subunit of the eIF2B complex for the eIF2•GDP to eIF2•GTP transition, which enhances protein translation. In contrast, expression of human EIF2B5 in zebrafish was lethal, consistent with data showing that stoichiometry of the EIF2B5 subunit (ε) expression is critical (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Wortham et al., 2016</xref>). Taken together, our work suggests conservation of <italic>eif2b</italic> expression and function.</p><p>Mutations in the zebrafish eIF2B complex were associated with multiple defects in development of the CNS. In the 5 dpf homozygous mutants of <italic>eif2b2<sup>sa17223</sup></italic>, <italic>eif2b5<sup>zc102</sup></italic>, and <italic>eif2b5<sup>zc103</sup></italic> alleles, there was an increase in apoptosis in the CNS. We also observed altered patterns of cell proliferation pattern in the CNS, and a decrease in overall CNS proliferation in the <italic>eif2b2<sup>sa17223</sup></italic> mutants. Although there was no change in total OPC numbers in the CNS, we found an increase in the number of OPCs undergoing apoptosis in the hindbrain. We also observed effects on myelination, marked by an apparent decrease in thickness of the myelin sheath, abnormal patterning of myelinated axon tracts in the optic tectum, and abnormal intensity of white matter regions on MRI. However, because mutants can have a decrease in axon diameter, we cannot conclude definitively that myelin sheath thickness is decreased (for example, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Klingseisen et al., 2019</xref>). To fully investigate whether the zebrafish VWM mutants have a decreased G-ratio (decreased myelin sheath thickness), future studies should analyze this by binning results by axon diameter.</p><p>Since a hallmark of VWM is that disease progression can be precipitated by stressors, we tested the ISR and the response to stress in the <italic>eif2b</italic> mutants. We noted that while stress of wild-type zebrafish caused motor deficits, stress in the mutant <italic>eif2b</italic> zebrafish (including heat shock, hypoxia, or thapsigargin) did not worsen further worsen their already impaired motor behavior (data not shown). This suggests that the <italic>eif2b</italic> mutant zebrafish are already ‘maximally’ stressed at baseline, consistent with the observed activation of the ISR at baseline, and the finding of increased intron 12 retention. ISR induces expression of transcription factors including ATF4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Harding et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Watatani et al., 2008</xref>). ATF4 and other components of the ISR trigger a stress-induced transcriptional program that promotes cell survival during mild or acute conditions, but which causes pathological changes under severe or chronic insults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Pakos-Zebrucka et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>A poorly understood aspect of VWM is why a minor stressor can precipitate significant white matter loss and neurological deterioration. Our work suggests that this is caused by a feed-forward effect of chronic ISR that cannot be terminated. This occurs by alternative splicing and retention of intron 12 in EIF2B5 leading to a premature stop codon and expression of a truncated EIF2B5. This was first observed in cancer cell lines in response to hypoxia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brady et al., 2017</xref>). The truncated EIF2B5 permits formation of the eIF2B complex and a partial catalytic domain, but is missing the eIF2α interaction domain. This would result in impaired translation mechanism and a decrease in protein synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Adomavicius et al., 2019</xref>). We demonstrated the pathological role of truncated EIF2B5 in VWM disease by showing that truncated <italic>eif2b5</italic> is expressed in VWM mutants, and that expression of the truncated EIF2B5 impairs motor function, and itself leads to further activation of the ISR.</p><p>Major advances in the past several years have shown that a small molecule stabilizing the decameric eIF2B complex (ISRIB - ISR InhiBitor) can boost the GEF activity of wild-type and VWM mutant eIF2B complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Tsai et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Wong et al., 2018</xref>) and can inhibit the ISR in mice bearing an <italic>Eif2b5<sup>R132H/R132H</sup></italic> VWM mutation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Wong et al., 2019</xref>). However, it is not clear whether ISRIB or other drugs targeting eIF2B complex stability will be sufficient to prevent stress-induced ISR chronic, feed-forward activation. Therapies for VWM may need a combinatorial approach incorporating eIF2B stabilization at baseline; and prevention of stress-induced truncated eIF2B5 expression.</p></sec><sec id="s4"

Wild-type animals, harboring the non-mutated Hpy188I restriction site, generate a 404 bp and 219 bp band, specific to the wild-type allele, as well as the 44 bp internal control band; heterozygous animals generate all four bands after Hpy188I digestion: mutant 623 bp, wild-type 404 bp and 219 bp, and the internal digest control band 44 bp.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Chip genotyping</title><p>Survival genotyping of 72 hpf zebrafish was performed as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Lambert et al., 2018</xref>). Briefly, embryos were loaded individually onto genotyping wells of a ZEG chip (wFluidx, Inc) in 12 μl of E3 with a wide bore pipette tip. Once embryos are loaded, the ZEG chip was placed on the vibration unit, covered with the lid and vibrated for 7.5 min at 1.4 volts, 0.026 amps and 0.03 watts. After the samples are vibrated, 10 μl of E3 is removed from the well into a PCR strip tube.

Two primary scans were done to map the T1 and T2 behavior of the tissue. These scans were 3D turbo spin-echo scans (Rapid Acquisition with Refocused Echoes, RARE), specialized with varying repetition time (TR) or echo time (TE) to optimize T1 and T2 contrast. The T1 map scan utilized the following parameters: T1 weighted RARE: TR = [50, 150, 275, 450, 600]ms, TE = 12 ms, four averages, RARE factor = 2, matrix size = 305×140 x 165, spatial resolution = 0.036 mm isotropic, field of view: 110 x 50 x 60 mm.

This was corrected for with simple 2D rigid body transformations between TR experiments, using the MATLAB r2017b ‘affine2d’ function. A transformation matrix was generated for a single representative slice, then applied to all slices within the volume. This transformation was applied to each T1 experiment of a given set and were averaged into a single volume.</p><p>Transformation matrices were generated with landmark based analysis. Three primary landmarks were utilized to build the transformation: the center of the lens of each eye and the tip of the vagal lobe. The repetitions were averaged and fitted with the gradient descent algorithm detailed above. This resulted in two volumes of T1 and T2 values for each scan pair. The skull pair was separated into two distinct volumes for each T1, T2 map, and rotated into the anatomical planes for visualization.</p><p>Analysis of the T1 and T2 maps involved a two-step process of quantifying overall brain volume, and determining the T1 and T2 values for white matter regions of interest (ROI). To begin, four representative measurements were taken for each wild-type and mutant pair.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, including Beth Stevens as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Richard White as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Cody J Smith (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>As the editors have judged that your manuscript is of interest, but as described below that additional experiments are required before it is published, we would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). First, because many researchers have temporarily lost access to the labs, we will give authors as much time as they need to submit revised manuscripts. We are also offering, if you choose, to post the manuscript to bioRxiv (if it is not already there) along with this decision letter and a formal designation that the manuscript is 'in revision at <italic>eLife</italic>'. Please let us know if you would like to pursue this option. (If your work is more suitable for medRxiv, you will need to post the preprint yourself, as the mechanisms for us to do so are still in development.)</p><p>Summary</p><p>Mutations in the five subunits of the eukaryotic initiation factor 2B (eIF2B1-5) complex cause a severe leukodystrophy called Vanishing White Matter (VWM) disease. In this study from the Bonkowsky lab, new mutants were either generated or imported and analyzed for CNS defects relevant to VWM. By studying growth, lethality, myelination, CNS cell development, and swimming behavior, the authors conclude that the new <italic>eif2b</italic> mutants phenocopy VWM patients. The authors also show that in mutants, a retained intron leads to expression of a truncated transcript, which they conclude acts in a dominant-negative fashion and suggest that this explains some pathology in human VWM patients.</p><p>Although modeling human disease in model organisms like zebrafish is important, there are several major issues with the study that dampen enthusiasm as outlined below.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Significance of Model</p><p>1) For most of five the mutations most of them are heterozygous. Here the authors showed that only 2 out of 4 subunit mutants (<italic>eif2b5</italic>, <italic>eif2b2</italic>) exhibited phenotypes. Is it possible that other mutant alleles have mild phenotypes, such as increased ISR? More characterization of phenotypes in the other mutants (<italic>eif2b1</italic>, <italic>eif2b4</italic>) and the heterozygous siblings is needed to address relevance of this as a model of VWM.</p><p>Motor defects</p><p>1) It is unconvincing that the movement measurements in <italic>eif2b5<sup>zc103</sup></italic> mutants represent motor behavior deficits. Please address possible non-specific developmental delays cause the observed phenotypes. Can the authors perform the behavioral experiments at later stages or provide stage matched (rather than age matched) characterizations the mutants?</p><p>2) In Figure 6, for the truncated EIF2B5 mis-expression experiments, it is unclear from the text and Materials and methods how the experiments were performed. If the truncated protein acts as a dominant-negative in the e1f2b mutants, why would expression of the wild-type gene rescue the mutant phenotype? The dominant-negative product would still be present.

In this study, the authors showed that only 2 out of 4 subunit mutants (<italic>eif2b5</italic>, <italic>eif2b2</italic>) exhibited phenotypes.

The authors point out that these mutants are smaller than wild-type controls and the mutant larvae fail to inflate their swim bladders. Thus, it is also possible that non-specific developmental delays cause the observed phenotypes.

These images look more like toluidine blue stained semi-thick sections than EM sections.</p><p>5) In Figure 6, for the truncated EIF2B5 mis-expression experiments, it is unclear from the text and Materials and methods how the experiments were performed. Did the authors generate a stable transgenic line, as for EIF2B2, or it was a transient injection of expressing DNA construct? If it was a transient injection experiment, expression would be mosaic and likely short-term; thus, a motor phenotype is surprising if this was the method.</p><p>6) If the truncated protein acts as a dominant-negative in the e1f2b mutants, why would expression of the wild-type gene rescue the mutant phenotype? The dominant-negative product would still be present.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>Keefe and Soderholm and Shih et al. present a thorough paper that uses multiple approaches to address how <italic>eif2b5</italic> functions in neural development and function. The work nicely evaluated common features of VWM disease and sets foundation for future studies that would dissect mechanistic regulators in VWM. The model and data that is present will be of broad interest to groups studying neural development as well as VWM. The conclusions that are stated in the paper nicely match the data that is presented. Overall, this is a well written and complete story.</p><p>In Figure 6D, the impaired motor movement is observed. The authors conclude that it is acting as a dominant negative. However, it could be over expression and not a dominant negative effect. Can the authors compare motor behavior in actin:<italic>eif2b</italic> vs <italic>eif2b5</italic> expression? Alternatively, can the authors add text that demonstrate alternative interpretations of the data.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Vanishing white matter disease expression of truncated EIF2B5 activates induced stress response&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been evaluated by Richard White (Senior Editor) and a Reviewing Editor.</p><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below. Overall, this manuscript can serve as a useful model for understanding how mutations in eIF2b2 can leading to phenotypes present in VWM and will be a resource for the community. The authors have included several new data panels that help to clarify some of the previous concerns. However, a few issues remain that need to be addressed before publication.</p><p>1) A major issue remains in the quality of the electron microscopy to show myelin ultrastructure. As shown, it is unclear how g-ratio could have been calculated from images shown. Please address comments below (reviewer 1) and provide data using high quality EMs images as is standard for the field and important for a manuscript focused on a model of Vanishing White Matter disease.</p><p>2) New data in supplemental figures 1 and 2 are critical are important for the main story and should be included in the main figures for the story as written and revised. However, it is difficult to visualize the co-labeling of tunel and ph3 with the noted cell-type markers in those images that influence the quantification of data and results.</p><p>3) Please provide clarification and details on the sox10:mrfp transgene used in the study: The authors listed sox10:mrfp as a transgene that they used in the study but it is not clear which figure that transgenic animal was used. Tg(sox10:mrfp) would be a useful tool to validate the OPC phenotype in the spinal cord since sox10 labels OPCs with very different morphology than the subset of neurons that are labeled with that transgene.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>The authors were decently responsive to the previous round of critiques. A major issue remains in the quality of the electron microscopy to show myelin ultrastructure. As shown, it is unclear how g-ratio could have been calculated from images shown. Additionally, g-ratio quantifications are usually binned by axon size, which was not performed here and likely cannot be based on the quality of the EMs. The EMs are not publication quality and should not be published. If publication quality EMs cannot be obtained and quantified, the histological analysis of myelin will have to suffice, although this is certainly not ideal for a manuscript focused on a model of Vanishing White Matter disease. In this case, myelin was never formally examined, and the wording throughout the Abstract and manuscript will need to be changed to reflect this.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>Overall, this manuscript can serve as a useful model for understanding how mutations in eIF2b2 can leading to phenotypes present in VWM and will be a resource for the community. The authors have provided a point by point rebuttal to the reviewers concern. The authors have also included several new data panels that help to clarify some of the previous concerns. Most of this new data matches the conclusions as written. However, some of new data shown has presented a concern or clarification that should be addressed before publication.</p><p>New data in supplemental figures 1 and 2 are critical for the story as written and revised. It is difficult to visualize the co-labeling of tunel and ph3 with the noted cell-type markers in those images. It is not clear how such quantification could be completed, especially with the resolution of in situ hybridization vs immunostaining. As written, these figures are important for the main story and should be included in the main figures. The tunel staining in these new supplementary files is also different than displayed in the main figures. Can the authors provide insets for the labeling demonstrating an example of a co-labeled cell in each of the genotypes.</p><p>In an effort for the authors to address a review regarding the specificity of cell death in the spinal cord they used mag as a marker for oligodendrocytes. mag is certainly one marker that could identify an oligodendrocyte. But the mag in situ appears to be present in areas of the PNS without defined myelinating cells. There are also a low number of mag+ cells in the spinal cord of animal at 5 dpf in those images than would be expected for labeling of myelinating cells. Can the authors test that the mag+ cells in the spinal cord are also olig2+ or sox10+ to confirm that the mag labeling is specific.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.56319.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>In the manuscript entitled &quot;Vanishing white matter disease expression of truncated EIF2B5 activates induced stress response&quot;, Keefe et al., develop and validate a novel zebrafish model to study the mechanisms underlying Vanishing White Matter disease (VWM).

The human allele mutant in zebrafish will be really helpful to understand the degree of ISR, for example.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) It is unconvincing that the movement measurements in eif2b5<sup>zc103</sup> mutants represent motor behavior deficits. The authors point out that these mutants are smaller than wild-type controls and the mutant larvae fail to inflate their swim bladders. Thus, it is also possible that non-specific developmental delays cause the observed phenotypes. Can the authors perform the behavioral experiments at later stages or provide stage matched (rather than age matched) characterizations the mutants?</p></disp-quote><p>This is a good point. The phenotypes co-segregate with the mutations, but we do appreciate that the behavioral effects with our data are unable to differentiate a CNS effect, from an effect caused by the size of the animal, etc. The zc103 mutants stay persistently smaller throughout their life span, so stage matching is not a possibility. To clarify a point- the zc103 do have swim bladder (zc102 does not). We discuss this limitation on interpretation of the findings in the text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Olig2 also labels motor neurons in the spinal cord and neural precursors in the hindbrain. Thus, the authors cannot conclude they are only quantifying oligodendrocyte lineage cells in Figure 3.</p></disp-quote><p>That is a good point about the Olig2:dsRed transgenic line. We clarify this point, but do also point out that the <italic>olig2:dsRed</italic> line is specific to OPCs in labeled cells that have migrated dorsally out of the spinal cord.</p><p>However, to more conclusively test this issue, we have now down experiments using in situ probes for oligodendrocytes (olig1 and mag), and we confirm that there is an increase in apoptosis of oligodendrocytes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The electron micrographs in Figure 4 are low quality and cannot be analyzed for G-ratio based on what is shown. These images look more like toluidine blue stained semi-thick sections than EM sections.</p></disp-quote><p>We have included high resolution images of the TEM sections for Figure 4.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) In Figure 6, for the truncated EIF2B5 mis-expression experiments, it is unclear from the text and Materials and methods how the experiments were performed. Did the authors generate a stable transgenic line, as for EIF2B2, or it was a transient injection of expressing DNA construct? If it was a transient injection experiment, expression would be mosaic and likely short-term; thus, a motor phenotype is surprising if this was the method.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize that this was unclear- the experiment was performed with transient injection. With transient injections, because of the high copy number of plasmids, it is not infrequent to obtain a strong response, which is sometimes more marked than the response from a stable transgenic line, depending on the enhancer. We have clarified this in the text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) If the truncated protein acts as a dominant-negative in the e1f2b mutants, why would expression of the wild-type gene rescue the mutant phenotype? The dominant-negative product would still be present.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer raises an important point, it is possible that the phenotype observed is related to overexpression, and not from a dominant-negative effect. We have provided clarification in the text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>Keefe and Soderholm and Shih et al. present a thorough paper that uses multiple approaches to address how eif2b5 functions in neural development and function. The work nicely evaluated common features of VWM disease and sets foundation for future studies that would dissect mechanistic regulators in VWM. The model and data that is present will be of broad interest to groups studying neural development as well as VWM. The conclusions that are stated in the paper nicely match the data that is presented. Overall, this is a well written and complete story.</p><p>In Figure 6D, the impaired motor movement is observed. The authors conclude that it is acting as a dominant negative. However, it could be over expression and not a dominant negative effect. Can the authors compare motor behavior in actin:eif2b vs eif2b5 expression? Alternatively, can the authors add text that demonstrate alternative interpretations of the data.</p></disp-quote><p>This is a good point, and we have revised our text to match the alternative potential explanation.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1) A major issue remains in the quality of the electron microscopy to show myelin ultrastructure. As shown, it is unclear how g-ratio could have been calculated from images shown. Please address comments below (reviewer 1) and provide data using high quality EMs images as is standard for the field and important for a manuscript focused on a model of Vanishing White Matter disease.</p></disp-quote><p>We have provided images that are at higher magnification, that were used for the quantification and the g-ratio calculations. We have included these images in the revised Figure 6, and updated the text and figure legend. The images are similar in magnification and quality to those routinely published in the field (e.g. Ackerman et al., 2014, Nat Comm; Strachan et al., 2017, Hum Mol Genet; etc.), including for Vanishing White Matter disease (e.g. Dooves et al., 2016; Klok et al., Ann Clin Transl Neurol, 2018; etc.).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) New data in supplemental figures 1 and 2 are critical are important for the main story and should be included in the main figures for the story as written and</p><p>revised. However, it is difficult to visualize the co-labeling of tunel and ph3 with the noted cell-type markers in those images that influence the quantification of</p><p>data and results.</p><p>It is not clear how such quantification could be completed, especially with the resolution of in situ hybridization vs immunostaining. As written, these figures are important for the main story and should be included in the main figures. The tunel staining in these new supplementary files is also different than displayed in the main figures. Can the authors provide insets for the labeling demonstrating an example of a co-labeled cell in each of the genotypes.</p></disp-quote><p>For Figure 3 (the quantification of TUNEL and apoptosis in the different alleles): We have now included the images in the main body of the manuscript, as new Figures 4 and 5, and re-numbered the subsequent figures. The differences in appearances of some of the images are because it is now more than a year after the original images were generated, so new experiments were performed. For the new Figure 4, showing co-labeling of TUNEL and olig1: we have also provided high-magnification insets showing examples of double-labeled cells for each genotype.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In an effort for the authors to address a review regarding the specificity of cell death in the spinal cord they used mag as a marker for oligodendrocytes. mag is certainly one marker that could identify an oligodendrocyte. But the mag in situ appears to be present in areas of the PNS without defined myelinating cells. There are also a low number of mag+ cells in the spinal cord of animal at 5 dpf in those images than would be expected for labeling of myelinating cells. Can the authors test that the mag+ cells in the spinal cord are also olig2+ or sox10+ to confirm that the mag labeling is specific.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now included a high-magnification image, showing co-localization of the mag in situ probe with GFP expressed from a transgenic <italic>sox10:GFP</italic> line, taken using a single slice confocal image (step size 2.5mm). This image is Figure 4—figure supplement 1.</p><p>The mag staining the reviewer notes in the PNS (in the region ventral to the spinal cord) is biological; mag is a marker for oligodendrocytes as well as for Schwann cells. The different appearances of the PNS mag labeling reflects differences in the positioning of the image used for the paper. Also, with regards to TUNEL/OPC quantification, we note that the separate experiments performed in Figure 3, K-O, that the method of quantification of the olig2:dsRed line, of cells that have dorsally migrated in the spinal cord, is specific for OPCs.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Please provide clarification and details on the sox10:mrfp transgene used in the study: The authors listed sox10:mrfp as a transgene that they used in the study but it is not clear which figure that transgenic animal was used. Tg(sox10:mrfp) would be a useful tool to validate the OPC phenotype in the spinal cord since sox10 labels OPCs with very different morphology than the subset of neurons that are labeled with that transgene.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize about the confusion. Although we listed this line in the list of reagents, we did not in fact list or use it in the paper or in the figures. This was because although w had used this line in some experiments, those experiments ended up not being included in the submission, and so had erroneously left the line still in the reagents listed as being used, which we have now removed in the text and in the key resource table.</p></body></sub-article></article>
