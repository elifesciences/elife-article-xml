for glucose homeostasis and the pathology of type 2 diabetes (T2D). Here, we uncover a novel function of TET2 in the regulation of gluconeogenesis. In mice, both fasting and a high-fat diet (HFD) stimulate the expression of TET2, and <italic>TET2</italic> knockout impairs glucose production. Mechanistically, FBP1, a rate-limiting enzyme in gluconeogenesis, is positively regulated by TET2 in liver cells. TET2 is recruited by HNF4α, contributing to the demethylation of the <italic>FBP1</italic> promoter and activating its expression in response to glucagon stimulation. Moreover, metformin treatment increases the phosphorylation of HNF4α on Ser313, which prevents its interaction with TET2, thereby decreasing the expression level of FBP1 and ameliorating the pathology of T2D. Collectively, we identify an HNF4α-TET2-FBP1 axis in the control of gluconeogenesis, which contributes to the therapeutic effect of metformin on T2D and provides a potential target for the clinical treatment of T2D.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>TET2</kwd><kwd>FBP1</kwd><kwd>HNF4α</kwd><kwd>gluconeogenesis</kwd><kwd>diabetes</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group

sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Loss of glucose homeostasis can lead to type 2 diabetes (T2D), characterized by persistently elevated blood glucose levels that may result in various complications, including kidney failure and neuropathy. Since abnormal gluconeogenic activity is the primary contributor to hepatic glucose production (HGP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Basu et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Magnusson et al., 1992</xref>), which is the main source of increased blood glucose concentration in T2D, targeting gluconeogenesis represents a viable strategy for maintaining blood glucose homeostasis.</p><p>Fructose 1,6-bisphosphatase (FBP1) is a rate-controlling enzyme in gluconeogenesis that catalyzes the conversion of fructose 1,6-bisphosphate to fructose 6-phosphate. Notably, a point mutation in FBP1 has been reported to significantly reduce the efficacy of metformin, a first-line drug for the treatment of T2D, suggesting that FBP1 plays a major role in the therapeutic effect of metformin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hunter et al., 2018</xref>). However, the specific response of FBP1 to metformin treatment remains unclear.</p><p>Ten-eleven translocation 2 (TET2) belongs to the TET family, which includes TET1, TET2, and TET3. These enzymes function as DNA dioxygenases, catalyzing the successive oxidation of 5-methylcytosine (5mC) to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Tahiliani et al., 2009</xref>), 5-formylcytosine, and 5-carboxycytosine (5caC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">He et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Ito et al., 2011</xref>). Subsequently, thymine-DNA glycosylase mediates the removal of 5caC, resulting in the formation of an unmodified cytosine, which participates in DNA demethylation and gene expression regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Ito et al., 2011</xref>). Recently, it was reported that the expression of FBP1 can be regulated by promoter methylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hirata et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Dong et al., 2013</xref>), leading us to hypothesize that TET2 may play a role in regulating FBP1 expression and gluconeogenesis.</p><p>Mutations in <italic>TET2</italic> frequently occur in various myeloid cancers. Somatic alterations in <italic>TET2</italic> are observed in 50% of patients with chronic myelomonocytic leukemia and are associated with poor outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kosmider et al., 2009</xref>). The frequency of <italic>TET2</italic> mutations in patients with myelodysplastic syndromes is 19% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Delhommeau et al., 2009</xref>). Moreover, reversing TET2 deficiency suppresses the abnormal differentiation and self-renewal of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells and blocks leukemia progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cimmino et al., 2017</xref>). Additionally, TET2 has also been reported to repress mTORC1 and HIF signaling, thereby suppressing tumor growth in hepatocellular carcinoma and clear cell renal cell carcinoma, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">He et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Zhang et al., 2022</xref>). These studies focused on the function of TET2 in cancer development; however, it is unclear whether TET2 is involved in T2D progression. In this study, we demonstrated that TET2 is recruited by HNF4α to the <italic>FBP1</italic> promoter, activating <italic>FBP1</italic> expression through demethylation, which contributes to gluconeogenesis and T2D pathology. Furthermore, we identified the HNF4α-TET2-FBP1 axis as a target of metformin treatment, suggesting that targeting this axis may represent a potential strategy for T2D management.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>TET2 contributes to gluconeogenesis and T2D</title><p>To investigate the role of TET2 in gluconeogenesis, we developed three mouse models: one subjected to overnight fasting for 16 hr prior to testing and two subjected to high-fat feeding (HFD) for 11 days and 12 weeks, respectively. The results indicated that both fasting and HFD increased the mRNA and protein levels of Tet2 in the livers of mice compared to the normal chow group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–E</xref>), suggesting that TET2 may play an important role in gluconeogenesis. To test this hypothesis, we examined the effect of TET2 on glucose output and found that TET2 overexpression promoted glucose output in HepG2 cells and primary mouse hepatocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A and B</xref>). Consistent with this, <italic>TET2</italic> knockout impaired gluconeogenesis in HepG2 cells and mouse hepatocytes, even under glucagon treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C and D</xref>). Collectively, these data demonstrated that TET2 contributes to gluconeogenesis, prompting us to investigate whether TET2 is involved in T2D progression. Pyruvate tolerance test (PTT), glucose tolerance test (GTT), and insulin tolerance test (ITT) were conducted, revealing <italic>Tet2</italic> KO significantly increased glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity compared to the control mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E–H</xref>). Additionally, to assess the plasma insulin levels in response to GTT in <italic>Tet2-</italic>KO mice, we collected the orbital venous blood and examined the insulin levels at different time points. The results showed that <italic>Tet2-KO</italic> mice exhibited lower insulin secretion after glucose administration, further reflecting higher insulin sensitivity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>). Meanwhile, we compared the body weight differences between wild-type (WT) and <italic>Tet2</italic>-KO mice and found no significant differences at 8 and 10 weeks of age on normal chow (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I</xref>). In summary, the loss of <italic>Tet2</italic> function decreased gluconeogenesis in the liver and may contribute to the treatment of T2D.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>TET2 expression increases in fasting and high-fat diet (HFD) mouse livers.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) qRT-PCR analysis of <italic>Tet2</italic> mRNA levels in mouse livers after 16 hr fasting treatment.

However, it remains unclear whether the HNF4α-TET2-FBP1 axis responds to metformin treatment. Metformin, a first-line antidiabetic drug widely used to treat hyperglycemia in T2D, is also a well-established adenosine 5′-monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activator (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aroda et al., 2017</xref>).

To explore the role of metformin-induced AMPK phosphorylation of HNF4α in FBP1 expression, we treated cells with metformin and assessed the interaction between HNF4α and TET2. The results showed that metformin administration impaired HNF4α’s ability to bind to TET2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>), leading to a significant reduction in TET2 binding to the FBP1 promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>).

Our data demonstrated that TET2 upregulates FBP1, thereby enhancing gluconeogenesis in an HNF4α-dependent manner. Furthermore, metformin-induced phosphorylation of HNF4α at Ser 313 impairs its binding ability to TET2 and reduces TET2 recruitment to the FBP1 promoter, leading to decreased FBP1 expression. Importantly, TET2-FBP1 inhibition has a synergistic effect with metformin in HFD mice.</p><p>Intriguingly, a clinical investigation study revealed that <italic>TET2</italic> mutations occur more frequently in the diabetes mellitus (DM) group than the non-DM, suggesting a potential connection between TET2 and insulin resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Xu et al., 2024</xref>). Additionally, inactivating mutations of the epigenetic regulator TET2 led to metabolic dysfunction, including clonal hematopoiesis, and aggravated age- and obesity-related insulin resistance in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fuster et al., 2020</xref>). Regarding HNF4α variants, an analysis utilizing exome sequencing data demonstrated that human genetic variations in HNF4α disrupted its protein structure and function, impaired insulin secretion, reduced sensitivity to insulin, and increased the risk of T2D in individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Ellard and Colclough, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Yamagata et al., 1996</xref>). Furthermore, it has been reported that a point mutation in FBP1 can reduce the efficacy of metformin treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hunter et al., 2018</xref>), providing genetic evidence for the role of the TET2-FBP1 axis in the therapeutic effect of metformin. In summary, our findings uncovered a previously unknown function of TET2 in gluconeogenesis. TET2, together with HNF4α, facilitates FBP1 expression by maintaining the hypomethylation of the FBP1 promoter, which leads to increased gluconeogenesis. Thus, targeting the HNF4α-TET2-FBP1 axis may represent a promising strategy to lower blood glucose in T2D.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cell culture and transfection</title><p>HepG2 (#iCell-h092), LO-2 (#iCell-h054), and HEK293T (#iCell-h243) were purchased from Cellverse Co., Ltd (Shanghai, China), and have been confirmed to be free of mycoplasma contamination.

We apologize that we did not provide detailed description for some experimental methods and results. Following reviewer’s suggestion, we added the details in method section, including the generation of whole-body <italic>Tet2 KO</italic> mice and liver-specific Tet2 knockdown mice (AAV8-shTet2), the missing information of reagent, antibody, primer sequences and mutant generation, and the methods of chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) and immunofluorescence. The interpretation of the results was also further developed according to reviewer’s comments.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>This study reveals a novel role of TET2 in regulating gluconeogenesis. It shows that fasting and a high-fat diet increase TET2 expression in mice, and TET2 knockout reduces glucose production. The findings highlight that TET2 positively regulates FBP1, a key enzyme in gluconeogenesis, by interacting with HNF4α to demethylate the FBP1 promoter in response to glucagon. Additionally, metformin reduces FBP1 expression by preventing TET2-HNF4α interaction. This identifies an HNF4α-TET2-FBP1 axis as a potential target for T2D treatment.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>The authors use several methods in vivo (PTT, GTT, and ITT in fasted and HFD mice; and KO mice) and in vitro (in HepG2 and primary hepatocytes) to support the existence of the HNF4alpha-TET-2-FBP-1 axis in the control of gluconeogenesis. These findings uncovered a previously unknown function of TET2 in gluconeogenesis.</p></disp-quote><p>We are grateful for the reviewer's praise on the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>Although the authors provide evidence of an HNF4α-TET2-FBP1 axis in the control of gluconeogenesis, which contributes to the therapeutic effect of metformin on T2D, its role in the pathogenesis of T2D is less clear. The mechanisms by which TET2 is up-regulated by glucagon should be more explored.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks very much for pointing out the shortcomings of the manuscript. We agree with the reviewer that the manuscript is focused on the function of HNF4α-TET2-FBP1 axis in the control of gluconeogenesis, but not on its role in the pathogenesis of T2D. Following reviewer’s suggestion, we changed the title of the manuscript to “HNF4α-TET2-FBP1 axis contributes to gluconeogenesis and type 2 diabetes”. For the mechanisms by which TET2 is up-regulated by glucagon, we examined TET2 mRNA levels at different time points after a single dose of glucagon treatment in HepG2 cells. Interestingly, the results showed that TET2 mRNA levels significantly increased by 6 folds at 30 min and the sustained effect of glucagon on Tet2 mRNA levels persisted for more than 48 hours (refer to Fig. 3E).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Recommendations for the authors:</bold></p><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p><p>The authors indicate that they have overexpressed TET2 in HepG2 cells and primary mouse hepatocytes. The degree of overexpression should be shown. Is this similar to an increase in TET2 with fasting or HFD treatment?</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for reviewer’s helpful comment. Following reviewer’s suggestion, we examined the protein levels of overexpressed TET2 in HepG2 cells and primary mouse hepatocytes. The results revealed that the degree of TET2 overexpression (refer to Fig. 3J) is similar to the increase of TET2 under fasting or HFD treatment (Fig. 1C, D).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In Figures 2E-2G, the authors report results in Tet2-KO mice. Information on how these mice were generated is lacking. There is limited information about how Tet2-KO cells were generated, but again, I could not find anything about these mice in the methods section or figure legend. Is this whole-body or liver-specific Tet2-KO? How old were the mice at the time of PTT, GTT, or ITT?</p><p>Were these mice on chow or HFD? Are there any differences in body weight between WT and Tet2-KO mice?</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for reviewer’s helpful comment. Following reviewer’s suggestion, we provided the detailed information about the <italic>Tet2-KO</italic> mice, including the mouse generation in methods section. Moreover, the details of <italic>Tet2-KO</italic> mice used in each figure were clearly described in the figure legend. In this study, two mouse models were employed: whole-body <italic>Tet2-KO</italic> mice and liver-specific TET2 knockdown mice (AAV8-shTet2). The mice used for PTT, GTT and ITT were 8 weeks old and on HFD. To address reviewer’s concern, we compared the body weight of WT and <italic>Tet2-KO</italic> mice and results revealed that no significant differences in the body weight between WT and <italic>Tet2-KO</italic> mice at 8 and 10 weeks old when on a normal chow diet, as depicted in Figure 2I.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figures 3A-C shows that 48 hours after glucagon treatment, Tet2 and FBP1 mRNA increased. It's surprising that a single dose of glucagon would have effects that last that long. The peak rise in glucose following glucagon treatment occurs in 30 minutes. How do authors explain such a long effect of glucagon on Tet2 mRNA and protein?</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for reviewer’s constructive comment. To address reviewer’s concern, we examined the mRNA levels of TET2 and FBP1 at different time points following a single dose of glucagon treatment in HepG2 cells. Interestingly, the results showed that TET2 mRNA levels significantly increased by 6 folds at 30 min and the sustained effect of glucagon on Tet2 mRNA levels persisted for more than 48 hours (refer to Fig. 3E). The detailed mechanism underlying long effect of glucagon on Tet2 mRNA and protein needs further exploration.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It's interesting that in Figure 3F, Fbp1 and Tet2 mRNA expression correlated positively in both ad libitum and fasting conditions. I would expect that during fed conditions, gluconeogenesis would not be activated and thus would expect no correlation.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for reviewer’s constructive comment. According to the results in new Fig. 3H, the mRNA levels of Fbp1 and Tet2 indeed positively correlated in both ad libitum and fasting conditions, while the r value is higher and p value is lower in fasting condition compared to ad libitum. Notably, both the expression levels of Fbp1 and Tet2 increased under fasting treatment, which is consistent with Fig. 1C and Fig. 4K.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors state that &quot;Our results demonstrated that HNF4α recruits TET2 to the FBP1 promoter and activates FBP1 expression through demethylation&quot; What data points out that this is mediated through demethylation?</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for reviewer’s constructive comment.

The <italic>Tet2</italic> knockout (<italic>Tet2 KO</italic>) mice were originally purchased from the Jackson Laboratory (strain No. 023359) and we added the detailed information to method section of “Animal”. According to the previously reported phenotype of <italic>Tet2</italic> KO mice, it mainly includes bone marrow, spleen, islet and heart. Specifically, Tet2 KO mice led to an increase of total cell numbers in the bone marrow and spleen (PMID: 21873190), as well as an elevated white blood cell (WBC) count (PMID: 37541212). Additionally, Tet2 KO mice exhibited splenomegaly (PMID: 37541212, PMID: 21723200, PMID: 38773071, PMID: 21723200). And the morphology of the islets (PMID: 34417463), anatomical chamber volumes or ventricular functions (PMID: 38357791) were indistinguishable between the <italic>Tet2</italic> KO and wild type (WT) mice.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) An experiment showing the co-localization of TET2 and HNF4α in the mouse liver in fasted mice and/or in HFD-mice would strengthen the data shown in Figure 3.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for reviewer’s helpful comment.
