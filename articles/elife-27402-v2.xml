Chemical synthesis confirms hinokiflavone is the active molecule. Hinokiflavone inhibits splicing in vitro by blocking spliceosome assembly, preventing formation of the B complex. Cells treated with hinokiflavone show altered subnuclear organization specifically of splicing factors required for A complex formation, which relocalize together with SUMO1 and SUMO2 into enlarged nuclear speckles containing polyadenylated RNA. Hinokiflavone increases protein SUMOylation levels, both in in vitro splicing reactions and in cells. Hinokiflavone also inhibited a purified, <italic>E. coli</italic> expressed SUMO protease, SENP1, in vitro, indicating the increase in SUMOylated proteins results primarily from inhibition of de-SUMOylation. Using a quantitative proteomics assay we identified many SUMO2 sites whose levels increased in cells following hinokiflavone treatment, with the major targets including six proteins that are components of the U2 snRNP and required for A complex formation.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>hinokiflavone</kwd><kwd>RNA splicing</kwd><kwd>SUMO</kwd><kwd>SENP1</kwd><kwd>U2 snRNP</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>None</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010269</institution-id><institution>Wellcome</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>073980/Z/03/B</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lamond</surname><given-names>Angus I</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010269</institution-id><institution>Wellcome</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>097045/B/11/Z</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lamond</surname><given-names>Angus I</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010269</institution-id><institution>Wellcome</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>098391/Z/12/7</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hay</surname><given-names>Ronald T</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010269</institution-id><institution>Wellcome</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>105606/Z/14/Z</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hay</surname><given-names>Ronald T</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000780</institution-id><institution>European Commission</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PITN-GA-2011-290257</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tammsalu</surname><given-names>Triin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000266</institution-id><institution>Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>EP/L50497X/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>King</surname><given-names>Lewis J</given-names></name><name><surname>Kreinin</surname><given-names>Helmi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Hinokiflavone is identified as a splicing modulator that blocks progression from spliceosome complex A to complex B and inhibits SUMO protease SENP1, causing hyper-SUMOylation affecting 6 U2 snRNP proteins.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Pre-mRNA splicing is an essential step in gene expression in eukaryotes. During splicing, intron sequences are removed from nascent, pre-mRNA gene transcripts via two, sequential transesterification reactions, thereby joining exon sequences to generate messenger RNA (mRNA) for protein translation (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Wahl et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Papasaikas and Valcárcel, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lee and Rio, 2015</xref>]). The splicing of pre-mRNA takes place in the cell nucleus and is catalyzed by the large (&gt;3 MDa), ribonucleoprotein spliceosome complex. Spliceosome complexes assemble at the splice sites in a pre-mRNA transcript, involving a stepwise assembly pathway of the U1, U2 and U4/5/6 snRNP spliceosome subunits, together with additional protein splicing factors. The core splicing machinery, spliceosome assembly pathway and reaction mechanism is highly conserved across eukaryotes. Protein splicing factors have been shown to be targets for post translational modifications, including acetylation, phosphorylation and SUMOylation, which can affect the efficiency of spliceosome assembly and splicing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chen and Moore, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Pozzi et al., 2017</xref>). In mammalian cells the splicing machinery typically shows a punctate, or ‘speckled’ localisation pattern in the nucleus, with snRNPs also located in bright nuclear foci, which are termed Cajal bodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lamond and Spector, 2003</xref>).</p><p>In higher eukaryotes, most pre-mRNA transcripts have multiple introns and it is common for a single gene to give rise to multiple different mRNA products through alternative patterns of intron removal, e.g. via either the choice of different 5’ and/or 3’ splice sites, or via exon skipping etc. (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lee and Rio, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chabot, 2015</xref>]). Alternative splicing is thus a major mechanism for generating proteome diversity in higher eukaryotes and is likely to have played a major role in the evolution of organismal complexity. Changes in the pattern of alternative splicing of pre-mRNAs is highly regulated and plays an important role during organismal development, cellular differentiation and the response to many physiological stimuli. For example, a number of genes regulating apoptosis pathways, such as BCL2 and MCL2, can be alternatively spliced to generate distinct mRNAs encoding proteins that either promote, or inhibit, cell survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Wu and Tang, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">David and Manley, 2010</xref>).</p><p>Recent high-throughput, deep sequencing experiments have shown that almost all human genes produce alternatively spliced mRNA isoforms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Pan et al., 2008</xref>). The dysregulation of alternative splicing is also now recognized as a major mechanism for multiple forms of human disease, including inherited disorders, cancer, diabetes and neurodegenerative diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Le et al., 2015</xref>). The ability to target the modulation of specific classes of alternative pre-mRNA splicing events using small molecules is thus seen as an important new therapeutic strategy for drug development and future disease therapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Woll et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Ratni et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Naryshkin et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Chemical compounds are widely used as biotools to study the gene expression machineries involved in transcription and translation. In contrast, well-characterized compounds that can be used to dissect and study the splicing machinery are still very limited. Most splicing inhibitors described to date are natural products. The best-studied group are all SF3B1 inhibitors, which have either been isolated from the broth of bacteria, or are their synthetic derivatives, like Spliceostatin A, E7107 and herboxidine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kaida et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kotake et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Webb et al., 2013</xref>). In addition to the SF3B1 inhibitors, another plant derived compound, the biflavone isoginkgetin (extracted from the leaves of the ginko tree), has been reported to inhibit splicing, but its target remains unknown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">O'Brien et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>Biflavones such as isoginkgetin belong to a subclass of the plant flavonoid family, which have been reported to possess a broad spectrum of pharmacological activity, including antibacterial, anticancer, antiviral and anti-inflammatory functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kumar and Pandey, 2013</xref>). In view of their broad biological activity, we tested a set of biflavones for their ability to change pre-mRNA splicing in vitro and <italic>in cellulo</italic>. This identified the biflavone hinokiflavone as a new general splicing modulator active both in vitro and <italic>in cellulo</italic>. Further analysis indicated that hinokiflavone promotes unique changes in subnuclear structure and dramatically increases SUMOylation of a subset of spliceosome proteins by inhibiting SENP1 protease activity.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Biflavonoids as splicing modulators</title><p>We tested a set of bioflavonoids for a potential effect on pre-mRNA splicing in vitro, including amentoflavone, cupressuflavone, hinokiflavone and sciadopitysin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). As a positive control we included the previously reported biflavonoid splicing inhibitor, isoginkgetin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">O'Brien et al., 2008</xref>). Initially, we screened each compound at a high final concentration (500 µM), for a potential inhibitory effect on splicing of the model Ad1 and HPV18 E6 pre-mRNAs, using HeLa nuclear extract in conjunction with a non-radioactive RT-PCR in vitro splicing assay (see Materials and methods). Cupressuflavone did not inhibit splicing under these conditions, while hinokiflavone, amentoflavone, isoginkgetin and sciadopitysin all showed some inhibition of in vitro splicing of the adenovirus and/or the HPV18E6 pre-mRNAs. The strongest inhibitory effects were obtained with hinokiflavone and amentoflavone, which had not previously been identified as affecting either splicing, or spliceosome assembly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). We note that the active compounds each have a linkage connecting the B and A’ units of the two flavone moieties.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.27402.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Biflavones inhibit splicing in vitro.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Chemical structures of the five biflavones: hinokiflavone, amentoflavone, cupressuflavone, isoginkgetin and sciadopitysin.

A semiquantitative RT-PCR assay was performed, targeting a representative set of previously studied pre-mRNA transcripts. Thus, we used primer pairs to detect either changes in alternative pre-mRNA splicing for transcripts from the MCL1, NOP56, EIF4A2 and FAS genes, or changes in intron retention for transcripts from the HSP40, RIOK3, ACTR1b and DXO genes.

Thus, in HeLa and HEK293 cells, hinokiflavone promoted exon 2 skipping, thereby increasing the proportion of the pro-apoptotic mRNA isoform, whereas, in NB4 cells, multiple, aberrant alternatively spliced MCL1 isoforms were detected. In the presence of 10 µM hinokiflavone, a third band of around 1.5 kb was detected next to the expected MCL1-S (pro-apoptotic) and MCL1-L (anti-apoptotic) mRNA isoforms. In addition to the 1.5 kb band, a loss of the MCL1-S isoform and the appearance of a larger splice variant migrating between MCL1-S and MCL1-L was observed in cells treated with either 20 µM, or 30 µM hinokiflavone.</p><p>Intron retention in the HSP40 and RIOK3 transcripts was mainly detected in HeLa cells at 30 µM, in HEK293 cells at both 20 µM and 30 µM and in NB4 cells at all concentrations of hinokiflavone tested. In the case of ACTR1B, no changes in alternative splicing were detected in HeLa cells, whereas in HEK293 cells, intron inclusion was only observed in the presence of 10 µM hinokiflavone, while in NB4 cells intron inclusion was observed at all concentrations tested. Hinokiflavone also promoted intron 3 and intron 4 retention in the DXO transcripts and exon 4 skipping in the EIF4A2 transcripts in all cell lines and at all concentration tested. In the case of NOP56, hinokiflavone not only induced an increase in the production of NOP56 transcripts, with exon 8 included, but also induced the usage of alternative 5’ and 3’ splice sites. In the case of FAS, multiple PCR products were detected, which were individually cloned and sequenced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>). The FAS isoforms identified were either lacking exon 5, 6, 7 or 8, exon 6 and exon 7, or exons 6, 7 and 8.</p><p>To ensure that these observed effects on splicing in vitro and <italic>in cellulo</italic> were indeed caused by hinokiflavone, rather than by some minor product in the commercially available hinokiflavone isolated from a natural source, we developed a synthetic route for generating the hinokiflavone molecule. A detailed description of the synthetic route will be published separately (King et al., unpublished). Importantly, we find that chemically synthesized hinokiflavone is spectroscopically identical to hinokiflavone isolated from a natural source.

The reactions were analyzed both by denaturing PAGE to detect reaction products and by native gel electrophoresis to monitor spliceosome assembly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Hinokiflavone inhibited the formation of both splicing products and intermediates, with no inhibition seen with the DMSO control, in comparison with untreated nuclear extract (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). After 1 hr incubation, analysis using native gels showed the typical pattern of A, B and C spliceosome complexes in the DMSO control, similar to untreated nuclear extract. However, in the hinokiflavone treated extract, only H/E and A complexes were detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). This indicates that the inhibition of splicing caused by hinokiflavone results from a failure to assemble the B complex during spliceosome assembly. This may either result from a defect in the mechanism required for transition from the A to B complexes, or because a defective ‘A-like’ complex is formed that cannot be converted to a B complex.</p><fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.27402.008</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Hinokiflavone blocks spliceosome assembly prior to B complex formation.</title><p>Formation of splicing complexes on the Ad1 pre-mRNA was analysed on a native agarose gel after incubation with either DMSO (control), or 500 µM hinokiflavone.

This showed that in the presence of hinokiflavone, the sensitivity of the SENP1 fragment to protease digestion increased, indicating that hinokiflavone directly interacts with SENP1.</p><p>Another method to analyze ligand target interactions is the cellular thermal shift assay (CESTA). HeLa nuclear extract was incubated with either DMSO (control), or 500 µM hinokiflavone and heated to different temperatures, ranging from 30–50°C. The presence of soluble, endogenous SENP1 at each temperature was examined by western blotting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13">Figure 13C</xref>). In the presence of DMSO SENP1 was still soluble at 43°C, whereas no soluble SENP1 could be detected at any of the temperatures tested in the presence of hinokiflavone. This also indicates that hinokiflavone binds directly to SENP1, thereby altering its structure and concomitantly decreasing its thermal stability, consistent with the increase in protease sensitivity seen in the DARTS assay.</p><p>In summary, these data show that a structurally related group of biflavone compounds can inhibit purified SENP1 SUMO protease in vitro and this correlates with their potency as in vitro inhibitors of pre-mRNA splicing. The strongest inhibitor, hinokiflavone, was further shown to interact with SENP1 in vitro, using both the DARTS and CESTA assays. These data support the hypothesis that cells treated with hinokiflavone are prevented from de-conjugating SUMO, resulting in an accumulation of polySUMOylated proteins to levels above that seen in control cells.</p></sec><sec id="s2-9"><title>Identification of protein SUMOylation targets affected by hinokiflavone</title><p>Having identified hinokiflavone as a SUMO protease inhibitor in vitro, which causes the accumulation of poly-SUMOylated proteins <italic>in cellulo</italic>, we next sought to identify protein targets whose level of SUMO modification increases in cells treated with hinokiflavone.

We confirmed this to be a specific effect of hinokiflavone by developing a route for making synthetic hinokiflavone, which was shown to be active. Hinokiflavone blocks splicing of pre-mRNA substrates in vitro by inhibiting spliceosome assembly, specifically preventing B complex formation.</p><p>Multiple human cell lines treated with hinokiflavone show changes in alternative splicing patterns and altered nuclear organization of splicing factors required for the early stages of spliceosome assembly leading to A complex formation. This results in disruption of Cajal bodies (CBs) and concomitant formation of ‘mega speckles’, i.e., enlarged nuclear splicing speckles enriched in a subset of spliceosome proteins, along with SUMO1, SUMO2 and polyadenylated RNA. Hinokiflavone treated cells show dose and time-dependent cell cycle arrest phenotypes, along with varying degrees of apoptosis, the latter effect seen most strikingly in the promyelocytic NB4 cell line that expresses the PML-RARalpha fusion protein.</p><p>Hinokiflavone treated cells accumulate hyper-SUMOylated proteins, which we hypothesise results from hinokiflavone inhibiting de-SUMOylation. Consistent with this, we show that in vitro hinokiflavone can inhibit the catalytic activity of a purified, <italic>E. coli</italic> expressed fragment of the SUMO protease SENP1. Using a quantitative, mass spectrometry-based assay we also identified protein targets and mapped lysine residues showing increased levels of SUMO2 modification in hinokiflavone treated cells. The major hyperSUMOylated target proteins were enriched in pre-mRNA splicing factors, in particular, six components of the U2 snRNP spliceosome subunit, which is required for A complex formation. This included three lysine residues in the U2 snRNP protein PRPF40A, with K241, K375 and K517 showing a remarkable increase of &gt;20 fold in levels of SUMO2 modification after hinokiflavone treatment. Our data thus provide multiple lines of evidence linking increased SUMO modification of proteins in the pre-mRNA splicing machinery with downstream effects on alternative splicing, nuclear organization and cell cycle progression.</p><p>To date, the best studied group of splicing modulators are the SF3B1 inhibitors, such as Spliceostatin A, which either have been isolated from the broth of bacteria, or else are synthetic derivatives of these compounds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kaida et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kotake et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Webb et al., 2013</xref>). Several other natural compounds isolated from plants have also been shown to affect pre-mRNA splicing, including the flavones apigenin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Arango et al., 2013</xref>) and luteolin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chiba et al., 2016</xref>) and the biflavone isoginkgetin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">O'Brien et al., 2008</xref>), but in comparison with the SF3B1 inhibitors, very little is known about either their targets, or their mode of action. A recent study reported that isoginkgetin may affect splicing by modulating RNA polymerase elongation rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Boswell et al., 2017</xref>). As discussed below, we did not see evidence for hinokiflavone causing any major change in transcription. Furthermore, we observe that both isogingketin and hinokiflavone inhibit splicing of pre-synthesised transcripts in vitro, uncoupled from transcription. In this study, we compared the ability of the biflavones amentoflavone, cupressuflavone, hinokiflavone and sciadopitysin, to modify splicing, either in vitro, or <italic>in cellulo</italic>, comparing them with the previously described biflavone splicing inhibitor isoginkgetin. Our analysis showed that within this group of compounds hinokiflavone was the most potent biflavone modulator of splicing.</p><p>Hinokiflavone is a biapigenin found in many different plant families (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Harborne and Bryant, 1989</xref>). Previous studies, using in silico screens, have suggested several different proteins as potential targets for hinokiflavone, including the prostaglandin D2 synthetase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fong et al., 2015</xref>) and the matrix metalloproteinase-9 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kalva et al., 2014</xref>). We also tested the ability of hinokiflavone to inhibit a large panel of purified kinases in vitro and observed that it had either no, or only weak, non-specific inhibitory effects on any of the 120 different kinases tested (data not shown). In contrast, however, using direct biochemical assays, we identify here that hinokiflavone is a SUMO protease inhibitor. Specifically, we show that, (a) hinokiflavone inhibits the catalytic activity of a highly purified, <italic>E. coli</italic> expressed fragment of the SUMO protease SENP1 and (b) that treatment of multiple human cell lines with hinokiflavone resulted in a dramatic increase in the levels of SUMO1 and SUMO2/3 modified proteins. The effect in hinokiflavone treated cells appears to be specific to SUMO modification because we detected little or no parallel increase in cells in the levels of proteins linked with related post-translational protein modifiers, that is, either ubiquitin, or NEDD8. Accumulation of high molecular weight SUMOylated proteins was also observed in vitro when HeLa nuclear extracts were incubated with hinokiflavone.</p><p>We characterized in more detail the stimulation of SUMO modification in cells treated with hinokiflavone, using a previously developed, quantitative, MS-based proteomics assay in HEK293 SUMO2<sup>T90K</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Tammsalu et al., 2014</xref>). We identified 924 SUMO2 modified lysine residues in 543 target proteins and showed that 22 of these lysine residues increased SUMO2 levels more than five-fold after hinokiflavone treatment. Interestingly, this unbiased assay independently linked the effect of hinokiflavone with the pre-mRNA splicing machinery, with ten of the lysine residues showing the highest increase in SUMO2 modification located specifically in six U2 snRNP proteins.</p><p>We note that U2 snRNP is required for assembly of the pre-splicing A complex and that hinokiflavone prevents spliceosome assembly in vitro proceeding beyond formation of the A complex. It is possible, therefore, that one or more U2 snRNP proteins are transiently SUMOylated during the spliceosome assembly cycle and must be de-SUMOylated for assembly to proceed beyond the A complex. For example, we speculate this could be involved in a proof reading mechanism that ensures accurate selection of 5’ and 3’ splice sites before proceeding to form a catalytically active complex. This would provide a potential mechanism linking our observations that hinokiflavone both inhibits protein de-SUMOylation and prevents spliceosome assembly in vitro proceeding beyond the A complex. This would be consistent with our additional observations by fluorescence microscopy that specifically splicing factors involved in the early steps of the splicing process are enriched in the mega-speckles that are formed in hinokiflavone treated cells, while other splicing factors associated with later steps in spliceosome assembly remain mostly diffusely distributed throughout the nucleus.</p><p>Our current data mapping lysine residues in U2 snRNP proteins that are SUMO2 modified and which show enhanced SUMO2 modification after hinokiflavone treatment, are consistent with previous data suggesting a potential link between splicing and protein SUMOylation. A recent study by Pozzi et al., showed that several splicing factors were SUMO2-modified at different stages of the splicing reaction in vitro, including several components of U2 snRNP (SF3B1, SF3B3, SF3A1, SF3A2, SF3A3). It was further shown that inhibition of PRPF3 SUMOylation prevented the interaction of the U4/U6 di-snRNP with U5 to form the tri-snRNP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Pozzi et al., 2017</xref>). Interestingly, we note that hinokiflavone also caused an increase in SUMO2 modification (&gt;4 fold) on lysine 376 in PRPF3 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). Pelisch et al., reported that the Ser/Arg-rich non-snRNP protein splicing factor SRSF1 regulates protein SUMOylation and interacts with the SUMO E3 ligase PIAS1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Pelisch et al., 2010</xref>). Interestingly, SRSF1 was originally identified independently as both an essential splicing factor in vitro and also as a factor involved in the control of alternative splice site choice in cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cáceres and Krainer, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Zuo and Manley, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Xiao and Manley, 1998</xref>). Detailed biochemical studies have shown that SRSF1 is multifunctional, with important roles during early steps in spliceosome assembly, leading to formation of the A complex.</p><p>Two recent proteomics studies that systematically identified proteins that are SUMO2 modified in cells, using high-throughput, mass spectrometry-based proteomics methods, reported splicing factors amongst the many targets detected in HEK293 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Tammsalu et al., 2014</xref>) and HeLa cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hendriks et al., 2015</xref>). Both these studies identified PRPF40A as a SUMO2 target protein. In addition, Tammsalu et al., identified SNRPD2 and Hendriks et al., identified the U2 snRNP components SF3A2, SF3B1 and SF3B2 as targets for SUMO2 modification. Furthermore, in a recent study identifying the SENP inhibitor SI2, it was reported that blocking SENP activity increased the levels of SUMOylation of multiple proteins, including the splicing factors USP39, SF3B1 and PRPF40A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Wen et al., 2014</xref>). In this latter study, the authors did not map the specific lysine residues that were modified by SUMO2 and none of these three studies investigate whether either SUMO modification, or inhibition of SENP activity, affects pre-mRNA splicing. It is nonetheless interesting that here we also find highly increased SUMO2 modification of the same U2 snRNP proteins, SF3B1 and PRPF40A, upon inhibition of SENP activity by hinokiflavone.</p><p>PRPF40A is a conserved spliceosome protein, present throughout eukaryotes from yeast to mammals. It was identified as a component of the U2 snRNP spliceosome subunit and suggested to have a role in mediating interactions between the separate 5’ and 3’ splice sites on pre-mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Makarov et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abovich and Rosbash, 1997</xref>). While other proteins may also influence the effects of hinokiflavone on spliceosome assembly, including potentially interactions between SUMO1, as well as SUMO2 modified targets (which we were not able to address here), it is nonetheless striking that all the splicing factors that we detect here as showing the highest increase (&gt;five fold) in SUMO2 levels in cells treated with hinokiflavone, that is, PRPF40A, SF3A2, SF3B1, SF3B2, SNRPD1 and U2SURP, are either core components of, or associated with, U2 snRNPs and have been shown to interact with each other (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Makarov et al., 2012</xref>). Several reversible, post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation, ubiquitination, methylation and acetylation, were previously reported to be important for the assembly and the disassembly of the spliceosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chen and Moore, 2014</xref>). Our present data suggest that reversible SUMO modification may also be an important feature of mechanisms affecting spliceosome assembly and alternative splice site choice.</p><p>Previous studies using the SF3B1-targeted splicing inhibitors have shown that they are potent growth inhibitors of many different cancer cell lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Sakai et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Asai et al., 2007</xref>). When used in combination with BCL-2 inhibitors, these SF3B1 inhibitors have been demonstrated to induce apoptosis in small lung cancer cells, chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells and head and neck cancer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gao and Koide, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Larrayoz et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gao et al., 2014</xref>). This has been mainly attributed to their ability to change the alternative splicing of MCL1 pre-mRNAs. Indeed, meayamycin and spliceostatin A showed the greatest effect on exon two skipping towards the pro-apoptotic product of MCL1, when compared with their effects on alternative splicing of 34 other genes important for cell proliferation and apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Papasaikas et al., 2015</xref>). Here we show that, in common with the previously demonstrated effect of these SF3B1 inhibitors, hinokiflavone treatment also changes the alternative splicing of MCL1 pre-mRNA to favour the production of the proapoptotic isoform MCL1-S, over the antiapoptotic isoform MCL1-L. These differential effects of splicing inhibitors on alternative splicing likely reflect the differential requirements for splicing factors at different introns within a transcript.</p><p>The effect of hinokiflavone on MCL1 splicing and its ability to induce cell cycle arrest and/or apoptosis, raise the possibility that either hinokiflavone itself, or a synthetic derivative thereof, could be developed in future as a novel cancer therapeutic. We observed significant variation in the dose response to hinokiflavone between human cancer cell lines. The greatest effect on cell survival was seen in the human acute promyeolytic leukemia cell line NB4, where extensive apoptosis was induced upon treatment with 10 µM hinokiflavone. This positively correlated with the large effect of hinokiflavone in also altering alternative pre-mRNA splicing in NB4 cells, including promoting splicing of the pro-apoptotic isoform of MCL1. However, it is plausible that an increase in PML SUMOylation also contributes to the extreme sensitivity of NB4 cells to hinokiflavone. For example, our MS data in HEK293 cells showed ~twofold increased SUMO2 modification of PML after hinokiflavone treatment. It has been shown that the use of arsenic (As<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>) for therapeutic treatment of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) patients is effective because it triggers degradation of PML and oncogenic PML fusion proteins, such as PML-RARalpha, through promoting their hyper-SUMOylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Ferhi et al., 2016</xref>). We propose that hinokiflavone could have a similar effect through its ability to block SENP activity and therefore stimulate accumulation of hyper-SUMOylated proteins.</p><p>In summary, this study has identified the plant derived biflavone hinokiflavone as an inhibitor of SUMO protease activity that affects spliceosome assembly and splice site selection, leading to major changes in alternative splicing patterns in human cancer cell lines. Our development of an efficient route for the chemical synthesis of hinokiflavone (King et al., unpublished), has allowed us to confirm that the hinokiflavone molecule is the active compound and will facilitate the future investigation of its detailed mechanism of action and exploration of its development as a potential cancer therapeutic. This should help to clarify the relation between SUMO modification and alternative splicing and allow a better understanding of how hinokiflavone exerts such a potent increase in SUMOylation of U2 snRNP proteins.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Compounds</title><p>Hinokiflavone, amentoflavone, cupressuflavone and sciadopitysin were purchased from Extrasynthese (Genay Cedex, France) and isoginkgetin was purchased from MerckMillipore (Darmstadt, Germany).</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Cell culture, RNA isolation and RT-PCR</title><p>HeLa (RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/CVCL_0030">CVCL_0030</ext-link>), HEK293 (RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/CVCL_0045">CVCL_0045</ext-link>) and NB4 (RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/CVCL_0005">CVCL_0005</ext-link>) cells were purchased from ATCC and cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mM glutamine (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA) and 100 µg/ml streptomycin (100X stock, Life Technologies).

Full MS scan covered a mass range of mass-to-charge ratio (m/z) either 300–1800, or 300–1600, during standard and comprehensive peptide analyses, respectively. Target value was set to 1,000,000 ions with a maximum injection time (IT) of 20 ms and full MS was acquired at a mass resolution of 70,000 at m/z 200.

Hydrolysis of peptide bonds C-terminal to either Lys, or Lys and Arg, with a maximum of three missed cleavages was allowed for peptides processed with either Lys-C, or with Lys-C and Trypsin, respectively. Samples acquired after an additional Glu-C digestion were analyzed with enzyme specificity set to C-terminal Lys, Glu and Asp with a maximum of five missed cleavages. Carbamidomethylation of cysteine residues was specified as a fixed modification and oxidation of methionines, acetylation of protein N-termini and where applicable, Gly-Gly adduct on internal lysine residues and phosphorylation of Ser, Tyr and Thr, were selected as variable modifications.

All datasets were filtered by posterior error probability to achieve a false discovery rate of 1% at protein, peptide and modified site level. Peptides were identified using a reverse decoy database search and potential contaminants of non-human origin were excluded. The list of SUMO2 modification sites (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>) is based on diGly-Lys containing peptides, where modification site localization probability is greater than 75% and mass error is less than 2 ppm, or 4 ppm in the case of unsuccessful recalibration. The non-normalized SILAC ratios of diGly-Lys-containing peptides were normalized according to the median normalization factor obtained for the complete proteome experiment and was based on the non-normalized and normalized protein ratios reported in the MaxQuant output file.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by James Manley (Senior Editor) and three reviewers, one of whom, Juan Valcárcel, is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>In this manuscript Pawellek et al. describe their identification of the plant biflavonoid hinokiflavone as a modulator of pre-mRNA splicing in vitro and of alternative pre-mRNA splicing in mammalian cells. Moreover, they show that in vitro hinokiflavone inhibits pre-mRNA splicing by stalling spliceosome assembly at the A complex stage and thus blocking B complex formation. IF studies of cells treated with hinokiflavone revealed enlarged speckles and relocalisations of splicing factors to the speckles that are known to be involved in A complex formation. On the basis of the localisation of SUMO1 and 2 in the enlarged speckles, the authors then show that hinokiflavone increases protein SUMOylation, and biochemical assays indicate that the drug inhibits SENP1 SUMO protease. By quantitative MS and immunoblotting studies they finally show increased levels of SUMO2 modification in hinokiflavone-treated cells. Strikingly, several proteins associated with U2 snRNP were found to be particularly enriched among SUMO2-modified proteins and decreased interaction between some of these factors. The authors therefore conclude that increased SUMOylation of U2 proteins in the presence of hinokiflavone may lead to mis-regulation/inhibition of pre-mRNA splicing.</p><p>This is a solid and comprehensive analysis and a welcome addition to the rather limited toolbox of small molecule modulators of pre-mRNA splicing. The study also provides a novel focused set of reversible post-translational modifications that act during the spliceosome cycle. Moreover, the manuscript will trigger further work to clarify the effects of these compounds and their eventual use for splicing modulation.</p><p>Essential modifications:</p><p>1) In view of the relatively moderate SUMOylation level of U2 proteins upon treatment of cells with hinokiflavone (as shown by western blots; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig16">Figure 16B</xref>), it is striking that the inhibitor completely blocks B complex formation in vitro. Therefore, it is important for the authors to investigate the level of SUMOylation of the various relevant U2 proteins in the stalled A complexes. This could be accomplished by immunoblotting using purified stalled A complexes. While the correlation between increased SUMOylation of several U2 proteins and the observed stalling of A complexes in the presence of hinokiflavine is highly suggestive, the authors cannot at present exclude the possibility that additional (non-A-complex) spliceosomal proteins may also be hyperSUMOylated in the presence of the drug, which may also contribute to splicing inhibition.</p><p>2) Also related to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig16">Figure 16</xref>: the authors should make an effort to better explain in the text how the experiment was conducted and also label the panels in ways that will facilitate a more direct interpretation of the result (e.g. labeling the positions expected for the different protein species and their sumoylated forms; it might also help to provide a small schematic to show the initial separation of insoluble vs. insoluble, followed by the co-IP of the soluble). The western blot panels also need to be annotated to indicate the main bands corresponding to each protein, as well as the SUMOylated species. Are the size markers correct for SF3B2, which is 145 kDa? It might help to state explicitly that the initial hypothesis (that PRPF40A SUMOylation affects interactions with other proteins) could not be addressed due to the presence of SUMOylated protein only in the insoluble pellet. In addition, the authors should explain better their interpretation of this result: on one hand, PRPF40A and SF3B2 interact under normal conditions, on the other, their sumoylated forms are only present in insoluble aggregates; it is therefore unclear if sumoylation directly affects their interaction or the modification simply makes these proteins – and perhaps other proteins – insoluble and therefore part of an aggregate. How does formation of an aggregate contribute to splicing regulation? Simply by decreasing the overall levels of these proteins / U2 snRNP?</p><p>3) Some of the figures would greatly benefit from data quantification. Specifically:</p><p>a) Subsection “Hinokiflavone blocks cell cycle progression” and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>. Axes should be labelled clearly (or explained in the legend). It would be better to use the same scale for all panels, allowing a fairer comparison between DMSO and hinokiflavone. The claims made in the text are not all obviously supported by the data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4 e</xref>.g. &quot;dependent on time and concentration&quot; but only one time point and concentration are shown. It's presumably relevant to the statement about apoptosis that the main peak in the NB4 + hinikoflavone panel is to the left of the main peaks in all other panels? Perhaps aligning the two panels for each cell line vertically would be better to facilitate comparison – or superimpose the two sets of data in different colours? Overall, the text needs to provide a clearer justification for the conclusions stated, possibly with additional data shown or minimally reference to &quot;data not shown&quot; if necessary.</p><p>b) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>. The relocalization to &quot;megaspeckles&quot; is clear for SRSF2, U1A and U2AF65. It's much less clear for DDX46, SART1 and pan-SR (at least from the images shown) – the SR speckles actually appear larger in DMSO than hinikoflavone. It would be good to provide some kind of quantitative analysis of size and/or number of speckles/megaspeckles per cell, and to define a threshold for &quot;megaspeckle&quot; size.</p><p>c) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13">Figure 13B</xref>. It would be good to see some quantification of the protease sensitivity with an indication of reproducibility (e.g. expressed as% full length compared to no digestion).

While this report suggested the requirement of sumoylation for accumulation or recruitment of the U5/4/6 tri-snRNP to form complex B, the results of Pawellek et al. argue for a role of de-sumoylation of U2 snRNP components in the transition from A to B.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.27402.033</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential modifications:</p><p>1) In view of the relatively moderate SUMOylation level of U2 proteins upon treatment of cells with hinokiflavone (as shown by western blots; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig16">Figure 16B</xref>), it is striking that the inhibitor completely blocks B complex formation in vitro.

However, we point out that this was exactly why we carried out as part of our study an in depth, unbiased proteomics screen using a state of the art, quantitative MS approach (Tammsalu et al., 2014). We have therefore included in this manuscript data that comprehensively map the SUMO-modified lysine residues in target proteins that are affected by hinokiflavone. We have described this SUMO2 target screen in detail in the manuscript. We feel that the results showing that 6 of the most highly SUMO2 modified proteins detected were found to be U2 snRNP proteins is striking, as is the unprecedented level of increased SUMO2 modification we detected (~145 fold!) on the PRPF40A protein. We have now added an additional IP experiment in the revised manuscript, using a stable cell line expressing FP-tagged SUMO2, which shows that in this cell background hinokiflavone treatment for 8hrs results in SUMOylation of &gt;15% of the PRPF40A protein. We respectfully feel that further mechanistic studies on how the different protein targets of SUMO2 affect spliceosome assembly and alternative splicing will have to be addressed and published in separate future in depth analyses, particularly since the observed effects on splicing may depend upon an interplay between SUMO2 and SUMO1 modified proteins, which we cannot currently address (this possibility is now mentioned in the revised manuscript). In the revised manuscript we have tried to present a very balanced picture of what our data show and how this relates to other studies in the literature on the effects of SUMO modification on pre-mRNA splicing.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Also related to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig16">Figure 16</xref>: the authors should make an effort to better explain in the text how the experiment was conducted and also label the panels in ways that will facilitate a more direct interpretation of the result (e.g. labeling the positions expected for the different protein species and their sumoylated forms; it might also help to provide a small schematic to show the initial separation of insoluble vs. insoluble, followed by the co-IP of the soluble).</p></disp-quote><p>We have revised the manuscript to address this.
