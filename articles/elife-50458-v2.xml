Toll-like receptors (TLRs) orchestrate immune responses to injury by recognizing pathogen- or danger-associated molecular patterns. TLR4, the prototypic receptor for LPS, also mediates inflammation after O<sub>3</sub>, triggered by endogenous hyaluronan. Regulation of TLR4 signaling is incompletely understood. TLR5, the flagellin receptor, is expressed in alveolar macrophages, and regulates immune responses to environmental injury. Using in vivo animal models of TLR4-mediated inflammations (LPS, O<sub>3</sub>, hyaluronan), we show that TLR5 impacts the in vivo response to LPS, hyaluronan and O<sub>3</sub>. We demonstrate that immune cells of human carriers of a dominant negative TLR5 allele have decreased inflammatory response to O<sub>3</sub> exposure ex vivo and LPS exposure in vitro. Using primary murine macrophages, we find that TLR5 physically associates with TLR4 and biases TLR4 signaling towards the MyD88 pathway. Our results suggest an updated paradigm for TLR4/TLR5 signaling.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Immune cells in the lung help guard against infections. On the surface of these cells are proteins called TLR receptors that recognize dangerous molecules or DNA from disease-causing microbes such as bacteria. When the immune cells detect these invaders, the TLR receptors spring into action and trigger an inflammatory response to destroy the microbes. This inflammation usually helps the lung clear infections. But it can also be harmful and damage the lung, for example when inflammation is caused by non-infectious substances such as pollutants in the atmosphere.</p><p>There are several TLR receptors that each recognize a specific molecule. In 2010, researchers showed that the receptor TLR4 is responsible for causing inflammation in the lung after exposure to pollution. Another receptor called TLR5 also helps activate the immune response in the lung. But it was unclear whether this receptor also plays a role in pollution-linked lung damage.</p><p>Now, Hussain, Johnson, Sciurba et al. – including one of the researchers involved in the 2010 study – have investigated the role of TLR5 in immune cells from the lungs of humans and mice. The experiments showed that TLR5 works together with TLR4 and helps trigger an inflammatory response to both pollutants and bacteria. Hussain et al. found that people lacking a working TLR5 receptor (which make up 3–10% of the population) are less likely to experience lung inflammation when exposed to pollution or bacterial proteins that activate TLR4.</p><p>These findings suggest that people without TLR5 may be protected from pollution-induced lung injury. Further research into the role of TLR5 could help develop genetic tests for identifying people who are more sensitive to damage from pollution. This information could then be used to determine the likelihood of a patient experiencing certain lung diseases.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>inflammation</kwd><kwd>innate immune receptors</kwd><kwd>TLR4</kwd><kwd>TLR5</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000066</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Z01ES102605</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Garantziotis</surname><given-names>Stavros</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000066</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Z01ES102005</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Fessler</surname><given-names>Michael B</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The response to TLR4 ligands in mice and humans is modulated by TLR5, which participates in the TLR4 signaling complex.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Lung disease is a major contributor to morbidity and mortality worldwide. In the US alone, over 15% of the population suffers from lung disease, at an annual cost of 120,000 deaths, and &gt;$50 billion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Redd, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kochanek et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Ford et al., 2015</xref>). Environmental lung injury, for example through inhaled lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or elevated ozone (O<sub>3</sub>) levels, exacerbates lung disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bell et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Katsouyanni et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hubbell et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Thorne et al., 2005</xref>). For example, household LPS levels are directly associated with asthma symptoms and asthma-related health care utilization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Thorne et al., 2005</xref>). Also, sound epidemiological studies suggest that for every 10 parts-per-billion (ppb) increase in O<sub>3</sub> levels there is an associated mortality increase of 0.39–0.87% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Katsouyanni et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Levy et al., 2005</xref>). It is therefore imperative to understand the mechanisms of environmentally induced lung injury.</p><p>Innate immune activation is a major contributor to lung disease pathogenesis and environmentally-induced exacerbations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Miller and Peden, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Garantziotis and Schwartz, 2010</xref>). Toll-like receptors (TLRs) orchestrate the innate immune response to lung injury by recognizing exogenous pathogen- or endogenous danger-associated molecular patterns. TLR4 is the prototypic receptor for LPS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kawai and Akira, 2010</xref>), which is found in particulate-matter pollution and house dust (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Thorne et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Mueller-Anneling et al., 2004</xref>) and is a major contributor to sepsis-induced lung injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Andonegui et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Baumgarten et al., 2006</xref>). TLR4 also mediates inflammation and airway hyperresponsiveness after O<sub>3</sub> exposure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Garantziotis et al., 2010</xref>), triggered by release of the endogenous sugar hyaluronan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Garantziotis et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>Regulation of TLR4 signaling is still incompletely understood. TLR4 can heterodimerize with other TLR like TLR2 and TLR6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Stewart et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Wang et al., 2014</xref>); in these cases, the partner TLRs serve to expand the TLR4 ligand spectrum. However, until now there has not been evidence of TLR4 interaction with other TLR, that modulates TLR4 signaling in response to its own ligands. TLR4-TLR5 interaction has been reported once (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Mizel et al., 2003</xref>), wherein TLR4 was shown to promote nitric oxide production after flagellin exposure. We therefore hypothesized that the reciprocal interaction may also be true, that is TLR5 participates in TLR4 signaling after environmental lung injury. TLR5, the prototypic receptor for bacterial flagellin, is expressed in alveolar macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Shikhagaie et al., 2014</xref>), is induced after injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Menendez et al., 2011</xref>) and regulates the immune response to injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Burdelya et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Uematsu et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Wilson et al., 2012</xref>). TLR5 plays an important role in immunity and metabolism and has been implicated in processes as varied as asthma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Wilson et al., 2012</xref>), antiviral defense (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Zhang et al., 2014</xref>), ischemia-reperfusion injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Parapanov et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fukuzawa et al., 2011</xref>), radiation–induced injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Burdelya et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Burdelya et al., 2012</xref>), and regulation of gut immunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Uematsu et al., 2008</xref>). Furthermore, known functional genetic polymorphisms in <italic>TLR5</italic> are associated with susceptibility to infections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hawn et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Grube et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">West et al., 2013</xref>) and autoimmune disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gewirtz et al., 2006</xref>). These findings suggest a clinically relevant role of TLR5 in human immune regulation in the response to injury.</p><p>We show that TLR5 deficiency in mice significantly alters the in vivo response to TLR4 activators LPS, hyaluronan and O<sub>3</sub>. Mechanistically, we show that after ultrapure LPS exposure, TLR5 co-immunoprecipitates with MyD88, TLR4 and LPS. The presence of TLR5 promotes formation of the Myddosome, that is association of MyD88 and IRAK4, and biases TLR4 signaling towards the MyD88 pathway. Finally, we demonstrate that human carriers of a dominant-negative TLR5 allele have decreased inflammatory response to O<sub>3</sub> exposure in vivo and LPS exposure in vitro. Our results thus suggest that TLR5 participates in TLR4 signaling and modulates environmental lung injury in disease-relevant exposures that lead to TLR4 activation.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>TLR5 promotes TLR4-mediated inflammation and airway hyperresponsiveness in vivo</title><p>We first investigated the effect of TLR5 on TLR4 signaling in vivo, by exposing Tlr5-deficient mice or wildtype controls to LPS via intraperitoneal administration.

In aggregate, the presented results support that TLR5 promotes TLR4 signaling in several models of TLR4 activation through pathogen- or danger-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs or DAMPs, that is LPS or hyaluronan respectively) and promotes TLR4-mediated inflammation and airway hyperresponsiveness in vivo.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Genetic TLR5 deficiency in humans impacts TLR4 signaling in vitro and ex vivo</title><p>We then investigated the effect of TLR5 in human TLR4 signaling.

Recent evidence highlights the role of molecules of the TLR4 receptor complex in modulating TLR4 signaling. For example, elegant work has demonstrated that CD14, which is necessary for LPS binding to TLR4, also controls TLR4 endocytosis after LPS ligation, and thus is necessary for TRIF signaling, which is thought to occur in the endosomal compartment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Zanoni et al., 2011</xref>). Our work further suggests that TLR4 signaling is modulated by the addition of TLR5 to the receptor complex. Unlike CD14, TLR5 does not appear to regulate LPS-induced internalization of TLR4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Our findings rather support a model in which TLR5 promotes TLR4/MyD88 signaling at the plasma membrane by enhancing the assembly of the Myddosome. Importantly, our work suggests that TLR5 regulation of TLR4 signaling is biologically significant. TLR5-deficient mice had approx. 30–50% decreased cytokine expression in local and systemic LPS models of lung inflammation, while airway hyperresponsiveness after ozone or hyaluronan exposure was significantly reduced, and inflammatory gene induction after hyaluronan exposure was abolished. It is possible that the ‘fine-tuning’, MyD88-promoting effects of TLR5 are particularly evident in lower-grade inflammation such as ozone- or hyaluronan-induced, which explains the larger impact on TLR5 deficiency on human and murine inflammation after ozone exposure compared to LPS exposure.</p><p>Using primary murine and human macrophages, we demonstrate that, in the physiological state, TLR5 co-immunoprecipitates with MyD88 after ultrapure LPS exposure, but only in the presence of TLR4. This indicates that TLR5 is recruited into the Myddosome assembly, along with TLR4, upon TLR4 activation. Indeed, it has been postulated that the ability of the Myddosome to form 7:4 and 8:4 MyD88:IRAK4 stoichiometries is a potential mechanism through which clusters of activated TLR receptors can be formed and different TLR receptors can be recruited into the same assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Motshwene et al., 2009</xref>). Higher-order assembly of receptor complexes in lipid raft microdomains is likely to be crucial in the fine-regulation of immune responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gay et al., 2011</xref>). Our work suggests that TLR5 may be part of the higher-order receptor assembly that regulates TLR4 signaling. TLR4 is a promiscuous receptor, having been found to heterodimerize with TLR2 and TLR6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Stewart et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Wang et al., 2014</xref>) but the effect of heteromerization until now has always been to expand the TLR4 ligand spectrum. To our knowledge, this is the first work to demonstrate that TLR heteromerization may serve to modulate canonical TLR signaling. Further research will be necessary to uncover the precise mechanism of this effect. TLR5 heteromerization with TLR4 may help recruit additional MyD88 moieties to the signaling complex, and thus promote downstream signaling. Alternatively, or perhaps in addition, endogenous activators of both TLR4 and TLR5, like hyaluronan or HMGB1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Das et al., 2016</xref>) may engage these receptors and promote the signaling response.</p><p>A recent paper supported the role or TLR5 in TLR4 signaling, showing similar effects of the rs5744168 minor allele polymorphism on TNFα and IL-8 expression by human monocytes after LPS exposure, and also demonstrating that TLR5 does not influence the gene expression of TLR4 (45), as we also show. By contrast, that paper could not confirm that TLR5 is modifying the NFκB pathway. This apparent discrepancy may be due to different research methodologies: These authors used gene silencing which only resulted in approx. 50% reduction of TLR5 expression, as well as reporter cell lines with transfection-induced TLR5 expression, as opposed to our use of primary cells with genetically knocked-out gene function. Furthermore, the authors of that study did show an effect for TLR5 on NFκB when transfecting with lower (more physiological) doses of TLR5 DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Dickey et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>In summary, our results suggest a new model of TLR4-TLR5 complex formation in response to the PAMP LPS or the DAMP hyaluronan (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). We propose that the hitherto accepted model of TLR4 signaling through pure TLR4 homodimers rather reflects the TLR5-deficient state. In TLR5-expressing cells, TLR5 participates in a heteromeric higher-order TLR4 receptor complex and potentiates MyD88 signaling by promoting efficient assembly of the Myddosome. This may suggest that exposures that induce TLR5 expression, such as DNA injury, p53 activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Menendez et al., 2011</xref>) or flagellated bacterial infection may in parallel prime the MyD88-dependent pro-inflammatory response to LPS, due to the presence of more TLR5 receptors which may promote TLR4 signaling. Since TLR5 signals through MyD88, in a finite TLR4 receptor pool the presence of TLR5/TLR4 higher-order complexes would bias TLR4 signaling towards MyD88. Notably, cell surface expression of TLR4 on immune cells is low (a few hundred or thousand molecules per cell) compared to other TLRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Visintin et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Juarez et al., 2010</xref>), supporting that the presence of relatively few TLR5 receptor molecules may suffice to augment MyD88 signaling downstream of TLR4.</p><fig id="fig9" position="float"><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><title>Proposed model of TLR5-TLR4 interaction during environmental lung injury.</title><p>The current model of canonical TLR4 activation rather applies to the TLR5 deficient status (left panel).

The TLR5-deficient allele was generated in the 129S1 genome and subsequently backcrossed to C57BL/6 before being transferred to the Jackson Laboratory by the donating investigator. When possible, wildtype littermate control mice were used in our study in parallel to commercial wildtype C57BL/6J controls. To ensure that our results were not due to locality-influenced microbiome changes, we repeated experiments in mice that were bred at the NIEHS vivarium, as well as mice purchased from the Jackson Laboratory and studied within 1 week of arrival. In some experiments, mice received neomycin water to control gut microbiome. Results were comparable independent of provenance or antibiotic dosing. Mice were given access to water and chow ad libitum and were maintained at a 12 hr dark-light cycle. No differences in body weight were observed at the ages studied (6–12 weeks old).

To block spontaneous breathing, mice were given pancuronium bromide i.p. (0.8 mg/kg; Sigma-Aldrich) 5 min prior to assessment of airway responses. To measure airway responsiveness, a single-frequency forced oscillation waveform, followed by a broadband forced oscillation waveform (matched to the animal breathing frequency) were applied using the Flexiware 7.6 software default mouse inhaled dose-response script. The resulting pressure, volume, and flow signals were fit to either the Single Compartment or Constant Phase model of the lung to obtain total respiratory system resistance (R<sub>rs</sub>) and elastance (E<sub>rs</sub>) or Newtonian resistance (R<sub>n</sub>, generally understood as proximal airway resistance), tissue damping (G, generally understood as peripheral tissue resistance), and tissue elastance (H), respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Irvin and Bates, 2003</xref>).

After obtaining informed consent through a Duke University Institutional Review Board approved protocol, healthy human subjects were exposed to filtered air and ozone (200 parts per billion) in a crossover challenge designed study. Exposures were for 135 min, during which participants alternated between resting and walking on a treadmill at 2–3 mph to mimic an individual performing mildly strenuous activity under ambient conditions. Ozone was created from a 100% O2 source by cold plasma corona discharge (Ozotech, Yreka CA), and mixed with filtered air before addition to chamber and was continuously monitored. The order of filtered air or ozone exposure was randomized for every participant, with at least a 21 day washout period. Approximately 20 hr after exposure, participants underwent a flexible bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage. Following bronchial alveolar lavage, human alveolar macrophages were isolated. After red cell lysis and counting, the macrophages were re-suspended in medium (RPMI1640 with 10% heat-inactivated FBS, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin) and plated in a 24 well plate at a density of 200,000 cells per well. The cells were maintained in a CO2 incubator at 37° C for 2 hr. After 2 hr, the medium was replaced to remove non-adherent cells and then 2 hr later, the supernatant was collected and the cells were harvested for RNA. RNA extraction was performed using the Fourth Edition Qiagen Protocol (Qiagen, RNeasy Mini Kit, 4th edition, Valencia, CA), followed by DNase treatment (DNase I, Ambion, Austin, TX) and cDNA synthesis (BioRad). RT-PCR was performed on an ABI SDS 7500 (Applied Biosystems) using SYBR Green Reagent (Clontec Laboratories Inc, Mountain View, CA). TLR5 expression was determined in comparison to the 18 s RNA housekeeping gene and the data reported as fold change over the matched filter air sample for each individual subject. The following primers were used for RT-PCR: 18 s (Fwd: <named-content content-type="sequence">GTAACCCGTTGAACCCCATT</named-content>, Rev: <named-content content-type="sequence">CCATCCAATCGGTAGTAGCG</named-content>); TLR4 (Fwd: <named-content content-type="sequence">GGCCATTGCTGCCAACAT</named-content>, Rev: <named-content content-type="sequence">CAACAATCA</named-content> <named-content content-type="sequence">CCTTTCGGCTTTT</named-content>), TLR5 (Fwd: <named-content content-type="sequence">TGTATGCACTGTCACTCTGACTCTGT</named-content>, Rev: <named-content content-type="sequence">AGCCCCGGAACTTTGTGACT</named-content>).

requests and the accompanying author responses.</p></boxed-text><p><bold>Acceptance summary:</bold></p><p>Your revision now provides sound evidence for the involvement of TLR5 in the TLR4 signaling. Your additional experiments have taken away the concerns that the TLR5 participation found was due to artifacts like effects of contaminating TLR5 ligands.</p><p>The concept that TLR5 is not just a flagellin receptor, but has a sizable role in MYD88 dependent TLR4 signaling is of importance for pathology, such as lung injury by substances like ozone. Based on this work, it is to be expected that a role for TLR5 in other pathology will be pursued by others as well.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;TLR5 participates in the TLR4 receptor complex and biases towards MyD88-dependent signaling in environmental lung injury&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by Tadatsugu Taniguchi as the Senior Editor, a Reviewing Editor, and two reviewers. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>In this paper the function of TLR5 as part of the TLR4 signaling pathway for LPS and for hyaluronan recognition is described. Using TLR5 KO mice and human subjects carrying a TLR5 mutation LPS signaling was found to be inhibited, in vitro as well in vivo. Data are provided that TLR4/TLR5 complex could be formed after stimulations.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The central issue with the paper is whether the 'ultrapure' LPS is free from contamination for instance with flagellin, DNA and PGN. The LPS purity issue was addressed in vitro with the TLR4 KO control, but the reviewers consider that in-vivo proof is also necessary. A TLR 4-blocking experiment in TLR5-/- mice would be needed to see whether there is a pure TLR4 response. Likewise testing LPS from other sources is essential.</p><p>2) A second major issue is the ability to demonstrate that there is real TLR4/5 synergy in vitro and in vivo. The BMDM studies in vitro argue against a synergy model, since it is not likely that DAMPs that could be synergizing with LPS are being released in a short time frame.</p><p>3) A third point is the question what triggers TLR5 in the models used if there would be no flagellin moieties around? Endogenous ligands of TLR5 that have been described in the literature should be considered (and be mentioned in the introduction and the discussion. Could hyaluronan have direct or indirect TLR5 activating properties?</p><p>4) The reviewers feel that there are some invalid assumptions in the interpretation of the downstream signaling results regarding MyD88 and NFkB. The conclusion that TLR5 is driving TLR4-MyD88 but not TLR4-TRIF dependent signaling, may be an overstatement. Only data are provided that the TRIF-dependent arm is not affected is the lack of a change in IRF3 localization. This does not preclude an effect on TRIF-NFkB signaling. Some (potentially time-consuming) experiments that would really clarify this point would be to determine if TLR5 can bind to TRIF and examine the phenotype of BMDM from a TLR5/MyD88 double mutant mouse. These experiments are not strictly necessary if the interpretation/conclusions are appropriately tempered.</p><p>5) Along those same lines, the TRIF pathway can affect NFkB as well as IFN signaling, so the authors should rephrase how they deal with this point in subsection “TLR5 promotes TLR4-mediated inflammation and airway hyperresponsiveness in vivo”, subsection “TLR5 modulates TLR4-dependent signaling.”, Discussion section and in their model Figure 9.</p><p>6) Somewhat related is a caveat about the nanostring interpretation. Because NFkB-dependent genes on the nanostring data are over-represented, the authors conclude that NFkB is being regulated directly. Alternatively, since these data are from whole lung tissue, this could just be reflective of decreased recruitment of inflammatory cells.</p><p>7) In Figure 1, there is no protein levels shown of pro inflammatory mediators only mRNA expression, why? In the O<sub>3</sub> experiments (Figure 2), histology of the inflamed lungs is missing.</p><p>8) The co-localization of TLR4 and TLR5 was demonstrated by using overexpression system. The authors should show that TLR4/5 complexes are present in primary human cells.</p><p>9) In the figure legends it should be mentioned how many mice per group were used and how many times the experiment was repeated. E.g., Figure 1, N=5-8 mice per group, experiment repeated twice. Data are represented as mean (plus minus SEM) and were analyzed by unpaired t test with Welch's correction. Does this mean that 15-24 mice were used for Figure 1B and C?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.50458.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The central issue with the paper is whether the 'ultrapure' LPS is free from contamination for instance with flagellin, DNA and PGN.

First, we would like to note that, besides LPS, we have used two other in vivo exposure models, ozone and hyaluronan. The former is a sterile gas, making contamination impossible, and the latter is a pharmaceutical-grade compound, used for inhalation in human patients, and is therefore also pharmaceutical-grade and thus essentially contaminant-free. Nevertheless, we provide further evidence of absence of contamination. We show the response of TLR4 KO, TLR5 KO and TLR4/5 DKO mice, by lung lavage cytokines, to a different ultrapure LPS, from Invivogen (the previously used one was by List). This information is new Figure 1D. This strongly supports that this is not an independent TLR5 activation effect due to contamination. We also show in new Figure 3C that hyaluronan activation of airway constriction is dependent on TLR4 and cannot occur in the presence of TLR5 alone. Thus, our data support that TLR5 contaminants are not involved in the observed effects.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) A second major issue is the ability to demonstrate that there is real TLR4/5 synergy in vitro and in vivo. The BMDM studies in vitro argue against a synergy model, since it is not likely that DAMPs that could be synergizing with LPS are being released in a short time frame.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the opportunity to clarify. We are not arguing that TLR5 is activated by endogenous ligands and synergizing with LPS-activated TLR4. Rather, we are arguing that TLR5 is participating in the LPS-response complex and promotes TLR4 response to its own ligands. We do not believe that endogenous TLR5 ligands are involved (please also see response to point#3). This is supported by the fact that TLR4 deficiency leads to a complete abolition of the response, thus the observed TLR5 effects are predicated on a functional TLR4.</p><p>Editor’s reply regarding point #2:</p><p>“Perhaps the term synergy should be avoided. It would probably suffice if you would clarify better how you think TLR5 interacts. No activation of TLR5? No DAMPS involvement?”</p><p>Thank you for the opportunity to clarify. Indeed, we believe that our in vitro experiments conclusively show that activation of TLR5 by a <underline>PAMP</underline> is not involved, since we use by definition sterile systems and ultrapure reagents (LPS or hyaluronan). The issue of a TLR5 activation by a <underline>DAMP</underline> is not conclusively addressed in this paper, in that it is difficult to prove a negative. It is certainly possible that a DAMP is involved. However, the crux of our paper is that TLR5 participates in the TLR4 signaling complex. Therefore, we believe that the most relevant question here is “does TLR5 get activated by a DAMP that is <underline>not</underline> also activating TLR4?”. The only 2 DAMPs that have been reported to need TLR5 for signaling are hyaluronan (our paper, first time report) and HMGB1 (Das et al., 2016, see also response below). Both hyaluronan and HMGB1 are TLR4 activators. Therefore, even with a DAMP involvement, a receptor complex of TLR4 and TLR5 is invoked, since they both co-immunoprecipitate with MyD88. We have added these arguments in our discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) A third point is the question what triggers TLR5 in the models used if there would be no flagellin moieties around? Endogenous ligands of TLR5 that have been described in the literature should be considered (and be mentioned in the introduction and the discussion. Could hyaluronan have direct or indirect TLR5 activating properties?</p></disp-quote><p>Editor’s suggestion in response to our query regarding point #3:</p><p>“The reviewers are aware of these doubts regarding TLR5. Blocking HMGB1 would be great. Also, a Hyaluronan experiment would help convince the reviewers.”</p><p>Flagellin moieties cannot be entirely excluded in vivo. However, we provide several in vitro experiments, both with human and mouse primary cells as well as cell lines, which support the involvement of TLR5 in TLR4 signaling. We do not see a possibility of flagellin contamination in all these experiments. To further enhance this finding, we have performed in vitro tracheal ring experiments, exposing sterile tracheal rings to pharmaceutical-grade hyaluronan (i.e. contaminant-free), which is a TLR4 signaling activator. We show that TLR4 KO and TLR5 KO tracheal rings are as unresponsive to hyaluronan as MyD88 KO tracheal rings. This supports that TLR4 and TLR5 have non-redundant roles in hyaluronan signaling, and in our opinion argues against endogenous TLR5 ligands promoting activation without need for TLR4 activation. Thus, our results suggest that hyaluronan cannot activate TLR5 independent of TLR4.</p><p>Specifically, with regard to TLR5 ligands, we were only able to find very few papers in the literature referencing endogenous TLR5 ligands. Most of these papers are from the rheumatoid arthritis literature and are not mentioning specific ligands, but rather inferring the presence of endogenous ligands because TLR5 activity was found in synovial fluid that is supposedly sterile (Kim et al., 2014 and Chamberlain et al., 2012). Please note, that the supposed sterility of synovial fluid is no longer certain (for example Zhao et al., 2018). One paper (Das et al., 2016) mentions HMGB1 as a possible TLR5 agonist. However, please note that HMGB1 is also a TLR4 DAMP (Park et al., 2004 and also the Das et al., paper).</p><p>We did perform a HMGB1 inhibition assay in our tracheal ring setup, as suggested by the editor (See <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref>). Briefly, we incubated tracheal rings from C57Bl/6J mice with hyaluronan (which sterilely induces tracheal ring constriction via a TLR4/MYD88 pathway) and found that HMGB1 neutralizing antibody inhibits constriction after hyaluronan exposure. However, since HMGB1 is also a TLR4 activator, as mentioned above, I am not sure whether this result is relevant with regard to endogenous TLR5 activation. In other words, this does not prove that HMGB1 is a specific TLR5 endogenous agonist. It just suggests that it mediates hyaluronan/TLR4/TLR5 signaling. Therefore, this experiment does not disprove that TLR5 participates in the TLR4 receptor complex.</p><fig id="respfig1"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Neutralization of HMGB1 inhibits hyaluronan-induced airway hyperresponsiveness.</title><p>Murine tracheal rings were exposed to short-fragment hyaluronan which is known to elicit hyperresponsiveness of smooth muscle to methacholine.

The conclusion that TLR5 is driving TLR4-MyD88 but not TLR4-TRIF dependent signaling, may be an overstatement. Only data are provided that the TRIF-dependent arm is not affected is the lack of a change in IRF3 localization. This does not preclude an effect on TRIF-NFkB signaling. Some (potentially time-consuming) experiments that would really clarify this point would be to determine if TLR5 can bind to TRIF and examine the phenotype of BMDM from a TLR5/MyD88 double mutant mouse. These experiments are not strictly necessary if the interpretation/conclusions are appropriately tempered.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this helpful direction. We have amended our assertions, please see amended title of our paper, amended Figure 9, and new Discussion section. We have removed references to TRIF.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Along those same lines, the TRIF pathway can affect NFkB as well as IFN signaling, so the authors should rephrase how they deal with this point in subsection “TLR5 promotes TLR4-mediated inflammation and airway hyperresponsiveness in vivo.”, subsection “TLR5 modulates TLR4-dependent signaling”, Discussion section and in their model Figure 9.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this helpful direction. We have amended our assertions, as suggested.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Somewhat related is a caveat about the nanostring interpretation. Because NFkB-dependent genes on the nanostring data are over-represented, the authors conclude that NFkB is being regulated directly. Alternatively, since these data are from whole lung tissue, this could just be reflective of decreased recruitment of inflammatory cells.</p></disp-quote><p>We have amended the results and discussion to temper our conclusions and enter these caveats.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) In Figure 1, there is no protein levels shown of pro inflammatory mediators only mRNA expression, why? In the O<sub>3</sub> experiments (Figure 2), histology of the inflamed lungs is missing.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now added the cytokine data, new Figure 1D. Ozone, at the doses we used, leads to very limited or no histological changes, thus including histology would not add any information.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) The co-localization of TLR4 and TLR5 was demonstrated by using overexpression system. The authors should show that TLR4/5 complexes are present in primary human cells.</p></disp-quote><p>Unfortunately, we have been unable to perform IP of TLR4 or TLR5 with existing antibodies, either human or mouse. This is a well-known problem in the TLR4 literature. We discussed this issue with the Editor, and we agreed on an alternative approach: we used human monocyte-derived macrophages and performed immunoprecipitation for MyD88, and western for TLR4 and TLR5. We demonstrate that in primary human cells (monocyte-derived macrophages), TLR4 AND TLR5 co-immunoprecipitate with Myd88 after LPS exposure. Although this is an indirect proof, we feel that this strongly suggests that TLR4, TLR5 and MYD88 are part of the same complex after LPS exposure.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) In the figure legends it should be mentioned how many mice per group were used and how many times the experiment was repeated. E.g., Figure 1, N=5-8 mice per group, experiment repeated twice. Data are represented as mean (plus minus SEM) and were analyzed by unpaired t test with Welch's correction. Does this mean that 15-24 mice were used for Figure 1B and C?</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for the unclear statements. The analyses were performed for each separate experiment. So, the N depicted was 5-8, as indicated in Figure 1, for example, but in total we used 15-20 mice because we repeated the experiment twice, with similar results.</p></body></sub-article></article>
