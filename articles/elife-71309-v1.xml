However, prior evidence indicates that such memories can be controlled via a mechanism of retrieval suppression. Here, we test the hypothesis that suppression exerts a sustained influence on memories by deteriorating their neural representations. This deterioration, in turn, would hinder their subsequent reactivation and thus impoverish the vividness with which they can be recalled. In an fMRI study, participants repeatedly suppressed memories of aversive scenes. As predicted, this process rendered the memories less vivid. Using a pattern classifier, we observed that suppression diminished the neural reactivation of scene information both globally across the brain and locally in the parahippocampal cortices. Moreover, the decline in vividness was associated with reduced reinstatement of unique memory representations in right parahippocampal cortex. These results support the hypothesis that suppression weakens memories by causing a sustained reduction in the potential to reactivate their neural representations.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>memory</kwd><kwd>suppression</kwd><kwd>forgetting</kwd><kwd>reinstatement</kwd><kwd>neuroimaging</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004189</institution-id><institution>Max Planck Society</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Meyer</surname><given-names>Ann-Kristin</given-names></name><name><surname>Benoit</surname><given-names>Roland G</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Intentionally preventing the retrieval of an unwanted memory hinders future attempts to reactivate the memory’s neural representation and causes a reduction in the vividness with which it can be recalled.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Memories of the past are not always welcome. There are experiences that we would rather not think about, yet that involuntarily intrude into our awareness. Research over the last two decades has demonstrated that we are not at the mercy of such unwanted memories: we can control them by actively suppressing their retrieval (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Anderson and Hulbert, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Fawcett and Hulbert, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Norby et al., 2010</xref>). This process weakens the memory and can eventually cause forgetting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib111">Stramaccia et al., 2021</xref>). Here, we seek to tie the sustained phenomenological weakening of a suppressed memory to its neural basis.</p><p>Neuroimaging research has made strides in determining the transient neural mechanisms that prevent unwanted retrieval. It has consistently shown that retrieval suppression is associated with increased activity in right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) and decreased activity in the hippocampus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Anderson and Hanslmayr, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Benoit et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Benoit et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Benoit and Anderson, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Depue et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Gagnepain et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Gagnepain et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Mary et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Paz-Alonso et al., 2013</xref>). This pattern has been interpreted as a top-down inhibition of critical hippocampal retrieval processes by the dlPFC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Anderson and Hanslmayr, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Benoit and Anderson, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Depue et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>During retrieval, the hippocampus is integral for reinstating the cortical activity patterns that were present during the encoding of the memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Liu et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Neunuebel and Knierim, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Ritchey et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib122">Wing et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib124">Xue et al., 2010</xref>). Inhibition of the hippocampus would accordingly hinder such momentary cortical reactivation and thus prevent unwanted retrieval (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Anderson and Hanslmayr, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Gagnepain et al., 2014</xref>). Consistent with this account, retrieval suppression has been found to also affect activity in cortical regions that encode the particular content of the suppressed memory (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Benoit et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Depue et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Gagnepain et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Gagnepain et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Mary et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>For example, when the unwanted memories comprise images of complex scenes, suppression is accompanied by a transient reduction of activation in the parahippocampal cortex (PhC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Benoit et al., 2015</xref>).This region particularly supports memories for scenes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Bohbot et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Horner et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Staresina et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">Staresina et al., 2013</xref>) and its activity during retrieval scales with the detailedness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Qin et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib112">Tendolkar et al., 2008</xref>) and vividness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Kensinger et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Sheldon and Levine, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib113">Todd et al., 2013</xref>) of the memories. Moreover, more fine-grained analyses of the activity patterns within the PhC have linked the reactivation of memory-specific representations to the successful retrieval of scenes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Martin et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Staresina et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">Staresina et al., 2013</xref>). In turn, there is also some evidence that attempts to suppress an unwanted memory indeed momentarily prevent such memory-specific reactivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Detre et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Gagnepain et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Liu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib121">Wimber et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>We have thus gained an evolved understanding of the mechanisms that are engaged transiently <italic>during</italic> the suppression of unwanted memories. By contrast, there is little evidence for the sustained neural <italic>after-effect</italic> of this process: Why do previously suppressed memories remain difficult to recall? Suppression has been argued to deteriorate the memory’s neural representation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Anderson et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Depue, 2012</xref>). Here, we test the hypothesis that it thus compromises later reactivation, even when one then tries to intentionally recall that memory (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Poppenk and Norman, 2014</xref>). A deficient reactivation of cortical representations would hinder such recall attempts and diminish the vividness of the recollection.</p><p>To test this hypothesis, we conducted an fMRI study using an adapted <italic>Think/No-Think</italic> procedure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Anderson and Green, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Küpper et al., 2014</xref>). First, participants learned associations between neutral objects (cues) and aversive scenes (target memories) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). During the suppression phase, they were then scanned by fMRI while they again encountered the cues. In this phase, participants were repeatedly prompted to recall the associated target for one-third of the cues (<italic>recall condition</italic>), whereas they were requested to prevent the retrieval of the targets for another third of the cues (<italic>suppress condition</italic>). In the suppress condition, we instructed participants to remain focused on the cue while trying to block out all thoughts of the accompanying target memory without engaging in any distracting activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Benoit and Anderson, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Bergström et al., 2009</xref>). Importantly, the remaining third of the cues were not presented during this phase (<italic>baseline condition</italic>). These cues and their associated targets thus serve as a baseline for the passive fading of memories that simply occurs due to passage of time (i.e. without any active suppression attempts).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Experimental procedure, univariate MRI, and behavioral results.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Illustration of the adapted Think/No-Think procedure. Participants studied associations between unique objects and aversive scenes. Both during a pre- and a post-test, they covertly recalled all the scenes in response to the objects and rated the vividness of their recollection. In between these two tests, they performed the Think/No-Think phase. Specifically, for objects presented in a green frame, participants repeatedly recalled the associated scene (<italic>recall condition</italic>). By contrast, for objects presented in a red frame, they suppressed the retrieval of the associated scene (<italic>suppress condition</italic>). Note that we did not present a third of the objects during this phase (<italic>baseline condition</italic>). Afterwards, participants performed a one-back task that served to train a pattern classifier in detecting evidence for scene reactivation. Finally, participants once more recalled the memories outside the MRI scanner (now shown in this figure). The complete experimental procedure is comprehensively described in the methods. (NB) Following the IAPS user agreement, we have replaced the original pictures with similar scenes for this figure. In the original stimulus set, each object cue also features in its paired scene. (<bold>b</bold>) The suppression phase yielded the typical activity pattern associated with retrieval suppression, including greater activation in the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) and reduced activation in the hippocampus (HPC) and parahippocampal cortex (PhC) during <italic>suppress</italic> versus <italic>recall</italic> trials. For display purposes, the images are thresholded at <italic>p &lt;</italic> .001, uncorrected, with a minimum cluster size of 50 voxels. (<bold>c</bold>) Suppression caused a reduction in self-reported vividness from the pre- to post-test that exceeded any change due to the passage of time as indexed by the <italic>baseline</italic> condition. This effect replicated across the fMRI study (<italic>n</italic> = 33) and a behavioral study (<italic>n</italic> = 30) with an independent sample.

During these pre- and post-tests, they reported the vividness of the recalled memories. We thus assessed the phenomenological quality of the memories at the same time that we probed their neural reinstatement. Finally, participants engaged in a separate task that allowed us to train a pattern classifier to detect neural reactivation of complex and aversive scenes.</p><p>We tested our hypothesis by tracking the impact of suppression on neural reactivation, both distributed across the brain and more regionally specific in the PhC (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Detre et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Gagnepain et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib121">Wimber et al., 2015</xref>). Due to the strong association of the PhC with the processing of scenes, we considered it particularly sensitive to sustained disruptions of their neural representations. However, we do not suggest that suppression solely affects this region. In <xref ref-type="table" rid="app1table5">Appendix 1—table 5</xref>, we also report exploratory analyses of suggested candidate control regions, i.e. the amygdala, V1, the precuneus and the angular gyrus.</p><p>Specifically, we tested four key predictions. First, we expected that suppression would be associated with reduced scene reactivation. Second, we predicted that this effect would not be confined to the transient moment of active suppression but also linger on - as indexed by lower post-test reactivation of previously suppressed memories. Third, in addition to a reduced reactivation of general scene information, we also predicted a weaker PhC reinstatement of the neural representations that are unique to the individual memories. Finally, if weaker neural reactivation constitutes the basis for the sustained suppression-induced reductions in vividness, we expected a relationship between these effects.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Preventing retrieval yields the typical pattern associated with memory suppression</title><p>We first sought to establish whether our procedure elicited the activation pattern that has consistently been associated with retrieval suppression (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Anderson et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Benoit and Anderson, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Depue et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Mary et al., 2020</xref>). Suppressing versus recalling an aversive scene indeed led to increased activation in a number of brain regions including the right dlPFC and reduced activation in, amongst others, the bilateral hippocampi and PhC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="app1table3">Appendix 1—table 3</xref>). This pattern is consistent with the engagement of the mechanism thought to mediate retrieval suppression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Benoit and Anderson, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Gagnepain et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>In the following, we test the hypothesis that this mechanism impairs subsequent retrieval attempts by hindering reinstatement of the neural memory representation.

Additionally, there were main effects of time of test (<italic>F</italic>(1, 28) = 21.78, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, η<sup>2</sup> = 0.101) and of condition (<italic>F</italic>(1, 28) = 8.02<italic>, p</italic> = .008, η<sup>2</sup> = 0.02).

Importantly, we assessed the phenomenological quality of the memories during exactly those retrieval attempts that also provide the basis for our critical fMRI analyses. That is, in the following, we examine not only whether there is less reactivation of a memory during suppression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Detre et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Gagnepain et al., 2014</xref>), but also the hypothesis that this effect then lingers on during these subsequent recall attempts.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Univariate suppression-induced changes in brain activity</title><p>Before turning to scene-specific neural representations, we first probe whether suppression also yielded any generic after-effects in univariate brain activation.

To quantify the degree of such reactivation on a given trial, we trained a linear support vector machine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Hebart et al., 2014</xref>) on data from an independent task that participants had performed at the end of the MRI session. Specifically, the classifier learned to distinguish brain states associated with the perception of intact aversive scenes (similar to the ones used in the main task) versus morphed versions of the scenes. The morphed scenes were created via a diffeomorphic transformation that renders them unrecognizable while preserving their basic perceptual properties. Compared to conventional methods, such as scrambling, morphing has been shown to elicit neural activation that is more similar to activation induced by intact images (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">Stojanoski and Cusack, 2014</xref>).</p><p>Given the widespread nature of memory representations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">King et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Rissman and Wagner, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Ritchey et al., 2013</xref>), we sought to test for global reactivation by training a classifier on all voxels of the respective participant’s grey matter mask. Using cross-validation, the classifier reached a mean accuracy of 80.3% (<italic>SD</italic> = 17.4) on the training data, corroborating that it was able to distinguish brain states associated with the presentation of intact versus morphed aversive scenes (<italic>t</italic>(32) = 10, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001). We then used the trained classifier to analyze the activity patterns on each trial of our memory tasks. Specifically, for a given trial, we calculated the dot product of the trial’s activation map and the classifier’s weight pattern (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Chang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib123">Woo et al., 2017</xref>). We take the resulting values to index the degree of scene reactivation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>).

Successful episodic memory retrieval entails the reinstatement of a memory’s representation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Frankland et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Linde-Domingo et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib114">Tonegawa et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib122">Wing et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib124">Xue et al., 2010</xref>). It is fostered by hippocampal processes that complete the neural pattern of the original experience (e.g. of a particular scene) from a partial pattern provided by an adequate retrieval cue (e.g. of an object that was also part of the scene) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Knierim and Neunuebel, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Liu et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Neunuebel and Knierim, 2014</xref>).

Successful retrieval (e.g. of a particular scene) has thus been shown to be accompanied by a reactivation of categorical information (e.g. scene information) that is both widely distributed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Cooper and Ritchey, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">King et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Rissman and Wagner, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib122">Wing et al., 2015</xref>) and localized to specific brain regions (e.g. the PhC; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Martin et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Staresina et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>In the current study, the degree of scene evidence on a given trial scaled with the vividness with which a memory could be retrieved. This extends prior evidence showing that activation, particularly in the PhC, is stronger when scenes are recollected more vividly and in greater detail (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Kensinger et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Qin et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Sheldon and Levine, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib112">Tendolkar et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib113">Todd et al., 2013</xref>). Our data thus further validate the use of classifier evidence as a marker of memory reactivation. We expected that intentional attempts to prevent retrieval should lead to reduced scene reactivation. This was the case in the current study across the grey matter as well as for the left PhC (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Detre et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Gagnepain et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Liu et al., 2016</xref>). The data thus suggest that participants successfully suppressed unwanted retrieval.</p><p>Suppression also had a sustained impact on the avoided memories: It diminished their vividness on a subsequent test. This finding adds to the extant literature by showing that suppression does not only affect the objective availability of a memory in an all-or-none fashion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib111">Stramaccia et al., 2021</xref>). By reducing the vividness of the memories, it also gradually diminishes the subjective quality of the information that can be retrieved. Such graded forgetting can be beneficial, for example when it allows for the continued conscious access to an aversive past event while dampening its affective impact (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Norby et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib118">Visser et al., 2018</xref>, see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Cooper and Ritchey, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Parks and Yonelinas, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Richter et al., 2016a</xref>, for dissociations of retrieval success versus vividness).</p><p>Critically, the sustained fading of a suppressed memory has been argued to result from a deterioration of its neural representation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Anderson and Hanslmayr, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Depue, 2012</xref>). This deterioration, in turn, would lower the potential of these representations to be reinstated on later retrieval attempts. To test this hypothesis, we tracked changes in the reactivation of suppressed representations.</p><p>The classifier analysis yielded evidence for a greater reduction of scene reactivation for suppressed than for baseline memories. This was the case at a global level across the grey matter as well as locally in the PhC. Moreover, consistent with the contribution of the PhC to mnemonic vividness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib113">Todd et al., 2013</xref>), participants who displayed a greater suppression-induced reduction in scene reactivation in the right PhC also experienced a greater reduction in vividness. (Note that we do not suggest that it reflects a lateralized effect, given that the analogous analysis for the left PhC showed a similar, albeit non-significant, pattern.) Indeed, disruptions of cortical memory representations, such as in the PhC, may particularly lead to these graded effects of forgetting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Gagnepain et al., 2014</xref>). That is, as cortical representations get progressively weakened, they may become increasingly susceptible to interference from overlapping representations of similar memories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Andermane et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>By comparison, hippocampal representations are encoded in a more orthogonal fashion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Knierim and Neunuebel, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Kumaran et al., 2016</xref>) and may thus be largely protected from interference. The disruption of these representations would thus not manifest as graded forgetting but eventually lead to holistic forgetting in an all-or-none fashion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Andermane et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Horner et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Richter et al., 2016b</xref>). Indeed, a previous study did not obtain evidence for lingering effects of suppression on hippocampal reinstatement when the memories could still be recalled (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Liu et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>A pattern classifier is a powerful tool for inferring the reactivation of category-specific neural representations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Haynes, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Kuhl et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Norman et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Polyn et al., 2005</xref>). As a downside, it does not provide evidence for the reinstatement of individual exemplars from within a category. Weaker scene evidence during the retrieval of suppressed memories may thus not only reflect reduced reactivation of the respective scene. Instead, it could conceivably also result from greater reactivation of additional, non-specific scene information during the retrieval of baseline memories. However, this interpretation is difficult to reconcile with the observation that, across participants, a greater suppression-induced reduction in scene reactivation was associated with a stronger decline in vividness.</p><p>In a complementary set of analyses, we used RSA to track the reinstatement of individual memory representations. Specifically, given that the retrieval of a memory should reinstate its representation, we expected similar activity patterns to emerge for a given memory on the pre- and on the post-test (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Danker et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Staresina et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib122">Wing et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib125">Xue, 2018</xref>). This was the case for the baseline condition, where the activity patterns were more similar for the comparison of a memory with itself than with the other memories. By contrast, the reinstatement was not significant for suppressed memories. However, we did not obtain the critical evidence that it was weaker than the baseline effect.</p><p>The absence of a significant difference in our study might simply reflect lower power for the more fine-grained, condition-rich analysis of individual activity patterns than for the more generic classifier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Nili et al., 2020</xref>). It may also result from the repetition of the identical objects as retrieval cues during the pre- and post-tests. Although the PhC is more sensitive to scenes than objects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Staresina et al., 2011</xref>), the repeated objects could have contributed to the similarity of the activity patterns. This would have been the case in both the baseline and suppress condition. Such a common effect driven by the object repetitions may have obscured any condition-specific effect driven by differences in scene reinstatement.</p><p>However, the absence of an overall effect might also reflect the varying degrees to which participants were successful at suppression (see also <xref ref-type="table" rid="app1table1">Appendix 1—table 1</xref>). Indeed, right parahippocampal reinstatement was particularly affected in those people who also experienced the strongest decline in vividness. This finding is particularly noteworthy as it corroborates the association that we had obtained with the more general index of scene reactivation. Together, the two sets of analyses thus converge in their support of our hypothesis that suppression leads to a sustained reduction in neural reinstatement.</p><p>Although we did not obtain a similar pattern in any of the additional candidate control regions, we do not suggest that suppression of scenes solely affects memory representations in the PhC. Indeed, the whole-brain classifier yielded evidence for sustained after-effects also when excluding the contribution of this region. These results indicate that further regions are affected by suppression. Nonetheless, the data are consistent with a preferential involvement of the PhC in the processing of scenes – a feature that may make this region particularly sensitive to suppression-induced changes in memory representations.</p><p>Computational modelling suggests that suppression deteriorates memory representations via a targeted inhibition of the respective representation’s strongest, that is, most active, features (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Gagnepain et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Poppenk and Norman, 2014</xref>). These simulations imply that neural representations need to be at least partially reactivated to become liable to disruption (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Elsey et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Lee et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Sinclair and Barense, 2019</xref>).</p><p>Indeed, during initial suppression attempts, unwanted memories often involuntarily start intruding into awareness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Benoit et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Hellerstedt et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Levy and Anderson, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Mary et al., 2020</xref>), indicating that they were partly reactivated. Such intrusions then become less frequent over time with repeated suppression attempts. The decrease in intrusions has been associated with a mechanism of reactive inhibitory control that is mediated by an upregulation of the dlPFC and a negative top-down modulation of hippocampal activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Benoit et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Levy and Anderson, 2012</xref>). This inhibitory signal may be relayed via the thalamic reuniens nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Anderson et al., 2016</xref>) and there is some evidence that it relies on GABAergic activity in the hippocampus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Schmitz et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>This account is reminiscent of the non-monotonic plasticity hypothesis which proposes that memories get weakened if they are moderately activated – irrespective of any intention to forget (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Kim et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Norman et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Poppenk and Norman, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Ritvo et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Sinclair and Barense, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib119">Wang et al., 2019</xref>). On a neurophysiological level, this effect is reflected in long-term depression (i.e. synaptic weakening) following moderate postsynaptic depolarization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bear, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Ritvo et al., 2019</xref>). Suppression may complement such a passive learning process with a top-down process mediated by the dlPFC. By disrupting hippocampal retrieval, the top-down process may keep the reactivation of a memory to a moderate activity level and thus render its representation amenable to synaptic weakening.</p><p>There are a number of limitations to this work. First, as predicted, we do provide evidence for sustained after-effects of suppression on neural reactivation. We suggest that these are caused by a progressive weakening of the memory representations over repeated suppression attempts. This is consistent with prior evidence that unwanted memory intrusions become less frequent over time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Benoit et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Gagnepain et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Levy and Anderson, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Mary et al., 2020</xref>). However, our study was not designed to assess the occurrence of memory intrusions. It therefore does not provide corroborating evidence for a gradual decline.</p><p>Second, we focused on the impact of suppression on the declarative components of aversive memories. Future studies could further determine links between possible reductions in negative affect and in neural reinstatement by assessing subjective emotional experiences. Such a relationship may be particularly pronounced in other brain regions that code for salience or negative affect, such as the amygdala (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Gagnepain et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Finally, we obtained evidence for both, the transient engagement of retrieval suppression and for the subsequent sustained reductions in memory reactivation. However, it remains a future challenge to causally tie the effectiveness of the former neural inhibitory process to the latter after-effect.</p><p>To conclude, the current study set out to examine the neural consequences of suppression that underlie the phenomenon of suppression-induced forgetting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Anderson and Green, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Depue, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib111">Stramaccia et al., 2021</xref>). We demonstrated that suppression rendered memories less vivid and, at the same time, provided evidence that it hindered the reactivation of their neural representations. Notably, a weaker reinstatement of the memories was also associated with a greater reduction in vividness. We thus tie the sustained phenomenological changes induced by suppression to their neural basis.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Participants</title><p>Thirty-seven right-handed volunteers participated in the MRI study.

They comprised 60 object-scene pairs: 48 critical pairs and 12 filler pairs. The scenes were negative images depicting aversive scenes (e.g. accidents, injury, disaster) and were originally selected from the International Affective Picture System (IAPS; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Lang et al., 2008</xref>) and online sources. The objects were photographs of familiar, neutral objects taken from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Brady et al., 2008</xref>. Specifically, each object was chosen to resemble an object that was also part of its paired scene. By this, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Küpper et al., 2014</xref> intended to mimic the situation in which an everyday object can trigger the involuntary retrieval of an aversive experience that had featured a similar object (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Ehlers, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Ehlers and Clark, 2000</xref>). Moreover, the objects were chosen to be peripheral to the respective scene (e.g. a doll in the corner of a room) and to be not essential to its gist. Per se, they were thus not space-defining, a feature that has previously been associated with PhC activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Auger et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Throughout the experiment, all images were presented on a grey background. The 48 critical pairs were divided into three sets that were matched on salience of the objects, as well as the emotional valence and arousing nature of the scenes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Küpper et al., 2014</xref>). Assignment of the sets to the three conditions was counterbalanced across participants.</p><p>The task design for training the pattern classifier was based on <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Poppenk and Norman, 2014</xref>. It included black and white photographs of five different categories: aversive scenes, neutral scenes, morphed scenes, objects, and fruits. The aversive scenes were different items taken from similar databases as the critical items (IAPS; EmoPicS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib120">Wessa et al., 2010</xref>], GAPED [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Dan-Glauser and Scherer, 2011</xref>], NAPS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Marchewka et al., 2014</xref>]). The pictures were chosen to resemble the ones used for the original task in terms of complexity, closeness, and the degree to which they include humans. We moreover ensured that they depict similar aversive themes (e.g. fight, accident, disaster, war, hospital, injury).</p><p>We created morphed pictures of the aversive scenes with the procedure described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">Stojanoski and Cusack, 2014</xref>. The morphed pictures retain the low-level visual features of the original pictures while ensuring that their content can no longer be recognized. We placed the pictures of the objects and fruits on top of phase-scrambled versions of the scenes and thus ensured that the images had the same size and rectangular shape. All images for the classifier training were normalized with respect to their luminance using the procedure described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Detre et al., 2013</xref>.

This procedure entailed four phases: an initial study phase, a pre-test, the suppression phase, and a post-test. These were followed by a classifier training task in the scanner (MRI study only) and an additional memory task (see appendix). The entire session took around four hours. By repeating the same procedure in two independent studies, we could corroborate the replicability of the suppression-induced reduction in vividness.</p><p>During the initial study phase, participants encoded all object-scene associations. First, they saw pairs of objects and scenes that were positioned next to each other. Participants tried to intentionally encode the associations and, in particular, the scenes in as much detail as possible. Each pair was presented for 6 s followed by a 1 s inter-trial-interval (ITI). Following initial encoding, we presented each object as a cue and asked participants to indicate within 5 s, via button press, whether they could fully recall the associated scene. Once they had pressed the button, they had again 5 s to choose the correct scene out of an array of three different scenes (all of which were drawn from the actual stimulus set). The correct object-scene pair was then presented as feedback. This procedure was repeated up to three times until participants had correctly identified at least 60% of the scenes. To facilitate learning, this phase was split into two parts, each with half of the object-scene associations. Finally, participants were again shown all objects and asked once more to indicate whether they could recall the complete scene without feedback.</p><p>Participants then moved to the MRI scanner. Here, they saw all pairs a last time for 1.5 s each with an 800ms ITI. The extensive learning regimen and this refresher immediately prior to the critical parts of the experiment ensured that participants had encoded strong associations and were able to vividly recall the scenes. However, it made it less likely that suppression would induce absolute forgetting rather than gradual fading of the memories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Benoit et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>During the pre-test, we presented all 48 reminders on the screen for 3 s each. Participants were asked to covertly recall the associated scene in as much detail as possible for the duration of the whole trial. They then had 3 s to rate the vividness of their recollection on a scale from 1 (not vivid at all) to 5 (very vivid). We presented no feedback at this stage. The rating was followed by a long ITI of 14 s. With this long ITI, we optimized our ability to detect the activity pattern associated with the recollection of a given scene with little contamination of the subsequent trial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Poppenk and Norman, 2014</xref>). The order of trials was pseudorandomized with at most three objects from the same condition presented in a row.</p><p>The Think/No-Think phase consisted of five blocks. During a block, each object was presented two times for 3 s. A green frame around an object indicated the <italic>recall</italic> task. That is, here participants were asked to recall the associated scene as vividly as possible. By contrast, a red frame around an object indicated the <italic>suppress</italic> task. Here, participants were asked to engage a mechanism that we have previously shown to disrupt hippocampal retrieval (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Benoit et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Benoit and Anderson, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Gagnepain et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Mary et al., 2020</xref>). That is, they tried to avoid the associated scene from coming to mind while focusing on the object on the screen. If the scene were to intrude into their awareness, they had to actively push it out of their mind. Importantly, a third of the objects were not shown during this phase. These items served as baseline memories to assess weakening due to the mere passage of time. The ITIs were optimized with optseq (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/optseq/">https://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/optseq/</ext-link>) and ranged from 2 s to 8.5 s with a mean of 3 s. Participants received extensive training and feedback on this procedure on the filler memories prior to entering the scanner. Immediately following the suppression phase, participants performed the post-test. This phase was identical to the pre-test but with a different pseudorandom presentation order.</p><p>Finally, participants engaged in a classifier training task (modelled on <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Poppenk and Norman, 2014</xref>) to obtain a neural pattern associated with the perception of aversive scenes. We presented pictures of the five categories in separate task blocks. During each block, they saw ten different pictures of the given category for 900ms with a 100ms ITI. Six of these pictures were randomly repeated within each block, thus resulting in 16 trials. Participants had to indicate the occurrence of these repetitions via a button press to ensure that they attended to the stimuli. Performance on the task was high, with participants responding correctly on 97.6% (<italic>SD</italic> = 2.83) of the trials. Each category was presented in six blocks (for 30 blocks in total) in a pseudorandom presentation order with no more than two blocks of the same category in a row and with 10 s inter-block-intervals. After scanning, participants completed an additional memory task (see appendix).</p><p>Participants also completed a number of questionnaires. To assess their compliance with the instructions, they rated if they had <italic>intentionally</italic> recalled the suppress items, either (i) during the presentation of the reminders or (ii) following their offset or (iii) if they had generally made an effort to recall scenes of the suppress condition. For each of these questions, they used a scale from zero (never) to four (very often). The sum of the three scores serves as a measure of task compliance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Hertel and Calcaterra, 2005</xref>). The mean compliance score in the final MRI sample was 0.67 (<italic>SD</italic> = 0.96, range: 0–3). Following standard procedure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib116">van Schie et al., 2013</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Liu et al., 2021</xref>), this sample excluded the one participant with a score of four. In the behavioral study, non-compliance led to the exclusion of two participants.</p><p>Participants further indicated that they had engaged more frequently in direct suppression than in the alternate strategy of thought substitution (scale from zero (never) to four (always), mean difference: 2.12, <italic>t</italic>(32) = 9.8, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001). They also indicated that they successfully suppressed the scenes on about 75% of the suppress trials (scale from zero (0%) to four (100%); <italic>M</italic> = 2.99, <italic>SD</italic> = 0.92) and that they remembered the respective scenes on about 86% of the recall trials (<italic>M</italic> = 3.44, <italic>SD</italic> = 0.88).

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Christian Büchel as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Methodology:</p><p>1. Inclusion/Exclusion criteria: There is no information on inclusion and exclusion criteria for the participants. The authors indicated that participants completed the Beck Depression Inventory, the Thought Control Ability Questionnaire and the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory. Were participants screened for the presence of psychiatric conditions and/or excluded based on BDI and STAI scores? Please, add any demographic information you may have on your participants (in the main text or on a Supplementary Table).</p><p>2. Procedure: Some information on the experimental procedure is not clearly represented in Figure 1A. A more detailed schematic description of the experimental procedure would be helpful including titles such as TNT phase, vividness test, etc.</p><p>3. The distinction between identification, gist and details measures of performance used in the final memory test should be briefly described (reference to Kupper et al., 2014 is not sufficient).</p><p>4. The aversive scenes used in the classifier training task are not sufficiently described. What are the 5 categories? How similar to the main task are the aversive scenes selected here?</p><p>5. TNT Phase: During the TNT phase, participant ratings of suppression success do not seem to have been acquired (e.g., intrusion rate). How did the authors ensure that the participants were actively trying to suppress or recall the aversive scenes during the TNT phase? Moreover, it cannot be determined whether consecutive suppression attempts are associated with a progressive decrease of intrusions over time.</p><p>6. Based on the TNT compliance questionnaire administered at the end of the experiment, please clarify which strategies the participants used (e.g., direct retrieval suppression, thought substitution) and what the exclusion criteria were based on this, along with reports of average compliance, and range.</p><p>7. The memory task involves aversive scenes from the IAPS that typically induce negative affect. Did the participants complete any questionnaire to rate the emotional valence and/or arousal of the aversive scenes before and after the TNT phase? Memory suppression may decrease the negative valence of the scenes.</p><p>Imaging Analysis:</p><p>8. ROI approach: Although there is a clear rationale for focusing on parahippocampal regions with regards to scene reactivation, it is not clear to me why a larger ROI was not used for the RSA analyses, especially since the RSA results were marginal. Perhaps the parahippocampal information is only part of what is being reconstituted for a specific memory, and as such there is not enough power to detect the reduction in strength of that memory. Perhaps effects would be found for visual areas and/or the amygdala. Visual areas seem like a potential candidate because other work has shown that visual areas are involved in memory suppression during early attempts at suppression and other works suggests that memory vividness is linked to processing in visual areas. The amygdala, which is associated with stimulus salience especially of an emotional nature, is another area that might be a good candidate ROI (or to be included in a large multi-region ROI).</p><p>9. Similarly, the linking of detail/vividness of memories to the PhC warrants further justification, particularly when other posterior parietal regions are also heavily implicated (e.g., angular gyrus, precuneus). Maybe I missed this, but I did not see any control regions included in the analysis to demonstrate the specificity of the PhC findings. To make firm conclusions about the right PhC could the authors test for the specificity between these associations (i.e., to show that right PhC is differentially implicated relative to the left). Figure 3 shows there is a lot of noise in the data.</p><p>10. Because this study demonstrates that memory suppression is linked to the classifier fit for scene retrieval it would be quite interesting to look at the degree to which connectivity between prefrontal cortex and parahippocampal regions are linked to memory suppression and vividness, that is, the data may be able to address the degree to which top-down mechanisms are driving the reduction in scene processing.</p><p>11. From Figure 1a, it appears that objects were always presented as the cue for subsequent recall or suppression. However, given that these objects were selected to be related to the aversive scenes, it is possible that the strong parahippocampal effects reported here reflect the scene-defining properties of these items. Work by Auger, Mullally and Maguire on scene defining objects seems particularly relevant in this context and warrants consideration.</p><p>12. Classifier results: Using the classifier, scene evidence is first compared between conditions globally across the grey matter. The results of this analysis are very global and do not highlight the specific regions involved. The decoding method seems to be able to distinguish brain states associated with the presentation of intact versus morphed aversive scenes. However, the classifier does not seem to provide any information on the neural substrate related to the task. For this reason, it does not provide any precise picture of the neural network involved. Why not select more than one region of interest (e.g., based on the TNT univariate analysis) which would have been more informative than looking at the whole grey matter? Is it possible to visualize the weighted maps obtained with the classifier (or the dot product of the weight patterns and t-maps)?</p><p>13. The authors used innovative multivariate pattern analyses such as machine learning and representational similarity analysis. However, the advantages of these methods in comparison to more traditional ones are not sufficiently highlighted. Please highlight the advantages of these methods to evidence the decreased neural reactivation of previously suppressed memories, in comparison to more classical methods (e.g., difference in activation at pre- vs post- tests).</p><p>14. Comparison of the differences in brain activity during the pre- and post- tests should be reported. This analysis should highlight the brain regions that are less activated following suppression.</p><p>15. Please also provide further information regarding the vividness data. Were there any relationships between vividness rate (or pre-post change in vividness) and the final recall? And brain activity during the TNT phase? Do individuals who better engage the memory control network during the TNT phase have less vivid memories for suppressed scenes?</p><p>Interpretation:</p><p>16. Could the authors comment on the role of individual differences in the capacity to suppress unwanted memories. The authors do attempt to explore individual differences in terms of the deterioration of vividness, however, there is quite a lot of variability in the data which suggests that other factors may be at play. For example, many of the figures suggest that the reported effects are not uniform – there seem to be a number of cases that decrease (i.e., show increased vividness) from baseline to suppression or remain flat/stable.</p><p>17. RSA results: In the Discussion (page 11, line 350), the authors state &quot;…the absence of an overall effect might also reflect the varying degrees to which participants were successful at suppression. Indeed, right parahippocampal reinstatement was particularly affected in those people who also experienced the strongest decline in vividness.&quot; To test this hypothesis, it should be interesting to split the sample into groups with higher and lower memory control abilities based on either the Thought Control Ability Questionnaire or the vividness scales at post-test.</p><p>18. It appears that the results in the independent behavioural study did not fully replicate those of the neuroimaging study as the baseline memories show significant decline over time (in the fMRI study, baseline did not change significantly over time although p = .08 so maybe there is a trend there).</p><p>19. For the TNT univariate analysis, the MNI coordinates of the local maxima for the contrast Suppress &lt; Recall are located mainly in posterior regions (cuneus, precuneus). How can the authors explain it? The medial posterior parietal cortex is considered as a memory engram (Brodt et al., 2018, Science). As such, the activity of this region may also be reduced during reactivation of suppressed items. Is the activity of the regions deactivated during the suppressed trials of the TNT related to the reduced global scene reactivation during suppression?</p><p>20. Authors should acknowledge the limitations of their study in the discussion.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>I thoroughly enjoyed reading this manuscript. The experimental work and analyses are rigorously conducted and meticulously reported, and the manuscript itself is exceptionally well-written. I only have a few comments that I would like to see addressed.</p><p>1. Throughout the manuscript, I wondered about the role of individual differences in the capacity to suppress unwanted memories. Perhaps some individuals are naturally better at doing this than others, which in turn might confer resilience in the face of trauma or conversely an impaired capacity to suppress memories might confer risk for PTSD. The authors do attempt to explore individual differences in terms of the deterioration of vividness, however, there is quite a lot of variability in the data which suggests that other factors may be at play. For example, many of the figures suggest that the reported effects are not uniform - there seem to be a number of cases that decrease (i.e., show increased vividness) from baseline to suppression or remain flat/stable. I would have liked to have seen these issues explored in more depth. Do the authors have any ratings of task difficulty or individual differences in imagery capacity that might speak to this issue?</p><p>2. I would have liked to see stronger justification for the a priori focus on the PhC, given that both the PhC and hippocampus demonstrated significant deactivation during suppression trials and the well-established contribution of the hippocampus in scene cognition. Similarly, the linking of detail/vividness of memories to the PhC warrants further justification, particularly when other posterior parietal regions are also heavily implicated (e.g., angular gyrus, precuneus). Maybe I missed this, but I did not see any control regions included in the analysis to demonstrate the specificity of the PhC findings.</p><p>3. While I appreciate that the focus of this study is on the PhC, I wondered about the finding of increased dlPFC activation during memory suppression and how this might relate to individual differences in cognitive control? This likely lies outside the scope of the current study but I would be keen to hear the authors' thoughts.</p><p>4. From Figure 1a, it appears that objects were always presented as the cue for subsequent recall or suppression. However, given that these objects were selected to be related to the aversive scenes, it is possible that the strong parahippocampal effects reported here reflect the scene-defining properties of these items. Work by Auger, Mullally and Maguire on scene defining objects seems particularly relevant in this context and warrants consideration.</p><p>5.

Figure 3 shows there is a lot of noise in the data.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Although the authors have performed a logical and careful set of analyses, there is likely more that could be leveraged with their data set.

The study is carefully conducted. However, I have some comments, which need to be addressed before publication (see public review and below).</p><p>– Participants inclusion: There is no information on inclusion and exclusion criteria for the participants. However, it is important to control for the presence of psychiatric comorbidities. Indeed, there is evidence that individuals with psychological disorders (e.g., depression, PTSD) are less efficient to control their memories and exhibit different neural patterns during the Think/No-Think task in comparison to healthy controls. The authors indicated that participants completed the Beck's Depression Inventory, the Thought Control Ability Questionnaire and the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory. Were participants screened for the presence of psychiatric conditions and/or excluded based on their scores at the Beck and STAI? If not, please comment on it. Can the authors share any other demographic characteristics of their sample? Please, add any demographic information you may have on your participants (in the main text or on a Supplementary Table).</p><p>– Procedure and material (clarification):</p><p>– Some information on the experimental procedure is not clearly represented in Figure 1A.

What are the 5 categories? How similar to the main task are the aversive scenes selected here?</p><p>– Information in Figure 1C and Appendix 2 seems to indicate that there is a group of participants that was tested only behaviorally (“behavioral study”). I did not see any mention of this behavioral study in the methods or there is something unclear that I misunderstood. Please clarify what is the additional value of this behavioral study.</p><p>– Multivariate methods: Authors used innovative multivariate pattern analyses such as machine learning and representational similarity analysis.

However, in this particular study, we were primarily interested in the sustained after-effects of suppression rather than the gradual changes over the course of the Think/No-Think phase.</p><p>Nonetheless, we have a number of good reasons to believe that participants indeed performed the task as instructed. First, the below-baseline reduction in vividness indicates that the participants engaged a mechanism that detrimentally affected the memories. Notably, we observed the opposite pattern of above-baseline enhancement in vividness for the recall condition.</p><p>Second, the activity during the suppression phase showed clear differences for recall versus suppress trials. This pattern closely resembles previous findings in the extant literature, including those derived from studies that had used intrusion ratings as an online measure of task performance (e.g. Benoit et al., 2015; Levy and Anderson, 2012; Mary et al., 2020). In addition, our pattern classifier also yielded reduced scene evidence during the suppression than during the recall trials. This finding further corroborates that participants were successful at performing the task as instructed.</p><p>Finally, we assessed overall compliance via a post-experimental questionnaire. Based on this questionnaire, we excluded the one participant of the MRI study and two participants of the behavioral study, who admitted to not have performed the task as instructed (please also see our response to essential comment #7). Moreover, on the postexperimental questionnaire, participants indicated that they successfully suppressed the scenes on about 75% of the suppress trials (scale from zero (0%) to four (100%); M = 2.99, SD = 0.92) and that they remembered the respective scenes on about 86% (M = 3.44, SD = 0.88) of the recall trials.</p><p>In the revised manuscript, we have included the additional evidence corroborating that participants generally complied with the task instructions and that they were successful at employing retrieval suppression as a means of avoiding the unwanted memories (p. 34, l.792ff). However, when discussing the limitations of our study, we now also note the potential of including intrusion ratings as an online measure of suppression success (p.27, l.614ff).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. Based on the TNT compliance questionnaire administered at the end of the experiment, please clarify which strategies the participants used (e.g., direct retrieval suppression, thought substitution) and what the exclusion criteria were based on this, along with reports of average compliance, and range.</p></disp-quote><p>Our compliance questionnaire was designed to assess whether participants intentionally tried to recall the memories of the suppress condition and thus disregarded the task instructions. Specifically, they answered three questions: On a scale from zero (never) to four (very often), participants rated if they had <italic>intentionally</italic> recalled the suppress items, either (i) during the presentation of the reminders or (ii) following their offset or (iii) if they had generally made an effort to recall scenes of the suppress condition. The sum of the three scores serves as a measure of task compliance. The mean compliance score in the final MRI sample was 0.67 (SD = 0.96, range: 0-3). Following standard procedure (van Schie et al., 2013 see also Liu et al., 2021), this sample excluded the one participant with a score of four. In the behavioral study, non-compliance led to the exclusion of two participants. On the post-experimental questionnaire, participants further indicated that they had engaged more frequently in direct suppression than in the alternate strategy of thought substitution (scale from zero (never) to four (always), mean difference: 2.12, t(32)=9.8 , p &lt;.001).</p><p>We have included more details about the compliance questionnaire in the methods section and also report the adherence to direct suppression rather than thought substitution (p.34, l.792ff).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7. The memory task involves aversive scenes from the IAPS that typically induce negative affect. Did the participants complete any questionnaire to rate the emotional valence and/or arousal of the aversive scenes before and after the TNT phase? Memory suppression may decrease the negative valence of the scenes.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that this is an important research question. In the current study, we did not assess ratings of negative affect and thus can’t speak to a possible change in subjective emotional experience. In the revised manuscript, we discuss this as a limitation of the study (p.27 l. 623ff). However, we also refer to the work by Gagnepain et al., (2017), who did show that suppression can affect ratings of valence.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Imaging Analysis:</p><p>8. ROI approach: Although there is a clear rationale for focusing on parahippocampal regions with regards to scene reactivation, it is not clear to me why a larger ROI was not used for the RSA analyses, especially since the RSA results were marginal. Perhaps the parahippocampal information is only part of what is being reconstituted for a specific memory, and as such there is not enough power to detect the reduction in strength of that memory. Perhaps effects would be found for visual areas and/or the amygdala. Visual areas seem like a potential candidate because other work has shown that visual areas are involved in memory suppression during early attempts at suppression and other works suggests that memory vividness is linked to processing in visual areas. The amygdala, which is associated with stimulus salience especially of an emotional nature, is another area that might be a good candidate ROI (or to be included in a large multi-region ROI).</p></disp-quote><p>We had focused our analysis on the PhC because we had considered this region to be most sensitive to a sustained disruption of neural reinstatement. However, we did not mean to suggest that it is the only region that may show such an effect.</p><p>Following this comment as well as the related essential comment #10, we have explored the activity patterns in bilateral masks of V1, amygdala, precuneus, and angular gyrus. All of these regions, apart from the amygdala, show greater same- than different-item similarity. However, unlike the PhC, none of them exhibited a correlation between reduced reinstatement and reduced vividness. They also showed no evidence for a suppression-induced reduction in reinstatement. For these candidate control regions, we thus have no additional data to corroborate that the RSA effect reflects replicable reinstatement of memory representations rather than the repeated presentation of the same reminder objects. In a further exploratory analysis, we combined all of these regions in a multi-region ROI. Again, we did not see any evidence for either a suppression-induced reduction in reinstatement or a correlation between reduced reinstatement and reduced vividness.</p><p>A similar picture emerged when we explored these additional regions using a pattern classifier. We successfully classified patterns associated with aversive versus morphed scenes in each of these regions. Of note, though, in each case, the classification was numerically worse than the classification based on the data from the right PhC – an observation that further corroborates the preferential involvement of this region in the processing of scenes. However, none of the additional regions showed a significant suppression-induced reduction in scene evidence, and only for the angular gyrus and precuneus did we observe a trend for a correlation with suppression-induced reductions in vividness.</p><p>We have included the additional analyses in supplementary table 5 and summarize them in the result section c In general, the obtained pattern further highlights that the PhC may be particularly sensitive to changes in the representations for memories for scenes. However, in the revised discussion, we also note that representations in other regions may be more sensitive to other qualities of a memory. Specifically, as suggested by the reviewer, the amygdala may be more sensitive to suppression-induced changes in subjective emotional experience ( p.27, l.623ff).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9. Similarly, the linking of detail/vividness of memories to the PhC warrants further justification, particularly when other posterior parietal regions are also heavily implicated (e.g., angular gyrus, precuneus). Maybe I missed this, but I did not see any control regions included in the analysis to demonstrate the specificity of the PhC findings. To make firm conclusions about the right PhC could the authors test for the specificity between these associations (i.e., to show that right PhC is differentially implicated relative to the left). Figure 3 shows there is a lot of noise in the data.</p></disp-quote><p>Indeed, we did not mean to suggest that suppression-induced reductions in vividness are solely attributable to reductions in PhC reactivation. We had focused on this region because of its preferential role in reinstating scenes (Staresina et al., 2011) and its documented association with vividness of these memories (Kensinger et al., 2011; Sheldon and Levine, 2013; Todd et al., 2013) We had thus reasoned that PhC reactivation should be a particularly sensitive marker of vividness and its sustained modulation by suppression.</p><p>Given the proposed contribution of the angular gyrus and the precuneus to the phenomenological experience of a memory (e.g., Richter, Cooper, et al., 2016), we were of course happy to further examine the pattern of reactivation in these regions. In response to essential comment #9, we also examined such possible effects in V1 and the amygdala. However, of these candidate control regions, only the angular gyrus and precuneus showed a trend for an association between suppression-induced changes in scene evidence and in vividness.</p><p>As for the PhC effects, we are reluctant to draw any conclusions about hemispheric differences. Though both the RSA analysis and the pattern classifier yielded significant relationships with the reduction in vividness in right PhC only, at least the classifier data also showed a trend for the left PhC. Finally, we note that our inferences are based on robust skipped spearman correlations that are better suited for noisy data given that they are less susceptible to outliers.</p><p>In the revised manuscript, we have taken several actions to address this comment. First, in the introduction (p.5, l.103ff) and in the methods (p. 37 l.856ff), we more carefully describe that we focus on the PhC because of its presumed sensitivity for changes in scene reactivation and accompanying reductions in vividness. We also indicate that we don’t expect this effect to solely rely on the PhC. Second, we report the results of the additional candidate control regions in supplementary table 5 and summarize them in the result section (p.16, l.358ff, p.19 l.433ff). Finally, we ensured that we don’t assign a particular significance to the apparent lateralization, while being clear that we only obtained significant correlations for the data from the right hemisphere (p. 23 l. 519ff).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10. Because this study demonstrates that memory suppression is linked to the classifier fit for scene retrieval it would be quite interesting to look at the degree to which connectivity between prefrontal cortex and parahippocampal regions are linked to memory suppression and vividness, that is, the data may be able to address the degree to which top-down mechanisms are driving the reduction in scene processing.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that this is an interesting question. We took this comment to run an exploratory PPI analysis (e.g., Paz-Alonso et al., 2013). It was seeded at the peak activation in the right dlPFC and set up to reveal increases in connectivity during suppression versus recall trials. We could thus explore the associations between the coupling parameters in the PhC and markers of suppression success. However, we did not find evidence for a correlation with either the reduction in vividness, scene evidence, or reinstatement. Given the inconclusiveness of these exploratory analyses, we opt to not report them in the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>11. From Figure 1a, it appears that objects were always presented as the cue for subsequent recall or suppression. However, given that these objects were selected to be related to the aversive scenes, it is possible that the strong parahippocampal effects reported here reflect the scene-defining properties of these items. Work by Auger, Mullally and Maguire on scene defining objects seems particularly relevant in this context and warrants consideration.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for pointing us towards the paper by Auger et al., 2012, which we have read with great interest. The authors observe greater univariate activity in the PhC when participants view objects that they had deemed as particular space defining (e.g., a lighthouse is more space defining than a car). They thus conclude that this region may have a particular role in the construction of spatial representations. However, it seems plausible that this effect may also reflect the retrieval of particular scenes that is triggered by the presentation of the objects.</p><p>We also note that the objects in our procedure were chosen precisely because they were merely peripheral to the scene (see also response to essential comment #5). That is, they were explicitly chosen because they were <italic>not</italic> space defining for our particular scenes. Moreover, we counterbalanced the assignment of the object-scene pairs to the three conditions (baseline, suppress, recall). Incidental differences in space-defining properties of the objects could thus not account for the observed pattern.</p><p>With reference to Auger et al., we now more strongly stress the nature of the chosen objects and their relationship to the paired scenes (p.30, l.677ff).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>12. Classifier results: Using the classifier, scene evidence is first compared between conditions globally across the grey matter. The results of this analysis are very global and do not highlight the specific regions involved. The decoding method seems to be able to distinguish brain states associated with the presentation of intact versus morphed aversive scenes. However, the classifier does not seem to provide any information on the neural substrate related to the task. For this reason, it does not provide any precise picture of the neural network involved. Why not select more than one region of interest (e.g., based on the TNT univariate analysis) which would have been more informative than looking at the whole grey matter? Is it possible to visualize the weighted maps obtained with the classifier (or the dot product of the weight patterns and t-maps)?</p></disp-quote><p>To answer our research question, we took two complementary approaches. On the one hand, we took a global view and examined reactivation across the whole greymatter. On the other hand, we zoomed in on the PhC as a region that should be particularly sensitive to sustained disruptions in memory reactivation. This region also showed reduced activity during the suppression phase. Indeed, we have now conducted additional exploratory analyses of further ROIs, also in response to comments #9 and #10. These further suggest a particular role for the PhC. However, our analyses also indicate that the effects across the greymatter are not solely driven by the PhC, indicating that it is unlikely to be the only region contributing to this effect.</p><p>In addition to reporting further exploratory analyses of other candidate control regions, we have taken the comment to upload the average weight pattern to neurovault (https://neurovault.org/collections/KAZGAACE/). This map shows which regions particularly contributed to the classifier, and thus collectively also to the changes in scene evidence.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>13. The authors used innovative multivariate pattern analyses such as machine learning and representational similarity analysis. However, the advantages of these methods in comparison to more traditional ones are not sufficiently highlighted. Please highlight the advantages of these methods to evidence the decreased neural reactivation of previously suppressed memories, in comparison to more classical methods (e.g., difference in activation at pre- vs post- tests).</p></disp-quote><p>In general, MVPA methods often have a greater sensitivity to experimental manipulations than univariate methods (Norman et al., 2006). That is, the former can also exploit subtle differences in activity patterns across voxels, whereas the latter are confined to uniform BOLD signal differences between conditions. Indeed, only a few clusters across the brain exhibited a suppression-induced reduction in univariate brain activity (see response to essential comment #15). Critically, the multivariate approaches moreover allow us to identify changes in activity patterns that are more <italic>specific</italic> to the processing of scene information. RSA has the further benefit that it allows for investigating the reinstatement of individual memory representations.</p><p>In the revised manuscript, we report the univariate results and take them as an opportunity to highlight the benefits of the employed MVPA techniques (p.9, l.206ff).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>14. Comparison of the differences in brain activity during the pre- and post- tests should be reported. This analysis should highlight the brain regions that are less activated following suppression.</p></disp-quote><p>In the revised manuscript, we follow the suggestion to include a new analysis of the univariate pre- to post change induced by suppression, i.e., the contrast (post: baseline&gt;suppress) &gt; (pre: baseline &gt; suppress). This analysis yielded a few clusters, which we report in the Results section (p.9, l.199ff) and supplementary table 4.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>15. Please also provide further information regarding the vividness data. Were there any relationships between vividness rate (or pre-post change in vividness) and the final recall? And brain activity during the TNT phase? Do individuals who better engage the memory control network during the TNT phase have less vivid memories for suppressed scenes?</p></disp-quote><p>We explored the association between vividness change and suppression-induced forgetting (SIF) on the final recall test. We did not find a correlation of vividness reduction with SIF on either the details or the identification measure. However, we did observe a significant correlation with the gist measure in the MRI study (r = 0.56, CI = [0.29 0.78]). There was also a trend for this effect when pooling the data across the two studies (r = 0.31 , CI = [-0.02 0.51]).</p><p>The objective and subjective forgetting measures were thus only partially associated with each other, consistent with several reported dissociations in the extant literature (e.g., Clark and Maguire, 2020; Levine et al., 2009). We have included the relationship between the reductions in vividness and in performance on the final recall task in the supplement (p.12, ll.195ff)</p><p>In response to the latter part of this comment, we also examined the association between suppression-related activation of the right dlPFC (as the central region of the memory control network) and the ensuing suppression-induced reduction in vividness. However, the correlation between these measures was not significant (r = -0.25, CI = [-0.55 0.2]). See also comment #11 for the association between dlPFC-PhC connectivity and vividness change.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Interpretation:</p><p>16. Could the authors comment on the role of individual differences in the capacity to suppress unwanted memories. The authors do attempt to explore individual differences in terms of the deterioration of vividness, however, there is quite a lot of variability in the data which suggests that other factors may be at play. For example, many of the figures suggest that the reported effects are not uniform – there seem to be a number of cases that decrease (i.e., show increased vividness) from baseline to suppression or remain flat/stable.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that understanding individual differences is a critical goal for research on memory suppression. This is particularly the case given the clinical relevance due to its association with PTSD, anxiety, and depression (Catarino et al., 2015; Mary et al., 2020; Stramaccia et al., 2020). In our study, participants completed the <italic>Thought Control Ability Questionnaire</italic> (TCAQ), the <italic>Beck Depression Inventory</italic>, and the <italic>State-Trait Anxiety Inventory</italic>. These inventories help us define the demographics of our sample. They also allow us to examine relationships with the suppression-induced reduction in vividness. However, only the TCAQ showed a trend for a correlation in the MRI study (r = 0.32 , CI = [-0.08 0.58]) and a significant correlation across the two studies (r = 0.27, CI = [0.004 0.0.49]) (see Küpper et al., 2014). There was thus just some evidence for an association between individual differences in self-reported control ability and in the impact of suppression.</p><p>We report these exploratory correlations in the revised supplement (supplementary table 1).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>17. RSA results: In the Discussion (page 11, line 350), the authors state &quot;…the absence of an overall effect might also reflect the varying degrees to which participants were successful at suppression. Indeed, right parahippocampal reinstatement was particularly affected in those people who also experienced the strongest decline in vividness.&quot; To test this hypothesis, it should be interesting to split the sample into groups with higher and lower memory control abilities based on either the Thought Control Ability Questionnaire or the vividness scales at post-test.</p></disp-quote><p>Yes, we agree that this is an important point – though we suggest that it is better addressed with a correlation rather than a median split. Indeed, consistent with the hypothesis, we had observed a positive correlation between suppression-induced reductions in vividness and suppression-induced reductions in both general scene evidence and memory-specific reinstatement. However, we have now also looked into the relationship between the TCAQ and the two neural measures. The correlations were not significant.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>18. It appears that the results in the independent behavioural study did not fully replicate those of the neuroimaging study as the baseline memories show significant decline over time (in the fMRI study, baseline did not change significantly over time although p = .08 so maybe there is a trend there).</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that the two studies differ with respect to the rate of passive forgetting simply occurring with the passage of time. That is, we observed such passive forgetting for the baseline memories in the MRI study only. However, we note that we measure these baseline effects precisely to assess whether suppression yields forgetting that exceeds the respective rate of passive effects occurring in a given study.</p><p>We have clarified that the studies yield the same pattern with regards to suppression-induced changes, though they somewhat differ with respect to the changes in baseline vividness (p.8, l.187ff).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>19. For the TNT univariate analysis, the MNI coordinates of the local maxima for the contrast Suppress &lt; Recall are located mainly in posterior regions (cuneus, precuneus). How can the authors explain it? The medial posterior parietal cortex is considered as a memory engram (Brodt et al., 2018, Science). As such, the activity of this region may also be reduced during reactivation of suppressed items. Is the activity of the regions deactivated during the suppressed trials of the TNT related to the reduced global scene reactivation during suppression?</p></disp-quote><p>Indeed, consistent with prior studies and as shown in supplementary table 2, there are quite a number of regions that exhibit reduced activation during suppression. These regions differ with respect to the <italic>t</italic>-values at their respective peaks. We do note though that it is difficult to compare <italic>t</italic>-values across different brain regions. For example, a greater effect in posterior cortical regions may reflect regional differences in SNR rather than stronger task-related activation. However, as discussed in essential comments #9 and #10, we have now also examined memory reactivation in the precuneus as an additional candidate control region.</p><p>Moreover, following the latter part of this comment, we have examined the relationship between suppression-related deactivations during the suppression phase and suppression-induced reductions in reactivation. We performed these analyses separately across the greymatter mask, the precuneus, and the PhC. However, none of the analyses yielded significant correlations.</p><p>As discussed above, we have included the results from the precuneus in the revised manuscript. We also report that there was no clear evidence of a direct relationship between deactivation during suppression and the sustained reductions in reactivation in the PhC (p.16, l. 352ff).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>20. Authors should acknowledge the limitations of their study in the discussion.</p></disp-quote><p>In the revised manuscript, we have made sure to more explicitly describe the limitations of this study in a new section of the discussion (p.27, l.614). In particular, this section refers to the possible benefits of including intrusion ratings in future studies, the question about the attenuation of emotions, and the causal relationship between the neural suppression mechanism and the sustained reduction in neural reactivation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>– Procedure and material (clarification):</p><p>– Information in Figure 1C and Appendix 2 seems to indicate that there is a group of participants that was tested only behaviorally (&quot;behavioral study&quot;).
