Although numerous studies have indicated posterior cingulate areas are involved in spatial tasks, it is unclear how their neurons represent self-motion signals. Providing translation and rotation stimuli to macaques on a 6-degree-of-freedom motion platform, we discovered robust vestibular responses in PCC. A combined three-dimensional spatiotemporal model captured data well and revealed multiple temporal components including velocity, acceleration, jerk, and position. Compared to PCC, RSC contained moderate vestibular temporal modulations and lacked significant spatial tuning. Visual self-motion signals were much weaker in both regions compared to the vestibular signals. We conclude that macaque posterior cingulate region carries vestibular-dominant self-motion signals with plentiful temporal components that could be useful for path integration.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>self-motion</kwd><kwd>vestibular</kwd><kwd>optic flow</kwd><kwd>cingulate cortex</kwd><kwd>multisensory</kwd><kwd>heading</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Rhesus macaque</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>31761133014</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gu</surname><given-names>Yong</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100006296</institution-id><institution>CAS</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>XDB32070000</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gu</surname><given-names>Yong</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003399</institution-id><institution>Shanghai Municipal Science and Technology Commission</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2018SHZDZX05</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gu</surname><given-names>Yong</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Macaque posterior cingulate region carries vestibular dominant self-motion signals with plentiful temporal components that could be useful for process of path integration.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Navigation is a fundamental and indispensable ability for creatures to survive and live in the world, such as in foraging and exploration. In cognitive studies, landmark-based and vector-based navigation are two commonly used strategies for spatial tasks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Gallistel, 1990</xref>). Landmarks are typically strong visual cues for helping localize and calibrate self-positions, yet this strategy is easily affected by environments such as open fields of deserts and grasslands, or woods without clear and reliable markers. Vector-based navigation, or path integration on the other hand, involves momentary self-motion cues from multiple sensory channels such as optic flow and vestibular ones for updating and accumulating one’s heading direction and location (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Etienne and Jeffery, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Valerio and Taube, 2012</xref>). For example, linear and angular vestibular signals originating from peripheral otolith and semicircular canal organs are thought to provide critical inputs to head direction cells (HD cells), place cells or grid cells in the hippocampal-entorhinal navigation system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Knierim et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Stackman et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Clark and Taube, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Hitier et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Jacob et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Winter et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>To date, robust vestibular and visual signals related with self-motion have been discovered in numerous cortical areas including the dorsal part of medial superior temporal sulcus (MSTd) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Duffy and Wurtz, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Page and Duffy, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Gu et al., 2006</xref>), the ventral intraparietal area (VIP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bremmer et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bremmer et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Zhang and Britten, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chen et al., 2011a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chen et al., 2011b</xref>), the visual posterior sylvian area (VPS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Chen et al., 2011c</xref>), parietal insular vestibular cortex (PIVC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Grüsser et al., 1990a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Grüsser et al., 1990b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chen et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chen et al., 2011b</xref>), the smooth eye movement of the frontal eye field (FEFsem) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Gu et al., 2016</xref>), and 7a (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Avila et al., 2019</xref>), composing a network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Guldin and Grüsser, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Britten, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Cheng and Gu, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Gu, 2018</xref>). However, most of these areas (except for 7a) have not shown direct connections with the hippocampal navigation system. What regions may bridge the cortical self-motion system and the limbic hippocampal navigation system? One hypothesis is that PCC and RSC may be one of these hubs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Rushworth et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Vincent et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Kravitz et al., 2011</xref>). On one hand, there is evidence that PCC and RSC directly project to entorhinal and parahippocampal cortices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Rosene and Van Hoesen, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Vogt et al., 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Insausti et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Vogt et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Morecraft et al., 1989</xref>). On the other hand, these areas are also heavily connected with cortical areas including area 7a (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Pandya et al., 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Vogt et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Musil and Olson, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cavada and Goldman-Rakic, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Olson and Musil, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Shinder and Taube, 2010</xref>), MSTd (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Akbarian et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">De Castro et al., 2020</xref>), FEF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">De Castro et al., 2020</xref>), PIVC, VPS and 3a (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Guldin and Grüsser, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">De Castro et al., 2020</xref>). Thus, posterior cingulate region may be one important hub mediating the propagation of self-motion signals from parietal-temporal cortices to the hippocampal-entorhinal system.</p><p>Supporting this notion, numerous studies have provided evidence showing that posterior cingulate region is involved in spatial navigation. For example, navigation related neurons in PCC are reported when monkeys navigate in a virtual environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Sato et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Sato et al., 2010</xref>). Lesion studies confirmed that PCC in monkeys (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Sutherland et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Murray et al., 1989</xref>) and the homologues area in rodents were actively involved in spatial memory tasks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Sutherland et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Cooper et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Cooper and Mizumori, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Whishaw et al., 2001</xref>). Using functional MRI with galvanic or caloric stimulation, vestibular signals were discovered in human PCC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Smith et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Schindler and Bartels, 2018</xref>), and visual signals were reported in human and macaque PCC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Wall and Smith, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Fischer et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Cottereau et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Smith et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Schindler and Bartels, 2018</xref>). Similarly, RSC has also been implicated to be involved in navigation context for a long time, mainly from studies in rodents and human. For example, HD cells have been reported in rat RSC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Cullen and Taube, 2017</xref>), and inactivation of RSC disrupts HD cell and place cell activities in hippocampal circuit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Cooper and Mizumori, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Clark et al., 2010</xref>). In human, RSC is active in virtual navigational tasks (see reviews by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Maguire, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Spiers and Maguire, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Vann et al., 2009</xref>). In addition, RSC is directly involved in spatial coordinate transformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Iaria et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Epstein, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Hashimoto and Nakano, 2014</xref>), which may be crucial for transforming egocentric self-motion signals to allocentric navigational signals in the hippocampal system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Byrne et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Wang et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Although signals related with spatial perception have been previously indicated in posterior cingulate region, previous studies often include too complex cognitive factors or do not apply techniques with enough spatiotemporal resolution for pinning down properties of neuronal signals in these areas. Hence in our current study, we systematically examined self-motion related signals in macaque PCC and RSC on a virtual reality system with a 6-degree-of-freedom motion platform. We recorded single unit activities in both subregions in the posterior region of the cingulate cortex under linear translation and angular rotation conditions. We also compared their temporal and spatial neuronal activity properties with those in the extrastriate visual cortex to infer how self-motion signals may be reserved or varied when they are propagated from parietal-temporal areas to the hippocampal system via the hub of PCC and RSC.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>Self-motion cues including vestibular or optic flow were provided in either the vestibular-only or visual-only condition respectively through a laboratory-built up virtual reality system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). The two stimuli conditions were interleaved across trials in each experimental session. In the vestibular-only condition, to activate the vestibular channel, each trial contains a Gaussian velocity profile with a corresponding biphasic acceleration profile, lasting 1.5 s (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> shows the motion profile in translation and rotation condition, respectively). Animals were translated or rotated through the motion platform along 26 directions or axes that were equally distributed in three-dimentional space (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, see Materials and methods). No optic flow was provided in this condition. In the visual-only condition, the motion platform was stationary, whereas self-motion stimuli were simulated by optic flow, with its motion profile simply following that in the vestibular condition to simulate what is experienced on retina during physical motion in the environment. In the following, we first analyzed and presented data under the vestibular condition, then we compared these data to that in the visual condition in the last section of the Results.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Diagram of experimental set-up.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Monkeys were translated or rotated by a 6-degree-of-freedom motion platform (MOOG).

According to this criterion, in PCC, 68% (252/372) cells were significantly modulated by inertial motion under translation condition, whereas 59% (161/271) cells were significantly modulated under the rotation condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, pie graph and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). About half of the neurons (50%, 131/263) were significantly modulated by both translation and rotation stimuli, indicating that quite a large proportion of PCC neurons received inputs from otolith and semicircular canals at the same time. Compared to PCC, fewer RSC neurons were significantly modulated under translation (32%, 37/114) and rotation (29%, 25/87) conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, pie graph). Only 17% (14/83) RSC neurons responded to both translation and rotation stimuli.

We found in PCC, a large proportion of neurons showed significant direction tuning (p&lt;0.01, one-way ANOVA) under translational condition (75%, 189/252) and under rotation condition (77%, 124/161, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, bar graph). Around 71% (93/131) neurons were spatially tuned under both translation and rotation conditions. However, in RSC, only 14% (5/37) and 36% (9/25) neurons were spatially tuned to translation and rotation stimuli, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, bar graph). And only 21% (3/14) neurons had significant spatial tuning in both translation and rotation conditions.</p><p>After identifying neurons with significantly spatial-tuned responses, we further used a direction discrimination index (DDI, see Materials and methods) to assess the strength of their modulations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). DDI ranges between 0 and 1, with values close to one indicating strong spatial preference. The average DDI of all PCC neurons was 0.57 ± 0.007 (mean ± S.E.M.) under the translation condition, and 0.58 ± 0.009 under the rotation condition. For RSC neurons, the average DDI was 0.49 ± 0.013 and 0.50 ± 0.017 under the translation and rotation condition, respectively, which was significantly weaker compared to that in PCC (p=0.00017 and p=0.0011 for translation and rotation, respectively, t-test). Thus, neurons in RSC carry much weaker vestibular spatial tuning than that in PCC.</p><p>For neurons with significant spatial tuning, we also investigated their preferred directions in 3D space (See Materials and methods). Briefly, spatial preference of each unit was calculated from vector sum of responses in all directions, with azimuth and elevation as spherical coordinates. Under translation condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>, dark blue circles), the preferred directions of PCC neurons were distributed almost everywhere in the 3D space, yet there was a tendency that more neurons preferred leftward and rightward motion in the horizontal plane (p=0.01, Uniform test, see Materials and methods). Such a pattern suggests that PCC neurons may be suitable for fine heading discrimination around straight forward during spatial navigation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Gu et al., 2010</xref>). Interestingly under rotation condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>, light blue triangles), the preferred rotary axis also concentrated around the horizontal plane (p=0.0225, Uniform test), corresponding to pitch (i.e. nose-down or nose-up tilt). The functional implications of such a preference were further discussed in the section of Discussion. Finally, for RSC, because there were not enough faction of neurons exhibiting significant spatial tuning, it was not possible to obtain true distribution of their direction preference in the 3D space.</p><p>Finally, we examined data and did not find any significant difference among individual animals and hemispheres (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Dark and sound control</title><p>To further confirm that the observed vestibular responses in the posterior cingulate region indeed originated from otolith and canals instead of from other cues, we conducted two control experiments.</p><p>The first control experiment was to exclude the possibility that the vestibular responses arose from retinal slip due to incomplete vestibular ocular reflex (VOR) suppression under condition when there was residual light in the experimental room.

To do this, we recorded the sounds when the motion platform moved in the vestibular condition, and delivered them from one loudspeaker to the animals when motion platform was stationary in the sound control experiment. As shown by the example neuron in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>, PSTHs in sound condition were dramatically changed, generating a null-modulation pattern that was totally unlike that in the fixation condition (r = −0.07, p=0.0002, Pearson’s correlation).</p><p>We tested 11 neurons in total. None of these neurons exhibited significant temporal tuning in the sound control experiment (p&gt;0.01, one-way ANOVA, and see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref> for details), and all neurons showed quite weak correlation with the PSTHs in the vestibular condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>).

These vestibular-tuned cells typically carried complex temporal dynamics that contained both velocity and acceleration components. To further characterize the temporal and spatial tuning properties for different signal components, we fitted responses (PSTHs) of each neuron with a 3D spatiotemporal dynamic model. Note that we only considered neurons with significant temporal tuning, thus for PCC, 252 neurons under translational motion and 161 neurons under rotational motion were included. For RSC, only 37 neurons for translation and 25 neurons for rotation were included in this analysis.</p><p>The spatiotemporal model was a linear weighted sum of temporal functions with different signal components, with each component multiplied by a spatial function (see Materials and methods and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref> for details). We first considered a simpler model by including two most salient components of the velocity and acceleration (‘VA’ model) that were frequently observed in many neurons. A more complex model including more terms would be further illustrated in the next section. Specifically, in the VA model, the velocity temporal kernel was defined by a Gaussian function and the acceleration temporal kernel was the derivative of the velocity function. For the spatial term, it was modeled as a cosine function fed through a linear function that was depended on parameters of preferred azimuth and preferred elevation (see Materials and methods).</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> showed PSTHs from two example neurons fitted with VA model.

This neuron was fitted well by the VA model (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.88), as evident by the large overlap between the fitted curve and the responses. Moreover, the fitted weight of the velocity term was much larger than that of the acceleration (w<sub>V</sub> = 0.75 versus w<sub>A</sub> = 0.25), indicating a velocity domination signal. As a comparison, the second example neuron (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>) which was the same acceleration-dominant unit as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, was also fitted well by the VA model (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.65), yet the weight of acceleration component was much larger than that of the velocity (w<sub>V</sub> = 0.24 versus w<sub>A</sub> = 0.76), indicating a greater contribution of the acceleration signal.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Fitting results of two example neurons with VA model.</title><p>(<bold>A–B</bold>) Upper panels: PSTHs of two example cells fitted by VA model.

Overall, PCC responses were well fitted by VA model in both conditions, with median R<sup>2</sup> value of 0.49 for translation and 0.42 for rotation. The overall response delay (τ) was around 0 ms. However, fitting in RSC was worse (p&lt;&lt;0.001 in both translation and rotation, t-test), with only four neurons and one showing R<sup>2</sup> value greater than 0.5 under translational and rotation condition, respectively. This result was roughly matched with a lack of clear velocity or acceleration signals inspected by eyeballing from the PSTHs of RSC neurons.

To guarantee reliable results, we only selected those neurons with model’s goodness of fit (R<sup>2</sup>) larger than 0.5. In this area, the log V/A ratio distribution tended to be smaller than 0 under the translational condition (median = −0.21, p&lt;&lt;0.001, Wilcoxon rank sum test), while the distribution tended to be larger than 0 under the rotation condition (median = 0.47, p&lt;&lt;0.001, Wilcoxon rank sum test). Thus, PCC neurons in general carry more acceleration signals in translation condition and more velocity signals in rotation condition.</p><p>We further analyzed spatial tuning for each temporal component. In particular, preferred direction for each component was defined based on the spatial kernel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>). For example, both units as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> exhibited similar preferred directions between the velocity and acceleration components (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A&amp;B</xref>, lower panels). However, this was not the case across population, similar to that found previously in other brain regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Laurens et al., 2017</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Jerk and position signals</title><p>In addition to velocity and acceleration components, we also noticed some other temporal signals that were missed in the VA model. In one of these, the jerk signal is the derivative of acceleration and defines smoothness of the accelerated motion of the head or whole body in the environment. Previous psychophysical and neurophysiological studies have indicated that such a signal was present in the vestibular afferents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Fernández and Goldberg, 1976</xref>) and used by subjects to help detect strength of self-motion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Benson et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Grant and Haycock, 2008</xref>). The other is the position signal, resulted from the integral of the velocity signal and defines the travelled distance, or rotated head direction, which is critical for path integration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Etienne and Jeffery, 2004</xref>). Thus, we further fitted neural responses with a more complicated 3D spatiotemporal model including two additional terms of jerk and position based on the previous VA model. The new full model contained four signal components in total (i.e. position, velocity, acceleration, jerk, so-called ‘PVAJ’ model), with each component having its own temporal and spatial kernel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>). For example, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref> showed PSTHs from two example neurons fitted by the full PVAJ model. The fitted weight of the first unit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A</xref>, upper panels) was w<sub>V</sub> = 0.24, w<sub>A</sub> = 0.22, w<sub>J</sub> = 0.42 and w<sub>P</sub> = 0.13, among which the weight of jerk was largest. The second unit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B</xref>, upper panels) instead presented a larger weight of position signal: w<sub>V</sub> = 0.08, w<sub>A</sub> = 0.32, w<sub>J</sub> = 0.17 and w<sub>P</sub> = 0.43.</p><fig id="fig9" position="float"><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><title>Fitting results of two example neurons with PVAJ model.</title><p>(<bold>A–B</bold>) Upper panels: PSTHs of two example cells fitted by VA model.

Similar to the VA model, the overall response delay (τ) in the full model was also around 0 ms. However, fitting RSC data with the PVAJ model was much worse compared to fitting in PCC (p&lt;&lt;0.001, t-test, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10A</xref>), suggesting that vestibular signals in RSC neurons may not simply follow dynamics defined by the classic temporal components, or may not be as reliable as that in PCC.

In the first way, we calculated partial correlation coefficient between neuronal responses (PSTHs) and the fitted data of each temporal component. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10B</xref>, majority of neurons exhibited significant and positive partial correlations for all temporal components (p&lt;0.05, Partial correlation). The average partial coefficients were varied, but comparable across different temporal components, suggesting that the full model captured more variance in the data. In the second way, we addressed the issue from the perspective that any models containing more free parameters would theoretically lead to better fit compared to models with fewer parameters. So we applied Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) analysis to calibrate this parameter-size effect. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10C</xref>, after removing the effect of the number of free parameters, BIC value of PVAJ model was still significantly smaller than that of VA model, confirming that including the jerk and position terms did capture more signals embedded in PCC neurons (p&lt;&lt;0.001, Paired t-test).</p><p>After confirming significant contributions from all four temporal components, we further investigated the relative contribution of each signal captured by the full model. Specifically, proportion of neurons was plotted as a function of each weight value only for those neurons with better goodness of fit (R<sup>2</sup> &gt;0.5, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10D</xref>). This criterion removed a small proportion of units with unreliable model fits and still reserved a large dataset (translation: n = 217; rotation: n = 130) for the analysis. In particular, the velocity was still more dominant in the rotation condition compared to the other signals which was consistent with that in the VA model (red curves in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10D</xref>). Acceleration and jerk signals weighed more in the translation condition compared to those in the rotation condition (blue and orange curves respectively in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10D</xref>). The position signal was less dominant compared to the others, particularly in the translation condition (green curves in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10D</xref>). Similar to that in the VA model, all temporal components did not show consistent relationships among each other, suggesting that different type of signals may be inherited from different sources.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Comparison with extrastriate visual cortex</title><p>Previous studies have discovered robust vestibular self-motion signals in other cortical areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Cheng and Gu, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Gu, 2018</xref>).

To quantitatively compare temporal dynamics in MSTd with that in the posterior cingulate region, here we used the same spatiotemporal model, including both VA and PVAJ models to fit MSTd responses.</p><p>Neural data was fitted quite well by the two spatiotemporal models in MSTd (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11A</xref>). Consistent with previous findings, Velocity signals tended to be more prevalent in MSTd (VA model: p&lt;&lt;0.001; PVAJ model: p&lt;&lt;0.001, Wilcoxon rank sum test, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11C</xref>), a pattern of which was different from that in PCC. Position and jerk signals were also revealed by the PVAJ model in MSTd. To quantify contributions of these two components, we computed the difference in BIC between the two models (BIC difference index, BDI, see Materials and methods) for both areas. BDI is expected to be larger if including additional terms produces better fit. The median value of the BDI distribution was 0.22 in the posterior cingulate region (only PCC was considered here), and was 0.12 in MSTd (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11B</xref>, left column). Compared between the two areas, BDI analysis revealed that the full model successfully captured more types of signals in PCC than in MSTd (p&lt;&lt;0.001, t-test, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11B</xref>, right column).

Only about one tenth neurons exhibited significant temporal modulations (Translation: 11%, 13/114; Rotation: 14%, 12/87), among which almost no units presented significant (p&lt;0.01, one-way ANOVA) spatial modulations (Translation: n = 0; Rotation: n = 1). Thus, across all the cells recorded with an unbiased sampling (see Materials and methods), the proportion of neurons showing significant spatiotemporal modulations in response to visual heading stimuli was fairly small (~10% in PCC, and ~0% in RSC).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig12" position="float"><label>Figure 12.</label><caption><title>Visual self-motion signals (optic flow) in the posterior cingulate region.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Proportion of temporal and spatial tuning in PCC and RSC.

It turned out that the average DDI was much weaker compared to the vestibular DDI in PCC (p&lt;&lt;0.001, t-test), as well as compared to the visual tuning in the extrastriate visual cortex (e.g. MSTd, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Gu et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Takahashi et al., 2007</xref>). Hence, visual self-motion signals are overall weak in the posterior cingulate region including both PCC and RSC subregions. Similar to the vestibular signals, visual signals also did not show any significant difference across animals or hemispheres (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12s1">Figure 12—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12s2">Figure 12—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Numerous studies have indicated that the posterior part of cingulate cortex is involved in many complex behavioral contexts, yet in these studies top-down signals such as attention, anticipation, memory and reward are often mixed with bottom-up sensory driven signals which are difficult to be disentangled from each other. In our current study, by recording spiking activities from these areas in macaques during passive physical motions, we provided solid evidence showing that majority of PCC neurons (~2/3), and a modest proportion (~1/3) of RSC neurons carry robust vestibular linear translation and rotation signals originated from otolith organs and semicircular canals, respectively. A combined 3D spatiotemporal model captured PCC data well and revealed multiple temporal components that could be useful for estimation of instantaneous heading direction or head direction. These properties are consistent with the view that posterior cingulate region may serve as an important hub mediating self-motion related signals propagated from parietal-temporal lobes to hippocampal system for path integration during vector-based spatial navigation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Rushworth et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Vincent et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Kravitz et al., 2011</xref>). Surprisingly though, the same region does not appear to carry robust visual self-motion signals such as optic flow or grating, indicating that posterior cingulate cortex is a vestibular dominant region.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Comparison with previous studies</title><p>Vestibular signals in the posterior region of cingulate cortex have been indicated in previous studies using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) techniques. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Smith et al., 2012</xref> reported clear vestibular signals in a homologues area (cingulate sulcus visual area, CSv) in the human brain. Other researchers using similar techniques also observed similar activity in similar areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bense et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Shinder and Taube, 2010</xref>). In these imaging studies, vestibular stimuli were typically provided through caloric or galvanic stimulations due to restraint of head positions during scanning. To achieve more real inertial motion stimuli, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Schindler and Bartels, 2018</xref> adopted a clever method by physically rotating the head of human subjects in the scanner, and measured the blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) signal immediately after termination of head motion. While these imaging studies provide valuable information of identified vestibular-related signals across the whole brain, there are limitations. In particular, caloric or galvanic stimulation techniques can only activate the vestibular system in a general way (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Suzuki et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Fitzpatrick and Day, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Utz et al., 2010</xref>), instead of being able to simulate real and accurate self-motion including translation along certain directions or rotation around specific axis in 3D environment. Moreover, vestibular signals typically carry complex temporal dynamics (i.e. in milliseconds) that cannot be easily captured by BOLD signals with a relatively slow temporal resolution (i.e. in seconds). Thus, it is important to further conduct studies using single-unit recording techniques to acquire neurophysiological data with much higher spatial and temporal resolutions. In general, we found robust vestibular signals in similar regions as indicated in previous imaging studies (yet with more spatiotemporal information as discussed in the following sections), confirming a rough consistency between spiking activity from single neurons with BOLD signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Berens et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>However, Smith and colleagues also reported robust visual signals in human cingulate sulcus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Wall and Smith, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Fischer et al., 2012</xref>), as well as in macaque PCC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Cottereau et al., 2017</xref>). By contrast, we discovered much weaker visual responses using global optic flow or grating. Our results seem to be more consistent with another study, in which BOLD signals were suppressed in response to random motion and static visual stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Pitzalis et al., 2013</xref>). The inconsistency of visual responses reported across studies may be due to different stimuli used in each experiment. For example, researchers observed visual activity in the posterior region of cingulate cortex when complex optic flow patterns were dynamically changing over time (e.g. switching back and forth between expansion and rotation) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Wall and Smith, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Cottereau et al., 2017</xref>). These activities were basically gone when patterns of optic flow became consistent and stable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Smith et al., 2017</xref>). It is possible that the posterior cingulate region is more involved in more complex environment when visual stimuli are ever-changing. Other possibilities include specific parameters in the stimuli, for example, the range of temporal frequency of visual stimulus which have been limited in our experiments (see Materials and methods). More types of stimuli and temporal frequencies should be used to test this hypothesis in future experiments.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Functional implications of vestibular signals in PCC</title><p>Direct inputs of vestibular signals to PCC originate from a number of sources, including the thalamus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Shinder and Taube, 2010</xref>), the parietal insular vestibular cortex (PIVC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Guldin and Grüsser, 1998</xref>), and the parietal-temporal cortices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Pandya et al., 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Vogt et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Musil and Olson, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cavada and Goldman-Rakic, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Olson and Musil, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Akbarian et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Shinder and Taube, 2010</xref>). Previous studies have demonstrated that vestibular signals with diverse temporal and spatial modulations are ubiquitously distributed across many areas, pointing out a vestibular network in sensory cortices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Guldin and Grüsser, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Laurens et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Cheng and Gu, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Gu, 2018</xref>).</p><p>In the current study, we also found clear temporal and spatial modulations in a large proportion of neurons in PCC, with many properties qualitatively similar to those in the insular and parietal-temporal areas, indicating PCC is one of the nodes within the cortical vestibular network. For example, preferred directions of PCC neurons in response to linear translation overall have a bias toward leftward and rightward motion in the horizontal plane, a pattern of which has been seen in several parietal-temporal areas such as MSTd (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Gu et al., 2006</xref>). Information theory predicts that such a pattern of distributed preferred directions is useful for detection of fine-varied headings around straight ahead (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Gu et al., 2010</xref>), suggesting that PCC could be involved in heading perception. As to rotation signals, the distributed preferred axis tends to bias around pitch and roll, but not yaw. A previous study has reported that in mice, azimuth-tuning of head direction cells is affixed to the head-horizontal plane when the animals’ head positions were changed relative to gravity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Angelaki et al., 2020</xref>). Therefore, these rotation signals could be essential for head direction cells to function properly in 3D environments.</p><p>We found all temporal components play important roles through partial correlation analysis. Besides velocity, acceleration and jerk which were studied in previous work, our study also captured a position signal in some posterior cingulate neurons. According to weight value, this component is less dominant compared to the others, but is more prevalent than that in the extrastriate visual cortex, suggesting that a process of integrating the velocity quantity to position may happen in PCC when self-motion related information is propagated closer to the hippocampus system.</p><p>As to the outputs of PCC, it also directly sends signals back to the vestibular nucleus (VN) in brainstem (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Akbarian et al., 1994</xref>). This pathway may be involved in gaze control or other reflex behaviors during coordinated eye, head, and body movements during natural navigation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Dean and Platt, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Shinder and Taube, 2010</xref>). Thus, as postulated by previous researchers, PCC ‘… <italic>do not serve a simple or direct role either in sensory information processing or in motor control…</italic>’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Vogt and Gabriel, 1993</xref>). Instead, vestibular signals with rich temporal and spatial information in PCC may compose a high and mixed dimensional neural representation that could be used by downstream neurons through a simple, linear readout algorithm to compute an efficient and flexible variable according to ongoing task’s need.</p><p>Among the brain limbic system, PCC is the one that has been less studied and its exact functions to date remain unclear and debatable compared to the other parts, for example, its counterpart at the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), an area of which is identified to be involved in emotion processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Vogt and Gabriel, 1993</xref>). Both anterior and posterior parts of cingulate cortex are heavily connected with each other. PCC is also reciprocally connected with PIVC that in turn receives projections from the viscera system through the solitary tract and the parabrachial complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Vogt, 2019</xref>). Electrical stimulation in PIVC evokes unpleasant emotions including vomiting, nausea, dizziness, and pain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Penfield and Faulk, 1955</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Penfield, 1957</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Mazzola et al., 2012</xref>). Thus, vestibular signals in PCC may also be related to emotion, which requires further investigations in the future. In addition, PCC has been indicated to play roles in many other cognitive functions including default mode network (DMN), visual spatial map, action, learning, spatial memory, decisions (see reviews and books by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Vogt et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Vogt and Gabriel, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Vogt and Laureys, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Fransson and Marrelec, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Leech and Sharp, 2014</xref>). For example, in a recent study, Gold and his colleagues reported that PCC neurons contain spatial choice and reward-target signals in a complex, adaptive task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Li et al., 2019</xref>). Future studies need to be conducted for investigation of how vestibular signals in PCC are involved in these functions.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Self-motion signals in macaque RSC</title><p>Similar to PCC, RSC has also been indicated to be involved in spatial navigation tasks albeit mainly in human and rodent studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Cooper et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Maguire, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Spiers and Maguire, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Vann et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Clark et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Cullen and Taube, 2017</xref>). Vestibular yaw-rotation signals have been observed in mice RSC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Keshavarzi et al., 2021</xref>), as well as primary visual cortex (V1) which may originate directly from RSC as revealed by tracing and functional mapping (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Vélez-Fort et al., 2018</xref>). At the same time, mice RSC also receives heavy inputs from V1 as well as other sensory information related with spatial perception, suggesting RSC is a multisensory area albeit biased toward visual (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Zingg et al., 2014</xref>). Recently, Powell and colleagues also reported visual responses modulated by grating stimuli in mice RSC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Powell et al., 2020</xref>). By contrast, although we discovered that about one-third RSC neurons in macaques exhibited significant temporal modulations to physical translation or rotation stimuli, visual modulations overall by optic flow appeared to be fairly weak in this area (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Figure 12B</xref>). To verify that we have not missed other visual motion signals, we also introduced the visual gratings stimuli. Similar to optic flow, the responses to grating stimuli is also quite weak in this region (data not shown). A number of factors may lead to heterogeneous results across studies.</p><p>First, previous studies on human found strong involvement of RSC in virtual navigation task or when animals were imagining or planning route, which required many high-level top-down signals such as attention, anticipation, or action (see reviews by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Maguire, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Spiers and Maguire, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Vann et al., 2009</xref>). By contrast, in our study, the monkeys performed a simple fixation task while they were passively experienced self-motion stimuli, a process of which mainly involved sensory-driven signals. Second, previous studies suggest that RSC may be more involved in landmark-based navigation instead of vector-based navigation (i.e. path integration). For example, lesion of RSC significantly impaired mice’s performance during spatial navigation when they relied on visual landmarks but not much when animals were required to rely on self-motion cues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Clark et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Mitchell et al., 2018</xref>). Thus, RSC may not be much involved in vector-based navigation particularly when relying optic flow to update one’s self-motion directions or travelled distance. Third, the exact area of RSC has been defined differently across species. In rodents, RSC (usually defined as RSP) is a relatively large region and PCC is small, whereas in monkeys the region of PCC is very large and RSC is small. In human, both areas are fairly small. Thus, homologous areas across species could be somehow different and execute heterogeneous functions to adapt to environments during evolution.</p><p>Compared to PCC, we discovered that vestibular signals overall are less clear in macaque RSC. Close to one-third proportion of RSC neurons, which is about a half of that of PCC neurons, exhibit significant temporal modulations. Moreover, the same 3D spatiotemporal model does not fit data in RSC as well as that in PCC, suggesting that temporal component signals in RSC may either be less reliable, or more complex that need other models to be further developed to better capture the data. Unlike PCC, spatial tuning in RSC neurons is basically lacking. This result may seemingly surprising compared to recent findings in rodents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Keshavarzi et al., 2021</xref>). However, in addition to the possibilities described above, there is also another one that our motion stimuli contain a smaller rotary speed (maximal ~20°/s) compared to that used in previous rodent studies (maximal ~80°/s). Rotation with high velocity may evoke more responses which should be tested in the future. In any case, our results suggest that macaque PCC and RSC may contribute to spatial navigation in different ways. Future studies could be conducted to investigate spatial reference frames of self-motion signals in these regions, and how these signals are functionally linked to the animals’ perceptual decisions during spatial-related tasks.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Subjects and system set-up</title><p>We performed the experiments on three male monkeys (<italic>Macaca mulatta</italic>), weighted 8–12 kg (monkey Q, P, and W). The monkeys were chronically implanted with a circular molded lightweight plastic ring above cranium for head fixation and recording, and scleral coils for monitoring eye movements in real time inside a magnetic field with phase detector (Riverbend instrument).</p><p>During behavior training and neural recording, monkeys were comfortably seated in a chair, which was secured to a six-degree of freedom (heave, surge, and sway for translation; pitch, roll, and yaw for rotation) motion platform (MOOG, 6DOF2000E) with an attached LCD screen in front of it (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). With such set-up, we could flexibly switch different stimuli types, vestibular stimuli from the motion of platform and visual stimuli from the screen given by an OpenGL accelerator board, depending on different trial condition. To simulate the visual pattern of real motion projected onto the retina, visual stimuli are depicted as a three-dimensional cuboid space full of 0.3 × 0.26 cm yellow triangles (just like stars in the star sky), with 100 cm wide, 150 cm high, 160 cm deep and the density of 0.002 /cm<sup>3</sup>. The optic flow field is a simulated 3D space with motion parallax and size information that is dependent on depth. The monkeys were head-fixed and sat at a distance of about 30 cm from the screen, with a visual angle of approximately 90°×90°.</p><p>After monkeys were well-trained to the tasks, a recording grid was tightly settled inside the plastic ring horizontally. The grid contains small holes arranged in array with a diameter of 0.5 mm and the holes were apart from each other by 0.8 mm. With the help of the grid and figures from MRI, we can map the position of each site which we performed recording on. All animal procedures were approved by the Animal Care Committee of Shanghai Institutes for Biological Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences and have been described previously in detail (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Gu et al., 2006</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Experimental protocol</title><p>During each task, there was a small fixation point (0.2°×0.2°) appeared at the center of the screen from the beginning and disappeared till the stimulus was vanished. The monkeys needed to saccade to the fixation point and maintain fixation for 200 ms to initiate the self-motion stimuli. The animals maintained fixation for the following 1.5 s within an electronic window (3°×3°) before the stimulus was removed. Monkeys were rewarded with juice at the end of trial if they completed the trial successfully, otherwise the trial would stop and the data were aborted.</p><p>To characterize basic tuning properties in posterior cingulate region, two sensory modality conditions including vestibular and visual stimuli were conducted in the current study. In the vestibular condition, motion platform was moving along a straight line (i.e. translation condition) or rotating around the center of the interaural axis (i.e. rotation condition) in 26 directions that were equally distributed in 3D space (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Only a fixation point was presented on the visual display for the animal to maintain fixation at a head-fixed target (i.e. suppression of vestibular ocular reflex, VOR). In the visual condition, the motion platform was stationary while visual stimuli (optic flow) were presented on the screen, simulating real motions that were delivered in the vestibular condition. Visual and vestibular stimuli conditions were interleaved in one experimental block.</p><p>Motion profiles in either stimulus condition followed a Gaussian velocity, with a corresponding biphasic acceleration profile. Actual velocity and acceleration parameters were acquired from an accelerator and a gyroscope mounted on the motion platform (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, dark blue line indicates the measured acceleration of translation and light red line indicates the measured velocity of rotation.). By estimation, the peak velocity was ~0.3 m/s and the peak acceleration was 1 m/s<sup>2</sup> in the translation condition. In the rotation condition, the peak angular velocity was ~20 °/s and the peak acceleration was 60°/s<sup>2</sup>.</p><p>To make sure that responses under the vestibular condition were not evoked from other cues, we also conducted two additional control experiments. In the total darkness condition, we turned off the visual display to eliminate any residual visual cues in the vestibular condition that might arise from incomplete suppression of VOR. The monkeys were free to make any eye movements in this condition. In the sound control experiment, we tried to test the possibility that the vestibular responses might arise from the sound cue generated from physical motions of the mechanical actuators (peak magnitude: ~90 dBs). To do this, we first put a recorder beside the animal’s ears and recorded the sounds when the motion platform was moving with the motion profiles used in the vestibular condition. We then played these sounds to the animals when the motion platform was stationary.</p><p>Under the visual condition, for a subpopulation of neurons, we ran an additional block using drifting gratings. Specifically, gratings with a full black-white contrast were moving along eight directions orthogonal to their orientations in the fronto-parallel plane. The temporal frequency is 5 Hz and the spatial frequency is 0.2 and 0.4 cycles/degree in the experiment.</p><p>While the animals were experienced self-motion stimuli, single-unit activity was recorded from PCC and RSC in the posterior cingulate region. To validate the position of PCC and RSC, we first used MRI to help identify locations of electrode penetrations. Electrodes were penetrated in the earth-vertical plane. PCC were located roughly around anterior-posterior (−1~+12) and medial-lateral (0 ~ 10). RSC were located roughly around anterior-posterior (+1~+7) and medial-lateral (0 ~ 6). The MSTd data were recorded in a previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Gu et al., 2006</xref>) and were used here as a comparison with the cingulate data.</p><p>After entering the targeted areas, single-unit extracellular recording was performed.

To quantify whether a neuron was significantly modulated by the stimulus, a two-sided Wilcoxon rank sum test was used to compare responses during the 1.5 s stimulus duration with the spontaneous activity. The spontaneous activity was based on the time window of 100 ms before and 300 ms after stimulus onset. Responses in the 1.5 s stimulus duration was divided into 60 bins, each of which covered 300 ms and stepped at 25 ms. To avoid false positive results, a neuron was considered to have significant temporal tuning only when satisfying two strict criteria at the same time. First, at least five consecutive bins needed to show significant modulation (p&lt;0.01, Wilcoxon rank sum test). Secondly, the first requirement needed to happen in at least two adjacent spatial directions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chen et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>To quantify whether neurons were spatially tuned, we first calculated response in each 300 ms-bin and performed ANOVA analysis across 26 vectors (i.e. translation directions or rotation axes). Responses at a certain bin was considered to be significant when p value was smaller than 0.01. To identify the number of response peak across all bins, we performed an analysis as used in previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chen et al., 2010</xref>). Briefly, for all those bins with significant spatial tuning (p&lt;0.01, one-way ANOVA), a local peak was temporarily assigned when it was higher than its neighboring bins. Across all these local peaks, a next step was performed to identify which of them were within one group, meaning one real peak, or were separated from each other, meaning multiple peaks (actually only two-peak cases were considered whereas tri-peak or higher were not considered because those peaks were usually small and unreliable according to experience). In particular for each pair of neighboring local peaks, Pearson correlation coefficient was measured between the two vectors composed of responses in the 26 directions at the local peak bins. Positive correlation led to conclusion that the compared local peaks belonged to the same one peak and negative correlation suggested that they belonged to different peaks. If there was only one real peak in the end, a neuron was defined as ‘single-peak’ cell, and if there were two peaks, it was defined as ‘double-peak’ neuron.</p><p>To quantify the strength of direction tuning, we used a direction discrimination index (DDI) given by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Takahashi et al., 2007</xref>, as follows:<disp-formula id="equ1"><mml:math id="m1"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">D</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">D</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">I</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>R</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">m</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">a</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">x</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>R</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">m</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">i</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">n</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>R</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">m</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">a</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">x</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>R</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">m</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">i</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">n</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mn>2</mml:mn><mml:msqrt><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mi>S</mml:mi><mml:mi>S</mml:mi><mml:mi>E</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>N</mml:mi><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mi>M</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac></mml:msqrt></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac><mml:mo>,</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></disp-formula></p><p> where <italic>R</italic><sub>max</sub> and <italic>R</italic><sub>min</sub> are the maximal and minimal responses respectively, <italic>SSE</italic> is the sum squared error around mean responses, <italic>N</italic> is the total number of observations (trials), and <italic>M</italic> is the number of stimulus directions (here, <italic>M</italic> = 26). Neurons with strong response modulations will have DDI values closer to 1, while neurons with weak response modulations will have DDI values closer to 0. To compute each neuron’s DDI, we first found the maximum response direction based on the full 1.5 s stimulus duration. In that direction, we then found the maximum response time bin in one of the 60 bins (300 ms window with a step of 25 ms), and assigned this bin as the <italic>R</italic><sub>max</sub>. Using this time bin, <italic>R</italic><sub>min</sub> was assigned for the minimum response bin across the other 25 directions. Permutation test was applied to assess significance of DDI.</p><p>For neurons with significant spatial tuning, spatial preference of each unit was calculated from vector sum of responses in all directions, with azimuth and elevation as spherical coordinates. For single-peak neuron, preferred direction was calculated around the response peak time. For double-peak neuron, only the first peak time was used since responses at the first peak were generally larger than the second peak in the opposite directions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chen et al., 2010</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-3-2"><title>The 3D spatiotemporal model</title><p>A combined spatiotemporal model was constructed to fit PSTH data in 26 directions at the same time.

cingulate and retrosplenial cortex. Strengths of the study include the comparison across brain areas; the experimental design to distinguish the contribution of vestibular, visual and other cues to the neural responses; and the modeling approach used to analyze the data.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Robust vestibular self-motion signals in macaque posterior cingulate region&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, including Jennifer L Raymond as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Tirin Moore as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Jean Laurens (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>We would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). Specifically, we are asking editors to accept without delay manuscripts, like yours, that they judge can stand as <italic>eLife</italic> papers without additional data, even if they feel that they would make the manuscript stronger. Thus the revisions requested below only address clarity and presentation.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This manuscript characterizes the vestibular signals carried by neurons in the posterior cingulate cortex and restrosplenial cortex. The PPC has long been implicated in conveying self-motion signals to the navigation system. However, previous work did not disentangle the contribution of various sensory modalities to this function. The present study uses controlled visual and vestibular stimuli to demonstrate a strong pattern of vestibular responses in PPC, with weaker self-motion signals in RSC. The experiments are systematic and rigorous, with appropriate controls and comparisons across conditions. The manuscript could be improved by several changes in the way the results are analyzed and presented to facilitate comparison of vestibular signaling across regions of the cortex, including previously published results. The work provides foundational knowledge of that should be of interest to scientists studying sensory coding as well as those interested in spatial navigation.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1. The key question is not whether the vestibular responses are &quot;significantly better&quot; fit with a PVAJ model compared with VA-only model (which is roughly what BIC measures), but how much the various components influence the neuron's responses. Partial coefficient of correlation would be better suited than BIC to describe how various components contribute to neuronal responses.</p><p>2. The reviewers found the analysis of temporal tuning to be confusing, and thought it would be better to omit that analysis and go straight to the VA model.</p><p>3. The rationale for using non-linear rather than linear spatial tuning functions was not clear. Using a linear function would have the dual advantages of reduced chance of overfitting and allowing comparison with published results from other cortical areas (Laurens et al., <italic>eLife</italic> 2017).</p><p>4. The model allowed varied delay between the different components; this choice was not well justified, and lines 550-552 of the Discussion indicate that the inclusion of this delay affected the results. Please elaborate on this in the Results section, providing information about the delays obtained in the model fits, and more adequate justification of the choice of a varied temporal delay.</p><p>5. The source of the data from the MSTd is not clear. Were these neurons also recorded for this study? Or if data was used from another study, it should be clearly stated which study and the methods for recording these data.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Robust vestibular self-motion signals in macaque posterior cingulate region&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>.

Unfortunately, two of the major concerns raised remain largely unresolved.</p><p>I am particularly concerned about the inclusion of variable delays for each temporal component in the model. The range of relative delays between V and A components is quite broad, with many fits up to 300 ms. The authors describe that these delays are &quot;reasonable&quot;, but without justification, and I am not persuaded that delay is reasonable for a vestibular signal, even at higher levels in cortical processing. Moreover, it is not clear why the figures show the relative delays between temporal components, rather than the absolute delay fit by the model for each component-P,V,A,J, and I am worried that those delays may be even longer and less plausible. Notably, the delays for the VA vs PVAJ models are different, with many shorter delays for the latter, suggested something is amiss with this element of the model, particularly in the VA model. Finally, in the supplementary figures showing results when a fixed delay was used (Figure 8-Supp 1 and Figure 10-Supp2), the legends do not make it clear that is what is being shown, or what the fixed delay was.</p><p>The rationale provided in the manuscript for using nonlinear rather than linear fits has not been extended at all.

For instance:</p><p>– The partial correlation analysis performed in response to comment 1 is not based on 3D model fits. Instead, they performed separate analysis is based on only 1 motion direction (which won't represent the contribution of different components accurately if their spatial tuning are not aligned). Furthermore, this analysis doesn't take the delays of various components into account. Furthermore, this analysis is presented in a very superficial manner (Figure 10S1). Overall, they performed an un-insightful partial correlation analysis and then added two main figures to present the PVAJ model: this makes the manuscript more complicated for little benefit.</p><p>– The authors didn't really shorten or eliminate the analysis of temporal tuning (as suggested in comment 2 to streamline the manuscript) but merely moved ten lines to Methods.</p><p>– Regarding the delays between various components (comment 4), they added histograms of these delays in Figure 8D and Figure 10E. However, these histograms show that these delays are always positive, e.g. they assumed that V always lags A (the axis label in these panels is ambiguous, btw). This assumption is justified in the text as follows: &quot;the velocity time was set to lag the acceleration time because vestibular velocity signal is supposed to be an integral from the acceleration quantity&quot; (lines 289-291).</p><p>Unfortunately, this is mathematically incorrect: first, just because velocity is the integral of acceleration doesn't imply that it &quot;lags&quot; it (except in special cases e.g. using sinusoids); those are completely different notions. Second, even if velocity did lag acceleration, this fact would already be represented by the shape of the temporal components used to fit the model, and imposing a positive delay between acceleration and velocity would still be incorrect. Likewise, the authors assume that position lags velocity for the same incorrect reason (lines 372-374) and that jerk lags acceleration with a justification which is quite incomprehensible (lines 371-372).</p><p>In principle, I can appreciate that having variable delays may be justified; for instance if different neuronal pathways conveying different dynamic components converge onto a cortical neuron. On the other hand, I have reservations about this method as it may promote overfitting. In any case, if the authors introduce variable delays, then they must allow each delay to be positive or negative since there is no justification for doing otherwise.</p><p>– On the other hand, they addressed a number of other issues correctly.</p><p>Overall, I find the current revision a little disappointing: the manuscript has become more complicated (two new figures) and, even though some issues were corrected, new were raised.

We took the reviewer’s suggestion by performing the partial correlation analyses. Specifically, we computed partial correlation coefficients of the neural responses with each temporal component for each cell (i.e., velocity, acceleration, jerk and position, see method at line 822-828). As shown in the new Figure 10—figure supplement 1, partial correlation analysis nicely revealed many significant cases for each temporal component, with position relatively weaker compared to the others, confirming that these components are important. However, these coefficients tend to be high, and except for the position signal, the difference among the other temporal components is small and hard to be compared. So, in addition to the partial correlation analysis, we further performed the 3D spatial-temporal model (PVAJ) analysis in a similar way as developed in previous study (Laurens et al., 2017). This method not only gives the weight of each temporal component for each cell, reflecting their relative contributions, but also consider temporal effects in each spatial direction, allowing to provide more detailed and thorough information about spatial-temporal relationship. We have now modified texts accordingly, and these new results were added in the main text (line 358-368), method (line 822-828), and Figure 10—figure supplement 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. The reviewers found the analysis of temporal tuning to be confusing, and thought it would be better to omit that analysis and go straight to the VA model.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for the confusion caused by our description. In our experiment, to be able to assess the overall tuning situations in the targeted areas, we have performed unbiased recording by including every neuron we encountered online once we were certain to be in the right area. We then used the criterion used by previous researchers (e.g., Chen et al., 2010) to select neurons with significant temporal tuning for further analysis. Thus, the analysis of temporal tuning is traditional, yet it is pretty important for most of the consequent analyses in the current study. But we agree with the reviewer that our previous description is problematic, so we have now heavily polished this part, by moving large part of the detail to the Method to clearly explain this operation (line 775-787). By contrast, we only keep a very brief and clear description in the main text to affiliate reading (line 166-168). We hope this adjustment would be satisfactory, but we could further make modifications if reviewers still have concerns.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. The rationale for using non-linear rather than linear spatial tuning functions was not clear. Using a linear function would have the dual advantages of reduced chance of overfitting and allowing comparison with published results from other cortical areas (Laurens et al., eLife 2017).</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer is correct in that the linear function in Laurens’ paper is potentially better in reducing overfitting and allowing comparison with results from the published results. We originally simply chose the nonlinear function from a previous paper (Chen et al., 2011a) because we found this function can explain our data well and make sense theoretically. But we have not thought about the reviewer’s point about its alternatives. Sorry for this negligence. We have now tried the linear spatial function in Laurens’ paper, and found pretty similar results in general. However, the spatial congruency among different temporal components became less consistent. Moreover, because we have used a varied-delay setting that has not been used by previous studies anyway (see reply-to-reviewer point #4), we still keep the nonlinear function in the current version after careful weighing. We hope that this is acceptable, yet please let us know if the reviewer still has the concern.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. The model allowed varied delay between the different components; this choice was not well justified, and lines 550-552 of the Discussion indicate that the inclusion of this delay affected the results. Please elaborate on this in the Results section, providing information about the delays obtained in the model fits, and more adequate justification of the choice of a varied temporal delay.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for the vague information. There are a number of reasons we decided to include a varied delay. One is that it is a bit hard for us to suppose that all neurons have identical delays between each temporal component. Instead, it is likely that these components could be inherited from upstream neurons at different hierarchical levels, leading to heterogeneous lags. The other reason is that we see more consistent spatial information among different temporal components, compared to the case when the delay is fixed. This applies to both of the VA model and the full PVAJ model. We argue this result may make more sense in terms of efficiency of sensory coding, yet we don’t have further stronger evidence in the current study to support it, which definitely requires future studies. We have discussed this in the Discussion in the previous version, but now elaborate on this in the Results section (line 290-296, 343-346, 371-377). Following the reviewers, we also added the distribution of different temporal delays in the new Figure 8 and Figure 10 for VA model and PVAJ model, respectively. As a comparison, spatial correlation based on fixed-delay as used in previous models were presented in the Figure 8—figure supplement 1 and Figure 10—figure supplement 2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5.

MSTd data were from another study (Gu et al., 2006). We now have added the detail in the Method (line 766-767).</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed, as outlined below:</p><p>1.

We do agree with the reviewers that including the varied delay would potentially introduce more parameters and subsequently cause overfitting. Plus, as the reviewer pointed out, the assumptions about the relative delay among each temporal component is also kinda arbitrary. We could not really argue with persuasive evidence to show that our previous model really gains more benefits over the ones the reviewers proposed. Thus, we do not insist on our own model anymore, and decided to switch to the one with fixed-delay to eliminate issues as raised from all the reviewers.</p><p>Related with this issue, we also agree with the reviewer that the linear function is truly better than the nonlinear one to reduce potential overfitting. Thus in sum, we now used a model with fixed-delay (i.e., same delay time for all temporal components) plus a linear function (Laurens et al., 2017) in the new version of the manuscript. Importantly, we show that this decision does not change our main conclusions in our study. Hence, we hope that this modification would be acceptable for all the reviewers.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. Do a more complete partial correlation analysis</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for the previous inappropriate partial correlation analysis. We now have performed the analysis in a more correct way. In particular, we now calculated the partial correlation coefficients between neuronal responses (PSTHs) and the fitted data in all motion directions (26 vectors) for each temporal component in the 3D spatiotemporal model. As shown in the new Figure 10B, partial coefficients of correlation indicate significant contributions from all 4 temporal components for majority of the neurons in PCC. We now have included this result in the main text (line 345-351, &amp; Figure 10B).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3.
