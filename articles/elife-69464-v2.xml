for each kingdom. Nevertheless, recent discovery of homologs of Hyponastic Leaves1 (HYL1), a ‘plant-specific’ Dicer partner, in the metazoan phylum Cnidaria, challenges the view that miRNAs evolved convergently in animals and plants. Here, we show that the HYL1 homolog Hyl1-like a (Hyl1La) is crucial for development and miRNA biogenesis in the cnidarian model <italic>Nematostella vectensis</italic>. Inhibition of Hyl1La by morpholinos resulted in metamorphosis arrest in <italic>Nematostella</italic> embryos and a significant reduction in levels of most miRNAs. Further, meta-analysis of morphants of miRNA biogenesis components, like Dicer1, shows clustering of their miRNA profiles with Hyl1La morphants. Strikingly, immunoprecipitation of Hyl1La followed by quantitative PCR revealed that in contrast to the plant HYL1, Hyl1La interacts only with precursor miRNAs and not with primary miRNAs. This was complemented by an in vitro binding assay of Hyl1La to synthetic precursor miRNA. Altogether, these results suggest that the last common ancestor of animals and plants carried a HYL1 homolog that took essential part in miRNA biogenesis and indicate early emergence of the miRNA system before plants and animals separated.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>In both animals and plants, small molecules known as micro ribonucleic acids (or miRNAs for short) control the amount of proteins cells make from instructions encoded in their DNA. Cells make mature miRNA molecules by cutting and modifying newly-made RNA molecules in two stages.</p><p>Some of the components animals and plants utilize to make and use miRNAs are similar, but most are completely different. For example, in plants an enzyme known as Dicer cuts newly made RNAs into mature miRNAs with the help of a protein called HYL1, whereas humans and other animals do not have HYL1 and Dicer works with alternative partner proteins, instead. Therefore, it is generally believed that miRNAs evolved separately in animals and plants after they split from a common ancestor around 1.6 billion years ago.</p><p>Recent studies on sea anemones and other primitive animals challenge this idea. Proteins similar to HYL1 in plants have been discovered in sea anemones and sponges, and sea anemone miRNAs show several similarities to plant miRNAs including their mode of action. However, it is not clear whether these HYL1-like proteins work in the same way as their plant counterparts.</p><p>Here, Tripathi, Admoni et al. investigated the role of the HYL1-like protein in sea anemones. The experiments found that this protein was essential for the sea anemones to make miRNAs and to grow and develop properly. Unlike HYL1 in plants – which is involved in both stages of processing newly-made miRNAs into mature miRNAs – the sea anemone HYL1-like protein only helped in the second stage to make mature miRNAs from intermediate molecules known as precursor miRNAs.</p><p>These findings demonstrate that some of the components plants use to make miRNAs also perform similar roles in sea anemones. This suggests that the miRNA system evolved before the ancestors of plants and animals separated from each other. Questions for future studies will include investigating how plants and animals evolved different miRNA machinery, and why sponges and jellyfish have HYL1-like proteins, whereas humans and other more complex animals do not.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>microRNA</kwd><kwd>Cnidaria</kwd><kwd><italic>Nematostella vectensis</italic></kwd><kwd>HYL1</kwd><kwd>small RNA biogenesis</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010663</institution-id><institution>H2020 European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>637456</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Moran</surname><given-names>Yehu</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010663</institution-id><institution>H2020 European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>863809</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Moran</surname><given-names>Yehu</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Presence of a functional homolog of HYL1 in <italic>Nematostella vectensis</italic>, a basal animal model, indicates divergent evolution of miRNA biogenesis pathway in plants and animals from an ancestral miRNA system.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are 21–24 nucleotides-long small RNAs that are known to be involved in post-transcriptional gene regulation and play important roles in both plant and animal development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Alvarez-Garcia and Miska, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bråte et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Voinnet, 2009</xref>). The miRNA is transcribed by RNA polymerase II into a long primary transcript, which is further processed into a miRNA precursor and finally chopped into ~22 nucleotide miRNA/miRNA* duplex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bartel, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bartel, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Voinnet, 2009</xref>). The processing of miRNA varies between plants and animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Moran et al., 2017</xref>). In animals, the biogenesis of miRNAs is compartmentalized as the processing occurs in both the nucleus and cytoplasm. Within the nucleus, the RNase type III Drosha and its partner Pasha (also called DGCR8) constitute a microprocessor complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Han et al., 2004b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kim et al., 2009</xref>). This complex acts on primary miRNA (pri-miRNA) transcripts and processes them into precursor miRNA (pre-miRNA). The pre-miRNA is then transported by Exportin 5 into the cytoplasm where they get further processed into the mature miRNA by the RNase type III Dicer with the help of other double-stranded RNA binding proteins such as loquacious (Loqs), transactivation response element RNA-binding protein (TRBP), and protein activator of the interferon-induced protein kinase (PACT) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Han et al., 2004b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Redfern et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Saito et al., 2005</xref>). Contrastingly, in plants both pri-miRNA and pre-miRNA are processed into mature miRNA by a single RNase type III, called DICER-LIKE1 (DCL1) assisted by its partner the double-stranded RNA-binding motif (DSRM)-containing protein, Hyponastic Leaves1 (HYL1) within the nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Han et al., 2004a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Voinnet, 2009</xref>). In both plants and animals, the mature miRNA duplex interacts with Argonaute proteins (AGOs) and forms the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) in the cytoplasm. The RISC commences miRNA guided cleavage or translational inhibition of complementary targets genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kim et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>The metazoan lineages of Bilateria and its sister group Cnidaria separated more than 600 million years ago. While Bilateria include the vast majority of animals, Cnidaria include sea anemones, corals, hydroids, and jellyfish. The phylogenetic position of cnidarians makes them an important comparative group for inferring animal evolution. In a previous study, we identified different components of miRNA biogenesis machinery in Cnidaria and observed that most bilaterian components have cnidarian homologs. However, cnidarians lack homologs of classical bilaterian Dicer protein partners such as PACT, Loqs, or TRBP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Moran et al., 2013</xref>). Interestingly two homologs of HYL1 called Hyl1-Like-a (NveHyl1La) and Hyl1-Like-b (NveHyl1Lb) were identified in the sea anemone <italic>Nematostella vectensis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Moran et al., 2013</xref>). Apart from this, it was also found that cnidarian miRNAs possess several interesting features that are common to their counterparts in plants: cnidarian miRNAs and their targets show perfect complementarity and frequently regulate their targets by messenger RNA (mRNA) cleavage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Moran et al., 2014</xref>). Recently, some other common features with plants were identified in <italic>Nematostella</italic>, including methylation of miRNAs by HEN1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Modepalli et al., 2018</xref>), a feature rarely found in animals and the origin of miRNAs from inverted duplication of their target genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fridrich et al., 2020</xref>), a feature previously considered specific to plant miRNAs.</p><p>In addition to the presence of HYL1 homologs in Cnidaria, homologs are also present in other non-bilaterian animals such as sponges (<italic>Amphimedon queenslandica</italic>) and in ctenophores (<italic>Mnemiopsis leidyi</italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Moran et al., 2013</xref>). However, we could not detect HYL1 homologs in Placozoa (<italic>Trichoplax adhaerens</italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Additionally, we also could not find any homologs in bilaterian animals and in unicellular organism like Fungi and Ichthyosporea. However, deep phylogenetic study of DSRM proteins showed that those of protozoans and fungi are phylogenetically closer to the DSRM proteins of plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dias et al., 2017</xref>). These results suggested that the HYL1-like proteins were already present in the common ancestor of plants and animals and during evolution have been lost in Bilateria and Ichthyosporea. These sequence-based observations led us to experimentally test the function of a HYL1 homolog of <italic>Nematostella,</italic> which could provide better insight into the evolution and origin of the miRNA biogenesis pathway. Our results show that Hyl1La is essential for the development of <italic>Nematostella</italic> and miRNA biogenesis, suggesting a common evolutionary history of miRNA biogenesis in plants and animals.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Schematic representation of a phylogenetic tree of Eukaryotes at the phylum level.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Phylogenetic tree representing the presence (green circles) and absence (open circles) of microRNAs (miRNAs), Dicer, and Dicer interacting proteins in different plant and animal phyla.

The HYL1 protein is known to play an essential role in the growth and development of the model plant <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> by regulating miRNA biogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Achkar et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Han et al., 2004a</xref>). Similarly, in mice, TRBP mutants show multiple developmental abnormities and a reduction in miRNA accumulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Koscianska et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Zhong et al., 1999</xref>). The <italic>Hyl1La</italic> gene of <italic>Nematostella</italic> contains 11 exons and 10 introns predicted to code for a protein containing three DSRM domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2A</xref>). Unlike its paralog <italic>Hyl1Lb</italic> that is specific to stinging cells and carries additional protein domains, <italic>Hyl1La</italic> expression is ubiquitously distributed throughout <italic>Nematostella</italic> tissues and shares its domain structure with other cnidarian HYL1 homologs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Moran et al., 2013</xref>). Thus, we decided to focus our analysis on this gene. To decipher the function of Hyl1La in <italic>Nematostella</italic>, we designed two different splicing morpholinos (MOs) (Hyl1La SI MO1 and Hyl1La SI MO2) to knockdown by mis-splicing the gene at two different intron-exons junctions. Additionally, the gene was also targeted for inhibition by using a translation-blocking MO (Hyl1La TB MO) which binds on the 5′ UTR and sterically blocks translation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). We injected each of the three MOs into <italic>Nematostella</italic> zygotes in parallel with a control MO designed to bind to no target in the sea anemone genome. The effect of SI MOs was validated by PCR followed by cloning and sequencing which revealed intron retention in both cases (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2s1sdata1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1—source data 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). All the injected animals were studied until 9 days post-fertilization (dpf). We observed that more than 80% of the animals injected with control MO developed normally and metamorphosed into primary polyps. In contrast, the animals injected with any of the three Hyl1La MOs showed developmental abnormalities, where more than 90% of the animals did not settle and metamorphosed into primary polyps until 9 dpf (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B–D and F</xref>). The developmental abnormalities observed here were grossly similar to those observed in <italic>Nematostella</italic> morphants of other miRNA processing components such as HEN1, Dicer1, AGO1, and AGO2 knockdown animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fridrich et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Modepalli et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>).

HYL1 in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> interacts with the stem region of miRNA precursors by using its DSRM domains and works with DCL1 synergistically (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Song et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Wu et al., 2007</xref>). Although the Dicer homolog alone is capable of processing the precursor into a mature miRNA, the presence of HYL1 is essential as it enhances the efficiency and in some cases the accuracy of miRNA biogenesis in plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dong et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Szarzynska et al., 2009</xref>). To assay the possible role of Hyl1La on miRNA expression in <italic>Nematostella</italic>, we performed small RNA sequencing of animals, injected with Hyl1La SI MO1 and with control MO. The analysis of read length distribution showed that the small RNA reads that lied between the size of miRNAs (20–24 nt) were higher (p &lt; 0.01, Student’s t-test) in control as compared to knockdown embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>).

For the miRNA quantification we used the most recent <italic>Nematostella</italic> miRNA datasets that were obtained by AGO immunoprecipitation (IP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fridrich et al., 2020</xref>). The expression of normalized miRNA reads was compared between control and Hyl1La SI MO1. About 54% of the total identified miRNAs showed downregulation of more than twofold in Hyl1La SI MO1-injected animals as compared to the control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Further, a significant reduction in overall miRNA abundance was observed in the knockdown morphants (p &lt; 0.00001, Wilcoxon signed-rank test) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). The expression variation caused by the action of other two MOs (Hyl1La SI MO2 and Hyl1La TB) was also assayed by quantitative stem-loop PCR of five miRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). Significant downregulation of three miRNAs: miR2022-3p, miR2025-3p, and miR2026-5p was detected in all three MOs (with the exception of miR-2026–5p with SI MO1), which supported the small RNA sequencing results. In contrast, two miRNAs, miR2027-5p and miR2028-5p, either showed upregulation or were not significantly affected by the Hyl1La knockdown. Previous studies have also shown that these two miRNAs may respond differently to other miRNAs in HEN1 and Dicer1 knockdown morphants of <italic>Nematostella</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Modepalli et al., 2018</xref>). This might be relevant to other miRNAs that did not show downregulation and suggest differences in their biogenesis. Further, we also checked for the processing accuracy of all the identified miRNAs by mapping them onto their respective precursors. The analysis did not reveal any aberrant processing. These results suggest that like its homolog in plants, Hyl1La in <italic>Nematostella</italic> might be involved in enhancement of Dicer efficiency and is not involved in size selection.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Hyl1-like a (Hyl1La) morphants show reduced expression of microRNAs (miRNAs).</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Average read length distribution of small RNA reads after adapter removal.

Using principal component analysis (PCA), we see that broadly the expression of mature miRNAs following the knockdown of Hyl1La behaves similarly to other characterized miRNA processing components. This is evident with Hyl1La morphants clustering with all miRNA biogenesis components compared to control, particularly with HEN1 and Dicer1. We also observe that both AGO1 and AGO2 are the most distant among the miRNA biogenesis components, which is consistent with their function of loading and therefore affecting a particular subset of miRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fridrich et al., 2020</xref>), while Hyl1La, HEN1, and Dicer1 affect the majority of the same miRNA in the same manner.</p><p>Next, we explored the effect of Hyl1La MO on other categories of small RNAs (siRNA and piRNA) reported in <italic>Nematostella</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Modepalli et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Praher et al., 2017</xref>). The expression of normalized reads of siRNA and piRNAs were compared between control and Hyl1La MO-injected animals. Significant (p &lt; 0.00001, Wilcoxon signed-rank test) down- and upregulation of siRNAs and piRNAs, respectively, were observed in Hyl1La MO-depleted animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2A-D</xref>). In case of siRNAs the difference was very mild as only 9% (46 out of 469) of siRNAs showed downregulation of more than twofold in Hyl1La MO-injected animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2A</xref>). Contrastingly, most of the piRNAs showed upregulation in Hyl1La-depleted animals wherein 36% (91 out of 251) of piRNAs showed upregulation of more than twofold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2C</xref>). In addition, the size distribution of reads shows upregulation (p &lt; 0.05, Student’s t-test) of sizes that correspond to piRNAs (28–30 nt) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Overall small RNA analysis showed that Hyl1La depletion has strong effect on miRNA expression, while mild and opposite effect on siRNA and piRNA expression, respectively.</p><p>To further support our results obtained with MOs, we attempted to knock down this gene by using short-hairpin RNAs (shRNAs), a method previously established in <italic>Nematostella</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Karabulut et al., 2019</xref>) that worked well in our lab for other genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lewandowska et al., 2021</xref>). We designed three different shRNAs from three different regions of Hyl1La gene (Hyl1La shRNA1, Hyl1La shRNA2, and Hyl1La shRNA3) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A–C</xref>) and injected them into <italic>Nematostella</italic> zygotes.

To assess the effect of these shRNAs on Hyl1La expression, we performed qRT-PCR from 3-day-old injected animals. Unexpectedly, we did not find any difference in Hyl1La expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). Additionally, we also assessed the phenotype, but we could not identify any phenotypic difference either. Next, we employed stem-loop PCR to test whether small RNAs are generated from an injected shRNA and indeed the small RNAs were produced as expected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). This result indicates that the small RNAs derived from the shRNAs were not able to downregulate Hyl1La.</p><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Structure of short-hairpin RNA (shRNA) precursors and their effect on Hyl1-like a (Hyl1La) expression.</title><p>(<bold>A–C</bold>) Structure of different shRNAs designed from different positions of Hyl1La gene along with GC content and their position are shown.

Being a DSRM-containing protein, it could interact with either pri-miRNA, pre-miRNA, or with both. Hence to test if Hyl1La interacts with pre- and/or pri-miRNA, we conducted an IP assay by injecting a plasmid carrying a cassette encoding an N-terminal 3 × FLAG-tagged full-length Hyl1La (‘FLAG-Hyl1La’) followed by a 3′-memOrange2 separated by a P2A self-cleaving peptide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kim et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Shaner et al., 2008</xref>).

Due to the very high Ct values measured for pri-miRNA, we were not able to compare the levels of pri-miRNAs bound with IgG and accurately compare them to FLAG-Hyl1La.

Further, while the cleavage mode of action and nearly perfect target binding could have evolved convergently in plants and cnidarians (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Moran et al., 2014</xref>), the involvement in miRNA biogenesis of the Hyl1L in Cnidaria and its plant homolog HYL1 is far less likely to be the result of parallel evolution.

Thus, our results call into question the hypothesis that miRNAs evolved convergently in plants and animals from an ancestral RNAi system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Axtell et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Tarver et al., 2012</xref>). To the best of our knowledge, our study provides the first demonstration that an elaborate miRNA biogenesis pathway might have existed in the common ancestor of plants and animals. However, it is also important to note that the presence of HYL1-like proteins by itself cannot be considered a definitive hallmark for the existence of miRNAs in non-bilaterian animals or their relatives. For example, a homolog of HYL1 exists in the ctenophore <italic>M. leidyi</italic>, but this species does not produce miRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Maxwell et al., 2012</xref>). Moreover, several unicellular relatives of animals contain miRNAs, but no homologs of HYL1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bråte et al., 2018</xref>). Thus, this pathway might demonstrate in various lineages compositional flexibility as well as high loss rates (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Moran et al., 2017</xref>). Recently, it was found in <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> (a unicellular green algae) that DUS16, which is a DSRM protein, and the RNase III DCL3 were efficient enough for miRNA processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Yamasaki et al., 2016</xref>). Further, various fungal groups also exhibit the presence of Dicer and plant-like DSRM proteins and lack animal-like accessory proteins, such as Drosha and Pasha (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dang et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dias et al., 2017</xref>). Contrastingly, DCL3 of <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> exhibits some structural features that are reminiscent of metazoan Drosha (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Valli et al., 2016</xref>). These observations suggest that the common ancestor of all these groups might have harbored only a single Dicer/Drosha-like RNase III enzyme assisted by a DSRM protein resembling the ones found in plants (HYL1-like).</p><p>We unexpectedly found that in contrast to plant HYL1 proteins, which interacts with both pri- and pre-miRNA, Hyl1La in <italic>Nematostella</italic> interacts only with pre-miRNA and not with pri-miRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). Our sequencing data strengthens the specificity of the pre-miRNA binding by showing no enrichment for additional longer RNA molecules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s4">Figure 5—figure supplement 4A</xref>). Further supporting the specific binding of Hyl1La to pre-miRNAs is the in vitro binding assay to a synthetic pre-miRNA compared to the shuffled sequence with a different secondary structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). A plausible explanation to this finding might be that <italic>Nematostella</italic> already possesses miRNA biogenesis machinery like the Drosha-Pasha microprocessor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Moran et al., 2013</xref>) that is known to interact only with pri-miRNAs and crop them into the pre-miRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kim et al., 2009</xref>). Another surprising finding in this study is that we were able to knock down the Hyl1La by using the MO only and not by shRNA microinjection, despite the processing of the shRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D–E</xref>). A possible explanation for this contrasting result between MO and shRNA probably lies between the different mode of action of these two molecules. In contrast to MOs that do not use the cellular machinery, shRNA requires the miRNA/RNAi machinery for their production as well as in target recognition and inhibition. Thus, our combined results suggest that Hyl1La might have an additional effect on biogenesis steps that are downstream to the cleavage by Dicer such as loading of small RNAs into AGO, the protein at the heart of the RISC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hutvagner and Simard, 2008</xref>). Under such a condition the shRNA-derived small RNA would be unable to load onto RISC and hence could not cleave the Hyl1La, rendering its expression unaffected. Further, in such a scenario after injection with the shRNAs, the system might reach a balance point that is very close to the normal Hyl1La levels. Alternatively, it is possible that the three shRNAs are ineffective due to lack of accessibility of the three distinct target sites on the Hyl1La transcript to the RISC loaded with the shRNA-derived small RNAs for reasons such as secondary structure or binding by other proteins that restrict the RISC accessibility. However, we find this explanation less likely because the three shRNAs target distinct parts of this relatively long transcript.</p><p>During small RNA analysis, we expectedly observed a strong reduction in miRNA expression but in parallel a mild reduction in siRNA expression was also observed in Hyl1La-depleted animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2A-B</xref>). This might be due to involvement of Hyl1La in siRNA biogenesis pathway in <italic>Nematostella</italic>. Similar observation was also reported in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> where different members of the DRB protein family, which includes HYL1, are known to be involved in biogenesis of different siRNAs and hinder their expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Curtin et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Raja et al., 2014</xref>). For example, a HYL1 (DRB1) mutant of <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> exhibits severe defects in miRNA expression but also has a partial effect on tasiRNA (a plant-specific category of siRNAs) expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Tagami et al., 2009</xref>). Further, DRB2 and DRB4 were shown to inhibit small RNA expression produced by RNA polymerase IV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Pélissier et al., 2011</xref>). In addition to miRNAs and siRNAs, an opposite trend in piRNA expression was also observed as most of the piRNAs were upregulated in Hyl1La-depleted animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2C-D</xref>). We propose this might be due to the fact that depletion of Hyl1La-dependent miRNAs provided a void in the sequencing libraries that in turn made more reads available for piRNAs.</p><p>Finally, here we report that Hyl1La plays an important role in miRNA biogenesis in <italic>Nematostella</italic>, a representative of Cnidaria which is the sister group of Bilateria. However, the functional importance of Hyl1La in <italic>Nematostella</italic> identified here raises another interesting evolutionary question of what led to the replacement of Hyl1La by other DSRM proteins like TRBP, Loqs, or PACT in bilaterian animals during evolution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Interestingly, both Loqs in flies and TRBP in mammals enable processing of some miRNA precursors into different mature miRNAs and by this significantly increase their variability and targeted sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fukunaga et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lee and Doudna, 2012</xref>). Such variability is currently unknown in plants or cnidarians. It is intriguing to consider the possibility that this ability of the bilaterian proteins to increase small RNA variability was advantageous over Hyl1-like proteins and led to the loss of the latter in bilaterian lineages.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table

Induction of spawning was performed as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Genikhovich and Technau, 2009</xref>): the mature male and female animals were induced to produce eggs and sperm by placing them in an incubator for 8 hr under constant white light and heat (25°C). After induction, the tanks were further kept at 18°C (in the culture room) for 2 hr to allow the release of egg packages and sperm. Further, the egg packages were fertilized for 30 min by placing the packages inside the male tanks. The quality of egg packages was checked under the stereomicroscope and egg packages of round shape and homogenous size were processed further for dejellying using 3% of L-cysteine in 16‰ ASW pH 7.2 (titrated with 10 M NaOH). The selected egg packages were kept in the cysteine solution for 15 min while rotated by hand. The eggs were washed using 16‰ ASW in tissue culture plates. These clean eggs (zygotes) were further used for microinjection. For microinjection 1 mM stock solutions of both MO and shRNA were prepared by dissolving them into nuclease-free water. The toxicity of MOs as well as shRNA was optimized by injecting different concentrations into the animals along with the control-injected animals. Concentrations resulting in toxicity of less than 30% of the animals (estimated morphologically in the 2 days following the injection) were considered suitable for injection.

Dicer1 TB MO was injected at the concentration of 805 µM. For all the three shRNAs, 600 ng/µl concentration was found to be suitable. Similar concentration of control MO was used for microinjection in parallel with Hyl1La MOs. In every shift, we injected 600 zygotes (300 control MO and 300 Hyl1La MO) by mixing the injected material with dextran Alexa Fluor 488 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) which was used as a fluorescent tracer while injection was carried under magnification by a TS-100F fluorescent microscope (Nikon). The injected zygotes were kept at 22°C for further growth. The morphology of the animals was observed for up to 9 days after which the number of settled and unsettled animals were counted and documented under SMZ-18 fluorescent stereomicroscope (Nikon). Animals injected with Dicer1 MO were observed and documented after 10 days. For RNA extraction microinjected zygotes were flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen after 3 days of growth and stored at –80°C until RNA extraction. All the MO and shRNA injection experiments were performed in three independent biological replicates with three distinct animals’ batches. Dicer1 MO injection was performed in one replicate to repeat an experiment with published results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Modepalli et al., 2018</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Small RNA sequencing and analysis</title><p>The RNA was isolated using Trizol (Thermo Fisher Scientific) from 3-day-old animals. Small RNA sequencing was performed for only Hyl1La SI MO1 and control MO-injected animals. The small RNA library was prepared using NEBNext Multiplex Small RNA Library Prep Illumina kit (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA, USA) with some modifications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Plotnikova et al., 2019</xref>). In brief, small RNAs were isolated (18–30 nt) from 1 µg of total RNA using 15% urea-PAGE (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA) followed by overnight precipitation using 0.3% NaCl. The size-selected small RNAs were further precipitated using ice-cold ethanol (2.5 × volume) and 1 µl of GlycoBlue (Thermo Fisher Scientific) by centrifugation at 21130 × <italic>g</italic>. The pellet was dissolved in 7.5 µl nuclease-free water and used further for adapter ligation. The ligated products were subjected to 14 cycles of PCR amplification using adapter specific primers. The PCR product was run on 2% agarose gel followed by staining with GelRed (Biotium, Fremont, CA, USA). The band size between 137 and 149 nt was selected and purified using Gel Extraction Kit (Macherey-Nagel, Düren, Germany). The quality of the purified product (sRNA-seq libraries) was checked by using TapeStation system (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA, USA). The libraries having a dominant peak at the size range of 137–149 nt were sequenced by NextSeq500 (Illumina) in single-end mode.</p><p>The small RNA data was analyzed using miRProf (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Stocks et al., 2012</xref>) with the following parameters: two mismatches allowed, minimum abundance of 1 for miRNA and 5 for piRNA and siRNA, allowed overhang and not grouping mature and star strands. For miRNA, piRNA, and siRNA analysis, we mapped the small RNA sequences after adapter removal on the relevant previously reported sets of <italic>Nematostella</italic> small RNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fridrich et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Modepalli et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Praher et al., 2017</xref>). The small RNA expression was normalized in TPM by using only the transcripts that mapped on the reference genome. For read length distribution and scattered plot we used the average of expression obtained from the three biological replicates. For mapping onto the genome and miRNA precursor for identification of aberrant processing of miRNA, miRDeep2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Friedländer et al., 2012</xref>) was used.</p><p>Meta-analysis was performed to compare the pattern of miRNA expression following the knockdown of miRNA biogenesis components.

Filtered reads were mapped to the <italic>Nematostella</italic> genome using Bowtie (v1.3.1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Langmead et al., 2009</xref>) and miRNA loci quantified using featureCounts (v2.0.0)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Liao et al., 2014</xref>) from previously characterized coordinates. Due to differences in developmental stages and library preparation, reads were normalized between morphants and their respective control samples.

Three precursors from three different regions were further chosen, all having GC content of more than 35%. Further, we also added to the sequence a T7 promotor and three different mismatches at nucleotide positions 10, 13, and 16 to create bulges in the precursors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A–C</xref>). All these modified precursors were reverse complemented and synthesized at the DNA level by Integrated DNA Technologies, Inc (IDT, Coralville, IA, USA). The DNA templates and reverse primer were mixed (1:1) and denatured at 98 °C for 5 min and cooled to 24 °C. Further, this mixture was mixed with the components of AmpliScribe T7-Flash Transcription Kit (Lucigen, Middleton, WI, USA) and incubated for 8 hr at room temperature. The in vitro transcribed product was further purified using Quick-RNA Miniprep (Zymo Research, Irvine, CA, USA). The quality and size of the precursor was checked on agarose gel and its concentration was measured using Qubit RNA BR (Broad Range) Assay Kit with the Qubit Fluorometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific).

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, including Rene F Ketting as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Detlef Weigel as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) As pre-discussed, a strengthening of the claim that Hyl1La specifically binds miRNA precursors is needed. If a CLIP experiment is not feasible, a qPCR approach testing more miRNA precursors, but more importantly, non-related transcripts would also be acceptable. We would see testing of 10-12 mRNAs, 10-12 structured RNAs (for instance tRNAs) and a similar number of additional miRNA precursors as an appropriate alternative.</p><p>2) The small RNA analysis needs to be extended to also include piRNAs and siRNAs.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>This work addresses the function of a Hyl1 homolog of Nematostella in miRNA production. Hyl1 is a protein that was identified in plants, where it stimulates the processing of miRNAs. In animals, Hyl1 is not found, and other RNA binding proteins are in place to help processing of miRNAs by Drosha and Dicer. Linking Hyl1 in Nematostella to miRNA production would support the idea that in the last common ancestor of plants and animals a miRNA-like processing was in place. This contrasts the dominating view that plant and animal miRNA pathways have convergently evolved and would justify a revised view on how plant and animal miRNA pathways have evolved.</p><p>To test this, Hyl1La (the Nematostella Hyl1) was knocked down with morpholino oligos (MOs), and the resulting animals were probed for developmental defects and miRNA production. In both defects were observed. Animal development was delayed, and miRNA production dropped. Using RNA-IP-qPCR experiments the authors also address whether Hyl1La binds primary miRNAs or pre-miRNAs, two different maturation steps in the animal miRNA processing pathway. While pri-miRNAs were hardly detected in the IPs, pre-miRNAs were enriched, indicating that Hyl1La binds the intermediate miRNA processing stage, in between Drosha and Dicer cleavages.</p><p>The authors also attempt knock-down of Hyl1La by shRNAs but were not successful. This lack of success is hypothesized to relate to a potential role of Hyl1La in shRNA function.</p><p>The paper is rather short, but it makes the point that Hyl1La is needed for miRNA production, and as such brings an important piece of data to the discussion on miRNA pathway evolution in plants and animals. Nematostella is also not a model in which extensive manipulations of gene function are easily done, limiting what the authors can realistically do.</p><p>Parts of the paper are, however, not completely clear and in one case not consistent with the data that is shown:</p><p>– In Figure 3-supplement 1 two additional MOs are tested for knock-down. In the text a translation blocking MO is mentioned (TB) but this does not appear in this figure. It is also not clear if the same control MO is used for this figure compared to Figure 3. And finally, the text states that in this experiment mir-2026-5p was consistent down regulated, but MO1 does not show a significant effect in the figure.</p><p>– The authors do not discuss the miRNAs that are not affected.</p><p>– The authors mention that Hyl1 in plants is required for accuracy (page 4), but later (page 5) they write &quot;The analysis (of Hyl1La, red) did not reveal any aberrant processing. These results further suggested that like its homolog in plants, Hyl1La in Nematostella…//…is not involved in size selection.&quot; These statements appear to be contradictory, assuming that with 'accuracy' miRNA processing sites are implied. This issue also surfaces in the discussion.</p><p>Finally, the developmental defects are not linked to miRNA defects directly, but they do phenocopy knock-down phenotypes of other miRNA pathway components, such as Dicer.</p><p>In order to see the similarity of the MO knockdown of Hyl1La it would be good to do a knockdown of Dicer in parallel and compare the phenotypes. Also, the phenotypes shown are at a very zoomed-out level, and some more detail, or more informative images would be helpful.</p><p>Please include scale bars for all the imaging.</p><p>More importantly, the authors propose a role for binding pre-miRNA, and it would be good to substantiate that more.</p><p>One thing that could be interesting, and should be relatively straight forward, is to look at the subcellular localization of Hyl1La. One would expect a cytoplasmic localization if it acts with Dicer.</p><p>Maybe cytoplasmic lysate can process pre-miRNAs, and this may be impaired in extracts from knock-down animals. This depends on whether this is feasible in terms of amount of material; I cannot judge that, but I can see that may be difficult.</p><p>Third, a Northern blot may help to detect accumulating pre-miRNAs in the knock-down animals (with Dicer knockdown as a control).</p><p>In the discussion the authors dedicate a paragraph to basically a failed experiment: the shRNA knockdown. The model behind that discussion is interesting, but should be tested in my opinion: are the established shRNA knockdowns (that are cited) affected by MO knockdown of Dicer (positive control) and Hyl1La?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>The authors aimed to dissect the miRNA-processing capacity of Nv Hyl1La. The strength of the study is based on the observed developmental defects accompanied by molecular data upon Hyl1La KO. Information about the miRNA target genes that are affected by the Hyl1La-KO are missing as well as biochemical properties of Hyl1La. Working with non-traditional model organisms is challenging but provide a powerful resource for identifying new molecular pathways or revise current perceptions of regulatory mechanisms (i.e., miRNA processing). Cnidaria resemble plant-like miRNA-processing propensities, which have been eluted to in previous studies of the group.</p><p>Strength:</p><p>– Description of organismal defects upon Hyl1La depletion.</p><p>– Successful Hyl1La knockdown by using morpholinos but not shRNAs.</p><p>– sRNAseq on Hyl1La knockdown (vs. wild-type).</p><p>– Mechanistic information about Hyl1La’s miRNA processing capacity showing that Hyl1La processes pre- but not pri-miRNA (using RIP on FLAG-tagged Hyl1La followed by RT-qPCR)</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>– What are the expression levels of Hyl1Lb upon Hyl1La KD? The authors state that Hyl1Lb is cell-type specifically expressed, which suggests that the role of Hyl1Lb is negligible in this context. That can be easily checked by qPCR using gene-specific primers and would confirm that there are no compensatory effects (e.g., an unexpected gene activation of Hyl1Lb upon Hyl1La KD).</p><p>– Missing explanation why only a few miRNAs were detectable in Nv by using sRNAseq. Is this a technical (e.g., low input material, missing step to demethylate 3'ends of Nv sRNAs) or biological (e.g., primitive miRNA machinery with only a few genes that would give rise to miRNAs) issue?</p><p>– More comprehensive analysis of the sRNAseq data is required. Information is missing regarding the RNA type to which the entire sRNA population maps. That would explain the shift of sRNA population from 22nt to 28-30nt (Figure 3A) and also why some sRNAs remain unaffected by the Hyl1La-KD (Figure 3B – those on the regression line), e.g. these larger sRNAs could be tRNA or rRNA fragments that are processed in a Hyl1La-independent manner.</p><p>– Statements about the comparisons regarding plant HYL1 processing needs to be corrected. E.g. Wu et al. 2007 (doi.org/10.1105/tpc.106.048637) stated that AtHYL1 is involved in pre-miRNA processing.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>– A summary of what the authors were trying to achieve.</p><p>In this manuscript the authors attempt to understand the function of a protein, HYL1, in nematostella. This protein is interesting because HYL1 is known to be involved in miRNA biogenesis in plants, but is absent from most animals (and all bilatarians). The authors wanted to know whether it was involved in miRNA biogenesis in nematostella, as this would shed important light on the evolution of miRNA biogenesis. They investigate the phenotypic consequences of gene knockdown and then attempt to link these to changes in the small RNA profile, and on the basis of their findings argue for a role for HYL1 in miRNA biogenesis in nematostella.</p><p>– An account of the major strengths and weaknesses of the methods and results.</p><p>The authors use knockdown to reduce HYL1 and show that there is an embryonic lethality phenotype. This suggests importance of the protein in development. These experiments are done with several different knockdown methods, thus meaning that off-target effects are unlikely. Nevertheless, these experiments would be cleaner with deletion of the gene, which presumably is not possible currently in this organism.</p><p>The embryonic lethality phenotype is clearly in favour of an important role for this protein. However, it precludes the authors' examining potential functions for HYL1 in adult physiology, which would be interesting and would also be helpful in demonstrating that the role of HYL1 in miRNA biogenesis is direct.</p><p>The authors use small RNA sequencing to investigate whether small RNAs are perturbed.</p><p>They focus on miRNAs and show that there is a reduction in miRNA levels. This is convincing. However, the authors do not (i) link this to changes in gene expression which might be potentially responsible for the developmental phenotype. (ii) make any analysis of other types of small RNAs.</p><p>I would argue that both points are important for the authors' case that HYL1 is a miRNA processing factor that was present in the last eukaryotic common ancestor. It may be that HYL1 is a general DCR partner protein in nematostella and has thus evolved its function in miRNA biogenesis convergently. Furthermore, crucially, the strong developmental phenotype means that changes in miRNAs are possibly secondary to a different function, for example general RNA binding (see below) or a function in endogenous siRNA biogenesis separate from miRNA biogenesis.</p><p>The authors experiments that demonstrate binding of the HYL1 to pre-miRNA are useful in that they show HYL1 binds to its hypothesized substrate on the basis of extrapolation from Arabidopsis. However, the authors do not rule out the possibility that HYL1 is a generalized RNA binding protein- this could be tested by some kind of CLIP-seq experiment to assess in an unbiased way the RNA that HYL1 binds to.</p><p>– An appraisal of whether the authors achieved their aims, and whether the results support their conclusions.</p><p>The authors have certainly demonstrated that miRNAs are affected when HYL1 is removed, but they have not unambiguously determined that HYL1 is directly involved in miRNA processing. Additionally, they have not linked the developmental phenotype to the miRNA processing defects, which means that there is a possibility that the miRNA affects are secondary to another effect of HYL1 on development that alters the miRNA profile profoundly (as many strong developmental perturbations are likely to do).</p><p>– A discussion of the likely impact of the work on the field, and the utility of the methods and data to the community.</p><p>The demonstration that HYL1 in nematostella is a genuine and specific miRNA processing factor would be really important in redefining how we think of miRNA evolution. It would also be a really striking example of how many mechanisms present in the common ancestor of eukaryotes have been lost in many different lineages. It would therefore be worth this study going a little further to demonstrate that the processing function is direct and specific for miRNAs.</p><p>1) Direct demonstration that HYL1 processes miRNAs.</p><p>I think that this would be a really important aspect to try to improve in the current manuscript and have two possible suggested experiments:</p><p>i) If, instead of knocking down early in development leading to lethality, the authors could introduce knockdown morpholinos later, it might be possible to circumvent the lethality as the developmental problems will be avoided. Then the authors could examine miRNA precursors and mature miRNAs by deep sequencing in organisms over a timecourse of knockdown and potentially without such severe phenotypic effects. They could then be more confident that the influence of HYL1 on miRNA levels is direct.</p><p>I appreciate that this may not be technically possible- I am not familiar with the experimental system.</p><p>ii) CIPseq against HYL1 to assess in an unbiased way the RNAs that bind- present experiments used qPCR to test presence of miRNA precursors in the IP but this does not rule out the possibility that HYL1 is a general RNA binding protein- there may be other targets that are not directly investigated. Since the authors have already got IP-qPCR to work this should be relatively straightforward to implement. However, the authors should of course not use standard small RNA library preparations from IP RNA because the species will be too long- they should simply use everything and send for a traditional non-polyA total RNAseq. A mock IP without the anti-HYL1 antibody would be important as a control to assess enrichment. This experiment would be a tremendous addition to the paper.</p><p>2) A clear link between miRNA dysfunction and developmental phenotype.</p><p>This would be a complementary way to try to demonstrate that the effect of HYL1 knockdown on development is through miRNAs. If the authors perform RNAseq over a timecourse of normal and HYL1 knockdown development, they could compare the two to find genes that are differentially expressed. These genes might be miRNA targets, and this could be associated using bioinformatic analysis to test whether the changes are consistent with the alterations in miRNAs observed upon HYL1 knockdown.</p><p>3) Another important thing to look at is to examine whether endogenous small RNAs are affected by the knockdown. The authors' model that this is a specific miRNA processing factor would indicate that other classes of small RNAs, including piRNAs and endosiRNAs, will be unaffected or minimally affected. The authors have already generated small RNA sequencing data so this would be straightforward to test.</p><p>– Recommendations for improving the writing and presentation.</p><p>I'm not sure that the authors should make the bold claim of common evolutionary history of plant and animal miRNA biogenesis in the introduction and abstract. I fully agree that this is an exciting implication, but the paper so far has not demonstrated this- if they were to do some of the experiments above perhaps this would be justified but otherwise it should be placed in the discussion but not elsewhere.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.69464.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) As pre-discussed, a strengthening of the claim that Hyl1La specifically binds miRNA precursors is needed.

We understand that this might look like a limited response in light of the reviewers' request for 10-12 miRNA precursors; unfortunately, due to low levels of expression of most miRNAs at the planula life stage in combination with low RNA amounts in immunoprecipitation samples and predicted precursor sequences, we managed to amplify at reasonable levels (i.e., Ct value in the accepted range) only three additional miRNA precursors. miR-2030 and miR-2035-1 show significantly higher expression in Hyl1La immunoprecipitated samples compared to IgG control. In contrast, miR-2029 does not show a significant difference. This can be explained by the expression of miR-2029 in Hyl1La depleted animals that suggests it might not be dependent on Hyl1La for its biogenesis. This notion is further supported by previous results from our lab suggest that miR-2029 responds differently compared to other miRNAs to Dicer1 knockdown in <italic>Nematostella</italic> (Modepalli et al., 2018, PLOS Genet., 14(8): e1007590), which could point to difference in its biogenesis pathway.</p><p>In addition to the three miRNA precursors we managed to test, we attempted to amplify miR-2028, miR-2040b, miR-100 and miR-9414 but were unsuccessful.</p><p>We also added RNA sequencing information from immunoprecipitated samples that shows no enrichment for rRNA, mRNA ncRNA and repeat elements in the anti-FLAG samples compared to the IgG control samples (Figure 5 —figure supplement 4A). These results further support the specificity of Hyl1La to miRNA precursors. Unfortunately, due to size distribution limitations of the kit at the heart of this method (SoLo by Tecan; selected for its suitability for ultra-low starting material) it could not cover pre-miRNAs (Figure 5 —figure supplement 4B).</p><p>In an additional experiment, we show specific binding of Hyl1La to pre-miRNA by in vitro binding assay (Figure 6). We used miR-2022 backbone to generate a synthetic pre-miRNA that mimics with high similarity the structure of an endogenous pre-miRNA. The targeted sequence was altered to not match any <italic>Nematostella</italic> genes but mCherry sequence instead. As negative control we used a shuffled version of the synthetic pre-miRNA that does not generate a hairpin secondary structure. Both pre-miRNAs were biotinylated at their 3' end and incubated with lysate containing the Hyl1La-FLAG tagged protein that was over-expressed in injected animals. Pull-down with streptavidin beads followed by Western blot revealed that Hyl1La binds the pre-miRNA hairpin with significantly higher efficiency than the shuffled sequence (Figure 6 C-D), hence supporting the previous results that Hyl1La binds pre-miRNAs in <italic>Nematostella</italic> in a specific manner.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The small RNA analysis needs to be extended to also include piRNAs and siRNAs.</p></disp-quote><p>We extended that small RNA analysis to include piRNAs and siRNAs (Figure3 —figure supplement 2). We observed a mild downregulation of siRNAs with 9% of the siRNAs downregulated more than two-fold in HYL1La MO injected animals. piRNAs showed upregulation in Hyl1La depleted animals with 36% of piRNAs upregulated more than two-fold. The effect of Hyl1La depletion on siRNAs could be explained by the involvement of Hyl1La in the siRNA biogenesis pathway in <italic>Nematostella</italic>. Similar effects of double-stranded RNA binding proteins knockdown on siRNAs levels were reported in <italic>Arabidopsi</italic>s (Curtin et al., 2008, FEBS Letters, 582(18): 2753-60; Raja et al., 2014, Journal of Virology, 88(5): 2611-22). Regarding the upregulation of piRNAs, that could be a result of a sequencing void caused by the depletion of miRNAs and siRNAs, which left more space for piRNAs clustering and representation in the libraries.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>This work addresses the function of a Hyl1 homolog of Nematostella in miRNA production.

This issue also surfaces in the discussion.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the comment. We edited the text in lines 133-135 and added a reference (Szarzynska et al., 2009, Nucleic Acids Res. 37(9)) to emphasize that miRNAs in plants mostly show downregulation following Hyl1 knockdown and only a few of them show aberrant processing.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Finally, the developmental defects are not linked to miRNA defects directly, but they do phenocopy knock-down phenotypes of other miRNA pathway components, such as Dicer.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer and believe we conveyed this idea in the text (lines 123-125).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In order to see the similarity of the MO knockdown of Hyl1La it would be good to do a knockdown of Dicer in parallel and compare the phenotypes. Also, the phenotypes shown are at a very zoomed-out level, and some more detail, or more informative images would be helpful.</p></disp-quote><p>Following the reviewer's request, we performed knockdown of Dicer1 via Morpholino microinjection and documented the phenotype at 10 days post injection. The microscopy pictures were added to Figure 2. The observed phenotype is similar to what is seen in Hyl1La depleted animals, which do not undergo metamorphosis. In addition, the phenotype is similar to previous knockdown experiments of Dicer1 that were performed by our lab members and previously published (Modepalli et al., 2018, PLOS Genet. 14(8): e1007590).</p><p>Moreover, we added a principal component analysis (PCA) describing a meta-analysis comparing the knockdown effect of other miRNA biogenesis components on miRNA profiles (Figure 2G). We show that Hyl1La morphants cluster with Dicer1 and HEN1 morphants, suggesting they have a similar effect on a similar subset of miRNAs. In accordance with this result, AGO1 and AGO2 morphants are the most distant from the other components, which is consistent with their function in loading instead of processing miRNAs. The results from this analysis further support the role of Hyl1La in miRNA biogenesis in a similar manner to Dicer1 and HEN1. Sequencing data from the different knockdown experiments were taken from Modepalli et al., 2018, PLOS Genetics 14(8): e1007590 and Fridrich et al., 2020, Nature Communications, 11(1), 1-12. Notably, the clustering occurs despite the fact the libraries in the different studies were generated with different kits and protocols.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Please include scale bars for all the imaging.</p></disp-quote><p>Scale bars were added.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>More importantly, the authors propose a role for binding pre-miRNA, and it would be good to substantiate that more.</p><p>One thing that could be interesting, and should be relatively straight forward, is to look at the subcellular localization of Hyl1La.

Please see above our reply to essential revisions section 1. Looking at the subcellular localization is an interesting idea, however, use of this method is currently unavailable in <italic>Nematostella</italic> and we believe that it is beyond the scope of this paper.

The model behind that discussion is interesting, but should be tested in my opinion: are the established shRNA knockdowns (that are cited) affected by MO knockdown of Dicer (positive control) and Hyl1La?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the suggestion. Unfortunately, such an experiment would be difficult to perform. First, Dicer and Hyl1La are both maternally deposited in <italic>Nematostella</italic>. Second, MO injection might trigger immune response as was shown for several bilaterian species such as fish and frogs and this might increase Argonaute activity.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>The authors aimed to dissect the miRNA-processing capacity of Nv Hyl1La. The strength of the study is based on the observed developmental defects accompanied by molecular data upon Hyl1La KO. Information about the miRNA target genes that are affected by the Hyl1La-KO are missing as well as biochemical properties of Hyl1La. Working with non-traditional model organisms is challenging but provide a powerful resource for identifying new molecular pathways or revise current perceptions of regulatory mechanisms (i.e., miRNA processing). Cnidaria resemble plant-like miRNA-processing propensities, which have been eluted to in previous studies of the group.</p><p>Strength:</p><p>– Description of organismal defects upon Hyl1La depletion.</p><p>– Successful Hyl1La knockdown by using morpholinos but not shRNAs.</p><p>– sRNAseq on Hyl1La knockdown (vs. wild-type).</p><p>– Mechanistic information about Hyl1La’s miRNA processing capacity showing that Hyl1La processes pre- but not pri-miRNA (using RIP on FLAG-tagged Hyl1La followed by RT-qPCR)</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>– What are the expression levels of Hyl1Lb upon Hyl1La KD? The authors state that Hyl1Lb is cell-type specifically expressed, which suggests that the role of Hyl1Lb is negligible in this context. That can be easily checked by qPCR using gene-specific primers and would confirm that there are no compensatory effects (e.g., an unexpected gene activation of Hyl1Lb upon Hyl1La KD).</p></disp-quote><p>Hyl1Lb is expressed in nematocytes and not throughout the planulae like Hyl1La (Moran et al., 2013, Molecular Biology and Evolution, 30(12): 2541-52). Hence, we believe it is not relevant to test for compensatory effect by it. In addition, since we confirmed through sequencing that most miRNA levels are significantly decreased upon Hyl1La knockdown, it is most likely that there is no compensation by Hyl1Lb for the depletion of Hyl1La.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Missing explanation why only a few miRNAs were detectable in Nv by using sRNAseq. Is this a technical (e.g., low input material, missing step to demethylate 3'ends of Nv sRNAs) or biological (e.g., primitive miRNA machinery with only a few genes that would give rise to miRNAs) issue?</p></disp-quote><p>The topic of miRNA expression in the early stages of <italic>Nematostella</italic> life cycle has been thoroughly studied before (Grimson et al., 2008, Nature 455: 1193–1197; Moran et al., 2014, Genome Research, 24(4): 651-663; Modepalli et al., 2018, PLOS Genetics 14(8): e1007590). miRNA expression is difficult to identify without first performing Ago immunoprecipitation (Fridrich et al., 2020, Nature communications, 11(1): 1-12), while the class of piRNAs is very abundant. In addition, the miRNAs that are expressed at this stage are at low levels (Moran et al., 2014, Genome Research, 24(4): 651-663; Modepalli et al., 2018, PLOS Genetics 14(8): e1007590).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– More comprehensive analysis of the sRNAseq data is required. Information is missing regarding the RNA type to which the entire sRNA population maps. That would explain the shift of sRNA population from 22nt to 28-30nt (Figure 3A) and also why some sRNAs remain unaffected by the Hyl1La-KD (Figure 3B – those on the regression line), e.g. these larger sRNAs could be tRNA or rRNA fragments that are processed in a Hyl1La-independent manner.</p></disp-quote><p>Following the reviewer's comment, we added analysis of piRNAs (28-30 nt), which is described in section 2 of the essential revisions. piRNAs are highly abundant in <italic>Nematostella</italic> and can be found in somatic cells in early developmental stages (Praher et al., 2017, RNA Biology, 14(12): 1727-1741). Regarding unaffected sRNAs, as mentioned in section 1 of our reply to the essential revisions and in the paper, some miRNAs such as miR-2029 might be Dicer1- and Hyl1La-independent in their biogenesis process.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Statements about the comparisons regarding plant HYL1 processing needs to be corrected. E.g. Wu et al. 2007 (doi.org/10.1105/tpc.106.048637) stated that AtHYL1 is involved in pre-miRNA processing.</p></disp-quote><p>We are not sure we understand what the reviewer means exactly in their comment. We do not imply in the paper that AtHYL1 is not involved in the processing of pre-miRNAs. To the best of our knowledge, HYL1 in plants is involved both in cropping of pri-miRNAs and dicing of pre-miRNAs. We made sure again that this is the message we deliver in our manuscript, and we added the reference mentioned by the reviewer.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>[…]</p><p>1) Direct demonstration that HYL1 processes miRNAs.</p><p>I think that this would be a really important aspect to try to improve in the current manuscript and have two possible suggested experiments:</p><p>i) If, instead of knocking down early in development leading to lethality, the authors could introduce knockdown morpholinos later, it might be possible to circumvent the lethality as the developmental problems will be avoided. Then the authors could examine miRNA precursors and mature miRNAs by deep sequencing in organisms over a timecourse of knockdown and potentially without such severe phenotypic effects. They could then be more confident that the influence of HYL1 on miRNA levels is direct.</p><p>I appreciate that this may not be technically possible- I am not familiar with the experimental system.</p><p>ii) CIPseq against HYL1 to assess in an unbiased way the RNAs that bind- present experiments used qPCR to test presence of miRNA precursors in the IP but this does not rule out the possibility that HYL1 is a general RNA binding protein- there may be other targets that are not directly investigated. Since the authors have already got IP-qPCR to work this should be relatively straightforward to implement. However, the authors should of course not use standard small RNA library preparations from IP RNA because the species will be too long- they should simply use everything and send for a traditional non-polyA total RNAseq. A mock IP without the anti-HYL1 antibody would be important as a control to assess enrichment. This experiment would be a tremendous addition to the paper.</p></disp-quote><p>We understand the reviewer's request for a direct demonstration that Hyl1La processes miRNAs. We added sequencing results from Hyl1La IP samples that show no enrichment for other RNA molecules (Figure 5 – supplement 4) (see reply to essential revisions section 1). We also conducted an in vitro binding assay to show Hyl1La specific binding to pre-miRNA structures (Figure 6). In addition, our meta-analysis of miRNA profiles following knockdown of other miRNA biogenesis components shows clustering of Hyl1La morphants with Dicer1 and HEN1, which suggests they are involved in miRNA biogenesis in a similar manner. Together with our previous results and the new qPCR results for additional miRNAs we believe that we have a set of findings that support the notion that Hyl1La is involved in miRNA biogenesis in <italic>Nematostella</italic>. Regarding the suggestion to perform Hyl1La knockdown in adults, unfortunately it is currently technically impossible in <italic>Nematostella</italic> as there is no efficient method of delivery into adult <italic>Nematostella</italic> tissues.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) A clear link between miRNA dysfunction and developmental phenotype.</p><p>This would be a complementary way to try to demonstrate that the effect of HYL1 knockdown on development is through miRNAs. If the authors perform RNAseq over a timecourse of normal and HYL1 knockdown development, they could compare the two to find genes that are differentially expressed. These genes might be miRNA targets, and this could be associated using bioinformatic analysis to test whether the changes are consistent with the alterations in miRNAs observed upon HYL1 knockdown.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the comment. In previous publications we show that we tried to test the expression of miRNA targets following Argonaute knockdowns and got a complex picture (Fridrich et al., 2020, Nature communications, 11(1): 1-12). In that set of experiments targets did not show expected behavior and other genes were affected. Notably, this is likely due to the fact that some miRNA targets in <italic>Nematostella</italic> are transcription factors such as Hox D and Six3/6 which were shown to play pivotal roles in <italic>Nematostella</italic> development (He et al. 2018 Science 361(6409): 1377-1380 Sinigaglia et al. 2013 PLOS Biology 11(2):e1001488.), hence regulating a complex network of downstream developmental effects. Therefore, the picture we get with such an experiment is not clear enough to show the direct effect of miRNA depletion on their targets. In addition, an experiment such as described will require enormous amounts of work we believe it is beyond the scope of this paper.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Another important thing to look at is to examine whether endogenous small RNAs are affected by the knockdown. The authors' model that this is a specific miRNA processing factor would indicate that other classes of small RNAs, including piRNAs and endosiRNAs, will be unaffected or minimally affected. The authors have already generated small RNA sequencing data so this would be straightforward to test.</p></disp-quote><p>Following this request, we extended the small RNA analysis to include piRNAs and siRNAs (please see reply to essential revisions section 2)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Recommendations for improving the writing and presentation.</p><p>I'm not sure that the authors should make the bold claim of common evolutionary history of plant and animal miRNA biogenesis in the introduction and abstract. I fully agree that this is an exciting implication, but the paper so far has not demonstrated this- if they were to do some of the experiments above perhaps this would be justified but otherwise it should be placed in the discussion but not elsewhere.</p></disp-quote><p>After carefully comparing our claims to the claims made by others in the miRNA field promoting the opposite view and the available evidence they use, we respectfully disagree regarding this point made by the reviewer. We believe that we are cautious enough in our claims about the homology and role of Hyl1La in <italic>Nematostella</italic> and that the presentation of our study is balanced in its current form.</p></body></sub-article></article>
