Patients with the same apparent form of thrombocytopenia may respond differently to the treatment. We describe a miniaturized bone marrow tissue model that provides a screening bioreactor for personalized, pre-treatment response prediction to Eltrombopag for individual patients. Using silk fibroin, a 3D bone marrow niche was developed that reproduces platelet biogenesis. Hematopoietic progenitors were isolated from a small amount of peripheral blood of patients with mutations in <italic>ANKRD26</italic> and <italic>MYH9</italic> genes, who had previously received Eltrombopag. The ex vivo response was strongly correlated with the in vivo platelet response. Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells (iPSCs) from one patient with mutated <italic>MYH9</italic> differentiated into functional megakaryocytes that responded to Eltrombopag. Combining patient-derived cells and iPSCs with the 3D bone marrow model technology allows having a reproducible system for studying drug mechanisms and for individualized, pre-treatment selection of effective therapy in Inherited Thrombocytopenias.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Platelets are tiny cell fragments essential for blood to clot. They are created and released into the bloodstream by megakaryocytes, giant cells that live in the bone marrow. In certain genetic diseases, such as Inherited Thrombocytopenia, the bone marrow fails to produce enough platelets: this leaves patients extremely susceptible to bruising, bleeding, and poor clotting after an injury or surgery.</p><p>Certain patients with Inherited Thrombocytopenia respond well to treatments designed to boost platelet production, but others do not. Why these differences exist could be investigated by designing new test systems that recreate the form and function of bone marrow in the laboratory. However, it is challenging to build the complex and poorly understood bone marrow environment outside of the body.</p><p>Here, Di Buduo et al. have developed an artificial three-dimensional miniature organ bioreactor system that recreates the key features of bone marrow. In this system, megakaryocytes were grown from patient blood samples, and hooked up to a tissue scaffold made of silk. The cells were able to grow as if they were in their normal environment, and they could shed platelets into an artificial bloodstream. After treating megakaryocytes with drugs to stimulate platelet production, Di Buduo et al. found that the number of platelets recovered from the bioreactor could accurately predict which patients would respond to these drugs in the clinic.</p><p>This new test system enables researchers to predict how a patient will respond to treatment, and to tailor therapy options to each individual. This technology could also be used to test new drugs for Inherited Thrombocytopenias and other blood-related diseases; if scaled-up, it could also, one day, generate large quantities of lab-grown blood cells for transfusion.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>bone marrow</kwd><kwd>silk</kwd><kwd>Inherited Thrombocytopenia</kwd><kwd>megakaryocyte</kwd><kwd>Induced Pluripotent Stem Cell</kwd><kwd>thrombopoietin</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000780</institution-id><institution>European Commission</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>H2020-FETOPEN-1-2016-2017-SilkFusion ID 767309</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Balduini</surname><given-names>Alessandra</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 EB016041-02</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Balduini</surname><given-names>Alessandra</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002803</institution-id><institution>Fondazione Cariplo</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2017-0920</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Di Buduo</surname><given-names>Christian A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002426</institution-id><institution>Fondazione Telethon</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GGP17106</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Pecci</surname><given-names>Alessandro</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A 3D bone marrow niche that reproduces megakaryocyte differentiation and ex vivo platelet production from hematopoietic progenitors and iPSCs of thrombocytopenic patients predicts individual response to Eltrombopag accurately.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Bone marrow megakaryocytes are responsible for the continuous production of platelets in the blood, driven by Thrombopoietin (TPO) through interaction with its receptor MPL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hitchcock and Kaushansky, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kaushansky, 2015</xref>). In vivo, megakaryocytes associate with bone marrow microvasculature, where they extend proplatelets that protrude through the vascular endothelium into the lumen and release platelets into the bloodstream (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Ito et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Junt et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>Countless human pathologies result in alterations in platelet production; yet, for many of these, pathogenesis, and thus optimal targeted therapies, remain unknown. Inherited Thrombocytopenias are a diverse group of disorders characterized by low platelet count, resulting in impaired hemostasis. While often stable, patients can experience hemorrhages and/or excessive bleeding provoked by hemostatic events such as trauma or surgery; in some cases, hemorrhages appear spontaneously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Balduini et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Balduini et al., 2017</xref>). The treatment of Inherited Thrombocytopenias is still unsatisfactory. For patients affected with the severe forms, which are usually fatal at young ages, the treatment of choice is hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Balduini et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Locatelli et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Notarangelo et al., 2008</xref>). However, for most patients with Inherited Thrombocytopenias, transplantation is not recommended as the risks outweigh the benefits. The standard treatment protocols for these subjects were platelet transfusions to stop or prevent bleeding following trauma or during invasive procedures, anti-fibrinolytic agents, recombinant factor VIIa (rVIIa), or local treatment. A significant advance in the treatment of thrombocytopenias is the use of drugs that stimulate platelet production by mimicking the effects of TPO. The TPO-receptor agonists Eltrombopag, Romiplostim, and very recently Avatrombopag, have been approved for the treatment of several forms of acquired thrombocytopenia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bussel, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cheng, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Erickson-Miller et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kuter, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Santini and Fenaux, 2015</xref>). TPO-receptor agonists were first explored in Inherited Thrombocytopenias in 2010 in a phase 2 trial of Eltrombopag in 12 patients with Myosin Heavy Chain 9 (MYH9) mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Pecci et al., 2010</xref>). In 2015, Eltrombopag was tested in eight patients with Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome with platelet increases primarily in the X-Linked Thrombocytopenia (XLT) patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gerrits et al., 2015</xref>). More recently, a follow on phase 2 trial showed that Eltrombopag was safe and effective in increasing platelet count and reducing bleeding symptoms in patients with different forms of Inherited Thrombocytopenia, including <italic>MYH9</italic>-Related Diseases (<italic>MYH9</italic>-RD), <italic>Ankyrin Repeat Domain 26</italic>-Related Thrombocytopenia (<italic>ANKRD26</italic>-RT), XLT/Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome, monoallelic Bernard-Soulier syndrome and <italic>Integrin beta 3</italic> (<italic>ITGB3</italic>)-Related Thrombocytopenia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Zaninetti et al., 2020</xref>). Further, elective surgeries in <italic>MYH9</italic>-RD patients with severe thrombocytopenia have been performed safely after administration of Eltrombopag (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Zaninetti et al., 2019</xref>). Overall, these studies indicated that a sizeable proportion of patients with Inherited Thrombocytopenia respond to Eltrombopag, but that the extent of platelet response is highly variable not only among different forms of Inherited Thrombocytopenia but also among different patients affected by the same disease.</p><p>Tools that recapitulate the function of specific tissues or organs are critical to test drug efficacy, reduce ineffective or suboptimal therapies, and personalize the choice of the best treatment for each specific patient as exemplified by organoids. Reproduction of the bone marrow has been very difficult because of its incompletely understood complexity. Current research is focused on duplicating characteristic features of the physiologic bone marrow microenvironment ex vivo using relevant biomaterials and bioreactors, along with appropriate human cell sources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chou et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Di Buduo et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Di Buduo et al., 2021</xref>). Silk is a naturally derived protein biomaterial with utility for studying platelet production since its fundamental features include non-thrombogenicity, low-immunogenicity, and non-toxicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Abbonante et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Di Buduo et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Di Buduo et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Omenetto and Kaplan, 2010</xref>). A combination of modular flow chambers and vascular silk tubes and sponges was used to record platelet generation by primary human megakaryocytes, in response to variations in surface stiffness, functionalization with extracellular matrix components, and co-culture with endothelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Di Buduo et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Di Buduo et al., 2015</xref>). These systems were able to support efficient platelet formation and, upon perfusion, recovery of functional platelets, as assessed through multiple activation tests, including participation in clot formation and thrombus formation under flow conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Di Buduo et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Di Buduo et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>We developed an ex vivo miniaturized 3D bone marrow tissue model that recapitulates ex vivo platelet biogenesis of patients with different forms of Inherited Thrombocytopenias. This device is a radical improvement of the previous model because it minimizes the number of cultured cells required in an unlimited number of simultaneous culture chambers. The results, starting from only 15 mL of peripheral blood, showed that the ex vivo tissue model could predict the in vivo clinical platelet response to Eltrombopag in individual patients. The number of platelets recovered in the ex vivo model under standardized conditions, including exposure to Eltrombopag, was significantly correlated with the increase in platelet count observed in vivo after Eltrombopag treatment in the same patients. Overall, our data suggest this tissue model will have substantial applicability for the evaluation of the effects of compounds to determine their impact on platelet production.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Device design and prototyping</title><p>In adults, hematopoietic bone marrow is located in the medullary cavity of flat and long bones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Travlos, 2006</xref>), served by blood vessels that branch out into millions of small thin-walled arterioles and sinusoids allowing mature blood cells to enter the bloodstream (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).

A 2 days production process allowed us to obtain a sterile 3D silk-fibronectin scaffold that could be stored in water, at 4°C, up to 1 month after preparation and used upon experimental needs.

However, platelet concentrates are not indicated for the prevention of hemorrhages in chronically thrombocytopenic patients for many reasons: they lose efficacy due to alloimmunization, acute reactions may occur, and transmission of infectious diseases is possible. Thus, platelet transfusions are not chronically administered to patients with Inherited Thrombocytopenia unless their platelet count is extremely low, and their risk of bleeding is relatively high. There is a need for alternative agents or approaches that could increase platelet count in these and chronic thrombocytopenic conditions.</p><p>TPO-receptor agonists stimulate megakaryopoiesis and platelet production. Eltrombopag and/or Romiplostim and/or Avatrombopag are currently approved for the treatment of primary immune thrombocytopenia at various stages of ITP in adults and children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bussel, 2009</xref>), thrombocytopenia related to liver disease if a procedure is needed, and severe acquired aplastic anemia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Olnes et al., 2012</xref>). Small clinical trials and case reports have suggested that TPO receptor agonists are also effective in increasing platelet counts in patients with certain forms of Inherited Thrombocytopenia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Rodeghiero et al., 2018</xref>) and that at least Eltrombopag could be used to replace platelet transfusions to prepare patients to undergo hemostatic challenges (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Zaninetti et al., 2019</xref>). Indeed, a few patients have successfully received long-term treatment with TPO-receptor agonists, potentially paving the way for chronic treatment of these previously untreated forms of thrombocytopenia. However, platelet response to these drugs was variable among different patients, and sometimes the drugs were ineffective (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gerrits et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Zaninetti et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Zaninetti et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>Here, we have developed a miniaturized 3D bone marrow tissue model that ex vivo reproduces in vivo platelet biogenesis in such a way that it allows us to predict response to drugs on a single patient basis. The major advantages of this device over the existing bone marrow models include rapid customization and manufacturing, handling ease, and the implementation of small silk-based three-dimensional scaffolds to allow the seeding of small amounts of adult megakaryocyte progenitors that are cultured for several days, perfused in parallel and simultaneously, to compare platelet production under different treatments (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3">Table 3</xref>). As proof of principle, we applied our system to study thrombocytopenic patients affected by <italic>ANKRD26</italic>-RT and <italic>MYH9</italic>-RD who were treated with the TPO-receptor agonist Eltrombopag (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Zaninetti et al., 2020</xref>). According to our clinical data, the extent of platelet response to Eltrombopag in patients with <italic>ANKRD26</italic>-RT was lower than that in <italic>MYH9</italic>-RD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Zaninetti et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Zaninetti et al., 2020</xref>). This range of variability was reflected ex vivo, clearly demonstrating that our tissue model can efficiently predict both the positive and negative response to Eltrombopag in individual patients and allow more personalized treatment, reducing the number of non-responders unnecessarily exposed to potential side effects of the treatment and ineffective preparation for procedures. In the future, patients might be able to create their own platelets and thus avoid most if not all of the complications discussed above. The study has several limitations. First, only patients affected by <italic>ANKRD26</italic>-RT and <italic>MYH9</italic>-RD were investigated; however, they are among the most frequent forms of Inherited Thrombocytopenia worldwide. For the many other forms of Inherited Thrombocytopenia, we do not know if our ex vivo predictive system will be similarly predictive. Second, since in vivo clinical trials for patients with Inherited Thrombocytopenia thus far have been limited to Eltrombopag; we, therefore, chose not to include either Romiplostim or Avatrombopag (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bussel, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Ghanima et al., 2019</xref>) in our ex vivo testing. Third, the model was not tested to assess the effect of drugs that negatively impact platelet production, such as chemotherapy. Nonetheless, these limitations can readily be overcome by an additional study of the various permutations discussed. Viewed from this perspective, the studies reported here provide motivation and rationale for extending the model to allow identification of the impact of various molecules on platelet production for each patient. Furthermore, this ex vivo approach may be useful to study drugs not only in diseases characterized by thrombocytopenia but also in those with thrombocytosis.</p><table-wrap id="table3" position="float"><label>Table 3.</label><caption><title>Comparison of silk-bone marrow models for megakaryocyte culture.</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top"/><th valign="top"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Di Buduo et al., 2015</xref></th><th valign="top"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Di Buduo et al., 2017</xref></th><th valign="top">Current Manuscript</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Size of the cell-seeding well</td><td valign="top">15 × 20 × 5 mm (1500 mm<sup>3</sup>)</td><td valign="top">3.5 × 20 × 5 mm (350 mm<sup>3</sup>)</td><td valign="top">2 × 15 × 3.5 mm (105 mm<sup>3</sup>)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">No. of chambers that can be perfused in parallel</td><td valign="top">Max. 2</td><td valign="top">Max. 1</td><td valign="top">&gt;2 (up to at least 4)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Source of blood</td><td valign="top">Human <break/>Umbilical Cord Blood</td><td valign="top">Human <break/>Umbilical Cord Blood</td><td valign="top">Human <break/>Peripheral Blood</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Type of hemopoietic stem and progenitor cells</td><td valign="top">CD34<sup>+</sup></td><td valign="top">CD34<sup>+</sup></td><td valign="top"><sup>-</sup> CD45<sup>+</sup> <break/><sup>-</sup> CD34<sup>+</sup>-derived iPSCs</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Type of cells seeded</td><td valign="top">CD34<sup>+</sup>-derived megakaryocytes</td><td valign="top">CD34<sup>+</sup>-derived megakaryocytes</td><td valign="top">- CD45<sup>+</sup>-derived megakaryocyte progenitors <break/>- iPSC-derived megakaryocyte progenitors</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">No. of cells seeded</td><td valign="top">2.5 × 10<sup>5</sup></td><td valign="top">4 × 10<sup>5</sup></td><td valign="top">5 × 10<sup>4</sup></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Time of the culture</td><td valign="top">24 hr</td><td valign="top">24 hr</td><td valign="top">&gt;7 days</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Major application</td><td valign="top">Studying mechanisms of thrombopoiesis</td><td valign="top">Proof of concept for scaling up platelet production</td><td valign="top">Drug Testing in individual patients</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><p>Inherited Thrombocytopenias each represent a prototype of thrombocytopenias deriving from defective platelet biogenesis within the bone marrow. For many Inherited Thrombocytopenias, the mechanisms of defective platelet production remain unknown. Understanding the cause of thrombocytopenia in these diseases could define the most suitable treatment for each disorder and identify both novel potential targets and either novel drugs or novel uses of existing drugs. Current 2D assays for functional assessment of megakaryocytes do not effectively monitor the final stage of maturation, in particular proplatelet spreading, platelet formation, and platelet release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Balduini et al., 2016</xref>). By recreating megakaryocyte maturation from stem cells to platelet release, our miniaturized 3D bone marrow model demonstrated the ability to reproduce these key steps of thrombopoiesis, including alterations observed in diseased states.</p><p>Megakaryocytes from patient-derived iPSCs reproduce the genetic background of peripheral-blood derived megakaryocytes and, thus, can be used to systematically study disease mechanisms and test candidate drugs. iPSCs represent a potentially unlimited source of megakaryocytes that can be frozen and made available on-demand without having to rely on frequent collection of patients’ blood. We hypothesized that combining the 3D bone marrow tissue model and iPSC technologies would be instrumental in addressing critical clinical needs for a more specific understanding of the mechanism of action of TPO-receptor agonists in patients. The possibility of generating iPSC clones from fibroblasts of a <italic>MYH9</italic>-RD patient has been previously shown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Tangprasittipap et al., 2019</xref>), though, their differentiation potential was not proven. We derived iPSCs from hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells of one <italic>MYH9</italic>-RD patient and analyzed separately three different clones. The breakthrough of our approach includes an in-depth quality check of the iPSC clones to minimize heterogeneity and maximize replicability over-time. No defects in megakaryocyte maturation were observed from all the clones, while proplatelet formation was decreased as compared to healthy control clones.</p><p>Besides its ability to stimulate megakaryopoiesis, Eltrombopag has also been well-demonstrated to promote multilineage hematopoiesis in patients with acquired bone marrow failure syndromes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Olnes et al., 2012</xref>). Although the exact mechanisms of its effects on hematopoietic progenitor cells are not completely clear, Kao et al. recently demonstrated a stimulatory effect on stem cell self-renewal independently of the TPO receptor-mediated through iron chelation-dependent molecular reprogramming (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kao et al., 2018</xref>). Our benchmark tests highlight that, besides platelet release, the 3D tissue model allowed us to track the effect of Eltrombopag on both progenitor cell and megakaryocyte functions, promising to provide a more comprehensive approach to study the effect of TPO-receptor agonists on hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells.</p><p>In summary, we developed a proof-of-concept system that in two weeks measures the impact of TPO-receptor agonists on megakaryopoiesis and platelet production of individual patients starting from a small amount of their peripheral blood (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). This silk-based technology, which can be produced and customized in 2 days, reaches the expectation of cost efficiency, time-saving, convenience, and personalization of modern therapeutic approaches. The data demonstrated that the ex vivo system could predict in vivo clinical response to Eltrombopag. The increase in the number of platelets collected in the ex vivo model was comparable to the increase of platelet count in vivo upon treatment with Eltrombopag. The broader impact of this work is in the design of tools to mimic the bone marrow ex vivo that can uncover mechanisms of impaired platelet production and enable testing of candidate drug treatments on platelet production using patient-derived cells. In the future, our system may serve as the foundation for highly integrated approaches to generate solutions for the ex vivo production of all blood cells for transfusion. The system may also represent a benchmark for pre-clinical testing of new therapeutic applications for Inherited Thrombocytopenias or other hematologic diseases, and for testing the effects of potentially toxic agents for the whole hematopoietic niche.</p><fig id="fig9" position="float"><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><title>Summary of the proposed workflow.</title><p>After sampling, hematopoietic stem and progenitors cell from patients can be differentiated into primary megakaryocytes (MKs) or transformed into induced Pluripotent Stem Cells (iPSCs). iPSC are subjected to quality check, expansion and banking. Megakaryocytic progenitors differentiated either from primary stem cells or iPSCs are seeded within a 3D bone marrow tissue device, cultured in the presence of the tested drug, and analyzed. After perfusion, platelets are collected and counted in order to assess patient-specific response.

The modeling of the bioreactor was created using CAD software (OnShape, Fusion360, or Inventor2017) and used to generate 3D negative mold components exported as STL (Standard Triangulation Language) files, sliced with Slic3R PE, and export to the FDM 3D printer Prusa i3 MK3S (Prusa Research, Czech Republic). The printing is done using a poly(lactic acid) (PLA) high-temperature filament of 1,75 mm (FormFutura, Netherland) deployed in layers of 100 µm by a 0.25 mm nozzle. After printing, the mold was cured in an oven at 100°C for 20 min to increase mechanical properties. To produce the perfusion channel, 21G needles were disposed in the dedicated holes and sealed with a gel of 25% Pluronic F-127. The molding was performed using a polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) (Sylgard184, Dow Corning), mixed in a 10:1 ratio of base material and curing agent. The selected material is stable both at low and high temperatures (45–200°C) and it is resistant to UV, water, and solvents. The PDMS was poured into the 3D printed molds that were positioned into a vacuum chamber to remove all the air bubbles. The curing of the PDMS was performed in a dried oven at 70°C for 4 hr; the molds were then dissociated from the final silicon models sterilizable by autoclave. The chamber consisted of two wells of 10 × 22 mm, having a hollow cavity of 2 × 15 × 3.5 mm enclosed in a block of 30 × 30 × 14 mm and connected to the outside of the chamber through channels of 0.9 mm diameter. The luer adaptors for the inlet and outlet were mounted in the channel and sealed with biocompatible silicone adhesive MD7-4502 (Dow Corning, USA). Then, the modular flow chamber was equipped with a silk fibroin sponge functionalized with fibronectin as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Di Buduo et al., 2017</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Preparation of the silk fibroin solution</title><p>Silk fibroin aqueous solution was obtained from <italic>B. mori</italic> silkworm cocoons according to previously published literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Di Buduo et al., 2018</xref>). Briefly, dewormed cocoons were boiled for 30 min in 0.02 M Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub> solution at a weight to volume ratio of 10 g to 4 L. The fibers were rinsed for 20 min three times in ultrapure water and dried overnight. The dried fibers were solubilized for 4 hr at 60°C in 9.3 M LiBr at a weight to volume ratio of 3 g/12 mL. The solubilized silk solution was dialyzed against distilled water using a Slide-A-Lyzer cassette (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) with a 3500 MW cutoff for three days and changing the water a total of eight times. The silk solution was centrifuged at maximum speed for 15 min to remove large particulates and stored at 4°C. The concentration of the silk solution was determined by drying a known volume of the solution overnight at 60°C and massing the remaining solids.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Silk bone marrow fabrication and assembly</title><p>Silk solution (8% w/v) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lovett et al., 2007</xref>) was mixed with 25 µg/mL fibronectin and dispensed into the modular chamber. NaCl particles (approximately 500 µm in diameter) were then sifted into the solution in a ratio of 1 mL to 2 g of NaCl particles. The scaffolds were then placed at room temperature for 48 hr and then soaked in distilled water for 48 hr to leach out the NaCl particles. The scaffolds were sterilized in 70% ethanol and finally rinsed five times in PBS for over 24 hr. Silk scaffolds were characterized by confocal, as subsequently described. Perfusion of the silk scaffold has been tested at different flow rates (5–50 µL/min) by using a peristaltic pump (ShenChen Flow Rates Peristaltic Pump - LabV1, China). The total volume collected after each test corresponded to that injected in the system by the pump.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Patients</title><p>Human peripheral blood samples were obtained from healthy controls and thrombocytopenic patients after informed consent.

All patients provided written informed consent for this study, which was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the IRCCS Policlinico San Matteo Foundation, Pavia, Italy. A sample of 15 mL of peripheral venous blood anticoagulated with ACD was collected for the analysis in the 3D bone marrow system. Thirteen patients had previously received a short-term course of Eltrombopag (3–6 weeks) either within a phase two clinical trial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Zaninetti et al., 2020</xref>) (n = 11) or in preparation for elective surgery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Zaninetti et al., 2019</xref>) (n = 2).

The in vivo clinical response to the drug was expressed as the absolute increase in platelet count at the end of Eltrombopag treatment with respect to baseline. Blood samples for this study were collected when patients were out of Eltrombopag therapy (minimum of 6 months to a maximum of 48 months washout). According to the fast pharmacokinetics of Eltrombopag (plasma elimination half-life approximately 21–32 hr), all patients had platelet count at their baseline levels at one month of follow-up after the discontinuation of the treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Pecci et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Zaninetti et al., 2020</xref>).

A two-tailed paired t-test was performed for statistical analysis of data from samples tested in parallel under different experimental conditions. A two-tailed unpaired t-test was performed for statistical analysis of data from different samples. Statistical analysis was performed with GraphPad Software. A p-value of less than 0.05 or 0.01 was considered statistically significant. All experiments were independently replicated at least three times.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors thank Novartis for providing Eltrombopag; ‘Centro Grandi Strumenti’ of the University of Pavia and Dr. Patrizia Vaghi for technical assistance with confocal microscopy; Prof. Joseph Italiano for providing β1-tubulin antibody.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Jonathan Cooper as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Diana Passaro (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>As the editors have judged that your manuscript is of interest, but as described below that additional experiments are required before it is published, we would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). First, because many researchers have temporarily lost access to the labs, we will give authors as much time as they need to submit revised manuscripts. We are also offering, if you choose, to post the manuscript to bioRxiv (if it is not already there) along with this decision letter and a formal designation that the manuscript is &quot;in revision at <italic>eLife</italic>&quot;. Please let us know if you would like to pursue this option. (If your work is more suitable for medRxiv, you will need to post the preprint yourself, as the mechanisms for us to do so are still in development.)</p><p>Summary:</p><p>There was a consensus that this in vitro, 3D silk-based megakaryocyte culture system would be of value to grow from peripheral blood MK-derived platelets and help elucidate the pathophysiology of Inherited Thrombocytopenias. There are a number of strengths: the direct comparison of platelet production from peripheral blood progenitors of a cohort of patients whose response to eltrombopag was known, as well as excellent quantitative and imaging data on megakaryopoiesis and thrombogenesis.</p><p>However, there was also a consensus that this system is not entirely novel or advantageous from the one described in the authors' 2015 Blood paper. Other weaknesses include 1) reiteration of published data, 2) lack of healthy control comparators for patient data, 3) weak rationale for using an in vitro model to predict patient responses to eltromopag, and 4) single iPSC line derived from a patient whose response to eltrombopag is not provided.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1.

Absolute platelet numbers generated among patients' samples and with TPO plus/minus eltrombopag should be provided.</p><p>4. While there was a correlation between Eltrombopag-enhanced thrombopoiesis from patient-derived blood samples and patient response, this correlation was heavily dependent on one outlier with a large response, and a few with a more minimal response. The actual range of platelet enhancement by Eltrombopag mostly ranged from 3-9 fold. Also, the model is not so reliable that a dose of Eltrombopag should not be tested in a patient based on the in vitro finding, so the true predictive value of such cultures would hopefully be applicable to something more expensive or potentially toxic than simply testing the patient's response to Eltrombopag. In all of the 3D culture studies, TPO and Eltrombopag are given together. What are the effects of Eltrombopag alone? It seems that patients only receive Eltrombopag. What is the rationale of treating with combined TPO and Eltrombopag in vitro?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.58775.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Summary:</p><p>There was a consensus that this in vitro, 3D silk-based megakaryocyte culture system would be of value to grow from peripheral blood MK-derived platelets and help elucidate the pathophysiology of inherited thrombocytopenias.

In the revised manuscript we support the novelty of our model compared to existing silk-based technologies as it is a simplified bone marrow scaffold for screening individual responses to drug regimens ex vivo, requiring a much smaller volume of patient’s blood to study platelet production. The highly novel validation of the system, gained by comparing results obtained ex vivo with data from in vivo treatment of the same patients, represents a proof-of-concept for the future applicability of the experimental approach to a wide variety of new compounds intended to treat bone marrow diseases. Data from healthy controls have been provided, and the added value of including iPSCs in the system has been offered in Discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1.

In the past five years, our expertise in modeling megakaryopoiesis and silk processing has led to the development of early models of silk-bone marrow able to produce millions of human platelets from cord blood-derived haematopoietic stem and progenitor cells with the goal of providing proof-of-concept evidence of their applicability for transfusion medicine. We believe that our new miniaturized bone marrow represents a substantial innovation over these models as this simplified system can be easily applied to drug testing starting from patients’ peripheral blood progenitors. Major advantages of the miniaturized model include: (i) rapid manufacture and customization, (ii) easy handling, (iii) the implementation of small silk-based three-dimensional scaffolds to allow the seeding of a small number of adult megakaryocyte progenitors (such as those that can be obtained from 10-15 ml of patients’ peripheral blood), and (iv) the manufacturing of bioreactors holding two identical silk scaffolds which are cultured and perfused in parallel for the direct comparison of two samples.</p><p>Our first silk-based bone marrow model (Di Buduo et al., 2015) was composed of a porous silk tube, mimicking vessels, surrounded by a 3D silk matrix to allow the recording of megakaryocyte functions (i.e., migration, proplatelet formation) in response to variations in extracellular matrix components, surface topography and stiffness, and co-culture with endothelial cells. Millions of human platelets were produced and shown to be functional based on multiple activation tests. This system demonstrated the fundamental qualities of silk fibroin for studying thrombopoiesis, such as non-thrombogenicity and the possibility to entrap different molecules while retaining their bioactivity. A limitation of this model was the use of custom-made chambers and silk tubes whose production could not be standardized or scaled easily to guarantee the reliable comparison of different parallel culture conditions. This has been made possible by our miniaturized model. The miniaturized model can produce measurable numbers of platelets starting from less than one-fifth of the cells seeded in the original silk bioreactor, making it possible to study platelet production starting from progenitors collected from 15 ml of patient and control peripheral blood.</p><p>Our second silk-bone marrow model (Di Buduo et al., 2017) consisted of a scaled-up version intended to house a larger number of mature megakaryocytes producing millions of platelets for functional studies and biochemical characterization. The flow chamber was made of polydimethylsiloxane, holding a silk sponge, prepared with salt leaching methods, and functionalized with extracellular matrix components. Perfusion of the chamber allowed the recovery of platelets when the silk sponge was cultured with cord blood-derived megakaryocytes.</p><p>As indicated above, the major advantages of the present miniaturized bone marrow model over the previous ones are both the requirement for seeding an order of magnitude less megakaryocytes and the standardized production process which is easily scalable to produce as many chambers as needed within the same device. In future applications, we plan to use the system to test more than two drugs at the same time to help clinicians verify the best therapeutic approach for individual patients and to determine critical factors related to clinical platelet output. The miniaturized bone marrow model may pave the road to personalized medicine in this field – an aim and an application that could not be pursued with the previous silk-based bone marrow models.</p><p>A summary of key points is now reported in the section Discussion of the revised manuscript.

Please revise and provide the rationale for using both TPO and eltrombopag. Adding data showing the effects of eltrombopag alone would be of interest.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the Reviewers for the comment on this key point of the experimental design that was not described sufficiently in the previous version of the manuscript.</p><p>With the only exception of congenital amegakaryocytic thrombocytopenia, subjects with Inherited Thrombocytopenias have normal or moderately increased serum levels of endogenous thrombopoietin. in vivo, both Eltrombopag and endogenous thrombopoietin are present in the plasma of patients undergoing Eltrombopag treatment. We have shown that serum thrombopoietin concentration was moderately increased, compared to healthy subjects, both in patients with <italic>MYH9</italic>-RD and in those with <italic>ANKRD26</italic>-RT, both before and during Eltrombopag administration (Zaninetti et al., 2020). Combining Eltrombopag and thrombopoietin in the 3D system intends to mimic what patients’ cells experience in vivo in their native environment during Eltrombopag treatment, when bone marrow haemopoietic stem/progenitor cells and megakaryocytes are exposed to stimuli from both molecules. This condition was compared to thrombopoietin alone as a control reference, reproducing the in vivo situation in which the patients are not under treatment with Eltrombopag.</p><p>A stimulatory effect of Eltrombopag on stem cell self-renewal has been demonstrated independently of the thrombopoietin receptor (Kao et al., 2018). It is well known that Eltrombopag and thrombopoietin do not compete for the binding to the thrombopoietin receptor due to their affinity for different binding sites but, rather, Eltrombopag has an additive effect on thrombopoietin (Kuter, 2013).</p><p>Based on this knowledge, the revised paper contains a detailed description of the rationale supporting our choice to test Eltrombopag in combination with recombinant human thrombopoietin.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. Indicate whether this system is predictive of a response to eltrombopag, based on the patients' data. Absolute platelet numbers generated among patients' samples and with TPO {plus minus} eltrombopag should be provided.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the Reviewers for this suggestion that greatly improves the reported evidence of the clinical relevance of our findings. The revised version of the manuscript includes a table summarizing platelet counts of investigated patients before Eltrombopag treatment; increase in platelet counts obtained in vivo with Eltrombopag administration; numbers of platelets produced ex vivo with thrombopoietin alone; increase in the numbers of platelets produced ex vivo with the addition of Eltrombopag (Table 2). The significant correlation between platelet count increase ex vivo and in vivo is reported in Figure 6D.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. While there was a correlation between Eltrombopag-enhanced thrombopoiesis from patient-derived blood samples and patient response, this correlation was heavily dependent on one outlier with a large response, and a few with a more minimal response. The actual range of platelet enhancement by Eltrombopag mostly ranged from 3-9 fold. Also, the model is not so reliable that a dose of Eltrombopag should not be tested in a patient based on the in vitro finding, so the true predictive value of such cultures would hopefully be applicable to something more expensive or potentially toxic than simply testing the patient's response to Eltrombopag. In all of the 3D culture studies, TPO and Eltrombopag are given together. What are the effects of Eltrombopag alone? It seems that patients only receive Eltrombopag. What is the rationale of treating with combined TPO and Eltrombopag in vitro?</p></disp-quote><p>The range of variability of the in vitro responses, including the presence of an outlier with a very marked increase of platelet count and some patients with minimal responses, reflects the still unexplained variability of the in vivo clinical response to Eltrombopag. The availability of blood samples and clinical data from the same patients treated with Eltrombopag in vivo offered the unique possibility to validate the miniaturized bone marrow model. The concordance between in vivo and ex vivo data served as proof of the reliability of our laboratory assessment and the broader applicability of the experimental approach. As reported in the ‘<italic>Discussion’</italic> of the revised manuscript, we agree with the Reviewers that, based on these results, such a system will represent a benchmark for pre-clinical testing of other potential pharmacologic treatments (e.g.; new drugs, expensive therapies) intended to cure Inherited Thrombocytopenias or other hematologic diseases affecting blood cell progenitors as well as for testing the effects of potentially toxic agents for the whole haematopoietic niche (e.g.; chemotherapy). The miniaturized bone marrow model will serve as a tool for answering open questions related to mechanisms responsible for different individual responses to thrombopoietin-receptor agonists observed in patients affected by the same disease.</p><p>Regarding the rationale for treating samples with combined thrombopoietin and Eltrombopag, please refer to response to the Essential Revision 2.</p></body></sub-article></article>
