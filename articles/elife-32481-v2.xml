We present two structures of the human pancreatic KATP channel, containing the ABC transporter SUR1 and the inward-rectifier K<sup>+</sup> channel Kir6.2, in the presence of Mg<sup>2+</sup> and nucleotides. These structures, referred to as quatrefoil and propeller forms, were determined by single-particle cryo-EM at 3.9 Å and 5.6 Å, respectively. In both forms, ATP occupies the inhibitory site in Kir6.2. The nucleotide-binding domains of SUR1 are dimerized with Mg<sup>2+</sup>-ATP in the degenerate site and Mg<sup>2+</sup>-ADP in the consensus site. A lasso extension forms an interface between SUR1 and Kir6.2 adjacent to the ATP site in the propeller form and is disrupted in the quatrefoil form. These structures support the role of SUR1 as an ADP sensor and highlight the lasso extension as a key regulatory element in ADP’s ability to override ATP inhibition.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.32481.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>A hormone called insulin finely controls the amount of sugar in the blood. When the blood sugar content is high, a group of cells in the pancreas release insulin; when it is low, they stop. In these cells, the level of sugar in the blood modifies the ratio of two molecules: ATP, the body’s energy currency, and ADP, a molecule closely related to ATP. Changes in the ATP/ADP ratio are therefore a proxy of the variations in blood sugar levels.</p><p>In these pancreatic cells, a membrane protein called ATP sensitive potassium channel, K<sub>ATP</sub> channel for short, acts as a switch that turns on and off the production of insulin. ATP and ADP control that switch, with the two molecules having opposite effects on the channel – ATP deactivates it, ADP activates it. The changes in ATP/ADP ratio – and by extension in blood sugar levels – are therefore coupled with the release of insulin.</p><p>However, how K<sub>ATP</sub> channels sense the changes in the ATP/ADP ratio in these cells is still unclear. In particular, ATP levels are usually high and constant: ATP is then continuously deactivating the channels, and it is unclear how ADP ever activates them.</p><p>Here, Lee et al. use a microscopy technique that can image biological molecules at the atomic scale to look at the structure of human pancreatic K<sub>ATP</sub> channels. The 3D reconstruction maps show that K<sub>ATP</sub> channels have binding sites for ATP but also one for ADP. This ADP site acts as a sensor that can detect even small changes in ADP levels in the cell. The maps also reveal a dynamic lasso-like structure connecting the ATP and ADP binding areas. This domain may play a vital role in allowing ADP to override ATP’s control of the channel. The presence of the ADP sensor and the lasso structure could explain how K<sub>ATP</sub> channels monitor changes in the ATP/ADP ratio and can therefore control the release of insulin based on blood sugar levels.</p><p>Defects in the K<sub>ATP</sub> channels of the pancreas are present in genetic diseases where infants produce too much or too little insulin. Understanding the structure of these channels and how they work may help scientists to design new drugs to treat these conditions.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>cryo-EM</kwd><kwd>KATP</kwd><kwd>ATP</kwd><kwd>ADP</kwd><kwd>SUR1</kwd><kwd>Kir6.2</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>None</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000854</institution-id><institution>Human Frontier Science Program</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lee</surname><given-names>Kenneth Pak Kin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>MacKinnon</surname><given-names>Roderick</given-names></name><name><surname>Chen</surname><given-names>Jue</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>MgADP binding to the high-affinity 'consensus' ATPase active site of SUR1 and remodeling of the L0-loop (lasso region) overrides tonic ATP inhibition of KATP channels.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>In 1983, Akinori Noma made the first recordings of ATP-dependent potassium channels in rat cardiac myocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Noma, 1983</xref>). In membrane patches excised from cardiac myocytes, ATP-dependent K<sup>+</sup>-channels spontaneously open in electrolyte solutions devoid of nucleotides. When exposed to milimolar concentrations of intracellular ATP, these channels become quiescent. Once ATP is removed, the potassium currents re-emerge, thus ATP facilitates channel closure. KATP channels, as they are known, have since been discovered in other cells, including pancreatic beta cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Cook and Hales, 1984</xref>), skeletal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Spruce et al., 1985</xref>) and smooth muscle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Standen et al., 1989</xref>) fibers and neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Karschin et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Nelson et al., 2015</xref>).

These channels were found to be large oligomeric complexes composed of four sulphonylurea receptor (SUR) subunits, which belong to the ABCC family of ABC transporters, and four Kir6 subunits, which are members of the inward rectifier potassium channel family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Clement et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Inagaki et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Shyng and Nichols, 1997</xref>).

The focus of this study is the human KATP channel composed of SUR1 and Kir6.2, which are found in pancreatic beta cells where they play a major role in regulating insulin secretion. To facilitate large-scale expression and purification of the human SUR1-Kir6.2 complex, we fused the C-terminus of SUR1 to the N-terminus of Kir6.2 using a six-amino acid linker containing three repeats of the Ser-Ala dyad. This strategy allows the production of human SUR1-human Kir6.2 complex as a tetramer of the fusion construct. This and other peptide linkers ranging from 6 to 14 residues have been used to generate KATP channel fusions that reproduce the electrophysiological and pharmacological characteristics of wild-type octameric KATP channels, as assessed by inhibition from ATP and sulphonylurea drugs as well as activation by ADP and diazoxide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chan et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Clement et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Mikhailov et al., 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">1998</xref>). We also confirmed functional expression of our fusion construct (KATP<sub>em</sub>) in electrophysiology recordings and ATPase measurements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).

By contrast, in the NBD-dimerized SUR1, a small cavity inside the TMDs is closed off from the extracellular milieu and remains accessible from the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). These features are consistent with SUR1 being a regulator of a K<sup>+</sup> channel rather than a <italic>bona fide</italic> transporter itself. This notion is further supported by the observation that no substrate has been identified for SUR1 hitherto (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Aittoniemi et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Schwappach et al., 2000</xref>). Whether the transporter transitions to the outside-open conformation as part of the KATP gating cycle awaits further investigation.</p><p>Another unusual feature of SUR1 is the asymmetric configuration of the NBD dimer. Mg<sup>2+</sup>-ATP is bound in the ‘closed’ catalytically inactive degenerate site and Mg<sup>2+</sup>-ADP is bound in the ‘open’ catalytically competent consensus ATPase site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B–D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). To our knowledge, this is the only ABC transporter observed with both Mg<sup>2+</sup>-ADP and Mg<sup>2+</sup>-ATP bound in its NBDs. We note that the structure of a dimeric ABC transporter, AaPrtD, shows Mg<sup>2+</sup>-ADP bound to both sites, but in this case both sites are the same and symmetrically closed around Mg<sup>2+</sup>-ADP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). In the structure determination of KATP, no ADP was added to the sample. While some ADP must have been generated through hydrolysis, it is clear that the degenerate ATP-binding site on SUR1 and the ATP inhibitory site on the channel are occupied by ATP. Thus, the consensus site on SUR1, relative to the other ATP sites in the complex, is selective for ADP (see below).</p><p>A simplified reaction scheme for the consensus ATP site (S) in SUR1 can be written as S + ATP ↔ SATP ↔ S’ATP→ S’ADP +Pi ↔ S’+ADP. Here, the hydrolysis reaction is approximated as irreversible. We know from the rate of ATP hydrolysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>) that the ATP turnover rate, expressed per SUR1 molecule, is approximately 0.02 per second, which means the above reaction takes approximately 50 s to undergo a complete cycle. The structure shows a relatively open cleft between bound ADP and solution, therefore ADP dissociation is likely to be much faster than this slow turnover rate of 0.02 per second. A different transition must limit the overall rate. The slow transition is likely to be either the isomerization step from NBD open to NBD closed conformation (SATP ↔ S’ATP) or the hydrolysis step (S’ATP→ S’ADP + Pi). Base on this reasoning, the occupancy of S’ by ADP must reflect equilibration of the site by ADP in solution (i.e. through a rapid, reversible ADP dissociation reaction, S’ADP ↔ S’ + ADP). The prior observation that channel gating does not exhibit violation of microscopic reversibility is also compatible with this assertion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Choi et al., 2008</xref>). We will return to the significance of this observation and its consistency with prior studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Dunne and Petersen, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Dunne et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Kakei et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Nichols et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Tantama et al., 2013</xref>) when we consider the mechanism KATP’s ability to sense the metabolic state of a cell.</p><p>SUR1 is the target of sulphonylureas that inhibit KATP to promote insulin secretion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Aguilar-Bryan et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Ashcroft et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Bryan et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Dean and Matthews, 1968</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Sturgess et al., 1985</xref>).

First, the presence of SUR1 (compared to Kir6.2 expressed in its absence) enhances the potency of ATP inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Tucker et al., 1997</xref>). Second, SUR1 permits Mg<sup>2+</sup>-ADP to override ATP inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Nichols et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Tucker et al., 1997</xref>). The structures of the quatrefoil and propeller forms provide clues as to how SUR1 might accomplish these tasks.</p><p>In the propeller form the ATP-binding site on Kir6.2 is buttressed by the lasso extension, which attaches SUR1 to the CTD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). Because of the lasso extension’s close proximity to the ATP-binding site it might influence ATP binding. This could account for the fact that SUR1 coexpression potentiates ATP inhibition of KATP by a factor more than 10-fold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Tucker et al., 1997</xref>). It could also provide the structural pathway through which ADP binding to SUR overcomes ATP inhibition to activate KATP. Functional data are consistent with this possibility. The lasso extension and adjacent amino acids within the ATP-binding site (i.e. both sides of the interface between Kir6.2 and SUR1) are hotspots for inherited gain-of-function mutations, which cause diabetes owing to over-activity of KATP channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Edghill et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Gloyn et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Lang and Light, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Proks et al., 2004</xref>). Furthermore, when this interface is locked together by a disulfide cross-link, KATP is permanently inhibited (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Pratt et al., 2012</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). While a mechanistic description of how SUR regulates Kir6 is still unknown, the structure of the lasso extension/ATP-binding site interface and its correlation to disease-causing mutations underscores its potential importance.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Implications for channel regulation</title><p>Formation of the quatrefoil form is associated with disruption of the lasso extension/ATP-binding site interface. SUR1 remains attached to Kir6.2 through its TMD0-channel interface, but rotation of the transport module around the central axis of TMD0 (to convert from propeller to quatrefoil forms) can only occur if the lasso extension releases from its contact adjacent to the ATP site on the CTD. We do not know whether disruption of this interface is an artifact of the preparation or is a normal occurrence during channel gating. Our rationale for even considering the latter possibility is based on a striking difference between the propeller and quatrefoil structures depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>. In the propeller form, in which the lasso extension/Kir6 interface is intact, the SUR1 transporter modules are held with an offset with respect to the hydrophobic membrane plane, as defined by the position of the Kir6.2 channel and TMD0 domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). In the quatrefoil form, the SUR1 transport modules reside coplanar, that is, in the same hydrophobic plane as defined by the Kir6 and TMD0 elements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). The consequence of holding the transport modules at a shifted position with respect to the pore in the propeller form should be strain exerted on the lasso extension/Kir6 interface in the propeller form.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.32481.021</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Hydrophobic offset of SUR1 relative to Kir6.2.</title><p>The grey lines connect the Cα position of T1160 residues (pink sphere) located in an extracellular loop on diagonally-opposed SUR1 subunits.

Thus, dimerization appears to exert force on the lasso extension away from the channel. In this manner, nucleotide binding and dimerization of the NBDs could potentially interfere with ATP inhibition. Whether the lasso extension actually dissociates is unknown. The gain-of-function mutations on the lasso extension that should tend to disrupt the interface, and the cross-link that should stabilize it, seem to support the idea that the interface is dynamic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Edghill et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Lang and Light, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Pratt et al., 2012</xref>).

This finding, together with the prior demonstration that channel gating is not coupled to ATP hydrolysis (i.e. gating never appears to violate microscopic reversibility), supports the idea that SUR1 is an ADP sensor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Aittoniemi et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Choi et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Dunne et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Dunne and Petersen, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Gribble et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Kakei et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Larsson et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Proks et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Tantama et al., 2013</xref>).

Masked 3D classification was performed without alignment and masked local refinement was performed to optimize alignment parameters. The masked 3D classification and refinement steps were iterated until no further improvement to the reconstructions was observed by manual inspection. For all of the focus maps obtained by this approach, we found significant enhancement to observable features and reported resolution compared to the initial map (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). The quality of the focus maps allowed the identification and modeling bound ligands including ATP, Mg<sup>2+</sup>-ATP and Mg<sup>2+</sup>-ADP as described in the main text. To facilitate map interpretation, we merged focus maps corresponding to all eight sectors into a single composite map using the compositing algorithm implemented in REFMAC5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Murshudov, 2016</xref>). The resultant composite map encompasses the Kir6.2 channel tetramer, four TMD0 and one transporter module, which is equivalent to the volume enclosed in sector 4. The final composite map was sharpened by scaling to the synthetic map calculated from the refined atomic model using <monospace>diffmap.exe</monospace> (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://grigoriefflab.janelia.org/diffmap">http://grigoriefflab.janelia.org/diffmap</ext-link>). The half-map equivalent of the composite map was prepared according to the procedure described above except half-maps from focused 3D refinements were used in lieu of the full-maps. To generate the symmetrized composite map shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3B</xref>, the region corresponding to the human KATP<sub>em</sub> construct (one SUR1 subunit followed by one Kir6.2 subunit) was isolated from the sharpened composite map using UCSF chimera (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Pettersen et al., 2004</xref>) and symmetrized using <monospace>e2proc3d.py</monospace> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Tang et al., 2007</xref>). Local resolution was estimated using <monospace>blocres</monospace> with a box size of 18 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Heymann and Belnap, 2007</xref>). Representative sections of the cryo-EM density in the quatrefoil form reconstruction are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5</xref>. Finally, we compared the symmetrized composite map with the map prior to masked 3D refinement and symmetry expansion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3A and B</xref>). The FSC between the two maps shows a correlation at FSC = 0.5 to 6.3 Å indicating that the symmetry expansion, focused refinement and map compositing steps did not introduced global distortions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3C</xref>).</p><p>We applied a similar focused 3D classification and refinement with symmetry expansion to improve the initial propeller form reconstruction from cryoSPARC (Class B, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). Briefly, particles corresponding to the propeller form Class B were subjected to additional rounds of <italic>ab initio</italic> 3D classification. A single class corresponding to 16,070 of the starting 72,757 particles displayed improved protein features in the SUR1 portion of the particle. This reconstruction was low-pass filtered to 60 Å and was used as the initial model to refine the stack of 16,070 particles in RELION, which resulted in a reconstruction at FSC = 0.143 resolution of 5.6 Å after masking (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). To further improve the propeller reconstruction, iterative focused 3D classification and refinement was performed in RELION using focus masks covering two overlapping sectors: (1) one SUR1 subunit (2) Kir6.2 channel tetramer and four TMD0 domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s6">Figure 1—figure supplement 6</xref>). Symmetry expansion was performed before focused classification and refinement in Sector 1. Representative sections of the cryo-EM density in the propeller form reconstruction are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s7">Figure 1—figure supplement 7</xref>. Composite maps (full maps and half maps) of the propeller form were prepared according to the procedure described above for the quatrefoil form reconstruction.</p></sec><sec id="s3-8"><title>Model building and coordinate refinement</title><p>Model building was initially performed in the focus maps corresponding to the quatrefoil form because of their higher quality. The cryo-EM structure of bovine MRP1 (PDB: 5UJA) was used as a reference structure to generate the starting model for building the SUR1 transporter module. Briefly, the MRP1 model (without TMD0) was first mutated to match the SUR1 sequence using CHAINSAW (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Stein, 2008</xref>) while keeping only side chains of conserved residues. The model was then divided into two pieces, each corresponding to one half transporter (one TMD plus one NBD). The SUR1 half transporters were then docked into EM density separately by rigid-body fitting using the fitmap function in UCSF Chimera (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Pettersen et al., 2004</xref>) followed by manual rebuilding in Coot (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Emsley et al., 2010</xref>). To build the SUR1 TMD0 domain, the EM density in the focus maps was of sufficient quality to allow de novo manual building in Coot. The crystal structure of GIRK (PDB: 3SYA) was used a reference structure to generate the starting model for building the Kir6.2 tetramer. CHAINSAW was again used to mutate the GIRK model to match the Kir6.2 sequence and eliminating non-conserved side chains. The Kir6.2 pore module and CTD were separated and converted to tetramers by applying the appropriate symmetry operations. The pore and CTD tetramer models were then rigid-body fitted independently into EM density in UCSF Chimera to allow for rotation of the CTD relative to the pore. The fitted Kir6.2 models were then used as starting points for manual rebuilding in Coot.</p><p>The SUR1 transporter, the TMD0 domain, and the Kir6.2 tetramer channel were first built as independent initial models by consulting all available focus maps. B-factor sharpening was performed locally in Coot ‘on-the-fly’ to optimize observable map features for model building. Side chains were not modeled for residues with poor density. The initial models were then merged into a single consensus model containing the Kir6.2 channel tetramer, four TMD0 domains and one transporter module. Composite maps of the quatrefoil (one full map and two half maps) were then prepared as described above. Prior to automatic real space refinement, one additional round of manual rebuilding in Coot was then performed using the consensus model and the composite full map.</p><p>Automatic real space refinement of the consensus model was performed against one of the composite half-maps using <monospace>phenix.real_space_refine</monospace> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adams et al., 2010</xref>) with 4-fold symmetry imposed for the Kir6.2 channel tetramer and the four TMD0 with the application of NCS constraints. Tight secondary structure and geometric restraints were used to minimize overfitting. Manual rebuilding in Coot was alternated with automated refinement in <monospace>phenix.real_space_refine</monospace>.</p><p>For cross-validation, FSC curves were calculated between refined models and the composite half-map used for refinement (FSC<sub>work</sub>) or the composite half-map not used at any point during refinement (FSC<sub>free</sub>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3D</xref>). These curves were inspected after each round of automated real-space refinement in <monospace>phenix.real_space_refine</monospace> to monitor the effects of overfitting.</p><p>Regions that did not allow accurate establishment of amino acid register were modeled as a polyalanines.

The Kir6.2 pore, the CTD, the TMD0 and transporter module from the quatrefoil form coordinates were independently docked into the propeller form reconstruction by rigid-body fitting. The agreement between the fitted models and the propeller form EM density was excellent and required little additional adjustment. The L0-loop in SUR1, which contains the lasso helix, the lasso motif and the lasso extension was ordered in the propeller form map, in contrast to the quatrefoil form. Given that the sequence of the lasso-motif in SUR1 and MRP1 is well conserved, we reasoned that the structure of this region in SUR1 should be very similar to that observed in MRP1. To build the lasso-motif in the propeller form density, we extracted the coordinates of the lasso-motif from the bMRP1 model (residues 205 to 248) and mutated it to match the SUR1 sequence using CHAINSAW while keeping sidechains of only conserved residues. This initial model (corresponding to residues 215 to 255 in SUR1) was docked into the lasso motif of the propeller form EM map by rigid-body fitting. The resulting model showed good agreement with the lasso density and required little additional manual adjustment in coot. EM density corresponding to bulky sidechains in this region allowed us to confidently establish the amino-acid register of the lasso-motif. Regions with less defined densities were built as polyalanine models. Automated real-space refinement, manual re-building and cross-validation were performed as described above for the quatrefoil form structure.

A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Molecular structure of human KATP in complex with ATP and ADP&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Kenton Swartz as the Reviewing Editor and Richard Aldrich as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: John L Rubinstein (Reviewer #1); Colin G. Nichols (Reviewer #2); Cristina Paulino (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The manuscript by Lee et al. report a 3.9 Å and 5.6 Å cryo-EM structure of the nucleotide-bound human pancreatic KATP channel. The complex is composed of a SUR1, an ABC transporters which acts as regulator with no transport activity, and the inward-rectifying potassium channel Kir6.2. The resolution of the map was further improved by focused classification and refinement of sub-sections of the complex, which were later combined to generate a composite map. This is a rather 'recent' approach, which the authors have conducted in a thorough and excellent way, giving this study, apart from the biological impact, also high-standard methodological impact. The authors identified two conformational states from the same sample, referred to as the quatrefoil and propeller state. In both states ATP occupies the inhibitory site in Kir6.2, while the nucleotide-binding domains of SUR1 are dimerized with Mg<sup>2+</sup>-ATP in the degenerated site and Mg<sup>2+</sup>-ADP in the consensus site. The manuscript, thus, reveals a new conformation of the complex and provides new exciting details. In light of the high pharmacological relevance of the protein and its implication in diabetes, the study greatly advances our understanding of the mechanism of action of the KATP channels and will be of highest interest to several research fields. While we believe the results are of great impact and strongly support its publication in <italic>eLife</italic>, the manuscript requires a more comprehensive description and discussion. In particular, it will be crucial to contrast the results with the recently accepted paper in <italic>eLife</italic> from Martin et al., which reports the structure of the same protein in another conformation. In fact, it will give the authors the opportunity to draw a more detailed picture of the entire transport and regulation cycle, than was possible before.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The authors should provide a more thorough description of both maps. While the quatrefoil structure is described in detail, a similar level of detail is missing for the other propeller map. Also, a more detailed comparison of both maps would be highly appreciated, both in text form and pictures.</p><p>2) The authors propose that the Lo loop (lasso extension) interaction with the Kir6.2 cytoplasmic domain exerts strain to keep the transport module in a position where the hydrophobic transmembrane domain is shifted down with respect to the pore and TM0 domains and that the release of the interaction is triggered by MgADP-induced NBD-dimerization, which would restore hydrophobic match among the domains, resulting in reduction of ATP affinity in the Kir domain. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> is provided as supporting evidence for this hydrophobic mismatch; grey horizontal lines were drawn to designate the inferred boundaries of the membrane bilayer that supposedly corresponded the hydrophobic region of each domain. It is unclear to us whether the lines are positioned appropriately and whether such a drastic hydrophobic mismatch is present in the structure of the propeller form or not. The upper line for the pore and TM0 domain are drawn far above the more likely hydrophobic boundary and the lower line for the transporter module in the 'Propeller' form is drawn much lower than the most reasonable boundary. Even though the authors claim that the 'Quatrefoil' form has better hydrophobic matches, it seems rather opposite in fact, with the basic residues at the end of elbow1 (circled by red dots) deeply penetrating into the hydrophobic core of the bilayer. It is also worth noting that, as reported in a recent Nature paper (Norimatsu Y. et al. 2017), the bilayer surface adjacent to transmembrane proteins may be heavily perturbed by proteins. Assuming a flat bilayer surface and arguing hydrophobic mismatch may not be reasonable. Overall, the authors need to enhance their presentation and justification of the hydrophobic mismatch in order to be convincing. It would also be of interest to see how the belt of amphipols looks like in both cryo-EM maps, and if a 'micelle' distortion is visible.</p><p>3) The authors argue that the slide helix might push the neighboring PIP2 site and hence inhibit PIP2 binding. However, aligning by the whole molecule shows that the relative distances between the slide helix and the neighboring PIP2 site are more or less the same in the three structures. Pushing of the slide helix is only apparent because of rigid body rotation of the cytoplasmic domain in a counter clockwise direction if viewed from the top of the TM domain and hence the actual distances between the two parts of the Kir domain do not change since the same degree of rotation also occurs in the neighboring PIP2 site. The primary conformational change observed in these EM structures seems to be that the Kir domain is displaced from the TM domain. The displacement is greater in the quatrefoil than the propeller form. It may be more likely that loss of the canonical PIP2 binding site (lack of helical c-linker) is caused by Kir domain disengagement from the TM domain. The authors should carefully reconsider their conclusions, provide a discussion of these issues, and either modify their conclusions or enhance the presentation to more clearly communicate their conclusions.</p><p>4) Issues to discuss:a) Chicken or egg problem: The two conformations were obtained in identical conditions with the same protein and ligand combination. The authors argue that transition from the propeller to the quatrefoil conformation is triggered by Mg-ADP binding. No clear rationale is given to support this claim. Is there any additional information in the population distributions?</p><p>b) Multiple ABC transporter structures have been determined including another KATP channel (5TWV) and two-bound Mg-ADP complex (5L22). These previous structures should be considered in comparison. The authors should also compare in their new structures with the new high-resolution structure of Martin et al. in <italic>eLife</italic>. Of great interest is the similarity of the propeller form to the structure of Martin et al. Now that several new structures are available the authors should consider drawing a scheme for the gating mechanism, Similarly, movies provide a perfect tool to illustrate the observed conformational changes.</p><p>5) The authors state that in SUR1, ATP is found in the catalytically inactive site and ADP in the catalytically active site. We are not sure how strongly this claim can be made at the reported resolution (and from looking at 3C&amp;D). The authors should better justify this conclusion.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.32481.037</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The authors should provide a more thorough description of both maps.
