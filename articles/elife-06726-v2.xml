the future vessels. To form the first axial vessels, angioblasts migrate towards the midline and coalesce underneath the notochord. Vascular endothelial growth factor has been proposed to serve as a chemoattractant for the angioblasts and to regulate this medial migration. Here we challenge this model and instead demonstrate that angioblasts rely on their intrinsic expression of Apelin receptors (Aplr, APJ) for their migration to the midline. We further show that during this angioblast migration Apelin receptor signaling is mainly triggered by the recently discovered ligand Elabela (Ela). As neither of the ligands Ela or Apelin (Apln) nor their receptors have previously been implicated in regulating angioblast migration, we hereby provide a novel mechanism for regulating vasculogenesis, with direct relevance to physiological and pathological angiogenesis.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.06726.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.06726.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.06726.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>The circulatory system enables blood to move around the body and deliver substances including nutrients and oxygen to the cells that need them. In the embryos of animals with a backbone, blood flows from the heart through the aorta into branching smaller vessels to the cells. The blood then gets collected by progressively bigger vessels and flows back to the heart via the cardinal vein. The cells that make up these blood vessels develop from cells called angioblasts—but first, during development these angioblasts must move to the place where the vessels will form.</p><p>A protein called Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) had been suggested to help guide and align the angioblasts as the embryo develops. Now, Helker, Schuermann et al. have examined developing zebrafish embryos using new technologies. This revealed that VEGF is in fact not essential for the dorsal aorta and cardinal vein to develop. Instead, the angioblasts only move to the correct part of the embryo if they can produce the Apelin receptor protein, which forms part of a signaling pathway.</p><p>There are two hormones—called Apelin and Elabela—that can bind to and activate the Apelin receptor. Helker, Schuermann et al. show that Elabela alone is needed to guide the angioblasts to the right part of the embryo during blood vessel development. However, in embryos where there is not enough Elabela, the Apelin hormone can compensate for this deficiency and the first blood vessels will later develop correctly. Future research will address whether this signaling pathway not only guides angioblasts to establish a circulatory system, but also guides blood vessel growth. As blood vessel growth is very relevant to human disease, identifying the mechanisms that regulate it will have an impact on biomedical research.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.06726.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.06726.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>angioblast migration</kwd><kwd>endothelial cell migration</kwd><kwd>Vegf</kwd><kwd>dorsal aorta</kwd><kwd>chemoattractant</kwd><kwd>notochord</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Zebrafish</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003484</institution-id><institution>State of Northrhine Westphalia</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Northrhine Westphalia Return Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Herzog</surname><given-names>Wiebke</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004869</institution-id><institution>Westfälische Wilhelms-Universität Münster</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Cells in Motion cluster of Excellence, CiM - EXC 1003 / FF-2013-14</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Herzog</surname><given-names>Wiebke</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001348</institution-id><institution>Agency for Science, Technology and Research (A*STAR)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Strategic Positioning Fund on Genetic Orphan Diseases</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Reversade</surname><given-names>Bruno</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004189</institution-id><institution>Max-Planck-Gesellschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kiefer</surname><given-names>Friedemann</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.3</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Elabela-Apelin receptor signaling is a novel pathway that regulates angioblast migration, instead of the proposed migration regulation through Vascular endothelial growth factor.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Main text</title><p>In the vertebrate embryo, the formation of the large axial vessels, namely the dorsal aorta (DA) and the cardinal vein (CV), establishes a first circulatory loop and thereby the core of the developing cardiovascular system.

In <italic>Xenopus</italic> embryos, transcripts for the <italic>vegfa</italic> gene are expressed in the midline and migrating angioblasts were guided towards sites of ectopic Vegfa expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cleaver and Krieg, 1998</xref>). Global inactivation of the genes encoding VEGF-A or the corresponding receptor VEGFR2 in mice led to strong vascular defects affecting the whole vascular network including the DA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Shalaby et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Ferrara et al., 1996</xref>). Based on these data it was concluded that in vertebrates VEGF-A signaling regulates angioblast migration to the midline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Coultas et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Verma et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Gore et al., 2012</xref>). To get direct, mechanistic and dynamic insight into angioblast migration and formation of the great vessels, we decided to investigate these processes in zebrafish embryos.</p><p>As previously published (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Nicoli et al., 2008</xref>), expression analysis of <italic>vegfaa,</italic> the gene for the main VEGF-A ortholog in zebrafish, showed the presence of transcripts in the somites between 12 and 15 hr post fertilization (hpf), that is the stage when angioblasts migrate to the midline (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B–F</xref>). To analyze whether Vegfa signaling, as previously proposed, is required for angioblast migration to the midline, we analyzed loss-of-function zebrafish embryos with deficiencies in the Vegfa signaling pathway resulting from genomic mutations as well as morpholino (MO) -mediated knockdown. To rule out developmental delays, we counted the somites of the embryos and fixed them for confocal analysis, when they had developed 16–17 somites (equivalent to 17 hpf). Surprisingly, neither Vegfa ligand depletion (<italic>vegfaa/vegfab</italic> MO) nor a null mutation in the gene encoding the VEGFR2 ortholog (<italic>kdrl</italic>) interfered with angioblast migration in zebrafish embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H,J</xref>), although Vegfa signaling dependent phenotypes, like failure to form the intersegmental vessels, could be observed after 24 hpf (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Additionally, pharmacological inhibition of Vegfr2 signaling from 6 to 17 hpf did not impair angioblast migration to the midline (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). As activity of Sonic Hedgehog (Shh) in the midline has been shown to induce <italic>vegfaa</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Lawson et al., 2002</xref>), we repeated the published experiments and blocked this process by chemical inhibition of Shh signaling using cyclopamine. In line with our previous experiments, angioblast migration was not affected after Shh inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). The sum of these data strongly indicates that Vegfa signaling is dispensable for angioblast specification or migration in zebrafish.</p><p>In order to identify the endogenous signal(s) guiding angioblast migration, we further analyzed the expression pattern of factors involved in cell motility and directed cell migration. As previously published (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Zeng et al., 2007</xref>), we detected the expression of Apelin, a short secreted peptide encoded by the <italic>apln</italic> gene<italic>,</italic> by the NC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref>). At the same time, transcripts of its two paralogous receptors <italic>apelin receptor a</italic> (<italic>aplnra</italic>) and <italic>apelin receptor b</italic> (<italic>aplnrb</italic>) were present in angioblasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A,B</xref>; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Scott et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Zeng et al., 2007</xref>]). Using MO-mediated gene knockdown, we observed that both <italic>aplnra</italic> and <italic>aplnrb</italic> are important for midline migration of angioblasts. While absence of each individual receptor reduced the efficiency of migration towards the midline, double depletion completely abolished this process (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="other" rid="media2">Video 2</xref>). We used TALEN or CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene editing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hwang et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Jao et al., 2013</xref>) to introduce mutations in either the <italic>aplnra</italic> or the <italic>aplnrb</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). As our MO-based analysis already indicated an additive effect of both receptor genes, we analyzed the phenotypes of the offspring of <italic>aplnra</italic><sup><italic>+/−</italic></sup><italic>;aplnrb</italic><sup><italic>+/−</italic></sup> double heterozygous parents. The embryos were all individually scored for their phenotype regarding angioblast midline migration into four categories (normal, mild, strong, stronger; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>) and then subjected to genotyping. Homozygous mutant embryos phenocopied the MO-induced phenotypes, additional loss of one or two copies of the second receptor increased the severity of the phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Additionally, we detected <italic>aplnrb</italic> transcripts together with the angioblast specification marker <italic>etv2</italic> indicating that both genes are expressed very early during angioblast specification. However, when we analyzed <italic>aplnra/aplnrb</italic> double deficient embryos, no difference in <italic>etv2</italic> expression was detectable by in situ hybridization indicating that Apln receptors only regulate angioblast migration, but not specification (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1E</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.06726.008</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Ela/Apelin receptor - signaling guides angioblast migration to the midline.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Angioblasts have migrated to the midline at 17 hpf in wild type, <italic>apln</italic><sup><italic>mu267</italic></sup> mutant or <italic>apln</italic> MO injected zebrafish embryos.

Your article has been evaluated by Janet Rossant (Senior editor), Tanya Whitfield (Reviewing Editor), and two additional reviewers.</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the other reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>While the reviewers have all found the work interesting, all three have concerns over the extent that the data support your conclusions, including the challenges that you propose to existing literature. The full reviews are appended below, but a summary of the main points that must be addressed is:</p><p>1) Data should be supplied to demonstrate the efficacy of each of the morpholinos used, especially (in the case of the Vegf study) when the authors are proposing that knockdown has no effect on angioblast migration. The authors should also show whether any of the morpholinos cause systemic non-specific effects, such as developmental delay. If mutants are available, it would be helpful to repeat the analysis in mutants.</p><p>2) Additional, and quantitative, data are needed to support the assertion that Ela acts as an instructive chemoattractant in this context and not simply as a motogen. As two of the reviewers have pointed out, the dataset is currently too small to be able to reach this conclusion. Further data should be supplied to illustrate this point.</p><p>It is vitally important to provide strong support for the two points above, as these are the proposed advances in the understanding of angioblast migration over previously published literature.</p><p>3) The relative contributions of Apln and Ela to angioblast migration should be clarified, both in the Results section and in the Abstract and Impact Statement.</p><p>4) A reduction in Shh signalling should be demonstrated to support the cyclopamine data.</p><p>5) Take care to acknowledge the findings of previously published work e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Pauli et al., 2014</xref>, and previously published expression patterns, appropriately.</p><p>6) Improve quantitation of all experiments: provide cell counts to support image panels; state n numbers wherever % values are shown, and ensure that appropriate statistical tests have been applied.</p><p>7) Correct typos, formatting and gene nomenclature throughout.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>This is an interesting and well-written short report examining the role of the Apelin receptor signalling pathway in angioblast migration in the zebrafish embryo.</p><p>The study challenges the current VEGF model for angioblast migration to the midline, and also proposes that in this context, the ligand Elabela functions as a chemoattractant rather than a motogen, again challenging previous interpretations in the published literature. Although the authors present some interesting preliminary observations to support these challenges, the data need further analysis and quantitation to strengthen the authors' conclusions.</p><p>The paper relies on morpholino (MO) knockdown for a number of experiments. Given the current scepticism in the field surrounding the use of MOs, it is particularly important to demonstrate that the MO experiments are justified and rigorous. The authors give references to previously published work for each MO they use, but nevertheless it would be helpful to show data (e.g. antibody or RNA splicing data demonstrating specific knockdown), or give a statement, to comment on the specificity and efficacy of each MO.</p><p>Confidence in the MO data is especially important given that the main phenotype that is shown for many of the experiments (a failure of angioblasts to migrate to the midline) could also be explained by a generalised developmental delay. It is therefore important to demonstrate that the MOs do not cause any general developmental delay (e.g. by showing a brightfield image of the whole embryo, and providing quantitative information about, for example, somite number).</p><p>The challenge to the VEGF model, a major conclusion of the manuscript, is based on just two data panels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), with no accompanying quantitation. For the <italic>vegfaa</italic> MO experiment, notwithstanding the caveats mentioned above for MO use, there do appear to be a few green cells beyond the midline, but the picture is so heavily cropped that it is not possible to assess this properly. The authors should provide some quantitation, together with further information to show that the MO is indeed disrupting VEGF signalling, to strengthen their conclusions for this experiment. The authors state that <italic>vegfaa</italic> is the 'main ortholog' in zebrafish, but it would also be helpful to know whether there are any other <italic>vegf</italic> genes or isoforms expressed at the relevant time and place, and whether these are affected by <italic>vegfaa</italic> MO knockdown or not. The mutant VEGFR (<italic>kdrl</italic>) analysis is more convincing, but again, are there other genes or isoforms that might function redundantly with the <italic>kdrl</italic> receptor?</p><p>The second challenge to existing literature, that Elabela (in this context) acts a chemoattractant rather than a motogen, is also supported only weakly, being based on a single supplementary figure panel (Figure 3–figure supplement 1D) showing one (or possibly two) green angioblasts in an ectopic dorsal position near to the ectopic Elabela-expressing (red) cells. This needs some further examples and quantitiation to support the authors' conclusion.</p><p>Quantitation:</p><p>The % data shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2 fig3 fig4">Figures 2C, 3C and 4B</xref> must be accompanied by corresponding n numbers, preferably shown directly on the graphs.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>. A <italic>t</italic>-test would not be recommended for an experiment involving more than one experimental condition. This analysis should be repeated using ANOVA or an equivalent test. The graph should use a bar to show which columns are being compared (presumably each of the experimental situations with the control).</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>Helker C. et al. demonstrate the essential role for Elabela (Ela)-Apelin (Apln) receptor (Aplnr) signaling in the initial assembly of angioblasts as a vascular cord in the midline. Unexpectedly, <italic>vegfa</italic> is not required as a chemoattractant for angioblast migration, while Elabela, a secretary peptide from the notochord, functions as an angioblast chemoattractant. The data has been convincingly demonstrated using several gene mutants (<italic>krdl</italic><sup>-/-</sup>, <italic>ela</italic><sup>br13-/-</sup>, <italic>apln</italic> <sup>mu267-/-</sup>, and <italic>noto</italic>) and their morphant.</p><p>The objectives written and the findings shown in the present manuscript are clear; however, there are several points should be addressed. There are several statements that are not supported by their results in the present study.</p><p>Major concerns:</p><p>1) Requirement of Apln for angioblast migration:</p><p>The authors claim that not only Ela but also Apln guides angioblasts to the midline in the Results section and in the Title. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, the data of <italic>apln</italic><sup><italic>mu267-/-</italic></sup> clearly show that Apln is not required for angioblast migration. However, the authors point to the requirement of Apln using the embryos of the <italic>ela</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> and <italic>apln</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup>. On the contrary, they state the impact of Ela (instead of Apln)-Aplnr signaling in the Impact Statement. This interpretation might puzzle the readers. Therefore, they need to re-interpret the data and re-write the manuscript including the Title.</p><p>2) Vegf or Vegfa:</p><p>The authors use &quot;Vegf&quot; and &quot;Vegfa&quot; in the Abstract and main text. This inconsistency should be corrected not to mislead the readers. Are other <italic>vegf</italic> members except Vegfa are thought to regulate angioblast migration in the previous papers? According to their results, the conclusion might be that Vegfa-Vegfr2 signaling is required for angioblast migration toward the midline. Therefore, they should rewrite the manuscript by keeping the consistency when they use the similar words.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>Helker and colleagues provide evidence for new roles of previously identified small peptides Apelin and Elabela in guiding angioblasts towards the embryonic midline during zebrafish embryogenesis. Previous studies implicated Vascular endothelial growth factor in convergence of angioblasts towards the embryonic midline, where they coalesce to build the first embryonic vessels. The authors first present evidence from zebrafish against the requirement for Vegf in angioblast migration towards the midline. Rather, they proposed, Apelin and Elabela, have partially redundant function to guide angioblasts to the midline by acting through the Apelin receptors. Apelin, Apelin GPCR Receptor axis has been previously implicated in cardiac progenitor cell convergence and cell fate specification, by Scott et al., and Zeng et al., in 2007. Elabela acting through Apelin receptors has been shown to be required for gastrulation cell movements and both heart and endoderm development by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chng et al., 2013</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Pauli et al., 2014</xref>. However, neither Apelin nor Elabela have been proposed to affect gastrulation cell movements acting as guidance molecules, with Elabela being considered a motogen. The authors employ morpholino oligonucleotides and mutations to show that Apelin and Elabela expressed in the notochord have partially redundant function in angioblast migration. Moreover, <italic>apelin</italic> receptors <italic>a</italic> and <italic>b</italic> expressed in angioblasts also have redundant function in this process. Therefore the proposed role of Apelin/Elabela/Apelin receptor signaling to guide angioblasts towards the embryonic midline would be a significant advance. However, the evidence in support of these conclusions are not compelling. There are also problems with the results and their interpretations. These problems should be addressed before the manuscript becomes suitable for publication.</p><p>The most novel conclusion of this work is that Elabela/Apelin/Apelin receptor axis has an instructive role in angioblast migration, by guiding them to the midline. The key line of evidence is that when cells ectopically expressing Ela were present in Ela mutant: &quot;We found that individual Ela overexpressing cell were indeed capable of attracting angioblast migration to ectopic locations […]. our data therefore demonstrate, that Ela acts as a chemoattractant for angioblasts during midline migration&quot;.</p><p>The presented data is not compelling. The authors observed occasional overlap between angioblasts and these Ela expressing cells. An alternative interpretation is that Ela expressed in ectopic location increased motility of angioblasts and some of them wondered in ectopic locations.</p><p>The conclusion about Vegf signaling not being required in angioblast migration is based on the observation that &quot;neither Vegf ligand depletion (<italic>vegfaa</italic> MO) nor a null mutation in the gene encoding the VEGFR2 ortholog (<italic>kdrl</italic>) interfered with angioblast migration in zebrafish embryos.&quot; However, there is no data showing the degree of loss-of-function for morpholino or for <italic>kdrl</italic> mutant.</p><p>Likewise, when the authors inhibit <italic>Shh</italic> signaling using cyclopamine, no quantitative data is presented documenting the degree of <italic>Shh</italic> signaling inhibition. Reduced expression of <italic>vegf</italic> is shown by in situ hybridization, but this is not a quantitative results. Such body of evidence is not sufficient to support the authors' conclusion regarding:</p><p>Does mutation in <italic>apelin</italic> gene affect <italic>elabela</italic> expression and vice versa?</p><p>Do mutations in <italic>kdrl</italic> affect phenotypes of <italic>apelin</italic>, <italic>elabela</italic> or <italic>apelin</italic> receptor single mutants?</p><p>The authors conclude that simultaneous knockdown of <italic>aplnra</italic> and <italic>b</italic> affects angioblast cell movement but not specification, based on morpholino interference. Whereas previously published morpholinos are used, appropriate experiments showing efficiency and specificity should be presented. Given that mutations for these receptors are available, they should be preferably employed.</p><p>Similar concerns are regarding <italic>apelin</italic> morpholino and <italic>apelin</italic> mutant experiments. Does <italic>apelin</italic> mutation lead to nonsense mediated degradation of <italic>apelin</italic> mRNA?</p><p>The authors conclude that angioblast migrate normally in <italic>apelin</italic> mutants, however, in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> it appears that ca. 30% of <italic>apelin</italic> mutants showed mild angioblast migration phenotype. This along with a strong enhancement of the phenotype of <italic>elabela</italic> mutant indicates that <italic>apelin</italic> is also required for angioblast migration.</p><p>In the Results the authors write that cardiomyocyte deficiency observed in <italic>aplnr</italic> deficient embryos could not be phenocopied by loss of <italic>apelin</italic> function. This is not correct; Scott et al., and Zeng et al. reported reduction of cardiomyocyte formation in <italic>apelin</italic> morphant embryos.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;The hormonal peptide Elabela guides angioblasts to the midline during vasculogenesis&quot; for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been favorably evaluated by Janet Rossant (Senior editor) and Tanya Whitfield (Reviewing Editor). The manuscript is much improved and most of the reviewers' recommendations have been addressed. Mutant phenotypes have been used to back up the morpholino data, and most of the requested control data have been provided to demonstrate the efficacy of morpholinos and compounds used. Description of relative roles for Apln and Ela in the migration of angioblasts is now much clearer.

If the data are not strong enough to be shown as a main figure, the conclusion should also be toned down: rather than stating that the data 'demonstrate' that Ela acts as a chemoattractant, wording such as 'the data support the interpretation that Ela is acting as a chemoattractant in this context, but further experiments and higher n numbers would be required to test this more rigorously' should be used.

Although the authors present some interesting preliminary observations to support these challenges, the data need further analysis and quantitation to strengthen the authors' conclusions</italic>.</p><p><italic>The paper relies on morpholino (MO) knockdown for a number of experiments. Given the current scepticism in the field surrounding the use of MOs, it is particularly important to demonstrate that the MO experiments are justified and rigorous. The authors give references to previously published work for each MO they use, but nevertheless it would be helpful to show data (e.g. antibody or RNA splicing data demonstrating specific knockdown), or give a statement, to comment on the specificity and efficacy of each MO</italic>.</p><p>As discussed above, we have now provided mutant data to complement MO data, wherever possible, for the Vegf studies we have used chemical inhibition of Vegfr2 as an alternative.</p><p><italic>Confidence in the MO data is especially important given that the main phenotype that is shown for many of the experiments (a failure of angioblasts to migrate to the midline) could also be explained by a generalised developmental delay. It is therefore important to demonstrate that the MOs do not cause any general developmental delay (e.g. by showing a brightfield image of the whole embryo, and providing quantitative information about, for example, somite number)</italic>.</p><p>We had already staged all embryos according to somite numbers, but failed to state this in the manuscript, we have changed the Methods section accordingly.</p><p><italic>The challenge to the VEGF model, a major conclusion of the manuscript, is based on just two data panels (</italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1"><italic>Figure 1C</italic></xref><italic>), with no accompanying quantitation. For the</italic> vegfaa <italic>MO experiment, notwithstanding the caveats mentioned above for MO use, there do appear to be a few green cells beyond the midline, but the picture is so heavily cropped that it is not possible to assess this properly. The authors should provide some quantitation, together with further information to show that the MO is indeed disrupting VEGF signalling, to strengthen their conclusions for this experiment. The authors state that</italic> vegfaa <italic>is the 'main ortholog' in zebrafish, but it would also be helpful to know whether there are any other</italic> vegf <italic>genes or isoforms expressed at the relevant time and place, and whether these are affected by</italic> vegfaa <italic>MO knockdown or not.

This inconsistency should be corrected not to mislead the readers. Are other</italic> vegf <italic>members except Vegfa are thought to regulate angioblast migration in the previous papers? According to their results, the conclusion might be that Vegfa-Vegfr2 signaling is required for angioblast migration toward the midline. Therefore, they should rewrite the manuscript by keeping the consistency when they use the similar words</italic>.</p><p>We now always specify Vegfa, and have re-written the manuscript accordingly.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3</italic>:</p><p><italic>Helker and colleagues provide evidence for new roles of previously identified small peptides Apelin and Elabela in guiding angioblasts towards the embryonic midline during zebrafish embryogenesis. Previous studies implicated Vascular endothelial growth factor in convergence of angioblasts towards the embryonic midline, where they coalesce to build the first embryonic vessels. The authors first present evidence from zebrafish against the requirement for Vegf in angioblast migration towards the midline. Rather, they proposed, Apelin and Elabela, have partially redundant function to guide angioblasts to the midline by acting through the Apelin receptors. Apelin, Apelin GPCR Receptor axis has been previously implicated in cardiac progenitor cell convergence and cell fate specification, by Scott et al., and Zeng et al., in 2007. Elabela acting through Apelin receptors has been shown to be required for gastrulation cell movements and both heart and endoderm development by</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4"><italic>Chng et al., 2013</italic></xref> <italic>and</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26"><italic>Pauli et al., 2014</italic></xref><italic>. However, neither Apelin nor Elabela have been proposed to affect gastrulation cell movements acting as guidance molecules, with Elabela being considered a motogen. The authors employ morpholino oligonucleotides and mutations to show that Apelin and Elabela expressed in the notochord have partially redundant function in angioblast migration. Moreover,</italic> apelin receptors a <italic>and</italic> b <italic>expressed in angioblasts also have redundant function in this process. Therefore the proposed role of Apelin/Elabela/Apelin receptor signaling to guide angioblasts towards the embryonic midline would be a significant advance. However, the evidence in support of these conclusions are not compelling. There are also problems with the results and their interpretations. These problems should be addressed before the manuscript becomes suitable for publication</italic>.</p><p><italic>The most novel conclusion of this work is that Elabela/Apelin/Apelin receptor axis has an instructive role in angioblast migration, by guiding them to the midline. The key line of evidence is that when cells ectopically expressing Ela were present in Ela mutant: &quot;We found that individual Ela overexpressing cell were indeed capable of attracting angioblast migration to ectopic locations&quot; […] our data therefore demonstrate, that Ela acts as a chemoattractant for angioblasts during midline migration&quot;</italic>.</p><p><italic>The presented data is not compelling. The authors observed occasional overlap between angioblasts and these Ela expressing cells. An alternative interpretation is that Ela expressed in ectopic location increased motility of angioblasts and some of them wondered in ectopic locations</italic>.</p><p>As described above, we have now added a new figure, in which distances between angioblast and control or <italic>ela</italic> expressing cells were measured. This analysis now shows a clear attractant role of Ela. By using <italic>noto</italic> or <italic>ta</italic> mutants, we have abolished <italic>ela</italic> and <italic>apln</italic> expression in the midline and could therefore score all angioblasts and not only those at very ectopic locations.</p><p><italic>The conclusion about Vegf signaling not being required in angioblast migration is based on the observation that &quot;neither Vegf ligand depletion (</italic>vegfaa <italic>MO) nor a null mutation in the gene encoding the VEGFR2 ortholog (</italic>kdrl<italic>) interfered with angioblast migration in zebrafish embryos.&quot; However, there is no data showing the degree of loss-of-function for morpholino or for</italic> kdrl <italic>mutant</italic>.</p><p>As described above this has been added, in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1–figure supplement 1</xref>.</p><p><italic>Likewise, when the authors inhibit Shh signaling using cyclopamine, no quantitative data is presented documenting the degree of Shh signaling inhibition.
