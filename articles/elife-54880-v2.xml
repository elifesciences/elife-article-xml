transcriptional program regulated by heat shock factor 1 (Hsf1) in eukaryotic cells. Activation of this heat shock response is triggered by heat-induced misfolding of newly synthesized polypeptides, and so has been thought to depend on ongoing protein synthesis. Here, using the budding yeast <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>, we report the discovery that Hsf1 can be robustly activated when protein synthesis is inhibited, so long as cells undergo cytosolic acidification. Heat shock has long been known to cause transient intracellular acidification which, for reasons which have remained unclear, is associated with increased stress resistance in eukaryotes. We demonstrate that acidification is required for heat shock response induction in translationally inhibited cells, and specifically affects Hsf1 activation. Physiological heat-triggered acidification also increases population fitness and promotes cell cycle reentry following heat shock. Our results uncover a previously unknown adaptive dimension of the well-studied eukaryotic heat shock response.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>heat shock</kwd><kwd>stress response</kwd><kwd>Hsf1</kwd><kwd>pH</kwd><kwd>yeast</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM126547</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Drummond</surname><given-names>D.

Cells across the tree of life possess the capacity to adaptively respond to primordial stressesâheat, starvation, hypoxia, noxious compoundsâin a conserved program involving the production of so-called heat shock proteins, many of which act as molecular chaperones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Lindquist, 1986</xref>). Transcription of heat shock genes surges at the onset of stress, reaching as much as a thousand fold during thermal stress, with more modest induction accompanying nutrient withdrawal and diverse other stresses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Lindquist, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Zid and O'Shea, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Morano et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gidalevitz et al., 2011</xref>). In eukaryotes, the transcriptional stress response is controlled by multiple factors, with the heat shock transcription factor Hsf1 regulating induction of a core group of chaperones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">SolÃ­s et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Pincus et al., 2018</xref>). Basal levels of chaperones repress Hsf1 by direct binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Shi et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Zheng et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Krakowiak et al., 2018</xref>), and removal of this repression in the absence of stress suffices to activate transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Zheng et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Krakowiak et al., 2018</xref>). Induced chaperones, in turn, assist with protein folding, as well as preventing and dispersing stress-induced molecular aggregates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Vabulas et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Richter et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cherkasov et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Walters et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kroschwald et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kroschwald et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>The mechanism by which the Hsf1-mediated transcriptional response is induced following physiological heat shock is incomplete and has remained so since the responseâs discovery nearly 60 years ago (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Ritossa, 1962</xref>). In the currently accepted model for heat-triggered Hsf1 activation, events proceed as follows. Hsf1 is constitutively bound and repressed by the molecular chaperone Hsp70 before stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Krakowiak et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Zheng et al., 2016</xref>). Heat stress is thought to cause deleterious protein unfolding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Richter et al., 2010</xref>) (misfolding) which exposes hydrophobic regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Vabulas et al., 2010</xref>) for which Hsp70 has high affinity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">RÃ¼diger et al., 1997</xref>). Titration of Hsp70 away from Hsf1 suffices to induce Hsf1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Zheng et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Krakowiak et al., 2018</xref>). Despite the crucial role misfolded proteins play in this model, no specific endogenous eukaryotic protein has been demonstrated to misfold in vivo in response to a sublethal heat shock. Instead, newly synthesized polypeptides (which include nascent chains still being synthesized and complete polypeptides which have yet to reach their native structure) are thought to serve as Hsf1 inducers during heat stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baler et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Tanabe et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Li et al., 2017</xref>). Suppression of newly synthesized polypeptides by translation inhibition suppresses the heat-induced transcription of genes regulated by Hsf1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baler et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Beckmann et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Albert et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Masser et al., 2019</xref>). Consequently, ongoing translation has been deemed a requirement for Hsf1 activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Masser et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Notably, the same diverse environmental changes which stimulate the transcriptional response are also accompanied by intracellular acidificationâa drop in cytosolic pH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Weitzel et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bright and Ellis, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Munder et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kroschwald et al., 2015</xref>). Like the transcriptional response, stress-induced acidification is broadly conserved in eukaryotes, including mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bright and Ellis, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Yao and Haddad, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Tombaugh and Sapolsky, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">DÃ­az et al., 2016</xref>), insects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Drummond et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Zhong et al., 1999</xref>), plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Ishizawa, 2014</xref>), and fungi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Weitzel et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kroschwald et al., 2015</xref>). Although acidification has sometimes been viewed as a toxic consequence of stress, particularly in studies of hypoxia and ischemia-associated acidosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Ishizawa, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Tombaugh and Sapolsky, 1993</xref>), the cytoprotective effects of short-term acidification were identified decades ago (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Tombaugh and Sapolsky, 1993</xref>). Recent work has shown that interfering with energy-depletion-induced acidification in budding yeast and in fission yeast, which diverged from budding yeast more than half a billion years ago (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hedges et al., 2015</xref>), compromises the fitness of both species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Munder et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Joyner et al., 2016</xref>). Furthermore, many mature proteins associated with stress-induced condensation show a strong dependence on pH for their self-association, whether by polymerization or phase separation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Petrovska et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kroschwald et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Munder et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Riback et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Franzmann et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>What role does stress-induced cellular acidification play in the transcriptional response to heat shock? Early work in <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> produced mixed results: one study indicated that acidification had little impact on the production of heat shock proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Drummond et al., 1986</xref>), while later work showed that Hsf1 trimerization, a key activation step, could be induced by acidification in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Zhong et al., 1999</xref>). More recently, acidification during stress has been shown to influence cell signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dechant et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Gutierrez et al., 2017</xref>) and appears to be cytoprotective (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Munder et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Joyner et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Coote et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Panaretou and Piper, 1990</xref>). The extent to which this adaptive effect of pH depends on the core transcriptional stress response remains unknown. What has been demonstrated is that cell cycle reentry after heat shock follows the dissolution of stress granules, which depends on the products of stress-induced transcriptional changes: molecular chaperones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kroschwald et al., 2015</xref>). These results suggest a clear link between stress-triggered transcription of heat shock genes and growth. Exactly how do intracellular acidification, transcriptional induction, chaperone production, and cellular growth interrelate following heat shock?</p><p>To answer this question, we developed a single-cell system to both monitor and manipulate cytosolic pH while tracking the induction of molecular chaperones in budding yeast. We find that acidification universally promotes the heat shock response, and that when canonical triggers for the responseâthe newly synthesized polypeptidesâare suppressed, acidification is required for cells to respond to heat shock. Acidification alone, however, is insufficient to induce a response. We measure fitness on both the population and single-cell level and find that in both cases, the physiological stress-associated drop in pH promotes fitness. Global measurement of transcript levels as a function of intracellular pH during heat shock reveals specific suppression of core Hsf1 target genes when intracellular acidification is prevented.</p><p>The mechanism underlying Hsf1âs pH-dependent activation remains open. However, our results are consistent with a previous hypothesis positing a role for temperature- and pH-dependent phase separation in sensing heat stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Riback et al., 2017</xref>), leading us to predict a specific mechanism in which elevated pH suppresses a temperature-sensitive phase separation process.</p><p>Our results link cytosolic acidification to the regulation of the canonical transcriptional heat shock response and subsequent stress adaptation in single cells, indicating that pH regulation plays a central role in the Hsf1-mediated stress response.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>A high-throughput assay allows quantification of single-cell responses to heat shock</title><p>Yeast thrive in acidic environments, and spend significant cellular resources on the activity of membrane-associated proton pumps which keep the cytoplasm at a resting pH of around 7.5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Orij et al., 2011</xref>).

To test whether acidification still promoted the stress response even under conditions where the concentration of newly synthesized polypeptides would be sharply limited, we first used brief glucose withdrawal, a physiologically relevant condition which is known to rapidly and reversibly inhibit translation of most cellular mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ashe et al., 2000</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). We heat-stressed cells, then returned them to favorable growth conditions (2% glucose, 30Â°C) to recover. Strikingly, we found that even in the absence of translation and presumably misfolded newly synthesized polypeptides, cells that could acidify during stress responded almost identically to cells stressed while global translation was unperturbed. However, cells that were not actively translating and also were unable to acidify during stress almost completely failed to respond (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>, right hand side).</p><p>We confirmed that the sharp dependence of heat-shock protein production on intracellular pH was not due to differences in intracellular acidification resulting from translation inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1C</xref>, compare to A; pre-shock pH change is an artifact of smoothing) or to differences in fluorophore maturation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4âfigure supplement 1A</xref>), and that translational suppression did not depend on media pH (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). To determine that the differences we saw were due to translation state and not nutrient withdrawal, we performed the same set of experiments with cells grown in maltose, a sugar which does not cause translational suppression when rapidly withdrawn (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ashe et al., 2000</xref>), an effect we confirmed and demonstrated was independent of external pH (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1A</xref>). As with cells in glucose, cells stressed in the presence of maltose were able to respond to heat shock regardless of whether they were able to acidify. Crucially, unlike glucose withdrawal, heat shock following maltose withdrawal resulted in production of Ssa4 during recovery independent of acidification (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1B</xref>). These results indicate that ongoing translation, rather than nutrient status, predicts the cellular response.</p><p>As an additional test of the connection between translation status and the heat shock response, we treated cells with cycloheximide, an inhibitor of translation elongation, followed by heat stress where acidification was either allowed or prevented. Because cycloheximide prevented translation of the Ssa4 protein, we instead measured induction of the <italic>SSA4</italic> transcript using qPCR. We found that when cells were able to acidify, they robustly responded to heat shock regardless of whether they could translate. When acidification was prevented, translational repression markedly inhibited the transcriptional response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>).</p><p>From these data we conclude that rapid, robust chaperone expression following heat shock depends either on ongoing translation, as previous studies have found, or on intracellular acidification (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>), an effect which has not been reported before. We therefore set out to determine whether this observed effect on Ssa4 extended to the broader transcriptional response.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Failure to acidify during heat shock impairs the core transcriptional stress response regulated by Hsf1</title><p>Our results thus far link pH regulation to the translation of a limited number of heat shock proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4âfigure supplement 1A</xref>). Since the heat shock response is characterized by conserved changes in transcription of multiple regulons, we used RNA-seq to characterize the stress response with and without acidification and under various translation conditions, using the pH of the media to prevent or allow acidification and treatment with 200 Î¼g/mL cycloheximide or acute glucose withdrawal to prevent translation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B,E</xref>). As controls, we assayed cells exposed to the same treatments without heat shock to account for transcriptional changes due to changes in translation and media pH. Although the results for translation arrest with both cycloheximide and glucose withdrawal are often similar, the glucose withdrawal results are more varied, and for clarity only the cycloheximide data are shown here.

Genes whose relative levels are independent of pH lie along the diagonal, genes preferentially induced in acidified cells lie above the diagonal, and genes repressed by acidification lie below.

To further differentiate between induced genes and characterize the pH sensitivity of the response, we examined the transcription factors responsible for regulating the response to heat shock.</p><p>Three main transcription factors regulate yeastâs heat shock response: Hsf1, which regulates chaperone-centric stress responses in all eukaryotes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Morano et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Mendillo et al., 2012</xref>), and Msn2/4, a pair of paralogous factors limited to fungi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gasch et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Estruch, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Nicholls et al., 2004</xref>). Recent work has used multiple methods to clearly define the regulons of both (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">SolÃ­s et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Pincus et al., 2018</xref>) and to identify genes regulated specifically by one or the other. We observed induction of both regulons when cells are stressed without translation, but substantially less induction of the Hsf1 regulon in cells prevented from acidifying (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3âfigure supplement 2B</xref>). To quantify the sensitivity to acidification we calculated the mRNA abundance ratio after heat shocks with and without acidification. The distributions of ratios for all genes are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>; distributions with more genes preferentially induced in acidified cells lie further to the right. The pH sensitivity of the Hsf1 regulon is remarkably clear when cells are translationally inhibited (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). Because the Msn2/4 regulon continues to induce robustly independent of pH and translational status, a broader effect of pH on transcriptional processes cannot explain Hsf1âs sensitivity.</p><p>How unusual is the Hsf1 regulonâs sensitivity to pH during heat shock? We assessed the pH sensitivity of the regulons of a broad panel of transcription factors for which data are available under heat shock conditions (see MaterialsÂ and methods) by comparing the mean heat-induced fold change in each regulon with and without acidification. In translationally active cells, no regulons show much acidification-dependent induction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>, left). However, when we inhibited translation with cycloheximide, Hsf1 became a clear outlier, showing strong acidification-related induction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). Hsf1 pH sensitivity also emerged when translation was attenuated by glucose withdrawal, although the cellular response was more complicated overall. In line with previous resultsÂ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Zid and O'Shea, 2014</xref>), acute glucose withdrawal alone caused some induction of heat shock genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3âfigure supplement 3B</xref>), however Hsf1 is still preferentially active in cells that acidify during heat shock in a way which cannot be explained by the mock treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3âfigure supplement 3A</xref>). We computed the pH sensitivity of all other upregulated genes outside the Hsf1 and Msn2/4 regulons to determine whether acidification affected the global transcriptional response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3âfigure supplement 2C</xref>). When translation is repressed by cycloheximide treatment prior to heat shock, induction of other upregulated genes is not pH-sensitive. When translation is repressed by acute glucose withdrawal, other upregulated genes show some pH sensitivity, but the Hsf1 regulon is more pH-sensitive (p <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf7"><mml:mrow><mml:mi/><mml:mo>&lt;</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2.2</mml:mn><mml:mo>Ã</mml:mo><mml:msup><mml:mn>10</mml:mn><mml:mrow><mml:mo>-</mml:mo><mml:mn>16</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msup></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>, Wilcoxon rank sum test). We conclude that Hsf1âs regulon stands apart in its pH-dependent induction during heat shock when translation is inhibited.</p><p>Finally, we widened our search to include other transcription factors that change their regulation during heat shock but have only been annotated under non-stress conditions; the full distributions for each regulon are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>. When translation is arrested during heat shock, Hsf1 is the only transcription factor examined that shows significant sensitivity to acidification. Interestingly, the regulon of another transcription factor, Ifh1, was pH-sensitive only under conditions where cells were translationally active (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>, left hand side). The apparent pH-dependent repression of Ifh1âs regulon could represent suppression of activation or a pH-sensitive mRNA decay process. Repression of the Ifh1 regulon depends on the synthesis of ribosomal proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Albert et al., 2019</xref>); we find that it also depends on intracellular acidification, but unlike Hsf1 this pH sensitivity is not dependent on translational status.</p><p>From these results, we conclude that intracellular acidification differentially affects the regulons of several transcription factors. Most strikingly, when cellular translation is haltedâconditions under which classical models predict little or no Hsf1 activationâwe find that intracellular acidification specifically promotes induction of genes under control of Hsf1. This highlights a previously unknown facet of the regulation of this important transcription factor. We consider potential mechanisms for this pH sensitivity in the Discussion.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Manipulating intracellular pH during heat shock reveals the precise relationship between pH and the heat shock response</title><p>To determine the quantitative relationship between intracellular pH during heat shock and chaperone production, we sought a means to manipulate intracellular pH which would circumvent cellular regulation of the proton gradient.

Ionophores allow ions to penetrate cell membranes, temporarily destroying the electrochemical gradient. Nigericin is a K<sup>+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> antiporter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Freedman, 2012</xref>) which has been used in a variety of biological systems to equilibrate intracellular and extracellular pH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Modi et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Nakata et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Thomas et al., 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Christen et al., 1982</xref>).

Treatment with buffer and ionophore delayed the chaperone production in all samples relative to untreated cells, but did so consistently and did not affect the ultimate induction level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4âfigure supplement 1B</xref>), supporting the assumption that pH-dependent differences between treatments can be appropriately interpreted.</p><p>Using the ionophore to manipulate intracellular pH, we were able to reproduce the same phenotype we observed in cells stressed in media with and without the ability to acidifyâpopulations stressed at the physiological stress pH (6.8, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) were able to respond, and those stressed at the resting pH were not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). Furthermore, we found that additional acidification during stress, as low as pH 5, did not increase or decrease the response compared to physiological acidification.</p><p>Our initial experiments involved allowing cells to recover in media buffered to the resting pH, ensuring that the differences in the stress response were due to pH during stress. However, we noticed that proton availability after stress seemed to influence the response. Remarkably, when we heat shocked cells and prevented acidification, but allowed them to recover in acidic media, these cells were able to induce Ssa4 where cells recovering in buffered medium were not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>, compare to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). This recovery-media-pH-dependent induction occurred with a pH-dependent delay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>) which was maximal when cells did not experience acidification during stress. To ensure that this was not due to treatment with the ionophore, we performed the same experiment without ionophore, stressing cells in media that was acidic or at the resting pH, and recovering in acidic media. The same pattern of induction was observed: cells recovering in acidic media induced Ssa4, but with a substantial delay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). What could explain the dependence on media pH during recovery for induction of the stress response? One possibility is that acidification occurs after stress and enables the induction of the stress response; we test this proposal in the following section.</p><p>We draw several conclusions from these data. The physiologically observed acidification of the cytosol is necessary for rapid heat shock protein production when translation is repressed. Physiological levels of acidification alone do not activate the response. Depriving translationally inactive cells of the opportunity to acidify virtually silences chaperone production after heat shock, an effect which is mostly transcriptional. Cells offered the chance to acidify after heat shock are still capable of mounting a response albeit with a substantial delay. All this suggests that intracellular pH during recovery plays a significant role in the production of heat shock proteins, so we turned our attention to that possibility.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Reversal of stress-induced acidification during recovery promotes heat shock protein production in single cells</title><p>How does intracellular pH during recovery influence heat shock protein production?

We noted that on average, cells that had failed to return to the resting pH range also failed to induce Ssa4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>).

We found that the lower-expressing subpopulation had a distinctly acid-shifted intracellular pH compared to the high-expressing cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>), confirming our prediction. Particularly at 120 min of recovery, when we see strong bimodality (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplement 1C</xref>), we also see strong separation of the intracellular pH distributions, with the low-expressing cells displaying intracellular pH values that fall below the ordinary unstressed range.</p><p>These data demonstrate that although cells require acidification during stress to mount a rapid response, the response further depends on subsequent reversal of acidification. Return to the resting pH predicts the dynamics of chaperone production.

To what extent do differences in expression cause observed differences in fitness? A causal model is motivated by the repeated observation that chaperone expression and subsequent dispersal of stress-induced aggregation precedes resumption of normal translation and progression through the cell cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cherkasov et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kroschwald et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>A causal, directed link from pH to chaperone expression to growth predicts that (1) cell-to-cell variation in pH will predict cell-to-cell variation in both chaperone expression and growth, and (2) cells which have resumed progression through the cell cycle will have high levels of chaperones. To test these predictions, we monitored variation in cell cycle progression and chaperone expression as a function of intracellular pH in single cells within identically treated populations.</p><p>Cellular growth and division reflect progression through the cell cycle. In budding yeast, this progress can be tracked morphologically, because emergence of a bud signals that cells have exited the gap one phase (G<sub>1</sub>) and have passed through the START cell-cycle checkpoint (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hartwell, 1974</xref>). Heat stress causes yeast cells to arrest in G<sub>1</sub>, an unbudded state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Rowley et al., 1993</xref>). The presence of a bud following stress indicates that the cell has re-entered the cell cycle and begun reproducing. Cells without a bud cannot be confidently assigned to a growth phase because they may either be arrested in G<sub>1</sub> or merely passing through this phase during active growth. To classify budded cells, we adapted a microscopy-based assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Rowley et al., 1993</xref>) for flow cytometry, using the pulse width of the forward scatter channel to measure cell (or cell plus bud) length. From the resulting data we scored cells as budded, unbudded, or ambiguous (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>); see Materials and methods and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6âfigure supplement 1</xref> for full details (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Tzur et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hoffman, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hewitt and Nebe-Von-Caron, 2004</xref>). Within these morphological categories, we then could assess the relationships between cell-cycle state, intracellular pH, and chaperone expression.</p><p>Cells heat-shocked at pH 6.8, mimicking normal acidification, showed robust chaperone expression during recovery. In contrast, cells shocked at pH 7.5, preventing acidification, created a large subpopulation of cells in which chaperone expression was suppressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). Virtually all cells which could be confidently assigned to the budded state showed high chaperone expression, and nearly all cells showing low chaperone expression were found in the unbudded state. Low-expression, unbudded cells also showed near-uniform reduction in pH (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>, lower left panel), consistent with the dysregulation of pH observed at the population level. These observations match both above predictions of a causal relationship between chaperone expression and cell-cycle resumption, modulated by intracellular pH.</p><p>We also used the proportion of budded and unbudded cells as an orthogonal measure of population-level fitness, measuring resumption of the cell cycle as opposed to cell doubling. During recovery, cells are released from heat-induced G<sub>1</sub> arrest en masse, leading to a temporary synchronization of the population with a coordinated increase in the proportion of budded cells, which eventually returns to the steady-state value for exponentially growing cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Rowley et al., 1993</xref>) as seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref> (left, dark red trace). After a 42Â°C, 20 min heat shock without pH manipulation, the percentage of budded cells peaked just before two hours of recovery (dashed line in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>). In pH-manipulated cells, if the pH experienced with elevated temperature was close to the native stress-associated pH, this recovery peak occurred at approximately the same time as in unmanipulated cells. However, cells that experienced a more acidic or more basic pH during heat shock showed a delay in the occurrence of the budding peak (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>, summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>), in agreement with the difference in growth rates shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>.</p><p>By measuring growth in multiple ways, we have shown that post-stress resumption of growth is tuned to particular stress-associated cytoplasmic pH values. Moreover, fitness positively correlates both with increased chaperone production and with restoration of the pre-stress pH in populations and in individual cells. Resumption of growth is consistent, at the population and single-cell level, with induced chaperones contributing to release of stress-induced cell-cycle arrest as others have reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kroschwald et al., 2015</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>What is the physiological significance of the broadly conserved, transient intracellular acidification triggered by stress in eukaryotes? By decoupling changes in intracellular pH from heat shock in budding yeast, we have discovered that the canonical transcriptional stress response mediated by heat shock factor 1 (Hsf1) depends on cellular acidification. When cells are translationally suppressed, such as following glucose withdrawal, transient acidification becomes a requirement for achieving a robust transcriptional response. Even in translationally active cells, acidification promotes induction. Restoration of resting pH and chaperone protein expression increase competitive fitness by promoting reentry into the cell cycle and overall population growth rates, indicating that transient acidification is an adaptive component of the heat shock response.</p><p>Our initial results are consistent with the longstanding view that misfolding of newly synthesized polypeptides can serve as Hsf1 inducers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baler et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Masser et al., 2019</xref>), presumably through recruitment of Hsp70 away from its repressive association with Hsf1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Zheng et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Krakowiak et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Li et al., 2017</xref>). However, we have discovered an alternative activation pathway for Hsf1 under conditions when newly synthesized proteins are in short supplyâwhen translational activity is low, such as following starvation or pharmacological inhibition. Here, intracellular pH plays a decisive causal role in Hsf1 activation following heat shock. Either ongoing translation or intracellular acidification is required, and the absence of either signal leads to suppression of the Hsf1-mediated transcriptional response during heat shock (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>).</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>The transcriptional response to heat shock, chaperone production, and cellular fitness are promoted by intracellular acidification.</title><p>The key step in initiating the transcriptional heat shock response is the release of Hsf1 repression by Hsp70 through titration of the chaperone via client binding.

However, cells that are not actively translating (right hand side) can still respond to heat shock, dependent on transient intracellular acidification, either during or after the temperature increase. We predict that pH-sensitive, stress-sensing proteins, similar to those already discovered, can act to titrate Hsp70, relieving Hsf1 repression and activating the transcriptional heat shock response.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-54880-fig7-v2.tif"/></fig><p>What is the source of the protons required for adaptive acidification? Our results strongly indicate that extracellular protons entering the cell following heat shock are the dominant cause of acidification. Simply placing translationally inactive cells in medium buffered to the resting cellular pH is sufficient to suppress the heat shock response during an otherwise robust heat shock, suggesting that no intracellular store of protons is liberated to cause acidification. Membrane permeability to small molecules increases with temperature in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Coote et al., 1994</xref>), and proton permeability specifically has been shown to increase with temperature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">van de Vossenberg et al., 1999</xref>), providing a likely mechanism for temperature-dependent acidification when a plasma-membrane-spanning proton gradient is present. (We discuss below certain physiological scenarios in which an ample source of extracellular protons and heat shock will reliably co-occur.)</p><p>Our results indicate a close causal connection between intracellular pH, chaperone production, and cellular growth. A surprising yet consistent detail is that cells must restore their resting pH before producing high levels of molecular chaperones. Previous work has demonstrated that heat shock causes changes in intracellular pH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Weitzel et al., 1985</xref>) and that intracellular pH controls growth rate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Orij et al., 2012</xref>). Our results are consistent with these findings, while adding critical steps, such as demonstrating that chaperone production sits between pH and growth in the causal chain, and that these dynamics can be seen at the single-cell level.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>The pH dependence of Hsf1 points to pH-dependent substrates of Hsf1âs repressor, Hsp70</title><p>Why is acidification required to mount the transcriptional heat shock response under certain conditions? Acidification in the absence of heat shock, at least to pH levels which would normally follow heat shock, is insufficient to activate Hsf1, ruling out direct sensing of pH by Hsf1 or its repressor Hsp70. On the flip side, Hsf1 can be robustly activated without a drop in pH, so long as cells are translationally active, indicating that acidification is not necessary for Hsf1 activation. Recent key studies have demonstrated that production of Hsp70 binding substrates that titrate Hsp70 away from Hsf1 suffices to induce Hsf1 in the absence of heat shock (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Zheng et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Krakowiak et al., 2018</xref>). All these results are consistent with the standard misfolding model: newly synthesized polypeptides misfold in response to heat shock, leading to recruitment of Hsp70, which causes Hsf1 activation. The pressing question is how Hsf1 is activated in the absence of newly synthesized polypeptides. Previous results argue against widespread heat-induced misfolding of mature endogenous proteins in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Wallace et al., 2015</xref>). Here, consistent with those results, cells show marked repression of the heat shock response at 42Â°C when translation is attenuated and resting pH is maintained, suggesting that misfolding caused by temperature, if it occurs, is insufficient to trigger the Hsf1 response. The remaining possibility is that Hsp70 substrates can be produced without ongoing translation in an acidification-dependent manner.</p><p>That is, we seek a mature protein which, in a heat- <italic>and</italic> pH-dependent manner, changes its state in a way which recruits Hsp70. Remarkably, a profusion of such candidates exists. Nearly two hundred mature endogenous proteins in yeast form reversible condensates in response to heat shock which under extreme stress coalesce into stress granules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Wallace et al., 2015</xref>). Hsp70 colocalizes with stress granules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cherkasov et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Walters et al., 2015</xref>), and stress-granule dispersal depends on Hsp70 and other chaperones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cherkasov et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Walters et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kroschwald et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kroschwald et al., 2018</xref>). Three individual protein components of stress granules, poly(A)-binding protein Pab1, poly(U)-binding protein Pub1, and the DEAD-box RNA helicase Ded1, condense by phase separation in vitro when exposed to heat in a pH-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Riback et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kroschwald et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Iserman et al., 2020</xref>). Pab1 and Ded1 condense by phase separation which depends strongly on temperature and pH. For example, a 42Â°C heat shock is insufficient to cause Pab1 condensation at pH 7.5, but sufficient at pH 6.6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Riback et al., 2017</xref>). In the case of Pub1, acidic pH promotes phase separation at non-shock temperatures, but these condensates spontaneously disperse when the resting pH is restored; only heat-triggered Pub1 condensates require dispersal by molecular chaperones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kroschwald et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Together, these studies indicate the existence of multiple proteins that undergo heat-triggered, pH-dependent condensation processes, producing assemblies which conditionally recruit Hsp70. Based on these observations, we make three hypotheses to be tested in future work. First, we hypothesize that pH- and temperature-dependent condensing proteins are the cause of the Hsf1 pH-dependence we observe when translation is silenced. Second, we predict that if such proteins are found, they will activate Hsf1 by recruiting Hsp70 in the condensed state. Third, we hypothesize that many such proteins exist, such that it should be possible to activate Hsf1 by triggering condensation of a single protein, but that suppression of any single proteinâs condensation may not suppress Hsf1 activation.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>pH dependence constrains the search for temperature sensors in eukaryotes</title><p>How eukaryotic cells sense temperature remains unknown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Yoo et al., 2019</xref>). In the misfolding model for Hsf1 activation, misfolded proteins are the actors which convert an increase in temperature into Hsp70 recruitment and thereby activate Hsf1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Morano et al., 2012</xref>); neither Hsf1 nor Hsp70 has temperature sensitivity in this model. Recent work has suggested that human Hsf1 possesses intrinsic thermal sensing ability regulating its trimerization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hentze et al., 2016</xref>). While this is a tantalizing possibility, Hsf1 thermosensing has yet to be demonstrated in vivo or for yeast, whose Hsf1 is thought to be constitutively trimerized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Morano et al., 2012</xref>). Our results also demonstrate that temperature alone is insufficient to activate Hsf1âs response when translation is attenuated; a drop in intracellular pH is required.</p><p>We have previously proposed that heat-triggered protein condensation can take the place of misfolding-induced aggregation in the standard model for Hsf1 activation, with phase-separating proteins acting as the primary sensors of temperature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Riback et al., 2017</xref>). Phase separation and other phase-transition behaviors provide a compelling solution to the tricky problem of sensing temperature, which typically involves only a few degreesâ change: 30Â°C to 37Â°C for robust induction of yeastâs heat shock response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gasch et al., 2000</xref>). Phase transitions by definition are highly cooperative, amplifying tiny changes in individual molecules into massive system-level transformations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Yoo et al., 2019</xref>). Crucially, unlike misfolding of newly synthesized polypeptides, heat-shock-triggered condensation of mature proteins is not suppressed by translational inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Wallace et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Which proteins might serve at the front line of temperature sensing, transducing slight temperature shifts into a cellular signal capable of triggering the Hsf1-mediated heat shock response? We have previously identified more than a dozen proteins which form condensates in under two minutes in response to heat shock in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Wallace et al., 2015</xref>). These so-called âsuperaggregatorsâ condense rapidly; many of them reside in the nucleus; and most show substantial condensation at 37Â°C, unlike Pab1 or Pub1 but like the exquisitely temperature-sensitive Ded1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Iserman et al., 2020</xref>). Such sensitivity is essential for any protein acting as an initial sensor of the Hsf1-mediated response. As noted above, these thermosensitive proteins provide a compelling list of candidates for Hsf1 activators. We predict they will have several characteristics shared by existing less-sensitive proteins: they will condense autonomously (without relying on the temperature-sensitive condensation of other factors), will recruit Hsp70 upon condensation, and will show condensation behavior that is suppressed at the resting intracellular pH.</p><p>We underscore that these are predictions based on a synthesis of existing knowledge, and that the mechanistic basis for the pH sensitivity we report is now a crucial open question. It remains possible, for example, that Hsf1 directly senses pH and translational activity. A conceptual advantage of our model is that, unlike this example, it is built from empirically extant pieces.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Temperature acts as a physiological signal</title><p>Is Hsf1 activation a response to a heat-induced proteotoxic misfolding catastrophe, or something else? Heat-induced misfolding has long remained more a supposition than a result.

As noted above, no specific endogenous protein has yet been identified which misfolds in response to a sublethal heat shock and thereby triggers the Hsf1 response. Here, we have shown that heat alone is insufficient to trigger the Hsf1 response, and that the newly synthesized polypeptides often cited as the primary inducers of Hsf1 are not required for Hsf1 activation.</p><p>An alternative to the misfolding model is that elevated temperatureâwithin the physiological range to which organisms have adapted during their evolutionâserves a signal, an environmental cue, which elicits an appropriate response.</p><p>Temperature acts as a physiological signal in other ascomycete fungi.

The budding yeast and occasional human pathogen <italic>Candida albicans</italic> similarly requires a temperature increase to trigger the bud-to-hyphae transition critical for infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brown et al., 2010</xref>), which also induces chaperones in a classical Hsf1-mediated heat shock response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Nicholls et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>The foregoing examples are pathogens.

This, along with other facts which we review here, suggests that a primary physiological heat shock for budding yeast is ingestion and dispersal by birds.</p><p>A survey of hundreds of migratory passerine (perching) birds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Francesca et al., 2012</xref>) isolated yeast species from their cloacae, implying ingestion as the source; 14% of isolates were <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae.

Passerine birds, the most numerous on earth, have an internal body temperature averaging 41.6Â°C (range 39Â°C to 44Â°C) when active, rising to an average of nearly 44Â°C (43.1â47.7) during high activity such as running and flight (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Prinzinger et al., 1991</xref>). These temperatures correspond remarkably well to the upper bound of nonlethal temperatures for <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">SalvadÃ³ et al., 2011</xref>).

Here, the suppression of the heat shock response by elevated pH suggests that acidificationâand the capacity to acidify, which appears to be determined in large part by extracellular pHâis a key part of the physiological context in which this thermal signal is received. This logic applies broadly. In humans, for example, a key physiological heat shockâfeverâtriggers the Hsf1-mediated heat shock response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Singh and Hasday, 2013</xref>). Perhaps fever causes new problems for cells, new self-inflicted damage to be cleaned up. More plausibly, however, fever acts as a systemic signal which activates a cellular program with key roles in modulating immune and inflammatory responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Singh and Hasday, 2013</xref>). Indeed, the apoptotic response of human neutrophils to fever temperatures is sharply dependent on intracellular pH, with acidification promoting survival; local acidification is a hallmark of inflammatory conditions and promotes neutrophil activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">DÃ­az et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>We began by noting that the biological meaning of the longstanding association of cellular stress with cytosolic acidification, observed from fungal cells to vertebrate neurons, has remained unclear. Our results speak to a potentially broad effect: that this association is adaptive, and reflects, at least in part, the dependence of the core Hsf1-mediated transcriptional response on pH. Our work will focus a decades-long search for the specific eukaryotic sensors of heat shock on systemsâlikely, we argue, specific moleculesâwhich depend on acidification for their sensory action.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Yeast strains</title><p>Scarless tagging of the Ssa4 protein with mCherry was accomplished in the BY4742 background via serial transformation and fluorophore exchange with the <italic>URA3</italic> gene such that no selection cassette remained in the genome.

Briefly, the Msn2/4 genes were identified as genes that had a conserved Msn2/4 binding site in the upstream promoter and which were upregulated during heat stress in a strain of yeast where Hsf1 had been acutely deactivated. Hsf1 target genes were determined by differential expression after Hsf1 inactivation using a combination of transcript sequencing (RNA-seq), chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-Seq), and native elongating transcript sequencing (NET-Seq). For <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D and E</xref>, transcription factors were identified using the YeTFaSCo database (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">de Boer and Hughes, 2012</xref>) to generate a list of proteins that have annotated DNA binding motifs (259 genes); the regulon of each transcription factor were determined by using the YeastMine database to generate a list of genes which had previously been shown to be reguated by each gene. The database includes interactions determined both during heat shock and non-heat shock conditions; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref> includes only transcription factors which had been assessed under heat shock conditions; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref> includes the regulons of other know stress-associated transcription factors which were determined under non-heat shock conditions.

This equality is true assuming constant exponential growth, which indicates thatÂ our dataÂ are valid at least for the early stages of recovery; we only fit the linear portion of the data to ensure the validity of this assumption. For cells stressed without ionophore treatment, this was all timepoints less than 100 min, for cells stressed with ionophore this was all timepoints less than 160 min (this difference correlates roughly with the delay in induction we observe after ionophore treatment and is consistent across all pHs). See <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6âfigure supplement 1F</xref> for all fits. We can use this equation to calculate the difference in growth rate, thatÂ is, the fitness loss, for each population of cells having experienced stress at a different intracellular pH. This value is expressed as a difference to arrested growth (maximal fitness loss) in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>.</p><p>The reference population (subscript <italic>wt</italic> in the above equation) is wild-type cells growing exponentially (âspikeâ or âspike-inâ), which are distinguishable from the pHluorin-expressing strains because they are are not significantly fluorescent in either pHluorin channel. Using a mixture of log-growing unlabeled and stressed labeled cells allows us to compare directly between the different pH and temperature combinations, as all the measured fitness loss values are relative to the same reference. It also implies that the difference <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf13"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>p</mml:mi><mml:mo>â¢</mml:mo><mml:mi>H</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>-</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>w</mml:mi><mml:mo>â¢</mml:mo><mml:mi>t</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> will be either zero or negative, since the treatments being compared (pH manipulation either with or without heat shock) will in general only decrease the growth rate from maximal. To ensure that the pH manipulation itself was minimally stressful, the relative growth of pH-manipulated cells, which experienced 35 min at room temperature in calibration curve buffer with ionophore, was calculated and was found to be extremely close to 0 for all pH values considered (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6âfigure supplement 1D</xref>, âRT (mock)â row).</p><p>To control for possible additional, strain-specific differences, we also calculated the relative growth rate when both the wild-type and yCGT028 cells were treated identically (âmixâ or âmix-inâ); this value was also found to be nearly zero in every condition examined (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6âfigure supplement 1D</xref>, âMix-inâ column).</p></sec><sec id="s4-9-2"><title>Determination of budded fraction</title><p>We first computationally isolated the labeled, stressed cells, and then for this population looked at the distribution of values in the Forward Scatter Width channel.

This approach has been previously used to discriminate budded and unbudded cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hewitt and Nebe-Von-Caron, 2004</xref>). Tracking the fraction of budded cells as a function of time gives information about cell cycle re-entry in a fashion analogous to the manual counting of budded and unbudded cells as previously performed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Rowley et al., 1993</xref>).</p><p>To verify this labeling, we sorted cells into two populations based on the forward scatter pulse width into 95% ethanol to fix, and then visualized the fixed cells using light microscopy; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6âfigure supplement 1A</xref> shows sorting parameters and representative microscopy images.

The âbuddedâ population contained more cells in the 2x DNA peak, indicating that they were doubling their DNA and were thus actively growing; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6âfigure supplement 1C</xref>.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Code and data analysis</title><p>All data analysis was performed with R (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">R Development Core Team, 2017</xref>) using packages from the tidyverse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Wickham, 2017</xref>).

organism <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> and shows that a transient acidification of the cytoplasm can trigger a response even in the absence of translation. Acidification may contribute to phase separation of (existing, mature) proteins, which may in turn be a second trigger of the heat shock response. Because the heat shock response is a highly conserved and important cellular response, it is quite clear that the topic is of interest to the broad authorship of <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Transient intracellular acidification regulates the core transcriptional heat shock response&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, including Kevin J Verstrepen as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Kevin Struhl as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Kevin Morano (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>We appreciate that your study challenges the current model for heat shock activation, showing that blocking translation either through carbon deprivation or through chemical inhibition still allows cells to mount a response, but only if they undergo a transient acidification of the cytoplasm.</p><p>As you can see in the individual reviews below, we are impressed with the overall quality of this study and excited about the possible implications. However, we also believe that there still are a few loopholes that warrant further exploration. In particular, we are not convinced that the current set of experiments establishes intracellular acidification as a direct trigger of the heat shock response, and we worry that alternative hypotheses have not been ruled out or at least acknowledged. There is a strong consensus among the reviewers that performing a transcriptome (RNAseq) analysis of cells progressing through a HSR in acidic or neutral pH, both while transcription is blocked or not, would help understand whether the effect of intracellular acidification is completely similar to the normal Hsf-driven HSR response, or instead is a somewhat different, more general response triggered by the low intracellular pH (eg as a consequence of general issues with transcription). We therefore ask you to perform this experiment and to critically discuss the results in the main text (not in the supplements).</p><p>In addition, we also ask to provide a more critical discussion of the results, acknowledging unanswered questions and possible alternative hypotheses.</p><p>Lastly, we suggest to also have a look at the individual reviews below. Whereas we do not think that it is necessary to address all issues listed, we do think that several of these other points may help to further improve the manuscript.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>In this study, Triandafillou and colleagues investigate the molecular signals that trigger a heat shock response in the model organism <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>. The current model for heat shock activation predicts that temperature-induced misfolding of newly synthesized proteins triggers the response, but the authors find that blocking translation either through carbon deprivation or through chemical inhibition still allows cells to mount a response, but only if they undergo a transient acidification of the cytoplasm. This acidification is shown to depend on an acidic environment, possibly because extracellular protons are able to diffuse through the membrane as it becomes unstable at higher temperatures. Acidification may contribute to phase separation of (existing, mature) proteins, which may in turn be a second trigger of the heat shock response.</p><p>Overall, this is an extremely interesting and thought-provoking study, summarized in an eloquently written, albeit somewhat wordy manuscript. Because the heat shock response is a highly conserved and important cellular response, it is quite clear that the topic is of interest to the broad authorship of <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>Although the scientific work is strong and solid, the authors could in some instances perhaps be a bit more critical and cautious with the interpretation of their results. While the hypothesis seems plausible, it would be good to also point out alternative explanations and pitfalls, and to clearly separate correlation from causation. A few extra sentences in the Results and Discussion may suffice.</p><p>For example, whereas glucose deprivation may indeed lead to translation arrest, it would be best to show this directly and to also consider the other effects, including a possible sudden drop in intracellular ATP and activation of various signaling pathways (main glucose repression pathway, cAMP pathwayâ¦), which could also contribute to the activation of the heat shock response. In that respect, I think that the experiments with cycloheximide provide a stronger basis, even though it is a much stronger perturbation of the cell, which in itself also increases the risks of undesirable side effects.</p><p>Second, the fact that a proper heat shock response correlates with transient acidification is interesting, but I am not convinced that &quot;it dictates chaperone production&quot; (seems to imply causation).</p><p>Third, while an attractive hypothesis, I am not sure whether there is enough proof to state that the acidification-dependent response indeed depends on phase separation of existing, mature proteins. Since acidification not only occurs during a heat shock, it might in fact be a more general trigger of a more general stress response, and while the phase-separation-theory looks plausible, one can imagine other sensors and pathways. In that sense, it would be interesting (but perhaps not necessary in this study) to carefully compare the cellular response (transcriptome) to acidification (eg using the ionophore) to that of a &quot;normal&quot; heat shock; and that of a heat shock in acidic medium to one in neutral medium. In the current manuscript, it would perhaps be best to explicitly state the that the phase-separation of mature Hsp70 clients is at this stage only a theory, and that other explanations should not yet be ruled out?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>The heat shock response (HSR) is an ancient and strongly conserved cellular program required for survival and adaptation to conditions leading to proteotoxic stress. While work in multiple experimental systems has established core tenets of the HSR, namely control of gene expression by the transcription factor Hsf1 that is induced/derepressed by protein misfolding and in some cases other cytotoxic stresses, a flurry of recent research activity in budding yeast has revealed more precise insights. Hsp70 is now recognized to be the primary, if not sole regulator of the Hsf1 activation switch, and nearly any condition that occupies or impairs Hsp70 can elicit the HSR. Additionally, the existence of temperature- and pH-specific protein dynamics in the yeast cytoplasm that impact Hsp70 and other chaperones raise the possibility of multiple sensing mechanisms that may channel into HSR activation. This manuscript by Triandafillou and colleagues challenges long-held assumptions that protein misfolding is required for HSR activation by heat shock and finds that it is not â transient intracellular acidification is required for the HSR and only when translation AND acidification are blocked does chaperone gene expression fail. Subsequent experiments additionally show that return to &quot;normal&quot; pH after HS is also required for maximal induction, and that these processes are fitness-promoting and therefore evolutionarily beneficial. Finally, transcriptome experiments are utilized to demonstrate that the observed effects are specific to the HSR.</p><p>Overall, the work reveals a previously unknown aspect of HSR regulation and is therefore novel and impactful. Moreover, the tools generated to carry out the study as well as the sophistication of the experiments (for example, single-cell correlation of HSR activation and intracellular pH) are particular strengths. Below I outline a few considerations and necessary clarifications I feel the authors need to address:</p><p>1) Figure 1B â the solid line sliding-window average appears to suggest that the pH is dropping prior to the application of heat shock. Is this just an &quot;artifact&quot; of the averaging process? Or perhaps lack of resolution between the addition of warm medium and immediate next reads in the flow cytometer?</p><p>2) With regard to physiological acidification, there is a great deal of investigation and discussion as to why this happens, but little about how it happens. While the ionophore- and medium-based manipulations are convincing, was thought given to using a complementary genetic approach? Mutants in proton antiporters, or even the PMA1 membrane ATPase can influence cytoplasmic pH. Identifying a mechanism to explain this important physiological effect seems germane, if not proximal, to the operational model the authors are trying to build.</p><p>3) Figure 2B â the authors immediately interpret the differential effects of glucose starvation as translational arrest. This is problematic for two reasons. Firstly, they do not go on to demonstrate translational arrest under these conditions until Figure 2D. Secondly, a great deal of physiological change is being experienced by cells experiencing glucose withdrawal, including translational arrest. I suggest that the authors flip the order of 2B and 2D and/or allow for several possible rationales for the failure to induce Ssa4 that are then narrowed down to translation via the experiments in 2D and 2E. It should also be pointed out that glucose withdrawal is known to decrease cytoplasmic pH via proton pump inhibition (MartÃ­nez-MuÃ±oz, G. A., and Kane, P. (2008) Vacuolar and plasma membrane proton pumps collaborate to achieve cytosolic pH homeostasis in yeast. J. Biol. Chem. 283, 20309-20319), possibly confounding the use of glucose withdrawal solely to block translation.</p><p>4) The experiments shown in Figures 3D, 3F and 4B appear to suggest that ionophore treatment is not required to observe external pH-mediated effects on Ssa4 induction. Am I interpreting this correctly? If so, are the ionophore experiments necessary for the recovery questions?</p><p>5) While it is not apparent from the plot shown in Figure 6C, 6D appears to show a significant, though smaller in magnitude, induction ratio for the two Msn2 targets tested. The authors conclude that the pH effects they have observed are specific to Hsf1, but I think that's not so clear. Hsf1 is definitely more dependent than Msn2/4, but it is not exclusively dependent. Have the authors excluded the possibility that general transcriptional induction, i.e., Mediator-controlled rapid pol II recruitment, is not more widely affected? Showing the GAL genes are equally well induced at the same pHs would be an easy way to dispel this notion.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>This manuscript explores the functional consequences of the long noted observation that many different types of cells experience transient cytosolic acidification after heat shock. Specifically the authors use budding yeast to examine if cytosolic acidification is important for mounting the core transcriptional heat shock response mediated by Hsf1 and whether this phenomenon has any cell adaptive role during stress.</p><p>To do this, they develop a FACS method to simultaneously monitor the cytosolic pH and the induction of a reporter of the heat shock response (Ssa4-mCherry), over time, in heat shocked cell populations.</p><p>By blocking cytosolic acidification during heat shock by transferring cells to pH7.5 media they show that the heat shock response is blunted when translation is ongoing and abrogated when translation is blocked. This result is recapitulated using nigericin to manipulate cytosolic pH during heat shock.</p><p>The authors find that preventing cytosolic acidification during heat shock slows the return of cytosolic pH to a resting state during recovery and propose that delay is influencing the dynamics of chaperone production.</p><p>Finally, they show data that suggests that cytosolic acidification during heat shock promotes improved fitness of the cell population and that the lack of cytosolic acidification during heat shock affects Hsf1 regulated targets specifically.</p><p>The data in this manuscript seem to be of high quality, the manuscript is well written and is potentially of broad interest to readers of <italic>eLife</italic>. The speculation about the need for interplay between the heat shock transcriptional program and cytosolic acidification to promote yeast cell fitness during their dispersion by passerine birds is particularly enjoyable to consider.</p><p>A major concern however, is that this manuscript does not provide clear evidence that preventing cytosolic acidification during heat shock is directly influencing the Hsf1-mediated heat shock transcriptional program versus indirect effects of the temporal interplay between the pH stress responsive pathway driven by Rim101 (or a variety of other stress responsive pathways likely induced when cells are placed in a buffer containing 50 mM NaCl, 50 mM KCl, 50 mM MES, 50 mM HEPES, 100 mM ammonium acetate and 10 mM 2-deoxyglucose). Testing this direct causality would require finding a way of preventing cytosolic acidification independently of manipulating extracellular pH (Rim101 pathway is driven by external cues). Unfortunately, such a separation is non-trivial (there are many genes involved in pH homeostasis) and I am not aware of a simple way to separate the internal and external pH effect seen here. This may require a genetic screen to identify candidates to accomplish such an &quot;unlinking&quot;. Another potential way to address this concern is to use RNAseq to identify the transcriptional changes associated with the experimental procedure and then test the dynamics of Ssa4 induction in cells unable to mount those changes.</p><p>Given the experimental procedure the authors employ is critical to make the conclusions drawn in this manuscript, they must rule out the influence of other (pH?) stress responsive transcriptional programs on the dynamics of the heat shock response, before this manuscript should be accepted in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.54880.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>We appreciate that your study challenges the current model for heat shock activation, showing that blocking translation either through carbon deprivation or through chemical inhibition still allows cells to mount a response, but only if they undergo a transient acidification of the cytoplasm.</p><p>As you can see in the individual reviews below, we are impressed with the overall quality of this study and excited about the possible implications.

At no point have we claimed that acidification is a direct trigger; indeed, in the Discussion we hypothesize the opposite (that Hsf1 activationâs pH-dependence is indirect, through the substrates of Hsf1âs repressor, Hsp70). In revision, we have attended closely to clarifying the nature (hypothesis, speculation, synthesis) of the interpretations for the phenomena we report, and to affirming that the mechanism remains open. We hope the reviewers understand that we have articulated what we feel are the most plausible hypotheses, along with testable predictions.</p><p>For example, in the Discussion, we state: âTogether, these studies indicate the existence of multiple proteins that undergo heat-triggered, pH-dependent condensation processes, producing assemblies which conditionally recruit Hsp70. Based on these observations, we make three hypotheses to be tested in future work. First, we hypothesize that pH- and temperature-dependent condensing proteins are the cause of the Hsf1 pH-dependence we observe when translation is silenced. Second, we predict that if such proteins are found, they will activate Hsf1 by recruiting Hsp70 in the condensed state. Third, we hypothesize that many such proteins exist, such that it should be possible to activate Hsf1 by triggering condensation of a single protein, but suppression of any single protein's condensation will not suppress Hsf1 activation.â</p><p>We end the following section with: âWe underscore that these are predictions based on a synthesis of existing knowledge, and that the mechanistic basis for the pH sensitivity we report is now a crucial open question. It remains possible, for example, that Hsf1 directly senses pH and translational activity. A conceptual advantage of our model is that, unlike this example, it is built from empirically extant pieces.â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>There is a strong consensus among the reviewers that performing a transcriptome (RNAseq) analysis of cells progressing through a HSR in acidic or neutral pH, both while transcription is blocked or not, would help understand whether the effect of intracellular acidification is completely similar to the normal Hsf-driven HSR response, or instead is a somewhat different, more general response triggered by the low intracellular pH (eg as a consequence of general issues with transcription). We therefore ask you to perform this experiment and to critically discuss the results in the main text (not in the supplements).</p></disp-quote><p>We have carried out a large set of new RNA-seq experiments to address these and related questions. These results are now central to the manuscript. Briefly, as described in our revised Materials and methods section, we performed RNA-seq on cells in media (as opposed to ionophore treated, as in the previous version) where acidification was either blocked or allowed, as shown in Figure 2. In order to determine the effect of translation state, we examined the transcriptional response to heat stress, in cells that acidified vs. those that didnât, when translation was ongoing, blocked by cycloheximide treatment, or blocked by acute glucose withdrawal. We performed equivalent mock treatments (the same media and translation conditions without heat shock), and did every condition in biological duplicate (correlation between replicates was quite good, and are quantified in Figure 3âfigure supplement 1A). In total, this amounted to 22 samples, with data now deposited in GEO under accession number GSE152916.</p><p>The results confirm our previous low-throughput findings. The major addition is that the pH sensitivity of the Hsf1 regulon is now remarkably clear, and clearly different than other regulons including Msn2/4.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In addition, we also ask to provide a more critical discussion of the results, acknowledging unanswered questions and possible alternative hypotheses.</p></disp-quote><p>As noted above, we have rewritten much of the Discussion to more clearly state hypotheses and distinguish them from our empirical results and from prior work.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>In this study, Triandafillou and colleagues investigate the molecular signals that trigger a heat shock response in the model organism <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>.

In the Discussion, we have tried to be even clearer when advancing hypotheses versus merely providing an interpretation of results. The reviewerâs important comment about separating correlation from causation is echoed in another comment below where we respond more fully.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>For example, whereas glucose deprivation may indeed lead to translation arrest, it would be best to show this directly and to also consider the other effects, including a possible sudden drop in intracellular ATP and activation of various signaling pathways (main glucose repression pathway, cAMP pathwayâ¦), which could also contribute to the activation of the heat shock response.

They show that translation is halted when cells are deprived of glucose (as known), and that this effect is independent of intracellular acidification.</p><p>The reviewerâs point that there are other effects of glucose withdrawal is certainly relevant. To this end we examined both glucose withdrawal and cycloheximide treatment in the sequencing experiment we performed for this revision (new Figure 3). We were able to correct for the general effect of glucose withdrawal (which are quantitatively similar to those observed previously, see a direct comparison in Figure 3âfigure supplement 3B) by normalizing the heat-shocked abundances to mock-treated abundances (see Figure 3âfigure supplement 3A). This demonstrates that there is an additional effect on Hsf1 genes by acidification that goes beyond the effects produced by glucose withdrawal.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Second, the fact that a proper heat shock response correlates with transient acidification is interesting, but I am not convinced that &quot;it dictates chaperone production&quot; (seems to imply causation).</p></disp-quote><p>We agree. The causal effect of the return to resting pH is clear at the population level where we carried out a perturbation experiment, but has not been demonstrated at the single-cell level where this phrase appears. We have revised the text to say (with context): âReturn to the resting pH predicts the dynamics of chaperone production. Acidification, either simultaneous with or following heat stress, followed by return to the resting pH appears to be required for robust induction of chaperones after heat stress.â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Third, while an attractive hypothesis, I am not sure whether there is enough proof to state that the acidification-dependent response indeed depends on phase separation of existing, mature proteins. Since acidification not only occurs during a heat shock, it might in fact be a more general trigger of a more general stress response, and while the phase-separation-theory looks plausible, one can imagine other sensors and pathways.</p></disp-quote><p>In revision, we have redoubled our efforts to ensure that no confusion arises between a result and a hypothesis. We hypothesize that biomolecular condensation is involved; at no point do we state that this has been shown or that all other hypotheses have been ruled out. We now explicitly state, âthe mechanistic basis for the pH sensitivity we report is now a crucial open question.â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In that sense, it would be interesting (but perhaps not necessary in this study) to carefully compare the cellular response (transcriptome) to acidification (eg using the ionophore) to that of a &quot;normal&quot; heat shock; and that of a heat shock in acidic medium to one in neutral medium.</p></disp-quote><p>We have carried out extensive new experiments using RNA-seq which answer some of these questions. We compare the heat shock response in both acidic and basic media, and find that under conditions of high translation there is no detectable difference in the induction of heat shock proteins (Figure 3C). However, we find that under conditions where translation has been blocked, that the induction of heat shock proteins is significantly lower in cells that cannot acidify, which we interpret as a failure to activate Hsf1 under conditions where cells are both non-translating and cannot acidify.</p><p>In these experiments we did not use an ionophore and so cannot (and do not) make any claims about the broader response to acidification in the absence of other perturbations.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In the current manuscript, it would perhaps be best to explicitly state the that the phase-separation of mature Hsp70 clients is at this stage only a theory, and that other explanations should not yet be ruled out?</p></disp-quote><p>In the Discussion, we now state explicitly: âWe underscore that these are predictions based on a synthesis of existing knowledge, and that the mechanistic basis for the pH sensitivity we report is now a crucial open question.â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>[â¦]</p><p>Overall, the work reveals a previously unknown aspect of HSR regulation and is therefore novel and impactful. Moreover, the tools generated to carry out the study as well as the sophistication of the experiments (for example, single-cell correlation of HSR activation and intracellular pH) are particular strengths. Below I outline a few considerations and necessary clarifications I feel the authors need to address:</p><p>1) Figure 1B â the solid line sliding-window average appears to suggest that the pH is dropping prior to the application of heat shock. Is this just an &quot;artifact&quot; of the averaging process? Or perhaps lack of resolution between the addition of warm medium and immediate next reads in the flow cytometer?</p></disp-quote><p>We applaud the eagle eye of the reviewer! The effect referred to is a combination of the smoothing, and the fact that the increase in temperature is performed manually and varies slightly between experiments. In some cases, the application of increased temperature by addition of warm medium was performed slightly earlier, leading to a seeming early drop in pH when plotted on a common axis. We have added an explanation of this effect in the text to avoid confusion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) With regard to physiological acidification, there is a great deal of investigation and discussion as to why this happens, but little about how it happens. While the ionophore- and medium-based manipulations are convincing, was thought given to using a complementary genetic approach? Mutants in proton antiporters, or even the PMA1 membrane ATPase can influence cytoplasmic pH. Identifying a mechanism to explain this important physiological effect seems germane, if not proximal, to the operational model the authors are trying to build.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that understanding the mechanism by which acidification occurs is interesting and relevant to the topic, we feel that it is outside the scope of this work. This issue has been previously explored in the literature (for example in Coote, Cole and Jones, 1994) and weâve included a slightly more extended discussion of these results.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Figure 2B â the authors immediately interpret the differential effects of glucose starvation as translational arrest. This is problematic for two reasons. Firstly, they do not go on to demonstrate translational arrest under these conditions until Figure 2D.</p></disp-quote><p>We understand the reviewerâs point and our revision is substantially clearer. Translational arrest due to glucose withdrawal is well-established per citations in the paper, and we do not claim that glucose withdrawal only causes translational arrest. In revision we write: âTo test whether acidification still promoted the stress response even under conditions where the concentration of newly synthesized polypeptides would be sharply limited, we first used brief glucose withdrawal, a physiologically relevant condition which is known to rapidly and reversibly inhibit translation of most cellular mRNAs (Ashe, 2000)â We also now confirm this arrest under our precise conditions in Figure 2B.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Secondly, a great deal of physiological change is being experienced by cells experiencing glucose withdrawal, including translational arrest. I suggest that the authors flip the order of 2B and 2D and/or allow for several possible rationales for the failure to induce Ssa4 that are then narrowed down to translation via the experiments in 2D and 2E.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that glucose withdrawal is not a specific perturbation of translation, and use cycloheximide both here and in the new sequencing experiments in Figure 3, where the differences between glucose withdrawal and cycloheximide treatment become clearer. In introducing the cycloheximide experiments in Figure 2E, we now write âTo directly inhibit translation without nutrient withdrawalâ¦â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It should also be pointed out that glucose withdrawal is known to decrease cytoplasmic pH via proton pump inhibition (MartÃ­nez-MuÃ±oz, G. A., and Kane, P. (2008) Vacuolar and plasma membrane proton pumps collaborate to achieve cytosolic pH homeostasis in yeast. J. Biol. Chem. 283, 20309-20319), possibly confounding the use of glucose withdrawal solely to block translation.</p></disp-quote><p>These are important details. We investigate the drop in pH induced by glucose withdrawal on the short timescales that we employ it in Figure 2A and C. Brief (in this case ~10 minutes) pre-treatment in 0% glucose SC (pH 4) is not enough to cause acidification on its own, and cells acidify normally when heat shocked as shown in Figure 2C. We are of course aware that glucose withdrawal cannot be used to solely block translation; we use cycloheximide as a more targeted inhibitor (Figure 2E and Figure 3).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The experiments shown in Figures 3D, 3F and 4B appear to suggest that ionophore treatment is not required to observe external pH-mediated effects on Ssa4 induction. Am I interpreting this correctly? If so, are the ionophore experiments necessary for the recovery questions?</p></disp-quote><p>You are correctâionophore is not required to merely prevent or allow acidification. However, we were interested not only in the binary distinction between acidifying and not, but also the underlying quantitative question, that is, what is the quantitative relationship between acidification and the response? Is there a certain degree of acidification or a particular pH that was required for a response? In order to address this question (and subsequent questions about recovery), we performed the experiments with the ionophore. We were also interested in the important question of whether acidification without concomitant heat shock had an effect on cells, either in terms of heat shock protein production or cellular fitness. In order to create acidification without heat shock, we found it necessary to use ionophore treatment.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) While it is not apparent from the plot shown in Figure 6C, 6D appears to show a significant, though smaller in magnitude, induction ratio for the two Msn2 targets tested. The authors conclude that the pH effects they have observed are specific to Hsf1, but I think that's not so clear. Hsf1 is definitely more dependent than Msn2/4, but it is not exclusively dependent. Have the authors excluded the possibility that general transcriptional induction, i.e., Mediator-controlled rapid pol II recruitment, is not more widely affected? Showing the GAL genes are equally well induced at the same pHs would be an easy way to dispel this notion.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that the question of whether there is a more general effect (or even more of an effect on Msn2/4 genes) is important, and thus we considered this in the design of the sequencing experiment we did for the revision. We heat stressed cells with and without acidification (using media conditions rather than ionophore to mitigate concerns about the ionophore affecting the cells in unintended ways); and with translation ongoing, blocked by cycloheximide, or blocked by glucose withdrawal. The data are summarized in Figure 3 and accompanying supplemental figures.</p><p>As we now note in the text, âBecause the Msn2/4 regulon continues to induce robustly independent of pH and translational status, a broader effect of pH on transcriptional processes cannot explain Hsf1's sensitivity.â The new Figure 3A (bottom right) demonstrates that a subset of the heat shock response continues to be induced to high levels in the presence of translational inhibitors at pH 7.5, and Figure 3C shows that the Msn2/4 regulon is virtually unaffected by lack of acidification. This indicates an effect that is, at least between Msn2/4 and Hsf1, specific to Hsf1.</p><p>To address whether this effect was truly specific to Hsf1, or instead affected other transcription factors, we took two separate approaches. The first was to compare the per-gene sensitivity to acidification for Hsf1 genes, Msn2/4 genes, and all other genes that were upregulated in our dataset in response to heat shock. This is shown in Figure 3âfigure supplement 2C. When translation is arrested, only the Hsf1 genes are preferentially induced by acidification. Under conditions of glucose withdrawal there is a slight increase in pH-sensitivity for Msn2/4 and âotherâ genes, and a marked sensitivity of Hsf1 genesâthus there may be some more general effect of acidification when cells experience glucose withdrawal; this is in line with previous work showing that acidification is part of the response to acute energy depletion (for example in Munder et al., 2016 and Joyner et al., 2016).</p><p>The second approach we took was to look for pH-sensitivity in the regulons of all annotated transcription factors, and here Hsf1 was the only transcription factor that showed sensitivity to acidification during heat shock (Figure 3D).</p><p>We identified two other transcription factors which showed behavior opposite Hsf1 (Ifh1 and Ste12): acidification-dependent repression (rather than activation) when translation was blocked. To our knowledge this has not been reported before.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>[â¦]</p><p>A major concern however, is that this manuscript does not provide clear evidence that preventing cytosolic acidification during heat shock is directly influencing the Hsf1-mediated heat shock transcriptional program versus indirect effects of the temporal interplay between the pH stress responsive pathway driven by Rim101 (or a variety of other stress responsive pathways likely induced when cells are placed in a buffer containing 50 mM NaCl, 50 mM KCl, 50 mM MES, 50 mM HEPES, 100 mM ammonium acetate and 10 mM 2-deoxyglucose). Testing this direct causality would require finding a way of preventing cytosolic acidification independently of manipulating extracellular pH (Rim101 pathway is driven by external cues). Unfortunately, such a separation is non-trivial (there are many genes involved in pH homeostasis) and I am not aware of a simple way to separate the internal and external pH effect seen here. This may require a genetic screen to identify candidates to accomplish such an &quot;unlinking&quot;. Another potential way to address this concern is to use RNAseq to identify the transcriptional changes associated with the experimental procedure and then test the dynamics of Ssa4 induction in cells unable to mount those changes.</p><p>Given the experimental procedure the authors employ is critical to make the conclusions drawn in this manuscript, they must rule out the influence of other (pH?) stress responsive transcriptional programs on the dynamics of the heat shock response, before this manuscript should be accepted in eLife.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that the specificity of the effect to Hsf1 and potential effects on other pathways needed to be more clearly demonstrated. To that end, and consistent with the reviewerâs specific suggestion along with the summary feedback, we performed RNAseq to look at the global effect of acidification during heat shock, both when translation was ongoing, or when blocked by either treatment with cycloheximide or withdrawal of glucose.</p><p>We found that when translation was blocked by either means, acidification specifically promoted the induction of the Hsf1-exclusive regulon. This is evident in the CDF in Figure 3C. However, we wanted to more fully and directly address whether there was a global effect of acidification. To address whether the effect we observed (promotion by acidification) was truly specific to Hsf1 or was instead more general, we took two approaches. The first was to compare the per-gene sensitivity to acidification for Hsf1 genes, Msn2/4 genes, and all other genes that were upregulated in our dataset in response to heat shock. This is shown in Figure 3âfigure supplement 2C. When translation is arrested, only the Hsf1 genes are preferentially induced by acidification.

The effect of acidification on the Rim101 regulon during heat shock (as mentioned by the reviewer) is shown in Figure 3âfigure supplement 3C; it looks similar to all genes, and does not seem to be affected in a pH-specific manner.</p></body></sub-article></article>
