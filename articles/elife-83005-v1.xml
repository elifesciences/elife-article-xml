In humans, even minor defects in coronary arteries can be lethal, emphasizing their importance for survival. However, some teleosts survive without coronary arteries, suggesting that there may have been some evolutionary changes in the morphology and function of coronary arteries in the tetrapod lineage. Here, we propose that the true ventricular coronary arteries were newly established during amniote evolution through remodeling of the ancestral coronary vasculature. In mouse (<italic>Mus musculus</italic>) and Japanese quail (<italic>Coturnix japonica</italic>) embryos, the coronary arteries unique to amniotes are established by the reconstitution of transient vascular plexuses: aortic subepicardial vessels (ASVs) in the outflow tract and the primitive coronary plexus on the ventricle. In contrast, amphibians (<italic>Hyla japonica</italic>, <italic>Lithobates catesbeianus</italic>, <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic>, and <italic>Cynops pyrrhogaster</italic>) retain the ASV-like vasculature as truncal coronary arteries throughout their lives and have no primitive coronary plexus. The anatomy and development of zebrafish (<italic>Danio rerio</italic>) and chondrichthyans suggest that their hypobranchial arteries are ASV-like structures serving as the root of the coronary vasculature throughout their lives. Thus, the ventricular coronary artery of adult amniotes is a novel structure that has acquired a new remodeling process, while the ASVs, which occur transiently during embryonic development, are remnants of the ancestral coronary vessels. This evolutionary change may be related to the modification of branchial arteries, indicating considerable morphological changes underlying the physiological transition during amniote evolution.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="plain-language-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Coronary arteries are tasked with supplying the heart with oxygenated blood and nutrients. Any blockage or developmental problem in these blood vessels can have severe and sometimes lethal consequences. Due to their importance for health, researchers have extensively studied how coronary arteries form in humans and mice; a more limited range of studies have also looked at their equivalent in zebrafish. However, little is known about these structures develop in animals such as birds, amphibians, or other groups of fish. This makes it difficult to retrace the evolutionary processes that have given rise to the coronary arteries we are familiar with in mammals.</p><p>To address this knowledge gap, Mizukami et al. set out to compare blood vessel development around the heart of mammals, birds, amphibians, and fish. To do this, they performed detailed anatomical studies of blood vessel structure at different stages of development in mice as well as quail, frogs and newts, zebrafish and sharks.</p><p>In both mice and quail, small arterial subepicardial vessels (or ASVs) emerged early in development around the heart; these subsequently reorganised and remodelled themselves to give rise to the â€˜trueâ€™ coronary arteries characteristic of the mature heart.</p><p>Frogs and newts also developed similar ASV-like structures; however, unlike their mammalian and bird equivalents, these vessels did not reorganise, instead being retained into adulthood. In fish, blood vessel development resembled that of amphibians, suggesting that the coronary artery-like structures seen in some fish are an â€˜ancestralâ€™ form of ASVs, rather than the equivalent of the mature coronary arteries in mammals and birds.</p><p>This work sheds light on the evolutionary processes shaping essential structures in the heart. In the future, Mizukami et al. hope that this knowledge will help develop a greater range of experimental animal models for studying heart disease and potential treatments.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>heart</kwd><kwd>cardiovascular</kwd><kwd>morphology</kwd><kwd>evo-devo</kwd><kwd>anatomy</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd><kwd>Xenopus</kwd><kwd>Zebrafish</kwd><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>20H04858</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Higashiyama</surname><given-names>Hiroki</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>20K15858</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Higashiyama</surname><given-names>Hiroki</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002241</institution-id><institution>Japan Science and Technology Agency</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PRESTO JP22715256</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Arima</surname><given-names>Yuichiro</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>22K07877</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Miyagawa-Tomita</surname><given-names>Sachiko</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>19H01048</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kurihara</surname><given-names>Hiroki</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>22H04991</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kurihara</surname><given-names>Hiroki</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>During the evolution of amniotes, the transformation of branchial arches coincided with the drastic remodeling of the ancestral extrinsic cardiac arteries, giving rise to novel ventricular coronary arteries that are unique to amniotes.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Coronary circulation refers to the network of blood vessels that supply oxygen and nutrients to the heart muscle.

Despite their importance, the evolutionary origin of the coronary arteries remains uncertain.</p><p>Because of the complete absence of coronary circulation in cyclostomes (lampreys and hagfishes), the coronary artery is generally considered a synapomorphy of jawed vertebrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Grant and Regnier, 1926</xref>). However, there is an inconsistency between amniotes and non-amniotes. In humans, the branching points (orifices) are located at the aortic sinuses close to the ventricle, and the arteries are distributed on the ventricular surface. Although the branching patterns of the vessels are diverse, the rostro-caudal level of the orifice and the distribution of the arteries on the ventricles are conserved in mammals, birds, crocodiles, and lepidosaurians (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Spalteholz, 1924</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Erhart, 1935</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">MacKinnon and Heatwole, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Farrell et al., 2012</xref>). In teleosts and chondrichthyans, however, the orifices are located more cranially, with branching from the hypobranchial arteries, and the arteries pass long distances from the orifices to the heart (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Parker, 1886</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Grant and Regnier, 1926</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Corrington, 1930</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">May and Herber, 1957</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Halpern and May, 1958</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">De AndrÃ©s et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">MuÃ±oz-ChÃ¡puli et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Icardo, 2017</xref>).

Data on amphibians may help to address this controversy, although few comparative studies have examined their extrinsic blood vessels, and some authors have mentioned that amphibians lack coronary arteries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kapuria et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lupu et al., 2020</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Anatomy of coronary arteries of amniotes.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Scheme of lizard coronary artery based on the data for the lace monitor (<italic>Varanus varius</italic>).

However, more recent studies have demonstrated in mice that amniote-type ventricular coronary arteries develop through the reconstitution of embryonic vessels (ASVs) and the primitive coronary plexus, with the ingrowth formation of orifices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bogers et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Red-Horse et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Peng et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Tian et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chen et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Ivins et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">He and Zhou, 2018</xref>). Our present results suggest that the coronary artery develops via reconstitution of the primitive vessels in mice and quails and this developmental process should be unique to amniotes.</p><p>In frogs and newts, we found that cardiac vessels are limited to the truncal outflow region and are composed of ASV-like vessels and the coronary vein. Frogs and newts have no primitive coronary plexus on the ventricle. Accordingly, remodeling to ventricular coronary arteries with secondary orifices does not occur in amphibians. These truncal ASV-like vessels of amphibians are identical to the ASVs of amniotes in topographical relationships: their orifices open at the root of the carotid artery (third pharyngeal artery derivative) and are distributed in the outflow tract in the same way. Given these anatomical connections, the ASVs of amniotes and ASV-like vessels of amphibians should be morphologically homologous.</p><p>The molecular identity of these vessels remains uncertain. In mice, ASVs are considered blood vessels because they contain erythrocytes and connect to the aortic endothelium; however, a subset of early ASV endothelial cells express <italic>Prox1</italic>, <italic>Vegfr3</italic>, and <italic>Lyve1</italic>, which are markers for lymphatic vessels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chen et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Maruyama et al., 2019</xref>). This suggests a lymphatic vesselâ€“like identity of mouse ASVs, although they function as blood vessels, and their origin has been speculated to be from <italic>Prox1</italic><sup>+</sup> cells, which also give rise to cardiac lymphatic vessels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Maruyama et al., 2021</xref>). The cardiac expression of <italic>Prox1</italic>, <italic>Vegfr3</italic>, and <italic>Lyve1</italic> orthologs in amphibians remains unknown. Recent identification of several endothelium-specific transcription factors by high-throughput single-cell RNA sequencing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Liao et al., 2022</xref>) will enable the comparisons of the amphibian vessels with ASV-specific molecular markers.</p><p>To determine whether the coronary circulation of anurans and urodeles is ancestral to that of amniotes, it is necessary to perform outgroup comparisons. Caecilians, the third group of extant amphibians, have a unique coronary circulation that is distinct from that of any other vertebrate group. In <italic>Hypogeophis rostratus</italic>, the so-called coronary arteries supply the heart tissue directly from the trabecular spaces of the ventricle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lawson, 1966</xref>), and <italic>Epicrionops</italic> reportedly has no coronary arteries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Wilkinson, 1996</xref>). Thus, the morphology of caecilian arteries differs from that of ASV-like vessels. On the other hand, the coronary veins of caecilians branch from the sinus venosus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lawson, 1966</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Wilkinson, 1996</xref>), as observed in mice, frogs, and newts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>).</p><p>We suggest that caecilian coronary arteries are unlikely to be ancestral to those of other amphibians. Vessels similar to ASV-like vessels, which branch off the third pharyngeal arch artery, are distributed on the outflow tract, and end at the level of the outflowâ€“ventricle junction, have been observed in the African lungfish (<italic>Protopterus aethiopicus</italic>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Szidon et al., 1969</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Laurent et al., 1978</xref>). The South American lungfish (<italic>Lepidosiren paradoxa</italic>) has similar vessels on the outflow tract, although their cranial part connects to the branchial arteries via the hypobranchial artery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Foxon, 1950</xref>), similar to our findings in zebrafish and shark. Coronary arteries originating from the branchial region and crossing the subepicardium of the coronary outflow tract are shared by the actinopterygian bichir (<italic>Polypterus senegalus</italic>) and chondrichthyans, although the locations of their orifices are uncertain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">DurÃ¡n et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lorenzale et al., 2018</xref>). Thus, the vascular connection from the pharyngeal region to the outflow tract, as seen in ASVs, is phylogenetically ancestral, and coronary arteries unique to caecilians are a derived trait likely associated with their heart being located near the middle of the body, which is also a derived trait.</p><p>Histologically, ASV-like vessels in tadpoles are small and may have the identities of both lymphatic and blood vessels, similar to ASVs in mice. However, in adults, they thicken to form outflow tract vessels and contain numerous blood cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>), indicating their function as mature blood vessels. Since these vessels constitute a network with coronary veins derived from the sinus venosus in their periphery, ASV-like vessels in tadpoles become arteries in adult amphibians. Comparison with the morphology of lungfish, bichir, and shark vessels suggests that amphibian ASV-like vessels are the ancestral form of coronary arterial vessels in jawed vertebrates, with ASVs in amniotes representing remnants of this form. While amniote ASVs have probably lost their arterial function, they may be maintained as embryonic primordia for the subsequent development. Thus, the existence of ASVs in amniotes may be explained as developmental burden (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Riedl, 1978</xref>), which is typically exemplified by notochords in vertebrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fujimoto et al., 2022</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Diversity of coronary arteries in fishes</title><p>Whereas the ancestral form of coronary arteries is conserved among mammals, birds, and amphibians (except caecilians) as ASVs or ASV-like vessels, the coronary circulation of fishes is highly diverse and whether it is homologous to that of tetrapods remains unclear (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Grant and Regnier, 1926</xref>).</p><p>Coronary vasculature is most variable in teleosts.

Some teleosts lack any extrinsic cardiac circulation, but this has been regarded as a derived trait because non-teleost actinopterygians (e.g. bichirs) and chondrichthyans have cardiac vessels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">De AndrÃ©s et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Farrell et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">DurÃ¡n et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Farrell and Smith, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lorenzale et al., 2018</xref>). It is generally thought that the lower need for external oxygenation probably causes the lack of ventricular coronary circulation due to the acquisition of spongy heart walls. However, it is unclear whether and how the presence or absence of ventricular coronary arteries correlates with the histological characteristics of the ventricles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). Among chondrichthyans, the posterior coronary arteries develop as branches of the subclavian arteries in some stingrays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">MuÃ±oz-ChÃ¡puli et al., 1994</xref>). Similar arteries are sometimes found even in amniotes, termed conus arteries, although they are distributed only on a small part of the ventricle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Schlesinger et al., 1949</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Simons, 1965</xref>).</p><p>Creating a comprehensive scheme for the coronary system in fishes, especially teleosts, is challenging due to its complexity. However, on the basis of our observations of zebrafish, we can generally interpret teleost coronary arteries as originating from at least two vascular networks: a branchial region network and a primitive coronary plexus. Vessels from these networks anastomose at the boundary between the outflow tract and the ventricles, similar to anastomosis between ASVs and the primitive coronary plexus in amniotes. However, unlike in amniotes, they do not undergo remodeling and remain connected to form adult coronary arteries. Furthermore, these vessels are detached from the walls of the outflow tract and are connected to multiple branchial arteries through hypobranchial arteries, unlike ASV-like vessels in amphibians, bichir, and chondrichthyans (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Because morphological comparison is difficult, we cannot identify the strict organ-level homology between ASVs and zebrafish hypobranchial arteries. Nevertheless, as the vascular structures derived from the pharyngeal arch to supply the aortic sinus, zebrafish hypobranchial arteries and related vessels undergo the same developmental processes in the same embryonic domain as ASVs, which should be considered as the same developmental module.</p><p>In zebrafish, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Paffett-Lugassy et al., 2017</xref> reported that the hypobranchial artery endothelium is derived from the second heart field (termed cardiopharyngeal mesoderm by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Diogo et al., 2015</xref>) in the pharyngeal arch. Although there is no direct evidence that amniote ASVs or amphibian ASV-like vessels originate from the second heart field or cardiopharyngeal mesoderm, the mouse periaortic lymphatic endothelium overlapping with ASVs originates from the <italic>Islet1</italic>-positive pharyngeal core mesoderm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Maruyama et al., 2019</xref>), and it is quite plausible that ASV distribution coincides with the mesodermal domains mentioned above. If the distribution of vascular structures corresponds to that of the mesenchyme, similar to the tight correspondence between distributions of neural crest cells and the trigeminal nerve in the face (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Higashiyama et al., 2021</xref>), the variations in vascular distribution between species may indicate differences in the mesenchymal contribution to the heart.</p><p>It should be noted that adult ventricular coronary arteries differ in their endothelial cell lineage, even in the same class animals (Table 1 in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kapuria et al., 2018</xref>). For example, in zebrafish, ventricular circulation is provided by the endocardium of the atrioventricular junction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Harrison et al., 2015</xref>); in gourami (<italic>Trichogaster trichopterus</italic>), it is derived solely from the hypobranchial arteries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Shifatu et al., 2018</xref>); in the giant danio (<italic>Devario malabaricus</italic>), it arises from the hypobranchial artery and the atrioventricular junction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Shifatu et al., 2018</xref>). These differences may be caused by the differences between species in the contribution of embryonic vessels. The developmental origin of the endothelial cells of the adult ventricular coronary vasculature also varies among amniotes (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kapuria et al., 2018</xref>), indicating that the relative contribution of ASVs and the primitive coronary plexus to adult coronary arteries varies among jawed vertebrates. It is not certain whether these cell lineage differences affect the vessels' morphological identity. If they do not affect it, it could be regarded as an example of developmental system drift (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">True and Haag, 2001</xref>), but further research is needed on this issue.</p><p>In summary, the origin of the coronary arteries of jawed vertebrates may be defined by the presence of the pharyngeal vessels (e.g., ASVs, amphibian ASV-like vessels, and hypobranchial arteries) and the primitive coronary plexus, and these two vascular networks have combined to produce a variety of coronary vasculature morphologies.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Amniote evolution and the establishment of the true coronary artery</title><p>The causes of the acquisition of novel amniote-type coronary arteries through remodeling are unclear. Coronary artery remodeling in amniotes can hardly be attributed solely to functional changes in the ventricles because lizards and snakes have spongy ventricles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Jensen et al., 2013a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Jensen et al., 2013b</xref>) but also have the amniote-type coronary arteries. Thus, the amniote-specific coronary artery remodeling may be related to morphological changes in the pharyngeal region rather than to functional requirements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>).</p><fig id="fig8" position="float"><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Evolution of coronary arteries.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The ventricular coronary arteries unique to amniotes are reconstituted from the ASVs and the primitive coronary plexus. The ASV-like vessels of amphibians and the hypobranchial arteries of fishes are comparable to the ASVs, rather than to the ventricular coronary arteries of amniotes. It remains unclear whether the ventricular artery in chondrichthyans arises as an extension of the hypobranchial artery or has a different developmental origin. As ventricular arteries have a variety of developmental sources in teleosts, ancestral vessels in this region may have had a variety of developmental origins in different animal species. In amniotes, such redundant coronary arterial development gave way to a single robust and unchangeable developmental program, resulting in developmental constraints. (<bold>B</bold>) A scheme of congenital coronary artery abnormalities according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kim et al., 2009</xref>.</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-83005-fig8-v1.tif"/></fig><p>The cardiopharyngeal structures in tetrapods have progressively changed during the water-to-land transition to form the amniote bauplan adapted to arid land. Branchial arches have changed into neck structures, and a long neck has formed in the amniotes with the morpho-functional separation of the head and pectoral girdle. Simultaneously, the heart, located ventral to the pharynx, moved back into the thorax and became separated from the pharyngeal structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hirasawa et al., 2016</xref>). This heterotopic shift of the heart inevitably resulted in various reorganizations of the pharyngeal arch derivatives, such as the recurrent laryngeal nerves of the vagus, which have been modified into a peculiar route without altering their anatomical connections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Higashiyama et al., 2016a</xref>). It seems reasonable to speculate that such reorganization of the branchial arteries may have influenced the establishment of true coronary arteries with secondary orifices. Myocardial thickening in mammals and birds may have resulted from the pre-existence of amniote-type coronary arteries, making coronary arteries essential for survival.</p><p>Only one exception is known among amniotes. The orifice in turtles is in the middle of the carotid artery, as it is in frogs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Spalteholz, 1924</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Grant and Regnier, 1926</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">MacKinnon and Heatwole, 1981</xref>), suggesting that the amniote-type coronary arteries were lost secondarily in the turtle lineage. Thus, transient ASV formation is conserved during development even after the acquisition of true coronary arteries, enabling them to return from the amniote type to the ancestral type. The loss of amniote-type coronary arteries in turtles might be related to the peculiar morphogenesis of the shoulder girdle in this lineage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Nagashima et al., 2009</xref>), but the extent to which this structural change affects cardiac function remains unknown.</p><p>The evolutionary origin of extrinsic cardiac arteries is still a mystery. Cyclostomes do not have coronary circulation, but whether this is the ancestral condition or a secondary loss is uncertain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Grant and Regnier, 1926</xref>). If they have retained the ancestral pattern, the establishment of extrinsic cardiac vessels may be related to the heterotopic shift of the cardiac region and headâ€“trunk interface in the ancestor of gnathostomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Higashiyama et al., 2016a</xref>), although further studies are warranted in this lineage.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Clinical implications of the coronary artery development</title><p>Using the present theory, we can explain some congenital coronary artery abnormalities, an uncommon disease entity covering a broad spectrum of abnormalities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>). Although many cases remain asymptomatic and are incidentally found by coronary angiography, these abnormalities sometimes cause sudden death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Taylor et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Yuan, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Villa et al., 2016</xref>). In particular, the anomalous origin of the coronary artery from the innominate (brachiocephalic) artery or adjacent aortic arch is accompanied by other severe anomalies and is often lethal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Davis and Lie, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Asada et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Pandey et al., 2019</xref>), although some patients survive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Santucci et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Duran et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kim et al., 2009</xref>). Since the brachiocephalic artery is derived from the right third pharyngeal arch artery and they pass across the ventral side of the ascending aorta, the anomalous coronary arteries in these reports are similar to ASVs. Thus, this type of anomaly can be considered persistent embryonic vasculature.</p><p>In conclusion, the present study suggests that the ventricular coronary artery, a common feature in amniotes, originated through ancestral cardiovascular remodeling during the evolution of amniotes. It is possible that this artery was necessary for the thickening of the ventricular wall, which is associated with high physiological activity. It is still undeniable that coronary artery formation through ASV remodelling may be a convergent evolution of mammals and birds. The resemblance of coronary arterial morphology in adult squamates to that of mammals and birds may reflect a potential common developmental process, although further research is required to delve deeper into this aspect. This new understanding of the evolutionary history and morphology of coronary circulation will be useful in evolutionary research on amniotes and in comparisons among animal models to study coronary artery disease.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals</title><p>Wild-type mice (<italic>Mus musculus</italic>) of the ICR background were kept in an environmentally controlled room at 23 Â± 2Â°C with a relative humidity of 50â€“60% under a 12 hr light: 12 hr dark cycle.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, including Kristy Red-Horse as Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Didier Stainier as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Guo Huang (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1. Additional species are required to support conclusions about when different cardiac vessel configurations arose during evolution.</p><p>2. Some modifications to imaging are required to confirm conclusions on ASV attachment sites.</p><p>3. Please consider the physiology and functionality of the vessel beds presented, either with comments or new experiments.</p><p>4. Some clarity in the writing is necessary.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>â€“ Detailed descriptions of mouse (e.g., Chen, JCI, 2014) and zebrafish (e.g., Harrison, Dev Cell, 2015) vasculature and their development are already available making comparisons to new species the major novelty in the work presented and anatomical descriptions are somewhat shallow in terms of the information they provide about the vessels under study.</p><p>â€“ The authors propose that the ASV/hypobrachial arteries are the ancestral coronary vessels. Given the shallow descriptions in the manuscript, the authors should provide additional information on the identity and function of these vessels and how these features are conserved.</p><p>â€“ What endothelial subtypes are the ASVs in terms of molecular markers? Are they artery, vein, or capillary in molecular identity and is this conserved? Are they covered with smooth muscle (the commonly used smooth muscle marker works in many species, and likely would in the ones used here)? Chen et al., JCI, 2014 found molecular evidence that ASVs contained blood endothelial cells and lymphatic endothelial cells while Gancz et al. <italic>eLife</italic> found that there is a lymphatic plexus at this same location.</p><p>â€“ Is the function of this vessel to provide oxygenation to the outflow tract or something else? Is there a capillary bed branching from the ASV arteries that could carry out oxygenation or is it just a larger vessel that might have a different function? Is this region of the outflow tract experiencing hypoxia despite the ASVs as defined by a chemical hypoxia probe? The authors should explore this issue.</p><p>â€“ There is an insufficient selection of most groups of vertebrate diversity to justify many of the claims made in the manuscript. Mouse and quail alone are not a sufficient sampling for all of amniote diversity. This is particularly problematic in the fish sampling, who as correctly pointed out, have incredibly diverse coronary vasculature structures. A greater actinopterygin sample is needed and a sarcopterygian would be interesting, if one with coronary vessels is known.</p><p>â€“ The developmental series in figure 2 is insufficiently sampled. Only one non-amniote is surveyed and an insufficient number of developmental timepoints sampled for <italic>Xenopus</italic>. Without more <italic>Xenopus</italic> sampling there could be a transient plexus that is lost between time points or one that forms later? Without a broader amphibian sampling we do not know that <italic>Xenopus</italic> is a proper representative of extant amphibians.</p><p>â€“ The author's claims would be bolstered if they expanded their sample sized beyond N=2 so that the finding are considered robust statistically.</p><p>â€“ The origination of the coronary orifice, in figure 3, is one of the most compelling part of the manuscript. However, it would be more so if a non-anuran amphibian, such as cynops pyrrhogaster was included to eliminate the possibility of an anuran specific trait.</p><p>â€“ Assumptions about homology from structural caparisons could be greatly strengthened by lineage tracing experiments in the subset of organisms in which this is commonplace (zebrafish, mouse, avian).</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1) The authors should include analysis or discussion of the coronary artery structure of a cold-blooded amniote species, such as lizard or snake, as the use of only mice and quail to represent amniotes makes it possible the evolutionary differences observed may be attributed to endothermic ability. Endothermic metabolism is strongly correlated with cardiac function and structure, so it may be reasonable to think that coronary arteries on the ventricle surface may have emerged to support the endothermic metabolism. If the structure of reptile arteries more closely resembles the non-amniotes, then the authors' claims of these morphological differences as developing between amniotes and non-amniotes would not be supported. If full morphological analyses of a reptile species cannot be performed, these limitations and existing literature on reptilian coronary artery structure should be discussed (https://doi.org/10.1111/brv.12056).</p><p>2) The authors should discuss the significance of the development of coronary arteries on the ventricle surface in terms of its physiological implications. The differences in vessel structure raises the question of why one configuration may be more advantageous over the other, so there should be some rationalization of why these changes have occurred throughout evolution and development. For example, it may be possible that arteries on the ventricle surface allow the heart to receive higher-oxygenated blood, allowing for greater cardiac function. Or perhaps the change of patterning arose to accommodate the denser and thicker ventricle walls seen in mammals and bird compared to non-amniotes. Such physiological implications should be included in the introduction and discussion to elevate the significance of the authors' observations.</p><p>3) The quality of images in the figures should be improved to improve clarity and strengthen the authors' claims, as their results are based on visual analysis of vasculature morphology. Specifically, Figures 1B, 2A-C, 3A-D and G, 4B-C, S1 and S2 struggle to show the intended evidence in a convincing manner and would greatly benefit from improved image quality.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Some additional comments that could help to improve the current manuscript for the authors to consider.</p><p>1. In discussion, &quot;We found that amniote type coronary arteries developed by the reconstruction of primary vessels.&quot;</p><p>â€“ What is the &quot;primary vessel&quot; in this context?</p><p>â€“ Do the amniote type coronary arteries refer to ventricular coronary arteries? If so, the manuscript does not seem to describe a developmental origin of ventricular vessels.</p><p>2. Similarly, lines 307-308 &quot;the present study shows that the true (amniote-type) coronary artery first developed by reconstitution of the ancestral cardiac vessels in amniote evolution&quot;. The word reconstruction suggests that amniote ventricular coronary arteries are derivatives of something exiting in an ancestral species. However, other parts of this discussion refer to amniote vessels as a novelty (line 260). These seemly conflicting statements could be modified for clarity.</p><p>3. The section Diversity of coronary arteries among vertebrates could be made more succinct and easier to read. For instance, discussion of the nematode vulva does not add to the section.</p><p>4. Is there another term besides &quot;so called arteries&quot; that the authors could use? This terminology reads rather casually for a scientific paper.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.83005.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>â€“ Detailed descriptions of mouse (e.g., Chen, JCI, 2014) and zebrafish (e.g., Harrison, Dev Cell, 2015) vasculature and their development are already available making comparisons to new species the major novelty in the work presented and anatomical descriptions are somewhat shallow in terms of the information they provide about the vessels under study.</p></disp-quote><p>We added three-dimensional reconstructions to compare newly acquired data on mice and frogs (Figure 2).

Given the shallow descriptions in the manuscript, the authors should provide additional information on the identity and function of these vessels and how these features are conserved.</p></disp-quote><p>The discussion of homology is a challenging task, and finding evidence to support it is even more difficult. It would be ideal if molecular markers could be identified and compared to determine commonalities between blood vessels, as the authors suggest. However, finding such markers for site-specific structures located far apart in distant lineages is uncommon. For instance, the middle ear bones of mammals and the jaw joint bones of chickens share the same genes involved in chondro- and osteogenesis but do not share any specific molecules. Still, they are obviously homologous in the topographical relationships. The changes in vascular endothelium are so extensive that even mouse and quail require different antibodies, and the degree of molecular similarity does not always lead to a determination of homology. The relationship between molecular features and homology has been the subject of numerous debates, and the concept of Character Identity Mechanism (ChIM; DiFrisco et al., 2020) has recently been established. Thus, we believe that topographical relationships still provide the best basis for determining morphological homologies for specific vessels in the body plan.</p><p>We believe that the morphological homology between the present ASVs and the truncal coronary arteries found in the amphibian outflow tract is reinforced by the additional data. Of course, recent developments such as single-cell RNA-seq hold promise for providing new insights into molecular homology. Thus, we added functional considerations to the discussion around lines 258-267.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>â€“ What endothelial subtypes are the ASVs in terms of molecular markers? Are they artery, vein, or capillary in molecular identity and is this conserved? Are they covered with smooth muscle (the commonly used smooth muscle marker works in many species, and likely would in the ones used here)? Chen et al., JCI, 2014 found molecular evidence that ASVs contained blood endothelial cells and lymphatic endothelial cells while Gancz et al. eLife found that there is a lymphatic plexus at this same location.</p></disp-quote><p>This remains uncertain even in mice. ASVs are considered blood vessels as they contain erythrocytes and connect to the aortic endothelium; however, a subset of early ASV endothelial cells express Prox1, Vegfr3, and Lyve1, which are markers for lymphatic vessels (Chen et al., 2014; Maruyama et al., 2019). This suggests that ASVs in mice may have lymphatic vessel-like identity, although they are blood vessels, and the origin of ASVs in mice has been speculated to be from Prox1+ cells, which also give rise to cardiac lymphatic vessels (Maruyama et al., 2021).</p><p>We tested to the immunohistochemistry stain amphibian tissues with smooth muscle actin and some endothelial markers for comparison, but unfortunately none of them showed satisfactory staining not only in the ASV-like vasculature but also in any vasculature throughout the body. Actually, previous studies on endothelial immunohistochemistry in amphibians are rare, and it is possible that the systemic vascular endothelium as well as the ASV may differ somewhat between amniotes and amphibians.</p><p>Thus, it is difficult to accurately identify whether the ASVs in the present study are arterial, venous, or near lymphatic. To address this, the present study treated ASVs and ASV-like vessels in amphibians simply as &quot;vessels&quot; instead of arteries, as it was difficult to determine their precise identity.</p><p>However, since ASV-like vessels in adult amphibians are thicker and have blood cells in the lumen, as well as forming cardiac veins and plexus similar to those in amniotes, it is likely that they are arteries.</p><p>The above discussion was added in the manuscript (around lines 258-267 and 290-295).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>â€“ Is the function of this vessel to provide oxygenation to the outflow tract or something else? Is there a capillary bed branching from the ASV arteries that could carry out oxygenation or is it just a larger vessel that might have a different function? Is this region of the outflow tract experiencing hypoxia despite the ASVs as defined by a chemical hypoxia probe? The authors should explore this issue.</p></disp-quote><p>Although experiments could not be performed, the fact that ASVs in mice and quail and early ASV-like vessels in amphibians are only a few Âµm in diameter and not of a size that blood cells can easily pass through, suggests that in these animal embryos ASVs probably have a limited function in oxygen supply and mainly make secondary orifice We expect that they act as signaling centers. However, in adult amphibians they would clearly have an oxygen-supplying role, as there are many blood cells inside. It is just as if the notochord, which functioned as the ancestral axial skeleton, transiently emerged as a signaling center during the vertebrate development.</p><p>We added this description in lines 290-301.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>â€“ There is an insufficient selection of most groups of vertebrate diversity to justify many of the claims made in the manuscript. Mouse and quail alone are not a sufficient sampling for all of amniote diversity. This is particularly problematic in the fish sampling, who as correctly pointed out, have incredibly diverse coronary vasculature structures. A greater actinopterygin sample is needed and a sarcopterygian would be interesting, if one with coronary vessels is known.</p></disp-quote><p>Due to limited access to embryos of multiple amniote species, we expanded our investigation to include the literature on adult coronary arteries in reptiles, such as lizards (Spalteholz, 1924; Erhart, 1935; MacKinnon and Heatwole, 1981; Farrell et al., 2012; also see Figure 1A). We also conducted the observations of the development of <italic>Hyla japonica</italic> and the fetuses of non-tetrapod sarcopterygians, such as lungfish and coelacanth. Although we were unable to identify coronary arteries in lungfish and coelacanth, previous literature on lungfish supports the idea that the distribution of coronary arteries in amphibians is highly consistent with that of lungfish (Szidon et al., 1969; Laurent et al., 1978). Thus, we can infer that the amphibian pattern is ancestral among phylogenetically sarcopterygians.</p><p>While actinopterygians exhibit a great deal of diversity, we were unable to obtain additional data. As a result, we have tempered our assertions regarding the homology of hypobranchial arteries in actinopterygians in the present paper. Nevertheless, information from lungfish and chondriichthyans suggests that the peculiar coronary arteries observed in Actinopterygians are largely phylogenetically derived modifications (see Discussion part).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>â€“ The developmental series in figure 2 is insufficiently sampled. Only one non-amniote is surveyed and an insufficient number of developmental timepoints sampled for <italic>Xenopus</italic>. Without more <italic>Xenopus</italic> sampling there could be a transient plexus that is lost between time points or one that forms later? Without a broader amphibian sampling we do not know that <italic>Xenopus</italic> is a proper representative of extant amphibians.</p></disp-quote><p>We newly obtained the three-dimensional imaging data to compare the developmental process of <italic>H. japonica</italic> with that of mice (Figure 2). We chose <italic>H. japonica</italic> because it undergoes metamorphosis from an underwater tadpole to a fully terrestrial adult, which is a more dynamic process than that of <italic>Xenopus</italic>, which remains aquatic throughout its life. The results showed that the ASV-like vessels in H. japonica stayed in the same area from the beginning of development, which is consistent with the development of <italic>Xenopus</italic> and with the anatomy other amphibians (Figure 4). We also added a histological section of the adult urodele, <italic>Cynops pyrrhogaster</italic> (Figure 4).</p><p>All these data indicate that in amphibians, ASV-like vessels are kept in the same position throughout development, with little difference in adult position between species.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>â€“ The author's claims would be bolstered if they expanded their sample sized beyond N=2 so that the finding are considered robust statistically.</p></disp-quote><p>Throughout the paper, the sample size was n=4 or more. The data for lungfish and coelacanth is only n=1, although the paper's claims are not problematic, as it supplements its discussion with findings from the previous research literature.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>â€“ The origination of the coronary orifice, in figure 3, is one of the most compelling part of the manuscript. However, it would be more so if a non-anuran amphibian, such as cynops pyrrhogaster was included to eliminate the possibility of an anuran specific trait.</p></disp-quote><p>We increased our results and discussion with a focus on the location of the coronary orifice. Unfortunately, we could not obtain the urodele embryos, but we added the data on adult orifice of Cynops pyrrhogaster (Figure 4). It was topographically same as that of anurans, suggesting that it is common in amphibians.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>â€“ Assumptions about homology from structural caparisons could be greatly strengthened by lineage tracing experiments in the subset of organisms in which this is commonplace (zebrafish, mouse, avian).</p></disp-quote><p>This experiment is difficult, and we could not add them in the present version. Also, we did not think that the lineage tracing is effective for the present study. This is because, whether ASVs or hypobranchial arteries, it is obvious that they originate from pharyngeal mesoderm because of their topographical positions. It might be effective to understand which particular pharyngeal arches produce them. But, in any case, this experiment is extremely difficult in amphibians.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>1) The authors should include analysis or discussion of the coronary artery structure of a cold-blooded amniote species, such as lizard or snake, as the use of only mice and quail to represent amniotes makes it possible the evolutionary differences observed may be attributed to endothermic ability. Endothermic metabolism is strongly correlated with cardiac function and structure, so it may be reasonable to think that coronary arteries on the ventricle surface may have emerged to support the endothermic metabolism. If the structure of reptile arteries more closely resembles the non-amniotes, then the authors' claims of these morphological differences as developing between amniotes and non-amniotes would not be supported. If full morphological analyses of a reptile species cannot be performed, these limitations and existing literature on reptilian coronary artery structure should be discussed (https://doi.org/10.1111/brv.12056).</p></disp-quote><p>We searched for non-mammalian and non-avian amniotic embryos, but this time we were unable to obtain them. We therefore referred to previous literature on reptile coronary arteries and hearts (e.g., Spalteholz, 1924; Erhart, 1935; MacKinnon and Heatwole, 1981; Farrell et al., 2012; Jensen et al., 2013a,b). The results showed that the anatomical connections of adult coronary arteries in lizards and snakes are conservative with those of mice and quails. A typical example is described in Figure 1A. We have also increased the description and discussion of reptile hearts throughout the paper.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The authors should discuss the significance of the development of coronary arteries on the ventricle surface in terms of its physiological implications. The differences in vessel structure raises the question of why one configuration may be more advantageous over the other, so there should be some rationalization of why these changes have occurred throughout evolution and development. For example, it may be possible that arteries on the ventricle surface allow the heart to receive higher-oxygenated blood, allowing for greater cardiac function. Or perhaps the change of patterning arose to accommodate the denser and thicker ventricle walls seen in mammals and bird compared to non-amniotes. Such physiological implications should be included in the introduction and discussion to elevate the significance of the authors' observations.</p></disp-quote><p>For this comment, we newly examined the correspondence between the distribution of coronary arteries and the structure of heart tissue and summarized it in Figure 7. The results suggest that the acquisition of amniote-type coronary arteries should not coincide with the evolution of changes in the structure of the ventricle. In other words, the evolution of coronary arteries itself was probably not caused by physiological demands. Perhaps it depends more on morphological changes in the pharyngeal arch artery and neck. However, the establishment of the amniote-type coronary artery may have enabled the development of thick myocardium in mammals and birds. We added this argument in the Results and the Discussion parts.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The quality of images in the figures should be improved to improve clarity and strengthen the authors' claims, as their results are based on visual analysis of vasculature morphology. Specifically, Figures 1B, 2A-C, 3A-D and G, 4B-C, S1 and S2 struggle to show the intended evidence in a convincing manner and would greatly benefit from improved image quality.</p></disp-quote><p>We improved all photos and layouts of all figures as possible.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>Some additional comments that could help to improve the current manuscript for the authors to consider.</p><p>1. In discussion, &quot;We found that amniote type coronary arteries developed by the reconstruction of primary vessels.&quot;</p><p>â€“ What is the &quot;primary vessel&quot; in this context?</p><p>â€“ Do the amniote type coronary arteries refer to ventricular coronary arteries? If so, the manuscript does not seem to describe a developmental origin of ventricular vessels.</p></disp-quote><p>This sentence was indeed inaccurate. We have completely rewritten the relevant section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. Similarly, lines 307-308 &quot;the present study shows that the true (amniote-type) coronary artery first developed by reconstitution of the ancestral cardiac vessels in amniote evolution&quot;. The word reconstruction suggests that amniote ventricular coronary arteries are derivatives of something exiting in an ancestral species. However, other parts of this discussion refer to amniote vessels as a novelty (line 260). These seemly conflicting statements could be modified for clarity.</p></disp-quote><p>We have avoided the conclusion that the amniote-type ventricular coronary arteries are an evolutionary novelty. Throughout the paper, we emphasize that they are the result of remodeling during development.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. The section Diversity of coronary arteries among vertebrates could be made more succinct and easier to read. For instance, discussion of the nematode vulva does not add to the section.</p></disp-quote><p>We reorganized and entirely rewrote the chapter. We decided to avoid the famous specific example of nematode vulva and cite True and Haag, 2001, which were the first to define DSD.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. Is there another term besides &quot;so called arteries&quot; that the authors could use? This terminology reads rather casually for a scientific paper.</p></disp-quote><p>We rewrote to avoid confusion, using names such as &quot;truncal coronary arteries&quot; and &quot;amniote-type ventricular coronary arteries&quot; depending on the context. Only the strange coronary arteries of the caecilians, which we did not know the proper name for, remained &quot;so-called coronary arteries.&quot;</p></body></sub-article></article>
