In rodents, tactile stimulation elicits the endogenous release of OT, potentially facilitating attachment and other forms of prosocial behavior, yet the relationship between endogenous OT and neural modulation remains unexplored in humans. Using a serial sampling of plasma hormone levels during functional neuroimaging across two successive social interactions, we show that contextual circumstances of social touch influence not only current hormonal and brain responses but also <italic>later</italic> responses. Namely, touch from a male to his female romantic partner enhanced her subsequent OT release for touch from an unfamiliar stranger, yet females’ OT responses to partner touch were dampened following stranger touch. Hypothalamus and dorsal raphe activation reflected plasma OT changes during the initial social interaction. In the subsequent interaction, precuneus and parietal-temporal cortex pathways tracked time- and context-dependent variables in an OT-dependent manner. This OT-dependent cortical modulation included a region of the medial prefrontal cortex that also covaried with plasma cortisol, suggesting an influence on stress responses. These findings demonstrate that modulation between hormones and the brain during human social interactions can flexibly adapt to features of social context over time.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>oxytocin</kwd><kwd>touch</kwd><kwd>fMRI</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004359</institution-id><institution>Vetenskapsrådet</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>FYF-2013-687</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Morrison</surname><given-names>India</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Touch-mediated social interactions in human females elicited endogenous oxytocin and brain responses in a covariant manner, and these changes were modulated by the familiarity of the person delivering touch as well as the recent history of social interaction.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>A hug from a friend, a caress from a lover, the secure embrace of a parent: touch is a predominant channel for bolstering human connection and emotional attachment. The neural mechanisms supporting this vital role of touch are not fully understood, but there is evidence from rodents that tactile stimulation in social interactions can act as a major trigger for the endogenous release of the neuropeptide hormone OT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kurosawa et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Tang et al., 2020</xref>), which has been implicated in the social attachment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Feldman, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Uvnäs-Moberg et al., 2014</xref>). It has, therefore, been suggested that social tactile stimulation such as affectionate stroking may elicit endogenous OT release in adult humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chen et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kreuder et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Li et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Walker et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>In this perspective, stimulation of tactile nerves in the skin initiates a cascade of modulatory responses in the brain, mediated by specific neural populations in the hypothalamus. It is well-established that magnocellular OT neurons in the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) of the hypothalamus send projections to the forebrain and cortical regions mediating olfactory and somatosensory signaling in the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Burbach et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Knobloch et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Mitre et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Oettl et al., 2016</xref>). For tactile stimulation, this signaling may rely on a population of parvocellular OT neurons in the PVN selective for particular forms of affiliative touch (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Tang et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Wang et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Yu et al., 2022</xref>). OT released into the bloodstream via a PVN-pituitary gland pathway modulates the action of vasculature and smooth muscle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Qin et al., 2009</xref>), notably during processes surrounding reproductive behavior in both sexes, as well as parturition and lactation in females (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Filippi et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Uvnäs-Moberg, 1998</xref>).</p><p>OT’s broad role in parental nurturance and affiliative behavior may reflect a functional extension of its influence on these core reproductive and maternal behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Walum and Young, 2018</xref>), many of which rely on sensory cues such as touch and olfaction, and can even encompass cross-species interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Algoe et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Nagasawa et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Rehn et al., 2014</xref>). Many OT-relevant sensory stimuli likely involve central pathways of OT in the brain, but peripheral mechanisms of release can also be triggered by stimulation of the genitals, the nipples, or the vagal nerve. Both central and peripheral mechanisms can play a role in such stimulus-driven effects of OT on social behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Althammer et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>In contrast, the influence of exogenous, intranasal OT (IN-OT) administration on behavioral and neural outcomes has been widely studied with regard to social stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Di Simplicio et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Heinrichs et al., 2003</xref>) For example, IN-OT have shown varying effects on social outcome measures such as face processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Fischer-Shofty et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Petrovic et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Rimmele et al., 2009</xref>), empathy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Domes et al., 2007</xref>), romantic relationships and bonding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Ditzen et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kreuder et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Scheele et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Scheele et al., 2013</xref>), and romantic touch (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kreuder et al., 2019</xref>). Neuroimaging studies of IN-OT manipulations indicate that many relevant changes occur at the cortical level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Wang et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Zink and Meyer-Lindenberg, 2012</xref>), suggesting more complex modulatory pathways than is implied by a stimulus-driven model focused on signaling from afferent receptors to subcortical brain regions.</p><p>There is uncertainty surrounding the mechanisms of action of IN-OT and its degree of equivalence to endogenous release, chiefly regarding the questions of whether the molecule crosses the blood-brain barrier, and how peripheral effects can be disentangled from central effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Churchland and Winkielman, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Striepens et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Wang et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Zink and Meyer-Lindenberg, 2012</xref>, but see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">McCullough et al., 2013</xref>). It is, therefore, crucial to investigate endogenous OT changes and their neural correlates in humans for a fuller understanding of its relevant mechanisms and functional roles, as well as its potential limits and parameters.</p><p>One potential role for endogenous OT release in human social interactions may lie in stress regulation. OT modulates cardiovascular responses, playing a key role in regulating the autonomic nervous system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Uvnäs-Moberg, 1998</xref>). OT may also modulate stress responses via an interplay with hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) mechanisms affecting the hormone cortisol, a key mediator of stress responses. Research in rats has suggested a role in particular tactile-mediated social behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Tang et al., 2020</xref>), while research in dogs has suggested a role for endogenous OT in touch during the social reunion with their owners, which may also involve cortisol changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Rehn et al., 2014</xref>). In, humans, neuroimaging research on touch and OT has implicated the orbitofrontal cortex during foot massage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Li et al., 2019</xref>). No clear overall picture of a relationship between endogenous OT and the brain has yet emerged, however.</p><p>Social, affective touch has also been associated with a specific subtype of afferent nerve fiber called C-tactile (CT) afferents in humans (C-low-threshold mechanoreceptors or C-LTMRs in rodent models), which are found in hair-follicle-containing skin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Löken et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Morrison et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Olausson et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Walker et al., 2017</xref>). CTs increase firing frequency for caress-like touch stimulation, which has correlated with subjective reports of touch pleasantness on a group level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Walker et al., 2017</xref>). Because both OT and CTs have been implicated in affective touch, it has been proposed that OT may be involved in CT-related neural mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Walker et al., 2017</xref>). Any such link would be supported if brain regions preferentially responding to touch on the CT-rich skin of the arm, compared to the CT-poor skin of the palm, showed specific OT-brain covariation. Alternatively, any cortex-OT modulation for social touch may be independent of any particular peripheral nerve type. Further, a general OT-brain comodulation may depend more heavily on contextual factors such as the familiarity of the interacting individual, as well as aspects of recent experience and current physiological state.</p><p>In this study, we examined whether social interactions involving touch can evoke endogenous changes in plasma OT in human females and whether this would be modulated by interacting with a socially familiar individual. Given the preponderance of OT studies in male populations, we also took a ‘female-first’ strategy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Shansky and Murphy, 2021</xref>) by testing hormone and brain responses in a female population. This experiment investigated the influence of contextual variables on endogenous hormones and their relationship with brain changes by combining serial sampling of plasma OT and cortisol with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). We predicted that touch from a socially familiar person (a romantic partner) would evoke greater endogenous OT changes than touch from an unfamiliar person (a nonthreatening stranger), allowing investigation of the neural responses associated with any such modulation. On the neural level, we expected engagement of the hypothalamus and other key regions associated with evolutionarily-conserved circuitry of OT modulation and receptor expression in different species (such as the amygdala, medial prefrontal cortex, and cingulate cortex).</p><p>Crucially, we also explored whether these OT-brain modulation changes would be modulated by participants’ very recent social interaction history with familiar or unfamiliar others. Each participant was caressed by both their partner and an unfamiliar yet unthreatening stranger over two successive parts of the same experimental session, while a total of eight plasma OT samples and six plasma cortisol samples per participant were collected over the session (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). The presentation order of partner or stranger across the two successive touch interactions during the experiment was counterbalanced: the stranger’s touch could either precede the partner’s touch or come after it. If the order of partner/stranger presentation influences OT-brain modulation, this should be reflected in plasma OT and brain responses, though we did not hypothesize a direction for any such effect. The ultimate aim of this experimental design was to identify brain regions in which hemodynamic responses changed as a function of endogenous OT levels over the experimental session, thus revealing any context-sensitive, OT-dependent engagement of both subcortical, and cortical systems.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) experiment setup.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) (1) Indwelling catheter in female participant’s left arm (arrow); (2) participant’s male partner or unfamiliar stranger caressed the participant, following audio prompts; (3) serial blood samples were collected from the catheter.

We predicted lower plasma cortisol levels for the partner compared to the stranger, and an inverse relationship between OT and cortisol measures, during social touch interactions. The paradigm also allowed for investigation of the question of whether brain regions showing differential responses to touch on arm skin, rich in CT afferent nerves, as compared to CT-poor palm skin, would show selective OT-dependent modulation.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Behavioral measures</title><sec id="s2-1-1"><title>Self-report questionnaires</title><p>Before entering the fMRI scanner, both the participant and her partner separately filled out two questionnaires: the Couples Satisfaction Index (CSI; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Funk and Rogge, 2007</xref>) and the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Spielberger, 1970</xref>).

These clusters included the right superior occipital gyrus (SOG) extending into the right cuneus, and the left angular gyrus (AG). These interactions are explained by a more negative relationship between BOLD and OT change in the stranger first group, which reflects greater relative BOLD increases in individuals showing smaller percent change in OT levels. Specifically, whereas BOLD increase in SOG/cuneus showed a positive relationship in the partner first group (partner first, stranger second), these relationships were negative in the stranger first group, particularly for stranger.

To explore whether BOLD signal changes in the hypothalamus covaried with OT levels with respect to familiarity, we first explored whether all subjects included in the whole-brain analysis had representative data in those voxels to be included in a region of interest (ROI) approach. To do this, we used the Neurosynth database’s ‘association test map’ for the search term ‘hypothalamus’ (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://neurosynth.org/analyses/terms/hypothalamus">https://neurosynth.org/analyses/terms/hypothalamus</ext-link>). This 1565-voxel map also encompassed regions outside the hypothalamus (e.g. thalamus and brainstem), so a restricted threshold was applied to include only voxels located in the hypothalamus. The size of the final ROI was 111 voxels, and this was used in a subsequent SVC analysis including 25 of the initial 27 participants. Two participants (one per group) were excluded as they had data for fewer than 50% of the ROI voxels in at least one of the two functional runs (partner touch, stranger touch). Within this cluster, a subset of 15 voxels showing greater increases for partner touch than stranger touch survived stricter cluster correction at p=0.002.

To determine whether a given data point was an outlier in this regard for the hypothalamus region-of-interest, we, therefore, examined the standard deviations of the residuals in the model (distance above and below the trendline), by entering the values into a regression model with beta values as an independent variable and OT (maximum % change from baseline) as a dependent variable. The standardized residuals were calculated in standard deviation units for each group (partner first and stranger first). These showed that all standardized residuals fell within ±3.

On the other hand, today’s familiar friend was yesterday’s stranger: an interaction with a person one has never met can lay the groundwork for future interactions. Neural and hormonal changes elicited during successive social interactions must, therefore, not only be able to maintain stability with respect to established social relationships (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Quintana and Guastella, 2020</xref>) —such as with a romantic partner—but must also be adaptable in the face of new or less certain relationships, such as meeting a new individual. The present findings shed light on the participation of OT in brain-OT covariation during social encounters with both familiar and unfamiliar individuals. They imply that OT and the brain can flexibly coordinate and calibrate responses depending on whom an individual is currently socially interacting with, and with whom the individual has recently interacted.</p><p>The most general finding was that touch-mediated social interactions in human females elicited endogenous OT and brain responses in a covariant manner. Beyond this, OT and neural changes were modulated by the familiarity of the person delivering touch, as well as the recent history of social interaction. The effect of these contextual factors on within-subject endogenous OT changes manifested in a mutual influence between the familiarity of the social interactant (partner or stranger) and the order of his presentation over two immediately successive social interactions (partner then stranger, or stranger then partner). This influence was driven by a greater increase in plasma OT responses for the stranger following partner touch, in the absence of a corresponding increase for partner touch following stranger touch (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). This dependence of OT responses on both familiarity and presentation order is consistent with evidence for cumulative effects of central OT exposure over repeated interactions with specific individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Burkett et al., 2016</xref>), as well as the established context-sensitivity of OT effects in nonhuman mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bartz et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>Social familiarity and presentation order also influenced the timecourse of the eight plasma samples collected during the experimental session, with this influence driven by OT responses to stranger touch following partner touch. The OT increase for stranger touch in this condition did not show a stable rise but rather dipped to below-baseline levels across participants before recovering to above-baseline levels by the end of the social encounter. A tentative interpretation of this pattern is that the initial partner encounter may have introduced a bias for OT increase during the subsequent stranger encounter, though not as a sustained carryover from the preceding partner interaction. In contrast, plasma OT remained at baseline levels when the experimental session began with an encounter with an unfamiliar stranger. The recovery of OT in the stranger-second condition could thus reflect a facilitation of underlying endogenous release mechanisms following the prior partner interaction. Overall, these endogenous OT changes may reflect mechanisms that selectively bias the way social stimuli are processed in the central nervous system during social interactions, with high dependence on contextual information.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>BOLD correlates of endogenous OT changes</title><p>The mutual influences observed in OT levels among social familiarity and partner/stranger presentation order were mirrored in OT-covariant BOLD responses in key parietotemporal and frontal regions, on a whole-brain level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). In particular, OT changes showed mutual influences with both familiarity and presentation order in the temporal pole (TP). In SMG/AG, IFG, mPFC/ACC, and superior frontal gyrus, OT-brain covariation was affected by the familiarity of the individual delivering the touch. These parietotemporal and medial prefrontal regions have been implicated in individual intranasal-OT studies of partner-stranger interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kreuder et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kreuder et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Scheele et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Scheele et al., 2013</xref>), animate visual social stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lancaster et al., 2015</xref>), as well as in meta-analyses of intranasal-OT fMRI activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Wang et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Zink and Meyer-Lindenberg, 2012</xref>) and even in tactile foot massage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Li et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Co-modulation between OT changes and BOLD in parietotemporal pathways may reflect updating of contextual information, possibly enhancing the salience of incoming sensory signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Johnson et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Shamay-Tsoory and Abu-Akel, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Sripada et al., 2013</xref>) or of personally-relevant stimuli <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alaerts et al., 2021</xref> following the initial encounter.</p><p>SMG/AG, MTG, and ITG/TP all showed a more positive relationship between BOLD and the degree of OT increase during partner compared to stranger encounters.

Here, BOLD was <italic>greater</italic> in individuals with <italic>smaller</italic> OT changes during the partner-second condition. Conversely, BOLD in an ITG/TP cluster was greater in individuals in the partner-first group in whom OT change was smaller (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, green), likewise indicative of selective modulation. This implies that initial OT-brain biases by partner or stranger may give rise to recalibration processes, acting either against (i.e. partner second for AG, stranger second for ITG/TP) or with (all other conditions) the degree of endogenous OT changes. A speculative interpretation is that OT-brain co-modulation may find and maintain a stable response profile following partner touch, even after an unfamiliar stranger is presented, whereas such recalibration can be more sluggish following an initial encounter with the stranger. This may reflect an enlistment of parietotemporal regions in gain control mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Grinevich and Ludwig, 2021</xref>)—more akin to a dimmer switch than an on-off button— with the ‘dimmer’ tuning from a wider, more flexible response range under higher contextual certainty (partner first) to a narrower, less flexible range under lower contextual certainty (stranger first).</p><p>In the initial touch encounter, the preferential increase in plasma OT levels for the partner is consistent with the familiarity-dependent effects of OT in rodents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Burkett et al., 2016</xref>). This basic partner-stranger difference was reflected in hypothalamus OT-covariance as a function of individual changes in plasma OT levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). This is in accord with the conserved mammalian neuroanatomy of central OT release, in which hypothalamic nuclei, particularly the PVN, synthesize OT and stimulate its release in the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Burbach et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Knobloch et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Mitre et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Oettl et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Wang et al., 2022</xref>). In rats, stroking touch increases Fos protein expression in PVN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Okabe et al., 2015</xref>), and recent evidence from freely-interacting female rats indicates that a population of parvocellular OT neurons in PVN is selectively tuned to social touch stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Tang et al., 2020</xref>) and also that this is associated with subsequent changes in levels of plasma OT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Tang et al., 2020</xref>). In the present study, BOLD changes in dorsal Raphe nuclei were also covaried with plasma OT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Specifically, when the stranger touched first, BOLD in both the hypothalamus and dorsal Raphe was greater the lower the mean OT across individuals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref>), whereas no such modulation of OT-BOLD covariance was observed for partner. This may reflect descending modulatory influence on afferent touch signals from the periphery, manifesting here as a negative relationship between BOLD and OT during stranger touch (the BOLD signal cannot distinguish hemodynamic activity resulting from excitation or inhibition).</p><p>Central effects of IN-OT have consistently been found ~45 min post-administration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Martins et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Sripada et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Valstad et al., 2017</xref>), but there is less direct evidence about the timecourse of central endogenous OT release into the periphery in humans. We, therefore, developed an exploratory regressor based on the serial pattern of individuals’ OT levels. Assuming a mechanism in which plasma OT changes were affected by central release in the brain and thus came after it in time, this regressor allowed us to look ‘backward’ from the temporal pattern of the plasma OT sample series to any preceding hemodynamic activation that tracked with this pattern. The pattern-covariant engagement of the precuneus at 2.5 min preceding sampling, and of precuneus, retrosplenial cortex, and mPFC at 2 min, is within the frame of the half-life of OT in the blood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Pow and Morris, 1989</xref>) and may reflect events surrounding central OT release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Qin et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). Although the present results lack the sufficient temporal and causal resolution to address this, it is possible that any descending OT influence from the brain to the periphery instates a ‘reafferent loop’ in which central-to-peripheral changes can, in turn, influence incoming sensory information, perhaps at the level of spinal and/or brainstem mechanisms.</p><p>Retrosplenial cortex projects to mPFC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Margulies et al., 2009</xref>), while precuneus is functionally connected to the AG region showing interactions between OT and familiarity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>; bilateral AG extending to left SMG) and OT and order (right AG), described above. IN-OT administration can also induce changes in functional connectivity between precuneus and AG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kumar et al., 2020</xref>). These findings imply that the precuneus, retrosplenial cortex, and mPFC may act as arbiters of activation in parietotemporal and limbic networks, potentially influencing responses to social touch via contextual integration and affecting regulation processes. For example, the covariant relationship of ITG activation with plasma OT changes as well as touch pleasantness ratings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>), suggests a potential role for this region in maintaining receptivity to touch following contextual shifts. Such OT-dependent neural dynamics may play a critical role in calibrating social receptivity, especially over multiple social encounters. It is not possible to determine the directness or direction of any corticocortical influences from these exploratory findings, however.</p><p>Here, mean plasma cortisol levels were higher for stranger than for partner during the first encounter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>) and these decreased as mean OT levels increased during the course of the experiment. OT has been implicated in stress regulation via corticotropin-releasing-hormone (CRH) pathways that result in cortisol changes, and so may act as a physiological regulator of acute stress-related responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Ditzen et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Grewen et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Petersson and Uvnäs-Moberg, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Vargas-Martínez et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Winter and Jurek, 2019</xref>). Here, plasma cortisol levels covaried with BOLD for partner in the initial encounter in several regions, including a mPFC activation that contained an OT-sensitive cluster (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). Further, activation in both mPFC, implicated in cortical-amygdala signaling following IN-OT, and superior temporal gyrus (STG), implicated across a range of multisensory integration, including touch (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Davidovic et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kaiser et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Voos et al., 2013</xref>), decreased for initial stranger touch as a function of cortisol, compared to partner.</p><p>Taken together, these selective hormone-brain changes support the view that endogenous OT’s role in human social interaction is heavily modulated by contextual factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bartz et al., 2011</xref>), and provides further evidence that this role can involve modulation in a positive or a negative direction, depending on the situation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hovey et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">LoParo et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Rickenbacher et al., 2017</xref>). For example, in prairie voles, higher levels of endogenous OT can mediate prosocial grooming of stressed others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Burkett et al., 2016</xref>), but optogenetic manipulation of the same PVN OT neurons in freely-behaving mice can result in either prosocial or antagonistic behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Yu et al., 2022</xref>). OT and OT receptor genotypes have also been shown to play a role in antagonistic social behaviors such as the defense of offspring in rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Rickenbacher et al., 2017</xref>) and aggression in rodents and humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hovey et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">LoParo et al., 2016</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Hormone-independent BOLD changes</title><p>BOLD responses in several key regions were independent of plasma OT or cortisol changes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>), suggesting an absence of direct, covariant modulation with respect to these endogenous hormones. The bilateral amygdalae were activated in a general fashion across all encounters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp5">Supplementary file 5</xref>), with the left amygdala selective for stranger touch, particularly in the first encounter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). Amygdala activation has been widely implicated in human IN-OT studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kirsch et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Liu et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Motoki et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Sripada et al., 2013</xref>), yet with inconsistent reports of the direction of BOLD changes, implying a dependence on experimental and methodological factors. In mice, OT receptor-expressing neurons in the medial amygdala have been found to mediate olfactory-based social familiarity effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ferguson et al., 2001</xref>). Here, though, stranger touch activated the amygdala in a general fashion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp5">Supplementary file 5</xref>), supporting the proposal that its prominent role in human and nonhuman primate OT studies may be indirect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Eckstein et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gothard and Fuglevand, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Putnam et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>IN-OT has been observed to increase the pleasantness of touch (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chen et al., 2020</xref>), and individuals with higher salivary OT levels have reported greater touch pleasantness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Portnova et al., 2020</xref>). Likewise, CT afferent nerve responses in the skin have been associated with subjective touch pleasantness of caress-like stimuli on a group level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Löken et al., 2009</xref>), though pleasantness ratings for touch show individual variability and lack of specificity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Croy et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Sailer et al., 2020</xref>). However, this experiment provided no supporting evidence for a putative relationship between OT and CT afferent nerve activity associated with affective touch. Primary somatosensory cortex showed selective activation for touch on the palm. Yet no OT-BOLD covariance was observed here or in arm-specific regions such as the posterior insula/PO, which might have indicated a link between stimulation of CT-rich skin and endogenous OT. In rodent models, oxytocin receptor (OXTR) expression has so far not been identified in dorsal horn neurons of the spinothalamic tract projecting to the specific thalamic pathways putatively shared by CT afferents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gauriau and Bernard, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Moreno-López et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Nersesyan et al., 2017</xref>). On a subjective level, participants found palm touch from a stranger less pleasant during the initial encounter, which was not predicted. This potentially reflects a functional difference in the palm’s prominent role in active sensorimotor exploration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Morrison, 2022</xref>), and perhaps potentiation of approach or withdrawal from others’ touch. Further research is, therefore, needed to explore any functional link between CT afferents and OT.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Limitations and future directions</title><p>Measurement of peripheral OT in humans comes with caveats, as does its relationship with central mechanisms of release. Different methods for detecting plasma OT have yielded different and sometimes uncorrelated sets of value ranges, with measurement issues centering around the selectivity with which testing components detect bound or unbound protein, or whole or fragmentary molecules. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) has consistently been found to correlate more strongly with brain OT levels than does plasma OT, while CSF and plasma OT measurements have shown weak or no correlation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Caicedo Mera et al., 2021</xref>). However, at least a proportion of inconsistencies in reported findings may depend on a historical tendency to investigate basal levels, rather than acute stimuli more likely to evoke coordinated, biologically-meaningful responses across the central and peripheral nervous systems. Such responses may also include the bioactivity of OT fragments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Uvnäs Moberg et al., 2019</xref>). In this study, though, within-subject serial sampling allowed assessment of evoked OT changes with respect to individual baselines. The covariation of these changes and their temporal patterns with BOLD points to a relationship between the central and peripheral effects of ecologically-evoked endogenous OT, but cannot directly demonstrate it.</p><p>Most human studies manipulating OT (usually via nasal administration) have been performed in male populations. In contrast, the present study used a ‘female-first’ strategy which moves to redress this imbalance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Shansky and Murphy, 2021</xref>; likewise, recent research in rodents has focused on OT-touch mechanisms in female samples (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Tang et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Yu et al., 2022</xref>). Here, we found no effect of the cycle phase on evoked OT changes. An important question for future research is whether, and to what extent, these results in human females generalize to males, especially with regard to any familiarity-dependent bias in endogenous OT. Another potential sex difference may lie in the relationships between OT, cortisol, and their covariation in mPFC.</p><p>In everyday life, we humans must navigate a complex and ever-changing social terrain, with some stable elements (for example, established relationships) and other less-stable ones (new or uncertain relationships). This presents a challenge for maintaining the stability of existing social bonds on the one hand, yet also establishing and calibrating newer social relationships on the other hand. These findings suggest a role for OT-brain covariation in such adaptive responses. A positive social interaction context (such as a pleasant touch interaction with one’s partner) may selectively bias the system towards a certain shorter-term neurohormonal response profile, whereas a less certain or less positive social context (such as an unusual interaction with a stranger) may bias it towards a different profile. For example, this could mean that starting the day with a positive social interaction can set up a virtuous circle that perpetuates itself through the day’s social interactions; whereas an uncertain or negative interaction could bias one’s responses towards remaining dampened. Such differential outcomes may potentially influence neural processing and behavior in longer-term social interactions. An important avenue for future research will be to investigate the behavioral effects of these neural and physiological differences, especially with respect to social relationships over time.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Conclusions</title><p>These findings offer a methodological and conceptual bridge between stimulus-driven and context-sensitive frameworks of endogenous OT modulation of the brain during social interactions. Touch-mediated social interactions evoked changes in endogenous OT, indicating the importance of the stimulus. Yet these responses were nevertheless influenced by specific features of social context, with the plasma of OT levels showing biases depending on the familiarity of the interacting person and the recent history of interaction. Such adaptive responses could reflect a gain-control-like role for OT-brain neuromodulation, comparable to a dimmer switch, which can effectively preserve stability with respect to established social relationships while also allowing for a change in new ones (possibly via increases or decreases in inhibitory influence). Across successive social encounters, such modulatory mechanisms may calibrate neural and behavioral receptivity, whether mediated by touch or another channel such as vision or speech. Network hubs in parietotemporal pathways, alongside precuneus and retrosplenial cortex, may be key for turning the ‘dimmer’ of OT-brain processing up or down depending on past and current social context.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Participants</title><p>42 females in committed heterosexual romantic relationships of at least one year (age <italic>M</italic>=24.6 years, SD = 4.6, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp6">Supplementary file 6</xref>), participated in the study with their male partners (age <italic>M</italic>=26.8 years, SD = 6.0).

This took place in the same building as the MR suite.</p><p>In the ensuing 45–60 min the participant and her partner filled out two questionnaires (separately); the Couples Satisfaction Index (CSI; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Funk and Rogge, 2007</xref>) and the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Spielberger, 1970</xref>). The CSI is a 32-item scale designed to measure satisfaction in a relationship. The total score is the sum of responses across all 32 items and can range from 0 to 161. Scores below 104.5 suggest relationship dissatisfaction, while higher scores suggest greater levels of relationship satisfaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Funk and Rogge, 2007</xref>). The STAI was used to measure the participants’ self-assessed anxiety. There are two subscales in STAI; one that determines state anxiety (STAI-S) and one that measures trait anxiety (STAI-T). The questionnaire contains 40 items in total and each item is scored on a 4-point Likert scale, with a total score range of 20–80 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Spielberger, 1970</xref>). The median alpha reliability coefficients in healthy individuals for the STAI questionnaire (STAI-S and STAI-T) are 0.92 and 0.90, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Spielberger, 1970</xref>). Missing data in both the CSI and STAI questionnaires (maximum two missing values) was handled with hot deck imputation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Myers, 2011</xref>).</p><p>After completing the questionnaires, participants and their partners received instructions about the experimental procedure together. They were requested not to touch each other during this period. They were also informed of the presentation order (partner or stranger first) and were briefly introduced to the stranger (a male employee working in the lab), before going into the scanner. Before the partner/stranger entered the MR room for a functional run, the participant was informed over the audio system about who would be entering the room. This was to reduce any uncertainty as to the identity of the person delivering the touch, to avoid the risk of increasing psychological distress for the participant, as well as any potential increase in variance in the measures collected. Partners that were to deliver touch in the second run waited in a furnished staff break room until they were accompanied to the MR room.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Experimental design and session structure</title><p>The participants performed both sessions during their single visit to the lab, i.e., they received a touch from both partner and stranger during the same visit. The experimental paradigm implemented a 2 × 2 × 2 factorial design: ‘familiarity’ (partner/stranger, blocked by run), ‘order’ (partner or stranger in the first encounter, counterbalanced), and ‘site’ of the touch (arm or palm). Each session included one 7 min functional run that consisted of twelve 12 s touch stimulation trials, with arm and palm stimulation pseudorandomized within the run, and a jittered 21–30 s intertrial interval. The first functional run was preceded by a T1-weighted anatomical scan. There was a~27 mn interval between the first and second session, during which the participants remained in the scanner, and T2-weighted anatomical scans, resting state, and diffusion data (not analyzed here) were collected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>).</p><p>Touch stimulation was delivered manually by the male interactant (partner and stranger). Caressing strokes were delivered to the right dorsal arm or palm, with timing and touch site guided by auditory cues via headphones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). The interactant was positioned beside the scanner bore on the right side of the participant. In the initial encounter (the first of the two functional runs), participants either received a touch from their partner or the stranger, and vice-versa in the second encounter (n=24 and n=18, respectively). In the last 7 s of each trial, the participant rated the pleasantness of the touch on a visual analog scale (VAS), anchored with ‘most unpleasant imaginable touch’ on one extreme and ‘most pleasant imaginable touch’ on the other. Responses were made with the right hand using a response pad system (four-Button Diamond Fiber Optic Response Pad, Current Designs).</p><p>16 serial blood samples (of which nine OT and seven cortisol; &lt;70 ml total) were collected from each participant during the session: a pre-run OT and cortisol baseline for each of the two sessions (preceding the T1 anatomical and preceding the resting state scans, respectively); three samples during each run at 1:00 min, 3:30 min (OT only), and 6:30 min; and a final post-session sample outside the scanner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). In order to keep the collected blood volume &lt;70 ml, OT but not cortisol sampling was performed at 3:30 min. All blood samples were collected by a nurse and an assistant, who was positioned beside the scanner bore on the left side of the participant. Samples were collected through the indwelling catheter using vacutainer tubes (which rely on the vacuum action of puncturing of a vial’s rubber seal). The two functional runs were separated by ~27 min, allowing OT levels to return to baseline between runs. Samples collected in EDTA-tubes were used for OT analysis and samples collected in serum-gel tubes were used for cortisol analysis. All samples were centrifuged at 4 °C at 10,000 g for 10 min and plasma and serum were then aliquoted and stored at –20 °C until analysis.</p><p>After the MR session, the participants evaluated how relaxing they had found partner and stranger touch, how attractive and trustworthy they had found the stranger, and how relaxing the interaction with the nurse had been. All ratings were performed using a visual analog scale (VAS), with –10 as the most negative rating and +10 as the most positive rating.</p><p>Occasionally, practical obstacles were encountered, such as coagulation within the catheter or cessation of blood flow from the vein, that resulted in incomplete data series for some participants. We, therefore, sought to maximize analysis for each type of data wherever possible, and so the number of included participants differs between analyzes.

Functional data were first de-spiked. Each EPI volume and the T1 were then aligned to the EPI volume with the minimum outlier fraction (using the AFNI outlier definition) to correct for motion. Functional images were warped to the MNI 152 template using a combination of affine and non-linear transformations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cox et al., 2017</xref>). Finally, spatial smoothing was applied with a 10 mm full-width at the half-maximum filter. Residual effects of head motion were corrected by including the estimated motion parameters (and their first-order derivatives) as regressors of no interest. A motion censoring threshold of 0.2 mm per TR was implemented in combination with an outlier fraction threshold of 0.1. Volumes violating either of these thresholds were subsequently ignored in the time-series regression. On average, a higher number of volumes was censored for partner arm (14,33±16,81%), than for the other three conditions (partner palm: 9,55±14,18%; stranger arm: 7,78±10,22%; stranger palm: 6,49±8,67%). In line with our approach of maximizing the amount of analyzable data, we decided to not discard additional participants based on the number of censored volumes per condition.</p><p>For each participant, whole-brain voxel-wise general linear models (GLM) were created for each of the two runs using 3dDeconvolve. One regressor (convolved with a standard model of the hemodynamic response function, HRF) modeled each of the conditions: partner arm, partner palm, stranger arm, stranger palm. To determine the specific effects of partner and stranger touch regardless of stimulation site, GLMs were created with partner and stranger as regressors. These were used for all analyses, except the linear mixed-effects model with OT covariate (see below). Each regressor modeled 10 s within the 12 s touch interval, beginning 2 s after the onset of touch stimulation and ending with stimulation offset. We also included additional regressors of no interest to model the effects of motor responses during the rating of the touch stimuli.</p><p>At the group level, the AFNI program 3dClustSim was used to determine cluster-size thresholds for identifying effects significant at <italic>α</italic>=0.05 family-wise-error (FWE) corrected (within-cluster).

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, including Rebecca Shansky as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Floris de Lange as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in the review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Rebecca Shansky (Reviewer #1); Stephanie Preston (Reviewer #2); Jellina Prinsen (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission. Note that all three reviewers were very positive about this manuscript, and recommendations are virtually all to improve clarity so that the broadest readership possible can appreciate the study.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>An explanation of the choice to compare arm vs palm touch would be helpful – is there a known difference in how touch to these two body parts is perceived?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>This was an awesome study with a design that was not for the faint of heart. The ability to collect so many concurrent measures, with a study that required three specific people to be present each time, is difficult and rarely attempted. The authors are applauded for this effort.</p><p>I so appreciated the study, its results, and the implications for the field that I worry that people won't be able to discern its value readily enough, owing to the complexity.</p><p>Experts from this subfield field will already be able to appreciate the study as is, but social bonding and OT are of widespread interest and OT mechanisms are often oversimplified. Thus, I think it's worthwhile to make edits so that the paper can be widely appreciated. To increase the reach, I think the conceptual parts should be more emphasized (e.g.., state the few key hypotheses up front and how they reflect the state of knowledge in the field and dictated the design, what the results were, whether they support or do not support those hypotheses, and what it all means). It's easier for people to follow results when the nature/meaning of the effect is the focus and stats come after or in a table E.g., instead of &quot;there was a three-way interaction of X, Y, and Z,&quot; you could say, As predicted, OT levels were sensitive to the context of the interaction, as levels were higher/lower for X partner than Z partner but only when X happened….(demonstrated in the 2x2 interaction STATS, and the main effects of partner STATS, and time STATS--or put those in a table). Here are some places where I noted confusion that could be ameliorated with more direct information:</p><p>The use of &quot;afferent tactile stimulation&quot; could be defined at first use.</p><p>Sentences like this one (below) were hard to parse because the meaning of others' proposals or frameworks is implicit, which non-experts will not know:</p><p>&quot;Proposed functional roles for OT as selectively modulating affiliative social</p><p>relationships (34) or maintaining allostatic stability (25) accommodate such differential, context-dependent effects. Nonetheless, a marked gap remains to be bridged between stimulus-driven and context-sensitive frameworks in charting the neural mechanisms of OT effects on social behavior.&quot;</p><p>Similarly for:</p><p>&quot;…stimulus-driven model focused on afferent-subcortical signaling. However, as there is uncertainty surrounding the mechanisms of action of IN-OT and its degree of equivalence to endogenous release (47-50); but see…&quot;</p><p>Readers could use more text about the significance of arm versus palm, what was the hypothesis, and what happened.</p><p>I am enthusiastic about the inclusion of the partner/stranger conditions and their temporal effects, but more background on how this impacts existing theories and current studies is warranted. E.g., do some not think OT is context sensitive (or do but never showed it)? Dictator-like games with strangers seem to presume relationship doesn't matter (which could explain null effects as shown in recent meta-analyses). Has this effect been demonstrated in rodents but we need to show it in humans? I think some of this is in the text but embedded in citations that myself and others may not know.</p><p>The female-first strategy can be defined and called out as a strength, given the predominance of male-only studies, particularly for social bonding. People worry that females will be impacted by cycling hormones and the fact that you did not find this can again be referenced in the discussion to support your approach.</p><p>I think readers could use an earlier description of the whole process. E.g., when you start with the IV insertion description, it's not yet clear why they are getting an IV or what the general study design is (this could be at the end of the intro).</p><p>Can you add information about how a &quot;good&quot; stranger was selected? Were there criteria/attributes they had to pass? (e.g., not be particularly creepy or attractive from pilot data?)</p><p>It wasn't clear until later that the two sessions were during the same visit (many times they are days or weeks apart).</p><p>Perhaps say that the &quot;caressing strokes were delivered to the right dorsal arm OR the palm&quot; to make sure it's clear.</p><p>Can you clarify why/when in the participants' section there are different amounts of data/people per measure?</p><p>Can you state why sometimes only OT is measured and not cort? This could be where their respective typical time course is stated (which comes up later but you need to know during the methods).</p><p>Perhaps some of these things are rules of this journal but, e.g., usually, I see stats letters in italics with spaces around the = sign. The tabs on the headers seem strange, but again maybe it's for this journal.</p><p>It is difficult for people to unpack interactions, particularly because some involve many levels. It helps to always use directional terms. E.g.,</p><p>– At the end of page 10, it says that the post hoc tests revealed a &quot;difference&quot; without saying the direction (which is more).</p><p>– The hormone interaction results state at the end that there was an interaction between familiarity and order without the nature of the effect or whether it was hypothesized.</p><p>– Similar to the covariate data, when cort results are introduced, most of the paragraph describes the model, and only at the end do we hear about the main effects, but again without specifying the direction or meaning.</p><p>– It also says in the discussion that partner compared to stranger touch &quot;covaried&quot; with cortisol without specifying the direction and the Discussion section uses variations of this word in other places.

Perhaps the area names could be in a table with a more general description of the regions/types of processing and the related psychological phenomena (e.g., &quot;in sensory processing areas, when participants feel more/less trusting/pleasant (Table1)…&quot;).

The authors argue this might be relevant because oxytocin has been proposed to play a role in the signaling of a specific subtype of C afferent nerve (C-tactile), found in hair follicle-containing skin and implicated in affective touch. Yet in the fMRI models including the oxytocin covariate, the factor stimulation site (palm vs. arm) is not included.</p><p>Do the authors measure hormonal neuromodulation or neural modulation of hormonal levels? What I'm trying to say here is that multiple times instances of e.g. &quot;endogenous OT modulation of the brain&quot; are used. This seems to imply that plasma OT drives/modulates brain activity (whereas in the Discussion, the authors argue it is probably the other way around). I think other terms are more appropriate here to describe this covarying relationship with max plasma OT levels.</p><p>How were the 5 different time windows in the exploratory regression analyses linking earlier BOLD with plasma oxytocin levels selected? Were they chosen arbitrarily, or were they informed by any (experimentally-demonstrated or hypothetical) known time scales of the hormonal (central and peripheral) and neural mechanisms? Do you suspect this covariant pattern in certain subcortical brain areas is a result of central oxytocin binding to its receptors, or are other mechanisms at play? The resulting paragraph in the Discussion might benefit from some additional context.</p><p>Although a significant main effect of familiarity was encountered in several brain regions when taking peak plasma oxytocin levels into account, subsequent t-tests showed no activation differences in the BOLD response between partner and stranger touch within the same subjects. Significant interaction maps are thus mainly driven by between-subject effects at different time points. The wording when discussing these results should reflect this (e.g. &quot;Hypothalamus and Raphe nuclei showed BOLD increases during partner touch in the first run.&quot; → &quot;Hypothalamus and raphe nuclei showed higher BOLD activations in participants experiencing partner touch vs. participants experiencing stranger touch during the first run.&quot;).</p><p>Potential to stress the inclusion of female-only participants already in the title and/or abstract more explicitly.</p><p>Maintain consistency of time notation (e.g. p. 6: 1m; 3:30 min, 6:30m) and F-test degrees of freedom notation.</p><p>Letters used to indicate statistical symbols are always italicized.</p><p>Please also include the data acquisition parameters of the anatomical T1 volume adopted for co-registration.</p><p>&quot;Residual effects of head motion were corrected by including the estimated motion parameters (and their derivatives) as regressors of no interest&quot; (p. 8).

I had a few lingering comments I think could be addressed quickly:</p><p>More often the BOLD analyses, now that the directional information is explained, refer to negative relationships, or associations with the less-bonded condition (e.g., more or less for strangers/palms). This is not obvious to a casual reader.</p><p>E.g., 3-way interaction in SOG, AG, cuneus for OT decreasing with stranger and decreasing with partner touch (so not just down-regulating). Also greater for stranger in MFG, AG, and more for palm in pre-/post-central gyri. There is a familiarity by OT interaction in AG and MTG that seem like the same areas as those above, but for an opposing result (more for partner &gt; stranger). MTG also increased more with OT increase in stranger first. Also, Partner v Stranger first, dorsal raphe, and hypothalamus are both involved when OT increased for partner &gt; stranger first and decreased in stranger first (the same thematic result).</p><p>I assume this does not reflect the subjective response but the up/down regulation? Or bc temporal is so involved with parsing who/what it might increase BOLD to process distinctions about who/what is happening, which has to work harder in less natural situations. Because behavioral/hormonal results are so in line with expectations, and there are so many results, and the figures are labeled as &quot;interactions&quot; without stating the directional info, these finer distinctions will be lost on people</p><p>The discussion does say at the top of p19, &quot;noteworthy that the relationship…was an inverse one&quot;. Does &quot;more stable OT&quot; mean decreasing? or lower lows and higher highs? Was this pattern similar to the ones in the citations where the directional info is lacking? I think a little more detail in this section would help.</p><p>There are still places without directional terms, especially in the discussion. E.g., end of p 15, it says &quot;covaried with cortisol&quot;, end of p 18 &quot;mutual influences&quot;, &quot;affected by&quot;, &quot;Implicated in&quot;. 2nd to last para on 19 &quot;dorsal raphe nuclei also covaried with plasma OT&quot;, &quot;interactions between OT and familiarity&quot; in AG near the top of p 20. End of p23 &quot;changes&quot; &quot;influenced&quot; &quot;differential&quot;.</p><p>I get this explains the most general property if gain control produces both directions. But any time a specific result is referred to the direction should be there and then the generality at the beginning and end about how it can produce both decreases and increases will be more clear to people.</p><p>Miscellaneous:</p><p>Stats reporting has inconsistencies. I would italicize all stats letters and put spacing around = &gt;&lt; signs. If you prefer no spacing (I don't see journal formatting rules), then just make them consistent.</p><p>Random errors: E.g., Burbach JP (no initials), says less rather than fewer toward the end of the discussion somewhere, there's an unattached emdash at the beginning of the discussion, and extra space after Tang et al. cite.</p><p>I would prefer some NS stats for the linear mixed model with touch and core (e.g., ps &gt;.11).</p><p>I don't know if the journal has a max table/figure rule that caused these things below:</p><p>Are none of the tables in the main body of the paper? The paper lists them as 1, 2, 3, like they are regular in-text tables but they were all provided as supplements (so should say S2, S3, etc?). I would prefer as a reader to have at least a few key BOLD tables in the paper. The table text could be simplified if you just number the first column (since it already says cluster at the top) and organize by area first then strength to leave all rows blank that repeat the same area. You don't have to do this, of course, but if you put a table in the main text but do not want it to take a lot of room, it would be easy to put a few simplified ones in there. Also, the T is for the t-test? It doesn't clarify. If it is a small stats t some of them would be negative right? Maybe it just refers to the peak voxel, but then IDK what the value is.</p><p>The order of the figures presented in the text was confusing. 4B was never mentioned in the text? 2 and 4 are intermixed and not always in order. Can you split up the figures if needed so that only the parts relevant to the text in that place, in order, are present? There is an interesting amygdala graph in Figure 4B, but I didn't see it referred to in the text until the discussion.</p><p>Thanks again for a great, interesting paper that I think a lot of people will enjoy. Sorry if I seem pedantic. I just want it to be very accessible to the many people interested in touch, OT, cort, and the brain, so it can have the max reach.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.81197.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>An explanation of the choice to compare arm vs palm touch would be helpful – is there a known difference in how touch to these two body parts is perceived?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for raising this point. We have now clarified the reasoning and hypotheses surrounding the arm vs palm manipulation throughout different sections of the manuscript. In particular, in the Introduction we provided more explicit explanation about the proposed contribution of CT afferents in arm but not palm touch, and our hypothesis that the associated sensory cortices would not covary with plasma OT (page 5):</p><p>“Because both OT and CTs have been implicated in affective touch, it has been proposed that OT may be involved in CT-related neural mechanisms (<italic>5</italic>). Any such link would be supported if brain regions preferentially responding to touch on the CT-rich skin of the arm, compared to the CT-poor skin of the palm, showed specific OT-brain covariation. Alternatively, any cortex-OT modulation for social touch may be independent of any particular peripheral nerve type.”</p><p>Following similar comments from all three reviewers, we ran a new linear mixed effects analysis which modelled stimulation site (arm/palm) together with the other regressors, which we had not previously included because the planned analysis had centered on regions of interest defined by an arm vs palm main effect in a general linear model. The results of the new LME confirmed the previous post-hoc t-test results, that is, there was no effect of the OT covariate on BOLD anywhere in the brain, including regions associated with arm vs palm touch.</p><p>For the effects of the other included regressors, there were no substantial changes from the results of the previous model. The extent of the regions varied, but the results were essentially the same—ie, the variance accounted for by the presence of the arm-palm regressors did not affect the overall activation map for the other effects.</p><p>This new analysis is described in the methods (page 13):</p><p>“For each participant, whole-brain voxel-wise general linear models (GLM) were created for each of the two runs using 3dDeconvolve. One regressor (convolved with a standard model of the hemodynamic response function, HRF) modeled each of the conditions: partner arm, partner palm, stranger arm, stranger palm.”</p><p>The results are described in the results (page 17) and the image for the interaction between OT and familiarity in Figure 2 has also been updated with the activation map from the new LME.</p><p>We also expand on the interpretation of this result in the discussion (page 26):</p><p>“However, this experiment provided no supporting evidence for a putative relationship between OT and CT afferent nerve activity associated with affective touch. Primary somatosensory cortex showed selective activation for touch on the palm (Figure 3). Yet no OT-BOLD covariance was observed in arm-specific regions such as the posterior insula/PO (Figure 3), which might have indicated a link between stimulation of CT-rich skin and endogenous OT. In rodent models, oxytocin receptor (OXTR) expression has so far not been identified in dorsal horn neurons of the spinothalamic tract projecting to the specific thalamic pathways putatively shared by CT afferents (<italic>96- 98</italic>). On a subjective level, participants found palm touch from a stranger less pleasant during the initial encounter, potentially reflecting a functional difference in the palm’s prominent role in active sensorimotor exploration (Morrison, 2021) and perhaps potentiation of approach or withdrawal from others’ touch. Further research is therefore needed to explore any functional link between CT afferents and OT.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>This was an awesome study with a design that was not for the faint of heart. The ability to collect so many concurrent measures, with a study that required three specific people to be present each time, is difficult and rarely attempted. The authors are applauded for this effort.</p><p>I so appreciated the study, its results, and the implications for the field that I worry that people won't be able to discern its value readily enough, owing to the complexity.</p><p>Experts from this subfield field will already be able to appreciate the study as is, but social bonding and OT are of widespread interest and OT mechanisms are often oversimplified. Thus, I think it's worthwhile to make edits so that the paper can be widely appreciated. To increase the reach, I think the conceptual parts should be more emphasized (e.g.., state the few key hypotheses up front and how they reflect the state of knowledge in the field and dictated the design, what the results were, whether they support or do not support those hypotheses, and what it all means).</p></disp-quote><p>We than the Reviewer for this feedback. We have tried to address this comment by better foregrounding the main messages in several places in the manuscript. In particular, we have highlighted the hypotheses and relevant concepts in the Introduction and tried to improve the explanation of how they are tested in the study.</p><p>Namely, in the Introduction we have brought out the tension between approaches to neural OT mechanisms as being sensory-driven vs context sensitive. This is linked to our hypothesis that familiarity should have an effect (partner &gt; stranger), and possibly presentation order (pages 3,4):</p><p>“However, the modulatory relationship between OT and the brain is unlikely to be wholly stimulus-driven. It may also be sensitive to aspects of context. For example, the contextual factor of social familiarity plays an important role, with OT-related prosocial behavior frequently limited to familiar individuals (<italic>22-24</italic>). Current physiological state also influences endogenous OT responses (<italic>25,26</italic>). Endogenous OT can mediate prosocial allogrooming behavior in mice (<italic>27</italic>), but OT hormone and OT receptor genotype have also been shown to play roles in antagonistic social behaviors such as defense of offspring (<italic>28</italic>) and aggression (<italic>29,30</italic>). Further, optogenetic manipulation of the same PVN OT neurons in freely-behaving mice can result in either prosocial or antagonistic behavior (<italic>31</italic>). These observations suggest that OT’s role in social behavior is multivalent and situational (<italic>32-34</italic>). Nonetheless, a marked evidential gap remains to be bridged between stimulus-driven and context-sensitive frameworks in charting the neural mechanisms of OT effects on social behavior in humans.</p><p>Despite existing indications of context-sensitivity, OT-brain modulation has been little explored for human endogenous OT responses, and how these may be selectively modulated by specific contextual conditions.”</p><p>We predicted that touch from a socially familiar person (a romantic partner) would evoke greater endogenous OT changes than touch from an unfamiliar person (a nonthreatening stranger), allowing investigation of the neural responses associated with any such modulation. On the neural level, we expected engagement of hypothalamus and other key regions associated with evolutionarily-conserved circuitry of OT modulation and receptor expression in different species (such as amygdala, medial prefrontal cortex, and cingulate cortex).</p><p>We have also tried to emphasize the tension between OT’s role in maintaining stability while also being adaptable to change under certain conditions, which is related to differential responses to partner and stranger, and a predicted interaction between mean cortisol and OT (page 5):</p><p>“Beyond these basic questions regarding touch, familiarity, and recent social interaction history, we also investigated any relationship of brain-hormone modulation to stress responses by testing for covariation between OT and peripheral cortisol changes, which can be evoked during a mild, acute stress challenge such as interacting with a socially unfamiliar individual within the novel environment of an fMRI experiment. We predicted lower plasma cortisol levels for the partner compared to the stranger, and an inverse relationship between OT and cortisol measures, during social touch interactions.”</p><p>We returned to this in the revised Discussion (pages 22 and 26):</p><p>“A single social interaction with a familiar partner is just one instance of many over the course of the relationship. On the other hand, today’s familiar friend was yesterday’s stranger: an interaction with a person one has never met can lay the groundwork for future interactions. Neural and hormonal changes elicited during successive social interactions must therefore not only be able to maintain stability with respect to established social relationships <italic>25</italic>—such as with a romantic partner—but must also be adaptable in the face of new or less certain relationships, such as meeting a new individual. The present findings shed light on the participation of OT in brain-OT covariation during social encounters with both familiar and unfamiliar individuals. They imply that OT and the brain can flexibly coordinate and calibrate responses depending on whom an individual is currently socially interacting with, and with whom the individual has recently interacted.</p><p>In everyday life, we humans must navigate a complex and ever-changing social terrain, with some stable elements (for example, established relationships) and other less-stable ones (new or uncertain relationships). This presents a challenge for maintaining stability of existing social bonds on the one hand, yet also establishing and calibrating newer social relationships on the other hand. These findings suggest a role for OT-brain covariation in such adaptive responses. A positive social interaction context (such as a pleasant touch interaction with one’s partner) may selectively bias the system towards a certain neurohormonal response profile, whereas a less certain or less positive social context (such as an unusual interaction with a stranger) may bias it towards a different profile. For example, this could mean that starting the day with a positive social interaction can set up a virtuous circle that perpetuates itself through the day’s social interactions; whereas an uncertain or negative interaction could bias one’s responses towards remaining dampened. Such differential outcomes may potentially influence neural processing and behavior in longer-term social interactions. An important avenue for future research will be to investigate the behavioral effects of these neural and physiological differences, especially with respect to social relationships over time.”</p><p>We hope the hypotheses and reasoning around the arm-palm factor are clearer now (see also response to Reviewer 1’s comment).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It's easier for people to follow results when the nature/meaning of the effect is the focus and stats come after or in a table E.g., instead of &quot;there was a three-way interaction of X, Y, and Z,&quot; you could say, As predicted, OT levels were sensitive to the context of the interaction, as levels were higher/lower for X partner than Z partner but only when X happened….(demonstrated in the 2x2 interaction STATS, and the main effects of partner STATS, and time STATS--or put those in a table).</p></disp-quote><p>We have made changes to phrasing and presentation throughout the Results section, especially in the Discussion, to make it easier for a general reader to parse.</p><p>For example, in the Results we now report some main effects and interactions like this (pages 14, 15, 16, 18):</p><p>“Partner touch was rated as more pleasant than stranger touch (<italic>F</italic><sub>1, 33</sub>=30.032, <italic>p</italic>&lt; 0.001) with a main effect of higher ratings for arm (<italic>F</italic><sub>1, 33</sub>=11.070, <italic>p</italic>=0.002, effect size <italic>f</italic> = 0.7, <italic>partial η2</italic> = 0.33 at power (1-β error probability) = 0.8, <italic>α</italic>=0.05). Participants who received stranger touch first had lower ratings for stranger touch on the palm compared to stranger touch on the arm (<italic>t</italic>=16, <italic>p</italic>=0.007, <italic>d</italic>=1.99), reflected in a significant three-way interaction, indicating influences of both familiarity and order on touch pleasantness ratings for palm (<italic>F</italic><sub>1, 33</sub>=4.730, <italic>p</italic>=0.037).”</p><p>“As predicted, OT levels increased when the partner was the interactant in the first encounter. In addition, when stranger touch was preceded by partner touch OT levels showed a significant dip and recovery during the second touch session. These results were revealed by a three-way interaction between the factors familiarity, order and sample timepoint (<italic>F</italic><sub>(3, 183.180)</sub> = 3.034, <italic>p</italic>=0.031).”</p><p>“Cortisol showed higher overall levels than OT (a main effect of hormone, <italic>F</italic><sub>1, 180.593</sub>=68.574, <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.001; OT mean± SEM: partner first: 67.781±6.019, stranger first: 42.959±1.816, p=0.017; cortisol mean± SEM: partner first: 80.346±5.486, stranger first: 101.633±6.306, p=0.040). In addition, OT levels were higher but cortisol levels lower in the partner first condition as compared to stranger first (<italic>F</italic><sub>1,180.593</sub>=28,751, <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.001). This was revealed by a statistical interaction indicating a mutual influence between familiarity and order (<italic>F</italic><sub>1, 178.355</sub>=10.565, <italic>p</italic>=0.001; also found in the two previous individual models).”</p><p>“BOLD was greater for stranger than partner (a main effect of familiarity) in bilateral middle frontal gyrus (MFG) and right AG, among other regions. BOLD was greater for palm than arm (a main effect of stimulation site) in left postcentral gyrus (PoCG) and bilateral precentral gyrus (PrCG).”</p><p>“In parietotemporal clusters, the higher an individual’s BOLD, the higher her OT levels when receiving partner touch in the second run, as compared to those receiving stranger touch in the second run (in whom this OT-BOLD covariation was less positive). These parietotemporal clusters were also seen in the interaction maps in which OT interacted with familiarity (right AG, right TP; Figure 2) and order (right MTG). Additional clusters were revealed in right superior temporal gyrus (STG), among other activations.”</p><p>In the Discussion we have revised the text to lead with the interpretation of the statistical effects, for example (pages 22, 24, 25):</p><p>“The most general finding was that touch-mediated social interactions in human females elicited endogenous OT and brain responses in a covariant manner. Beyond this, OT and neural changes were modulated by the familiarity of the person delivering touch, as well as the recent history of social interaction. The effect of these contextual factors on within-subject endogenous OT changes manifested in a mutual influence between the familiarity of the social interactant (partner or stranger) and the order of his presentation over two immediately successive social interactions (partner then stranger, or stranger then partner). This influence was driven by a greater increase in plasma OT responses for the stranger following partner touch, whereas there was no corresponding increase for partner touch following stranger touch (Figure 2A).”</p><p>“When the stranger touched first, BOLD in both hypothalamus and dorsal raphe was greater the lower mean OT was across individuals (Figure 3D), again suggestive of dynamic co-modulation.”</p><p>“Here, mean plasma cortisol levels were higher for stranger than for partner during the first encounter (Figure 3A) and decreased as mean OT levels increased, indicating an inverse relationship between OT and cortisol in peripheral circulation during this experiment.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Here are some places where I noted confusion that could be ameliorated with more direct information:</p><p>The use of &quot;afferent tactile stimulation&quot; could be defined at first use.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now changed this.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Sentences like this one (below) were hard to parse because the meaning of others' proposals or frameworks is implicit, which non-experts will not know:</p><p>&quot;Proposed functional roles for OT as selectively modulating affiliative social</p><p>relationships (34) or maintaining allostatic stability (25) accommodate such differential, context-dependent effects.

We regard one of the interesting advances of these results to be their indication that relationship does matter, implying that specific OT-related effects in humans may elude capture unless factors like familiarity, social relationship, current context, etc, are taken into account. To our knowledge no one has directly demonstrated this so far for human endogenous OT, though it has been proposed based on less direct data (eg Quintana et al. 2021, Bartz et al. 2011), for example familiarity effects in rodents. One recent rodent study used optogenetic stimulation of OT-expressing neurons in PVN to demonstrate that mice can exhibit either prosocial or antagonistic behavior depending on the situation (Yu et al., 2022).</p><p>We have added this text in the Discussion (page 25):</p><p>“Taken together, these selective hormone-brain changes support the view that endogenous OT’s role in human social interaction is heavily modulated by contextual factors (<italic>26</italic>), and provides further evidence that this role can involve modulation in a positive or a negative direction, depending on the situation (<italic>28-30</italic>). For example, in prairie voles, higher levels of endogenous OT can mediate prosocial grooming of stressed others (<italic>24</italic>), but optogenetic manipulation of the same PVN OT neurons in freely-behaving mice can result in either prosocial or antagonistic behavior (<italic>28</italic>). OT and OT receptor genotype have also been shown to play a role in antagonistic social behaviors such as defense of offspring in rats (<italic>25</italic>) and aggression in rodents and humans (<italic>26,27</italic>).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The female-first strategy can be defined and called out as a strength, given the predominance of male-only studies, particularly for social bonding.

In contrast, the present study used a “female-first” strategy which moves to redress this imbalance (6); likewise recent research in rats has focused on OT-touch mechanisms in female samples (<italic>1, 14</italic>). Here we found no effect of cycle phase on evoked OT changes. An important question for future research is whether, and to what extent, these results in human females generalize to males, especially with regard to any familiarity-dependent bias in endogenous OT. Another potential sex difference may lie in the relationships between OT, cortisol, and their covariation in mPFC.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>I think readers could use an earlier description of the whole process.

Reviewer 3 also raised a related point about directionality. We have therefore also tried to clarify that we assumed a central-to-peripheral direction of influence in creating this regressor. However, we believe that the full causal picture is likely to involve a modulatory loop (or even loops) in which peripheral and central changes influence one another.</p><p>Results (page 19):</p><p>“We assumed that any central-to-peripheral effects of OT release would be detectable retrospectively by modeling the plasma OT sample points “backwards”, in order to search for any BOLD activity which both preceded and tracked the observed pattern of OT changes. Points between the multiple samples were linearly interpolated and the resulting function was convolved with the canonical hemodynamic response function (HRF). N=23 participants had complete data series for both functional runs (Table XX). For this “backward-looking” regressor, we explored time lags of 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5 and 3 min to capture potential touch-evoked central modulation corresponding to the peripheral changes in plasma OT observed after these various delays, assuming that central activity preceded peripheral OT changes.”</p><p>Discussion (page 24):</p><p>“Central effects of IN-OT have consistently been found ~45 min post-administration (<italic>75-77</italic>), but there is less direct evidence about the timecourse of central endogenous OT release into the periphery in humans. We therefore developed an exploratory regressor based on the serial pattern of individuals’ OT levels. Assuming a mechanism in which plasma OT changes were affected by central release in the brain and thus came after it in time, this regressor allowed us to look “backwards” from the temporal pattern of the plasma OT sample series to any preceding hemodynamic activation that tracked with this pattern. The pattern-covariant engagement of the precuneus at 2.5 minutes preceding sampling, and of precuneus, retrosplenial cortex, and mPFC at 2 minutes, is within the frame of the half-life of OT in blood (<italic>78</italic>) and may reflect events surrounding central OT release (<italic>15</italic>). Although the present results lack sufficient temporal and causal resolution to address this, it is possible that any descending OT influence from the brain to the periphery instates a “reafferent loop” in which central-to-peripheral changes can, in turn, influence incoming sensory information, perhaps at the level of spinal and/or brainstem mechanisms.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>What would you say is the conceptual meaning of areas that are conjunctions?</p></disp-quote><p>The conjunctions reflect regions that are engaged by the touch manipulation across conditions, regardless of familiarity, order, hormone levels, or stimulation site. The activation pattern is consistent with somatosensory stimulation, and we infer that it is relatively robust to the more context-dependent variables in the paradigm. The presence of these “general” touch activations also complements the lack of covariation with OT levels here. We interpret this as further supporting the idea that these context-dependent variables do not directly affect processing in somatosensory cortices or the other regions in the conjunction.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>You could bring in real-world relevant issues to this in the discussion such as social anxiety, making friends from strangers, needing human touch from those we love in order to be more receptive to the rest of the world, etc.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this good suggestion. We have added some text to the “limitations and future directions” section of the discussion (pages 27-28) speculating that touch/interaction with a loved one might make one more receptive, or at least help to buffer one against any negative/uncertain circumstances in the short term:</p><p>“In everyday life, we humans must navigate a complex and ever-changing social terrain, with some stable elements (for example, established relationships) and other less-stable ones (new or uncertain relationships). This presents a challenge for maintaining stability of existing social bonds on the one hand, yet also establishing and calibrating newer social relationships on the other hand. These findings suggest a role for OT-brain covariation in such adaptive responses. A positive social interaction context (such as a pleasant touch interaction with one’s partner) may selectively bias the system towards a certain short-term neurohormonal response profile, whereas a less certain or less positive social context (such as an unusual interaction with a stranger) may bias it towards a different profile. For example, this could mean that starting the day with a positive social interaction can set up a virtuous circle that perpetuates itself through the day’s social interactions; whereas an uncertain or negative interaction could bias one’s responses towards remaining dampened. Such differential outcomes may potentially influence neural processing and behavior in longer-term social interactions. An important avenue for future research will be to investigate the behavioral effects of these neural and physiological differences, especially with respect to social relationships over time.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Can you state what you think the meaning of the OT stranger second dip is? Like you are receptive to a stranger initially, but then the actual first moments are still difficult with a stranger but you get used to it quicker?</p></disp-quote><p>The dip might reflect an initial destabilization (decrease from baseline) with the onset of the stranger, but which recovers to above-baseline levels over time. The observation that this happened for stranger only when preceded by partner may be attributed to a gain-setting effect of context.</p><p>We have added more detail of this interpretation in the results (page 15):</p><p>“As predicted, OT levels increased when the partner was the interactant in the first encounter. In addition, when stranger touch was preceded by partner touch OT levels showed a significant dip and recovery during the second touch session. These results were revealed by a three-way interaction between the factors familiarity, order and sample timepoint (<italic>F</italic><sub>(3, 183.180)</sub> = 3.034, <italic>p</italic>=0.031). A significant increase between the first and middle samples in the functional run during stranger touch in the partner first group only (<italic>p</italic>=0.027) drove the contribution of timepoint to the three-way interaction.”</p><p>and Discussion (page 23):</p><p>“Social familiarity and presentation order also influenced the timecourse of the eight plasma samples collected during the experimental session, with this influence driven by OT responses to stranger touch following partner touch. The OT increase for stranger touch in this condition did not show a stable rise, but rather dipped to below-baseline levels across participants before recovering to above-baseline levels by the end of the social encounter. A tentative interpretation for this pattern is that the initial partner encounter may have introduced a bias for OT increase during the subsequent stranger encounter, though not as a sustained carryover from the preceding partner interaction. In contrast, plasma OT remained at baseline levels when the experimental session began with an encounter with an unfamiliar stranger. The recovery of OT in the stranger-second condition could thus reflect a facilitation of underlying endogenous release mechanisms following the prior partner interaction. Overall, these endogenous OT changes may reflect mechanisms that selectively bias the way social stimuli are processed in the central nervous system during social interactions, with high dependence on contextual information.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The brain results are hard to digest because there are so many levels of effects, interactions, and lists of areas.

Touch-mediated social interactions evoked changes in endogenous OT, indicating the importance of the stimulus. Yet these responses were nevertheless influenced by specific features of social context, with plasma of OT levels showing differential responses depending on the familiarity of the interacting person and the recent history of interaction. Such adaptive responses could reflect a gain-control-like role for OT-brain neuromodulation, comparable to a dimmer switch, which can effectively preserve stability with respect to established social relationships while also allowing for change in new ones (possibly via increases or decreases in inhibitory influence). Across successive social encounters, such modulatory mechanisms may calibrate neural and behavioral receptivity, whether mediated by touch or another channel such as vision or speech. Network hubs in parietotemporal pathways, alongside precuneus and retrosplenial cortex, may be key for turning the “dimmer” of OT-brain processing up or down depending on past and current social context.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>I think this is a fantastic study that can provide us with key information about a topic that is central to people's interests in social-cognitive neuroscience.

The authors argue this might be relevant because oxytocin has been proposed to play a role in the signaling of a specific subtype of C afferent nerve (C-tactile), found in hair follicle-containing skin and implicated in affective touch. Yet in the fMRI models including the oxytocin covariate, the factor stimulation site (palm vs. arm) is not included.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for raising this important point. We had originally planned the arm-palm manipulation as a way of defining ROIs to check for OT covariance in posterior insula/parietal operculum (arm) and primary somatosensory cortices (palm). But we very much agree that including this factor in the full model is preferable, so we have re-run a linear mixed effects model accordingly (see also response to Reviewer 1’s comment). We replaced the previous linear mixed model (LME) Order *Familiarity with OT covariate and the GLM Familiarity* Site with a bigger LME model Order *Familiarity* Site with OT covariate. In this way we could test the covariation between the Site of stimulation and OT changes and the interaction with the other experimental factors (Order and Familiarity).</p><p>No covariance with OT was seen, consistent with the previous inference based on the absence of arm/palm regions in t-tests. The whole-brain results were not substantially different from those of the previous model. The methods, results, tables, and Figure 2 have been updated to reflect the new LME.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Do the authors measure hormonal neuromodulation or neural modulation of hormonal levels? What I'm trying to say here is that multiple times instances of e.g. &quot;endogenous OT modulation of the brain&quot; are used. This seems to imply that plasma OT drives/modulates brain activity (whereas in the Discussion, the authors argue it is probably the other way around). I think other terms are more appropriate here to describe this covarying relationship with max plasma OT levels.</p></disp-quote><p>This is a great point, and we agree.

Were they chosen arbitrarily, or were they informed by any (experimentally-demonstrated or hypothetical) known time scales of the hormonal (central and peripheral) and neural mechanisms? Do you suspect this covariant pattern in certain subcortical brain areas is a result of central oxytocin binding to its receptors, or are other mechanisms at play? The resulting paragraph in the Discussion might benefit from some additional context.</p></disp-quote><p>The temporal OT regressor was not based on any specific experimentally-demonstrated time scales of OT release in any organism. The time lags were selected with the aim of exploring the most possible time lags allowed by the number of sample points within the total time window of 5.5 minutes (the first sample in the run was collected and the last at 6.5 minutes). Thus the lags were selected partly arbitrarily and partly with an eye to the total timeframe of the 7-min functional runs. We thought that including these 5 lags was a good compromise between the exploratory nature of the analysis and the reliability of the methodological approach. In a general sense, the creation of the regressor as “backward-looking” was informed by evidence from animal models for central-to-peripheral effects from hypothalamus to pituitary to bloodstream. We assumed this directionality in the analysis. The text in methods, results, and the discussion has been revised to make this assumption explicit as such.</p><p>See also the reply to a related comment from Reviewer 2.</p><p>We did not interpret the BOLD in terms of any specific cell-level mechanisms such as receptor binding, but we would speculate that these may be involved, whether directly or indirectly. We think it is very likely that the BOLD reflects some degree of mediated effect between underlying cellular mechanisms and larger-scale network activity (and possibly even peripheral feedback). Unfortunately, these issues can’t be addressed with this dataset, but the results do suggest avenues for stronger tests in the future. For example, since resting-state evidence of precuneus and retrosplenial engagement comes from IN-OT administration studies, manipulations combining contextual factors, endogenous OT, and exogenous OT might be fruitful.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Although a significant main effect of familiarity was encountered in several brain regions when taking peak plasma oxytocin levels into account, subsequent t-tests showed no activation differences in the BOLD response between partner and stranger touch within the same subjects. Significant interaction maps are thus mainly driven by between-subject effects at different time points. The wording when discussing these results should reflect this (e.g. &quot;Hypothalamus and Raphe nuclei showed BOLD increases during partner touch in the first run.&quot; → &quot;Hypothalamus and raphe nuclei showed higher BOLD activations in participants experiencing partner touch vs. participants experiencing stranger touch during the first run.&quot;).</p></disp-quote><p>We are grateful to the Reviewer for making us aware of the lack of clarity here.

Please submit a revised manuscript that addresses these issues, and we will be able to move forward with publication without another round of peer review.</p><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>I read the revised version of this manuscript.</p><p>The paper is clearer; I appreciate the efforts.</p><p>The introduction in particular was easier for a non-expert to follow and many results are now described in directional terms, which helped my interpretation. I had a few lingering comments I think could be addressed quickly:</p><p>More often the BOLD analyses, now that the directional information is explained, refer to negative relationships, or associations with the less-bonded condition (e.g., more or less for strangers/palms). This is not obvious to a casual reader.</p><p>E.g., 3-way interaction in SOG, AG, cuneus for OT decreasing with stranger and decreasing with partner touch (so not just down-regulating). Also greater for stranger in MFG, AG, and more for palm in pre-/post-central gyri. There is a familiarity by OT interaction in AG and MTG that seem like the same areas as those above, but for an opposing result (more for partner &gt; stranger). MTG also increased more with OT increase in stranger first. Also, Partner v Stranger first, dorsal raphe, and hypothalamus are both involved when OT increased for partner &gt; stranger first and decreased in stranger first (the same thematic result).</p><p>I assume this does not reflect the subjective response but the up/down regulation? Or bc temporal is so involved with parsing who/what it might increase BOLD to process distinctions about who/what is happening, which has to work harder in less natural situations. Because behavioral/hormonal results are so in line with expectations, and there are so many results, and the figures are labeled as &quot;interactions&quot; without stating the directional info, these finer distinctions will be lost on people</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you very much for your very useful suggestions for improving the manuscript!</p><p>We have gone through the manuscript and added direction-of-effect information wherever possible. The most major additions or amendments we have made to the text are:</p><p>Results p 10.</p><p>“These interactions are explained by a more negative relationship between BOLD and OT change in the stranger first group, which reflects greater relative BOLD increases in individuals showing smaller percent change in OT levels. Specifically, whereas BOLD increase in SOG/cuneus showed a positive relationship in the partner first group (partner first, stranger second), these relationships were negative in the stranger first group, particularly for stranger. BOLD increase in AG showed positive or flat relationships with OT change in all conditions except for partner second in the stranger first group, which was negative (the higher the BOLD, the lower the OT change).”</p><p>…and</p><p>“For all these areas, individuals showing greater OT increase during the functional run were also more likely to show higher BOLD during partner compared to stranger touch, reflecting a more positive relationship between BOLD signal and OT change for partner (the higher the BOLD, the greater the degree of OT change). A right hemisphere cluster encompassing inferior and middle temporal gyri (ITG and MTG) also showed a main effect of OT covariate (a positive relationship between BOLD and OT change; Table 1) as well as an interaction between order and OT (Table 1; see also Figure 4A), reflecting a more positive relationship between BOLD signal and degree of OT increase in the stranger first group.</p><p>Regardless of the degree of OT change, BOLD was overall greater for stranger than partner (a main effect of familiarity) in bilateral middle frontal gyrus (MFG) and right AG, among other regions (Table 1), reflecting generally higher means but narrower range of variability for stranger than partner. BOLD was greater for palm than arm (a main effect of stimulation site; Table 1) in left postcentral gyrus (PoCG) and bilateral precentral gyrus (PrCG). No statistical interactions were observed between site of stimulation and OT covariate.”</p><p>…and</p><p>Results p 17</p><p>“Partner first vs. stranger second: For participants who had partner touch first, partner compared to stranger touch covaried with cortisol in the left ACC, right SMG, bilateral ventromedial prefrontal cortex, bilateral calcarine gyrus, right lingual gyrus, left TP and left PO (all at <italic>p</italic> = 0.002). These regions showed a more negative relationship between BOLD and cortisol for partner (individuals with higher BOLD had higher cortisol).”</p><p>We have also added direction information to the figure captions.</p><p>In the discussion, we expanded and elaborated on the discussion of the direction of effects in parietotemporal regions (p 22):</p><p>“Co-modulation between OT changes and BOLD in parietotemporal pathways may reflect updating of contextual information, possibly enhancing the salience of incoming sensory signals (Johnson et al., 2017; Shamay-Tsoory &amp; Abu-Akel, 2016; Sripada et al., 2013) or of personally-relevant stimuli (Alaerts et al., 2021) following the initial encounter. […] This may reflect an enlistment of parietotemporal regions in gain control mechanisms (Grinevich &amp; Ludwig, 2021)—more akin to a dimmer switch than an on-off button— with the “dimmer” tuning from a wider, more flexible response range under higher contextual certainty (partner first) to a narrower, less flexible range under lower contextual certainty (stranger first).”</p><p>…and</p><p>Discussion p 22</p><p>“In the present study, BOLD changes in dorsal Raphe nuclei also covaried with plasma OT (Figure 2D). Specifically, when the stranger touched first, BOLD in both hypothalamus and dorsal Raphe was greater the lower the mean OT across individuals (Figures1, 3), whereas no such modulation of OT-BOLD covariance was observed for partner. This may reflect descending modulatory influence on afferent touch signals from the periphery, manifesting here as a negative relationship between BOLD and OT during stranger touch (the BOLD signal cannot distinguish hemodynamic activity resulting from excitation or inhibition).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The discussion does say at the top of p19, &quot;noteworthy that the relationship…was an inverse one&quot;. Does &quot;more stable OT&quot; mean decreasing? or lower lows and higher highs?</p></disp-quote><p>We wonder the same thing, and have speculative ideas which we have now added to the Future Directions section of the discussion (page 27):</p><p>“Most human studies manipulating OT (usually via nasal administration) have been performed in male populations. In contrast, the present study used a “female-first” strategy which moves to redress this imbalance (<italic>55</italic>); likewise recent research in rodents has focused on OT-touch mechanisms in female samples (<italic>1, 28</italic>).

Another potential sex difference may lie in the relationships between OT, cortisol, and their covariation in mPFC.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Was this pattern similar to the ones in the citations where the directional info is lacking? I think a little more detail in this section would help.</p></disp-quote><p>It's difficult to compare directional influences across these studies since the manipulations were so different among them, but in general they seem to point to some degree of situational dependence of OT-related activity or behavior (and mostly more negative than positive modulation). We interpret this though the lens of OT’s likely role in attachment and nurturance of young, in which caregiving and defense can be two sides of the same coin, even though they might motivate behaviors that seem opposite (eg, nuturance vs defensive aggression).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>There are still places without directional terms, especially in the discussion. E.g., end of p 15, it says &quot;covaried with cortisol&quot;, end of p 18 &quot;mutual influences&quot;, &quot;affected by&quot;, &quot;Implicated in&quot;. 2nd to last para on 19 &quot;dorsal raphe nuclei also covaried with plasma OT&quot;, &quot;interactions between OT and familiarity&quot; in AG near the top of p 20. End of p23 &quot;changes&quot; &quot;influenced&quot; &quot;differential&quot;.</p><p>I get this explains the most general property if gain control produces both directions. But any time a specific result is referred to the direction should be there and then the generality at the beginning and end about how it can produce both decreases and increases will be more clear to people.</p><p>Miscellaneous:</p><p>Stats reporting has inconsistencies. I would italicize all stats letters and put spacing around = &gt;&lt; signs. If you prefer no spacing (I don't see journal formatting rules), then just make them consistent.</p><p>Random errors: E.g., Burbach JP (no initials), says less rather than fewer toward the end of the discussion somewhere, there's an unattached emdash at the beginning of the discussion, and extra space after Tang et al. cite.</p><p>I would prefer some NS stats for the linear mixed model with touch and core (e.g., ps &gt;.11).</p><p>I don't know if the journal has a max table/figure rule that caused these things below:</p><p>Are none of the tables in the main body of the paper? The paper lists them as 1, 2, 3, like they are regular in-text tables but they were all provided as supplements (so should say S2, S3, etc?). I would prefer as a reader to have at least a few key BOLD tables in the paper. The table text could be simplified if you just number the first column (since it already says cluster at the top) and organize by area first then strength to leave all rows blank that repeat the same area. You don't have to do this, of course, but if you put a table in the main text but do not want it to take a lot of room, it would be easy to put a few simplified ones in there. Also, the T is for the t-test? It doesn't clarify. If it is a small stats t some of them would be negative right? Maybe it just refers to the peak voxel, but then IDK what the value is.</p><p>The order of the figures presented in the text was confusing. 4B was never mentioned in the text? 2 and 4 are intermixed and not always in order. Can you split up the figures if needed so that only the parts relevant to the text in that place, in order, are present? There is an interesting amygdala graph in Figure 4B, but I didn't see it referred to in the text until the discussion.</p></disp-quote><p>We added text to point to this. Figure 4 panels were rearranged and this is now 4D.</p><p>p 19</p><p>“While BOLD signal change in left amygdala was high across conditions, it was also sensitive to partner-stranger differences (main effect of familiarity, <italic>F</italic> <sub>(1,16)</sub> = 5.8, <italic>p</italic> = 0.02), greater for the stranger in the first encounter.”</p><p>p 24</p><p>“…with left amygdala selective for stranger touch, particularly in the first encounter (Figure 4D).”</p><p>We have also gone through and made the italicization/spacing around stats signs consistent, and corrected the inclusion of author initials in the in-text ref citations, as well as the other errors you kindly brought to our attention.</p></body></sub-article></article>
