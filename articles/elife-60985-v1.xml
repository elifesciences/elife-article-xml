jawbone of <italic>Lophosteus superbus</italic> (Late Silurian, 422 Million years old), the phylogenetically most basal stem osteichthyan, visualized by synchrotron microtomography, reveals a developmental relationship between teeth and dermal odontodes that is not evident from the adult morphology. The earliest odontodes are two longitudinal founder ridges formed at the ossification center. Subsequent odontodes that are added lingually to the ridges turn into conical teeth and undergo cyclic replacement, while those added labially achieve a stellate appearance. Stellate odontodes deposited directly on the bony plate are aligned with the alternate files of teeth, whereas new tooth positions are inserted into the files of sequential addition when a gap appears. Successive teeth and overgrowing odontodes show hybrid morphologies around the oral-dermal boundary, suggesting signal cross-communication. We propose that teeth and dermal odontodes are modifications of a single system, regulated and differentiated by the oral and dermal epithelia.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Human teeth are an example of odontodes: hard structures made of a material called dentine that are sometimes coated in enamel. Teeth are the only odontodes humans have, but other vertebrates (animals with backbones) have tooth-like scales on their skin. These structures are called dermal odontodes, and sharks and rays, for example, are covered with them.</p><p>How these structures evolved, and whether teeth or dermal odontodes developed first, continues to spark great discussion among palaeontologists. Some researchers think that teeth evolved from dermal odontodes, a theory known as the ‘scales-to-teeth’ hypothesis. Others think dermal odontodes are distinct from teeth because they lack the same spatial organization. To investigate this further, palaeontologists are looking at the earliest examples of odontodes they can find: fossils of early vertebrates that carry both teeth and dermal odontodes.</p><p>Here, Chen et al. have studied <italic>Lophosteus</italic>, one of the earliest bony fishes that lived more than 400 million years ago, to explore early tooth evolution and growth patterns. Chen et al. digitally dissected a fossilized <italic>Lophosteus</italic> jawbone using submicron X-ray imaging, a technique with resolution to less than one millionth of a metre. Imaging thin sections of the specimen, found in Estonia, Chen et al. reconstructed the entire sequence of odontode development in the bony fish in 3D.</p><p>The analysis showed that teeth and dermal odontodes initially take shape together but differentiate as they grow, presumably instructed to do so by various developmental signals. However, at a later stage, the two types of odontodes become similar in appearance again, suggesting that they respond to each other’s signals. For example, as the jawbone grows, dermal odontodes overgrow the earliest formed teeth. These younger odontodes resemble teeth, while the new teeth developing near the dermal odontodes take after dermal odontodes.</p><p>These findings suggest that teeth and dermal odontodes are not wholly separate systems but, instead, are closely related on a molecular level. The results also show that contrary to the ‘scale-to-teeth’ hypothesis, teeth do not evolve from fully formed dermal odontodes, rather the two types of odontodes form out of one founder.</p><p>This research builds on our knowledge from modern sharks and points to a previously unrecognised evolutionary relationship between teeth and dermal odontodes. It also furthers our understanding of how molecular regulation controls development.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>dental ontogeny</kwd><kwd>bony fish</kwd><kwd>Silurian</kwd><kwd>odontode</kwd><kwd>origin of teeth</kwd><kwd>synchrotron</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004063</institution-id><institution>Knut och Alice Wallenbergs Stiftelse</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Wallenberg Scholarship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ahlberg</surname><given-names>Per E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Teeth and dermal odontodes diverge from the same set of founder odontodes, demonstrating they are modified subsets of the same system, and both oral and dermal epithelial have patterning capacity.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>A tooth is a particular type of ‘odontode’ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>): an exoskeletal structure that forms at an interface between an epithelial fold and the underlying mesenchyme, by dentine growing inwards from the epithelial contact surface. A mature odontode consists of dentine, in some cases covered with enamel or other hypermineralized surface tissue, irrigated through a central pulp cavity or pulp canals, and attached by a vascularized bone-like tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Ørvig, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Smith and Hall, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Huysseune and Sire, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Karatajute‐Talimaa, 1998</xref>). Although teeth are the only odontodes to persist in tetrapods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Reif, 1982</xref>), various forms of dermal odontodes covered the entire body surface of many extinct jawless vertebrates, before jaws and teeth evolved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Janvier, 1996</xref>), and persist in some extant groups. Probably, the most familiar examples of dermal odontodes in extant vertebrates are the placoid scales of sharks, which are commonly called ‘skin teeth’. Besides this form of individual pointed denticles, multiple dermal odontodes can be fused to a basal plate, like in the growing scales of primitive chondrichthyans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Reif, 1978b</xref>), or anchored on a dermal bone, like on the skull bones of primitive osteichthyans, where the odontodes are usually accreted into patterned tubercles or ridges, referred to as ‘ornament’. Dermal odontodes have long been regarded as an independent developmental module distinct from teeth, because of their supposed lack of the temporo-spatial regulation that, in teeth, is provided by a specific epithelial structure such as a dental lamina or odontogenic band (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Reif, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fraser and Smith, 2011</xref>). However, shark placoid scales were recently shown to be patterned by a Turing-like mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Maisey and Denton, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cooper et al., 2018</xref>). Nevertheless, current knowledge about the growth patterns of dermal odontodes is basically limited to modern sharks.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Odontode development and gnathostome phylogeny.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic representation of developing (left) and mature (right) odontode. The odontode shown here lacks enamel, as do the teeth and dermal odontodes of <italic>Lophosteus</italic>.

The classic ‘outside-in’ hypothesis is currently in favor after decades of debate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Donoghue and Rücklin, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Haridy et al., 2019</xref>), but the developmental continuum between teeth and dermal odontodes, which is one of its central premises, still lacks unequivocal evidence. Extant gnathostomes with dermal odontodes (sharks, rays, and some bony fishes such as <italic>Polypterus</italic>) always display a sharp demarcation between teeth and ornament. Even though they can provide data of all ontogenetic stages, they are not informative about the evolution of the developmental relationship between teeth and dermal odontodes. For that we must turn to the fossil record of the earliest jawed vertebrates, in particular to the jawed stem gnathostomes and the stem osteichthyans, which form the common ancestral stock of Chondrichthyes + Osteichthyes and of Actinopterygii + Sarcopterygii, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>).</p><p>This study presents the marginal dentition of the Late Silurian (422 million years old; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://stratigraphy.org/timescale/">https://stratigraphy.org/timescale/</ext-link>) stem osteichthyan <italic>Lophosteus superbus</italic>, based on investigation by propagation phase-contrast synchrotron microtomography (PPC-SRμCT), which allows the dentition to be digitally dissected in 3D with sub-micrometer resolution and the dental ontogeny to be reconstructed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>).</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Reconstructed ontogeny of the <italic>Lophosteus</italic> marginal jawbone relative to the development of the lateral line.</title><p>Block diagrams in antero-external view, aligned so that the biting margin maintains a fixed position (note that this causes the older parts of the bone to move away from the biting margin and rotate anticlockwise during growth).

Lines of resorption around the lateral line canal indicates bone remodeling (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s6">Figure 4—figure supplement 6</xref>). Note, the replacement of teeth and the overgrowth of odontodes may have commenced before the addition of the ultimate first-generation teeth.

The latter occur in the Early Devonian armored fish known as ‘acanthothoracids’, including <italic>Radotina</italic>, <italic>Kosorapis</italic>, and <italic>Tlamaspis</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). They all have non-shedding dentitions with lingual tooth addition, carried by marginal dermal bones, suggesting that these are the ancestral conditions of teeth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Vaškaninová et al., 2020</xref>). Chondrichthyans and osteichthyans both inherited the lingual tooth addition, but evolved tooth shedding independently, while marginal jawbones ornamented by dermal odontodes were only kept by osteichthyans. The jawbones of <italic>Kosoraspis</italic> and <italic>Tlamaspis</italic> consist of multiple short pieces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Vaškaninová et al., 2020</xref>, Figs. 3 and 4), a condition strikingly similar to that in <italic>Lophosteus</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>), but unknown in other taxa.

In fact, the only dental character of <italic>Lophosteus</italic> that unambiguously distinguishes it from acanthothoracids and identifies it as an osteichthyan is the presence of tooth shedding by partial and basal resorption (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chen et al., 2017</xref>). This character distribution suggests that <italic>Lophosteus</italic> is the least crownward of known stem osteichthyans (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), making it uniquely informative about the evolution of the osteichthyan dentition.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Gross morphology and digital disection of the <italic>Lophosteus</italic> marginal jawbone GIT 760–12.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Photographs oriented with biting (presumed dorsal) margin at the top, in internal (left) and external (right) views. White box indicates region where internal structures have been fully modeled.

Although the complexity of the data set necessitates a very detailed description to arrive at an understanding of the patterning and growth processes, the actual process of interpretation is conceptually straightforward. It rests in essence on four principles. Firstly, that if one odontode overgrows another, the overgrowing odontode is younger than the overgrown; secondly, that a resorption surface is younger than the structures it cuts into; thirdly, that a series of stacked resorption surfaces centered on a single pulp cavity indicates persistence of a single tooth position with repeated replacements of the tooth; and fourthly, that odontode files can be identified by the geometric alignment of odontodes on the jawbone. These criteria allow us to reconstruct the complete sequence of ontogenetic events (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>; <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>).</p><media id="video1" mime-subtype="mp4" mimetype="video" xlink:href="elife-60985-video1.mp4"><label>Video 1.</label><caption><title>Tooth addition and replacement of two alternate files.</title><p>Perspective view. The order of the structures appearing in the video is not strictly consistent with that in life. However, the sequence of developmental events can be inferred: except for the most labial ones, each first-generation tooth had been resorbed before the next, more lingual, tooth was added to the file. As the successive tooth positions in a file increasingly overlap, at a point, semi-basal resorption becomes completely basal, and the successive teeth in a file now take on the appearance of a replacement column. The marginal position is drifting and tilting lingually, with the basal resorption surfaces become increasingly tighter. The addition of new first-generation teeth to the lingual ends of tooth files, and the deposition of replacement teeth onto the labial tooth sockets of these files, are likely parallel processes. The former process constructs tooth files from the positions set up by the founder ridges via semi-basal resorption, and the latter builds replacement columns at each position via basal resorption. The replacement cycles of the labial positions are terminated by the overgrowth of ornament. But where space allows, a new position can be inserted into the marginal replacement column, substituting the overgrown positions.</p></caption></media><p>Here, we present a brief overview of the main ontogenetic stages, before proceeding to the comparative analysis in the Discussion; additional descriptive details are given in the figure legends. Odontodes that are directly attached to the oldest part of the jawbone are designated as ‘first-generation’, even if they partly overlap the positions of previously resorbed first-generation odontodes. The first generation thus does not represent a single moment in time, but rather the initial process of establishing the odontode array of the jawbone. Each standing odontode, including the ornament (O), first-generation teeth (TF) and replacement teeth (TR), is numbered according to its location and generation. Pulp cavities are numbered to denote ornament positions (OP), tooth positions (TP) and replacement columns (RC), marked as ‘file number-row number’. A replacement column is formed by the succession of teeth at a tooth position. Replacement columns that derive directly from a first-generation pulp cavity have the same number as the first-generation teeth. The youngest inserted positions are not aligned in rows, but all of their row numbers are set as 10 in order to be differentiated from the others. The generation membership of standing replacement teeth varies dramatically between tooth positions, and thus is not indicated (though it can be calculated from the number of resorption surfaces); but dermal odontodes are distinguished by generation numbers (1g/2g/3g), which is added before the file numbers. For example, O2g-6–5 represents the second-generation odontode that is situated in the sixth file of the fifth odontode row. File numbers can be overviewed from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref> (7 files in the modeled area), and generation number are illustrated by colors. The file/row numbers are not applicable to the overgrowing odontodes that are located irregularly, and ‘generation number-serial number’ is used instead. For instance, the ‘7’ of O3g-7 is neither related to File 7 nor Row 7.</p><sec id="s2-1"><title>Primordial odontodes</title><p>The oldest odontodes in the entire system are two rows of first-generation odontodes, fused into longitudinal ridges with confluent pulp cavities, at the level of the probable ossification center (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4B</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>, FRla, FRlin). We designate them as ‘founder ridges’. On the lingual founder ridge, the main cusps are tall, conical, lingually recurved and widely spaced; on the labial founder ridge they are blade-like, labially inclined and united by small cusps. Side-cusps are more numerous on the labial founder ridge. The labial flanks of both ridges carry more side-cusps than the lingual flanks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5F</xref>). There is no overlap between the two ridges; instead, their bases join as a continuous sheet (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2A</xref>), implying they formed simultaneously.</p><p>Following the establishment of the founder ridges, more isolated odontodes were added sequentially in both lingual and labial directions, overlapping the lingual and labial edges of the founder ridges, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>, O1g-2–1 and TF5-3). These new odontodes are unicuspid, conical teeth on the lingual side of the lingual ridge (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>), but are multicuspid and quickly take on the stellate morphology with crenulated ridges on the labial side of the labial ridge (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). Simply put, as the odontode skeleton spreads away from the two founder ridges, it turns into teeth lingually and into ornament labially.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Teeth</title><p>In the rows that follow lingually from the lingual founder ridge, all the main cusps become isolated and sharp. Although variable in size, they are arranged in semi-regular alternate files, and the lingual founder ridge can be regarded as a union of two alternate rows (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B,C</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>, TP3-1, TP5-1, TP7-1 and TP4-2, TP6-2). These unicuspid odontodes are considered as the first-generation teeth. Only the most labial (and thus oldest) first-generation teeth are complete. More lingually, the first-generation teeth are resorbed semi-basally, and their remaining bases overlap considerably (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5F</xref>), just like the first-generation teeth of the tooth cushions that form the inner dental arcades (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chen et al., 2017</xref>). The resorption surfaces are wide open, not only to the next first-generation tooth to be added to the file, but also to the replacement tooth buds that formed immediately above them (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C–F</xref>). The first-generation teeth thus establish the tooth positions for the cyclic replacement teeth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C,D</xref>; <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>). The pulp cavities of the first-generation teeth lie directly on the basal compact bone, coinciding with the territory of the basal feeder vessels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). This indicates that the most lingual row of first-generation teeth was once located at the jaw margin and that the oral lamina at this early developmental stage was much narrower (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>, TF).</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Ornament</title><p>Following labially from the labial founder ridge is a single row of isolated spiny odontodes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5A</xref>). They overlap the labial edge of the labial founder ridge substantially, without partially resorbing it. As a result, their pulp cavities are constrained by the space available (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>, O1g-2–1; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>, OP0-1, OP2-1, OP4-1, OP6-1). As the facial lamina extends labially, younger generations of odontodes are initiated to cover the new bone; as the jawbone rotates labially, they also begin to invade the oral lamina (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C,D</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>, O2g, O3g; <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>). Unlike the teeth, no resorption occurs in the dermal odontodes. Younger generations of larger odontodes thus simply overgrow, rather than replace, the preexisting dermal odontodes. There are two levels of overgrowth and the dermal odontodes are divided into three generations, inferred from their size and distribution.</p><p>All generations of dermal odontodes follow a global morphologic gradation. The further they are from the biting margin at the time they are initiated, the more side-cusps, ridgelets, and crenulations are associated with the main cusp, and the more ascending canals are attached to the flattened pulp cavities. The largest and youngest stellate odontodes have the most elaborate appearance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, O3g-3–6, O3g-7) and the most osteodentine-like tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplements 2</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s5">5</xref>), which probably reflects their location furthest from the jaw margin, rather than their size or age. We surmise that this pattern reflects a morphogenetic signal gradient (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>) between the jaw margin and the ‘generic dermal surface’ of the face, represented here by the facial lamina beyond the lateral line canal.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Interaction between teeth and ornament</title><p>Where the dermal odontodes invade the tooth-bearing oral lamina, a subtle but important morphologic variability affects the labial surface of some shedding teeth.

The dentine of the side-cusps tends to include some cell spaces. In other words, these teeth show ornament-like characteristics; there appears to be a degree of ‘morphologic cross-contamination’ between the two odontode sets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, bars in lavender and mint). At the invasive front line, both overgrowing odontodes and replacement teeth have a half-tooth half-ornament morphology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>, compare O2g-1 and O2g-2 with TR7-3 and TR7-7), though the replacement teeth are recognizable by their possession of basal resorption surfaces.</p><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Postero-occlusal view of the tooth field invaded by overgrowing odontodes.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) First-generation teeth are shown.

The dermal odontodes overgrowing the oral lamina do not develop a fully stellate morphology, only with few uncrenulated ridgelets. The most lingual ones tend to become longitudinally compressed, contrary to the longitudinal elongation of those on the facial lamina. Their side-cusps only develop labially and main cusps incline lingually.

This indicates the ossification center is located at the external margin. The gradient between teeth and dermal odontodes of the first generation appears to be unidirectional in <italic>Andreolepis</italic> too, from a morphology with elongate bases to a more prominently tooth-like morphology with round bases as they approach the jaw margin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chen et al., 2016</xref>, Figure 2a,b).

Nevertheless, it is certain that the location of the odontode founder region and the bone ossification center is considerably external to the original oral-dermal boundary in <italic>Andreolepis</italic>. By contrast, the three developmental landmarks overlap in <italic>Lophosteus</italic>, which thus displays a bidirectional morphologic gradation in the initial odontode skeleton.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Developmental implications: initiation of the odontode skeleton</title><p>The dermal odontodes and teeth of <italic>Lophosteus</italic> are initiated simultaneously in the form of two parallel and closely spaced founder ridges (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2A,B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4B</xref>). The cusps of the lingual founder ridge incline lingually, and those of the labial founder ridge, labially; subsequent odontodes are added to the lingual flank of the lingual founder ridge and the labial flank of the labial founder ridge. This geometric layout strongly suggests that the initiation site for odontode formation is the boundary between two patterning domains: a labial domain where the odontodes become ornament and a lingual domain where they become teeth. Because the development of an odontode is always initiated by an epithelium, we infer that the two domains are covered with two distinct epithelia, which we refer to respectively as the dermal and oral epithelium. The cusps of the two founder ridges are already morphologically distinct, and the odontodes that are subsequently produced at their labial and lingual sides quickly acquire the full characteristics of ornament and teeth, respectively. This must represent the establishment of their complete regulatory cascades, and possibly relates to the initiation of new odontodes on each side moving away from the boundary between the dermal and oral epithelia into the presumably more homogeneous signaling environment of a single epithelium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, 1g).</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Developmental implications: the shifting oral-dermal boundary</title><p>The strict, linear separation described above only characterises the first-generation odontodes. Already in the second-generation, stellate odontodes have overgrown some of the oldest teeth, in a considerably more lingual position than the original boundary. The third generation penetrates even further into the territory of teeth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, 2g and 3g; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>, O2g, O3g). This suggests an irregular expansion of the dermal epithelium into the region previously occupied exclusively by the oral epithelium. A similar invasion of the tooth field by dermal ornament has been observed in <italic>Andreolepis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chen et al., 2016</xref>) and an unnamed acanthothoracid from the Canadian Arctic, specimen CPW.9 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Smith et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Vaškaninová et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>In <italic>Lophosteus</italic>, the ornament invasion produces an effect that is highly informative about the relationship between these two odontode sets. Essentially, the <italic>deposition</italic> of odontodes remains characteristic for the two sets – teeth continue to be replaced cyclically until overgrown by ornament, and the dermal odontodes are never shed – but the <italic>morphology</italic> of each set seems to become influenced by the other. The teeth nearest to the ornament bear side-cusps that tend to form a labial ridgelet. Conversely, in the most lingual dermal odontodes, the conical main cusp tends to stand out and point lingually, the side-cusps being restricted to the labial side (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4A,B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6C,D</xref>). That is to say, in the invasion zone, the teeth are ornament-like and the dermal odontodes are tooth-like. The simplest explanation for this phenomenon is that the invasion zone provides a mixed set of morphogenetic signals, because it is a patchwork of dermal and oral epithelium, and that both dermal odontodes and teeth respond to both signals. Note, however, that this ‘regulatory cross-contamination’ only affects the morphology, not the deposition and (if present) resorption cycles.</p><p>In <italic>Andreolepis</italic>, the lingualmost odontodes of any generation of invading ornament can be tall and bear biting damage, in contrast to the characteristic flat-topped ornament morphology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chen et al., 2016</xref>, Extended Data Figure 3c). In many basal actinopterygians with acrodin-capped teeth, such as <italic>Birgeria</italic> and <italic>Boreosomus</italic>, the dermal odontodes labial to the jaw teeth also bear an acrodin cap (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Ørvig, 1978a</xref>, PP. 38, Figs. 3, 4, 7–9). The zone of the acrodin-bearing odontodes varies in size, being, for example, narrower in <italic>Colobodus</italic> and wider in <italic>Nephrotus</italic> and others (Ørvig, 1978c, pp. 307), but is invariably restricted to the vicinity of dentition, regardless of the type of jawbone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Ørvig, 1978b</xref>, pp. 41–42).

In fact, the bone appears to have rotated labially during growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), so that the location of the mouth margin shifted during ontogeny from the lingual founder ridge, via each lingual row of the first-generation teeth, to each successive row of replacement teeth at the current lingual margin of the oral lamina. This implies that the oral-dermal epithelial boundary does not drift lingually to any great degree; rather, the rotation of the bone causes the labial tooth rows to move onto the face, where they get covered by dermal epithelium and overgrown by ornament. This is comparable to the rotation of the tooth whorls at the jaw margin of primitive chondrichthyans, with the post-functional teeth slid beneath the skin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Smith and Coates, 2001</xref>, Figure 14.3(a); <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Williams, 2001</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Developmental implications: alternate pattern throughout the oral and dermal domains</title><p>In <italic>Lophosteus</italic>, the first-generation teeth are added sequentially toward the growing lingual margin, with the tooth families arranged in horizontal alternate files. In the next stage, each successor, if not overgrown by invasive odontodes, turns into an initiator and sets up its own tooth family by cyclic replacement. The replacement teeth hence inherit the pattern of the first-generation teeth, generation after generation, forming vertical alternate columns. The replacement columns, including those inserted later and those disturbed by overgrowing odontodes, follow the same transverse alignment as the first-generation teeth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>). Longitudinally, the exposed tooth rows appear somewhat irregular, which is due to two reasons. Firstly, new positions that are not established by the first-generation teeth are inserted whenever space is available along the marginal replacement column (e.g. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>, RC3-10). Secondly, different labial positions are terminated randomly by different generations of overgrowing odontodes, and the total number of replacement cycles is different in each tooth position. As a consequence, the final replacement teeth drifted lingually from their first-generation teeth for a variable distance, reflected by the variable length of replacement columns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, compare TR7-3 with TR 6–4 and TR4-4). Nevertheless, the marginal positions that maintain the original pattern throughout the growth of bone are invariably aligned in a row.</p><p>Sequential addition along the files established by the first generation also applies to the stellate odontodes on the facial lamina. Such an alternate arrangement is constant throughout the teeth and tooth-like odontodes on the marginal jawbone of <italic>Andreolepis</italic> and <italic>Kosoraspis</italic> as well, irrespective of whether they will be overgrown by younger generations of odontodes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chen et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Vaškaninová et al., 2020</xref>). The alternate pattern of teeth and ornament of <italic>Lophosteus</italic> is already established by the founder ridges. The ornament differs from teeth in the fact that every other alternate position of ornament is suppressed as the ornament extends labially (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>); this is because consecutive generations of dermal odontodes increase in length more quickly than the bone. The replacement of two teeth by a single larger successor at a crowded site has been observed in sharks, frogs and lizards, and considered as a common phenomenon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gillette, 1955</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Edmund, 1960</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cooper, 1963</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Osborn, 1971</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Reif, 1976</xref>). In alligator embryos, the reduction of jaw growth can cause the suppression of a tooth family during ontogeny (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Westergaard and Ferguson, 1987</xref>). The suppression does not represent an irregularity; instead, it may reflect the fundamental mechanism producing the alternate pattern.</p><p>The hexagonal pattern is the most efficient form of close packing of rounded objects. The close packed teeth of myliobatid rays, which have turned into short hexagonal prisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Edmund, 1960</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Underwood et al., 2015</xref>), is an extreme example of a dentition imitating the structure of a honeycomb. A regular pattern, which was thought to be unique to teeth and reflect the spatio-temporal regulation of the dental lamina (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Smith, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Underwood et al., 2016</xref>), is actually not uncommon in dermal odontodes, as well as in bony denticles. Ordered tubercles can be seen covering the armor of jawed stem gnathostomes as long as there is only one generation, irrespective of whether they are dentinal units on the gnathal plates and spines, or bony units on the postbranchial lamina (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bystrow, 1957</xref>, Fig. 2; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Burrow, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Johanson and Smith, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Johanson and Smith, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Young, 2003</xref>). In the polyodontode scales of the earliest known chondrichthyans, odontodes are often organized in parallel or radial rows by sequential addition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Andreev et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>An alternate pattern can be produced by odontodes that are laid down directly on the bony plate, simply through filling the gaps between the odontodes in the previous row, even if the previous row is from the older generation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>). But it is difficult for the enlarged overgrowing odontodes to find and fit such gaps, by reason of the preexisting odontodes, so the pattern will be disturbed. This effect is clearly visible in a digitally dissected spine of the jawed stem gnathostome <italic>Romundina</italic>, which carries three generations of odontodes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Jerve et al., 2017</xref>, Fig. 2D1–D3); the first generation shows an ordered pattern, but this breaks down in the second and third generations. The single-file arrangement of the first-generation odontodes of <italic>Andreolepis</italic> scale is also obscured by the overgrowing odontodes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Qu et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>All these examples agree with a fundamental embryologic mechanism of odontode patterning shared among the skeletons of vertebrates, which had evolved prior to the origin of teeth, as already proposed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Osborn, 1971</xref>. The alternate pattern can be self-generating, as long as the size of inhibitory zones is equivalent or in a smooth gradient (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Osborn, 1977</xref>). Therefore, the regularity of organization should not be considered as a criterion of true teeth. The claim that the ectoderm (dermal epithelium) lacks patterning capacity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fraser and Smith, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Smith and Johanson, 2015</xref>), which has been used to support the idea of a fundamental difference between dermal odontodes and teeth, is biased by the derived adult condition of modern chondrichthyans. Actually, skin denticles of chondrichthyans embryos are added sequentially in regular rows, including the caudal denticles, dorsal denticles and the first-generation general denticles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Grover, 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Reif, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ballard et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Miyake et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Johanson et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Debiais-Thibaud et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Maisey and Denton, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Martin et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cooper et al., 2018</xref>). The oro-pharyngeal denticles also emerge in rows in embryos, even if frequently interrupted by the oral papillae and undulated by the uneven surface of the oropharynx (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Rangel et al., 2017</xref>, Fig. 4F,G). All the skin or oral denticles are likely to be self-organized by Turing’s reaction-diffusion system, a patterning mechanism probably common to epithelial appendages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Maisey and Denton, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cooper et al., 2018</xref>). Later in ontogeny, these denticles may display a random organization, because the regular rows have been obscured by the mix of denticles in variable sizes, which may be due to the loss and repair of original denticles at different developmental stages. Even so, both skin and oropharyngeal denticles retain their alternating pattern in adulthood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Rangel et al., 2016</xref>). Denticle files with regular spacing line up the rear border of the pharyngeal pads in some requiem sharks, remarkably resembling the tooth files lining the length of jaw and probably functioning like osteichthyan pharyngeal dentitions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Nelson, 1970</xref>, fig. 13, 15, 16B). Wound-healing experiments on sharks show that the loss of the diagonal rows and the rostro-caudal polarity as well as the regular size and shape of the scales in repaired squamations is actually caused by disturbance of the original diagonal arrangement of the anchoring collagen fibers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Reif, 1978a</xref>). By contrast, the orderly shedding and replacing of chondrichthyan teeth preserves the embryonic pattern.</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Evolutionary developmental relationship between teeth and ornament</title><p>Our data from <italic>Lophosteus</italic> are in two respects uniquely informative about the relationship between teeth and ornament. Firstly, as a Silurian stem osteichthyan, <italic>Lophosteus</italic> represents a very short phylogenetic branch in a basal part of the gnathostome crown group, and is thus likely to present primitive characters for the Osteichthyes and maybe for the Gnathostomata as a whole; secondly, we can trace the developing relationship between teeth and dermal odontodes through the life history of the animal, whereas all the dermal odontodes and teeth that have been compared in previous studies are fully differentiated forms in adults.</p><p>The unified arrangement of the teeth and ornament of <italic>Lophosteus</italic> challenges the currently popular idea that teeth and dermal denticles have fundamentally different patterning regimes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fraser and Smith, 2011</xref>). In <italic>Lophosteus</italic>, teeth and ornament are never starkly different. The replacement teeth can have an ornament-like appearance, and can be partially shed and overlapped. The dermal odontodes can be added sequentially and alternately, and organized in rows and files. New tooth positions can be inserted once a gap appears, obliterating the original addition sequence.</p><p>Looking further afield, it is noteworthy that the ‘extra-oral teeth’ that occur in some teleosts also display a regular organization, development in epithelial invaginations, and shedding-replacing by basal resorption of the attachment bone and supporting bone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Sire and Huysseune, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Sire et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Sire, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Sire and Allizard, 2001</xref>). These structures reveal the potential plasticity of odontodes and suggest the conventional criteria of ‘true teeth’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Burrow, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Smith and Johanson, 2003a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Smith and Johanson, 2003b</xref>) are in fact not unique to oral teeth.</p><p>Therefore, teeth and ornament are not merely homologs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Reif, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Huysseune and Sire, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Donoghue, 2002</xref>), as supported by a common gene regulatory network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fraser et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Debiais-Thibaud et al., 2011</xref>). More importantly, they develop from the same developmental module, modified through a simple mechanism of heterotopy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Debiais-Thibaud et al., 2011</xref>), which can be evidenced by the developmental continuum, as on the marginal jawbone of <italic>Lophosteus</italic>. However, contrary to the scale-to-teeth scenario of the ‘outside-in’ theory, we argue that teeth did not evolve from ontogenetically mature ornament, but rather from a primordial type of founder odontode, when covered by the oral epithelium. The primordial odontodes might be similar all over the body, outside or inside the oropharyngeal cavity, with later deposited odontodes differentiated according to their location and function. For example, the primordial odontodes in the ganoid scales of <italic>Andreolepis</italic> or the cosmoid scales of <italic>Psarolepis</italic>, revealed by PPC-SRµCT, have a more pointed and tooth-like morphology than the overgrowing odontodes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Qu et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Qu et al., 2017</xref>), resembling the relationship between the founder ridges and ornament in <italic>Lophosteus</italic>. This earliest developmental stage of the odontode skeleton may have been lost in derived taxa or missed by the conventional investigative techniques. Direct comparison between the substantially modified mature subsets of odontodes, could lead to the conclusion that teeth and dermal odontodes are two wholly separate systems. Crucially, <italic>Lophosteus</italic> shows us that only ontogenetic data going back to the earliest stages of development are able to reveal the original patterning relationships within the odontode skeleton.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Specimen collecting and photography</title><p>The marginal jawbone fragments of <italic>Lophosteus</italic> were collected from fallen blocks of limestone at Ohesaare cliff, Saaremaa Island, Estonia, the type locality of <italic>Lophosteus</italic>.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by George Perry as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Zerina Johanson (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>We would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). Specifically, we are asking editors to accept without delay manuscripts, like yours, that they judge can stand as <italic>eLife</italic> papers without additional data, even if they feel that they would make the manuscript stronger. Thus the revisions requested below only address clarity and presentation.</p><p>This paper gives a detailed and well-illustrated description of the histological evolution of odontodes in a stem Osteichthyan fish <italic>Lophosteus</italic> using high resolution synchrotron imagery.

In addition, because we wanted to be sure that the paper is readable and informative to a developmental biology audience, we sent the manuscript out to two colleagues who work on dental development (Qingming Qu and Abigail Tucker) so that they could comment on it. Their views matched those of the two reviewers fairly closely, but we have made some additional changes that specifically reflect their wishes (notably, moving the explanation of the odontode numbering system from the Materials and methods to the main text, at the request of Abigail Tucker).</p><p>In order to shorten the manuscript, we have moved five figures plus figure legends to Supplementary Information. We have also moved some descriptive text into the figure legends of the main paper. We feel this works well, the figure legends are not overly large and it keeps the main text flowing well while simultaneously keeping the additional information more readily available for the reader than it would be in Supplementary Information.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>This is an important contribution from the Ahlberg lab, featuring the exquisitely detailed reconstructions of high-resolution synchrotron scans.

The founder ridges are only slightly different from each other, but the first-generation ornament odontodes and teeth quickly become more distinct as they are added further and further away from these ridges. However, later on, when the ornament begins to invade the territory of the dentition, the teeth and ornament odontodes in the “invasion zone” come to resemble each other morphologically. This only happens where the two types of odontodes are in close proximity, and we interpret it as the result of a mixed molecular signaling environment.</p></body></sub-article></article>
