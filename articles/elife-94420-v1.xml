In dermal fibroblasts from an APDS2 patient, we found no increased PI3K signalling, with p110δ expression markedly reduced. In preadipocytes, the APDS2 variant was potently dominant negative, associating with Irs1 and Irs2 but failing to heterodimerise with p110α.

Each of the three protein products can bind any of three catalytic subunits, p110α, β, and δ, encoded by <italic>PIK3CA</italic>, <italic>PIK3CB</italic>, and <italic>PIK3CD,</italic> respectively. This stabilises and inhibits the catalytic subunits in the basal state and confers responsiveness to upstream stimuli including receptor tyrosine kinase activation, enabled by two phosphotyrosine-binding SH2 domains shared by all PIK3R1 products (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fruman et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>PI3K signalling mediates responses to a myriad of cues, including growth factors, hormones such as insulin, and processed antigens, and so recent discovery that genetic perturbation of PIK3R1 in humans disrupts growth, insulin action, and immunity is no surprise. Beyond this headline observation lies considerable complexity, however, and important questions about genotype-phenotype correlations in PIK3R1-related disorders are unresolved.</p><p>Some PIK3R1 mutations reduce basal inhibition of catalytic subunits, usually due to disruption of the inhibitory inter-SH2 domain, and are found in cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Philp et al., 2001</xref>) and vascular malformations with overgrowth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cottrell et al., 2021</xref>). In both diseases, hyperactivated PI3Kα, composed of heterodimers of <italic>PIK3R1</italic> products and p110α, drives pathological growth. Distinct inter-SH2 domain <italic>PIK3R1</italic> mutations, mostly causing skipping of exon 11 and deletion of residues 434–475, hyperactivate PI3Kδ in immune cells, causing highly penetrant monogenic immunodeficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Deau et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lucas et al., 2014b</xref>). This phenocopies the immunodeficiency caused by genetic activation of p110δ itself, which is named <underline>a</underline>ctivated <underline>P</underline>I3K <underline>d</underline>elta <underline>s</underline>yndrome 1 (APDS1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Angulo et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lucas et al., 2014a</xref>). The PIK3R1-related syndrome, discovered shortly afterwards, is thus named APDS2.</p><p>Despite ubiquitous <italic>PIK3R1</italic> expression, features attributable to PI3Kα activation have been described in only a single case of APDS2 to date (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Wentink et al., 2017</xref>). In that case, the causal variant (N564K) was a constitutional activating mutation associated with cancer rather than one of the common APDS2 variants. Biochemical studies have suggested that apparently selective p110δ activation occurs because APDS2 mutations derepress p110δ, the predominant immune system catalytic subunit, more than p110α, due to differences in the inhibitory contacts between <italic>PIK3R1</italic> products and different catalytic subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dornan et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>More surprisingly, phenotypic overlap is reported between APDS2 and SHORT syndrome. SHORT syndrome, named for the characteristic developmental features (<underline>s</underline>hort stature, <underline>h</underline>yperextensibility, <underline>h</underline>ernia, <underline>o</underline>cular depression, <underline>R</underline>ieger anomaly, and <underline>t</underline>eething delay), is caused by loss of PI3Kα function due to disruption of the phosphotyrosine-binding C-terminal SH2 domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chudasama et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dyment et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Thauvin-Robinet et al., 2013</xref>). Like APDS2 it is stereotyped and highly penetrant. It features short stature, insulin resistance, and dysmorphic features (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Avila et al., 2016</xref>). In recent years, both individual case reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bravo García-Morato et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Petrovski et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Ramirez et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Szczawińska-Popłonyk et al., 2022</xref>) and larger case series <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Elkaim et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Jamee et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Maccari et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Nguyen et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Olbrich et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Petrovski et al., 2016</xref> have established that many people with APDS2 have overt features of SHORT syndrome, while, more generally, linear growth impairment is common in APDS2, but not in APDS1. These clinical observations are bolstered by the impaired linear growth and increased in utero mortality reported in mice with knock-in of the common causal APDS2 mutation in Pik3r1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Nguyen et al., 2023</xref>). All people with SHORT-APDS2 overlap syndromes have well-established activating PIK3R1 mutations in the inter-SH2 domain implicated in APDS2, but none have characteristic SHORT synfdrome mutations, which are usually in the C-terminal SH2 domain. Conversely, no patient with a classical SHORT syndrome mutation has been shown to have immunodeficiency. There is thus now convincing evidence of a syndrome with features of both gain and loss of PI3K function. The mechanistic basis of this is unexplained.</p><p>PI3K activity is determined not just by activity of individual PI3K holoenzymes, but also by subunit stoichiometry. Regulatory and catalytic subunits stabilise each other upon binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Brachmann et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Yu et al., 1998</xref>), and only regulatory subunit monomers are stable enough to be detected in mammalian cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Yu et al., 1998</xref>). Molar excess of regulatory subunits over catalytic subunits gives rise to free regulatory subunits that compete with holoenzyme for phosphotyrosine binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Ueki et al., 2002</xref>). This has been invoked to explain increased insulin sensitivity on knockout or reduction of p85α alone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Mauvais-Jarvis et al., 2002</xref>), of p55α and p50α (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chen et al., 2004</xref>) or of all <italic>Pik3r1</italic> products (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fruman et al., 2000</xref>). The ‘free p85’ model has been contested by some reports suggesting no excess p85 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Geering et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Zhao et al., 2006</xref>), however most observations, including some made recently using in vivo tagging and pulldown of PI3K components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Tsolakos et al., 2018</xref>), suggest that monomeric p85α can be seen in vivo in some tissues.</p><p>We now address mechanisms underlying human mixed gain- and loss-of-function phenotypes observed in association with PIK3R1 mutations using primary cells, cell models, and in vitro enzyme assays and suggest that they are explained by competing effects of APDS2 PIK3R1 mutations on PI3K activity and stability.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>PI3K subunit expression and signalling in APDS2 fibroblasts</title><p>Disorders in the <italic>PIK3CA</italic>-related overgrowth spectrum (PROS) feature soft tissue overgrowth and are caused by heterozygous, mosaic activating mutations in <italic>PIK3CA</italic>, encoding the p110α catalytic subunit of PI3Kα (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Madsen et al., 2018</xref>). In this group, basal hyperactivation of PI3Kα signalling can be easily discerned in dermal fibroblasts from affected areas of the body (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lindhurst et al., 2012</xref>). <italic>PIK3R1</italic>, like <italic>PIK3CA</italic>, is ubiquitously expressed, yet overgrowth is not reported in APDS2 caused by heterozygous, constitutional activating mutations in <italic>PIK3R1</italic>.

This affects a splice donor site that causes skipping of exon 11, leading to in-frame deletion of 42 amino acids (434–475 inclusive) in the inter-SH2 domain, which is shared by all PIK3R1 isoforms (Patient A.1 in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lucas et al., 2014b</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). These cells were compared to cells from healthy control volunteers, or from people with PROS. Confirmation of expression of all pathogenic mutations was undertaken by cDNA sequencing prior to further study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref>). We found that truncated p85α was expressed, but at a much lower protein level than full-length wild-type (WT) p85α (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B and C</xref>). Despite this, no increase in basal or insulin-stimulated AKT phosphorylation was seen in APDS2 cells compared to cells from WT volunteers or from people with PROS and activating <italic>PIK3CA</italic> mutations H1047L or H1047R (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3A and B</xref>). Although insulin-induced AKT phosphorylation was lower in fibroblasts from the one APDS2 patient studied compared to controls, we have previously reported extensive variability in insulin-responsiveness of primary dermal fibroblasts. Moreover even primary cells from a patient expressing high levels of the SHORT syndrome-associated p85α Y657X did not show attenuated insulin action (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Huang-Doran et al., 2016</xref>). The reduced insulin action in APDS2 cells in the current study thus should not be overinterpreted until reproduced in further APDS2 cells.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) subunit expression and signalling in primary dermal fibroblasts.</title><p>Immunoblotting of AKT, AKT phosphorylated at threonine 308 (T308) or serine 473 (S473), p85α, p110δ, and p110α and are shown with and without stimulation by 100 nM insulin (Ins) for 10 min. β-Actin is shown as a loading control, with different amounts of pooled lysate (Pool) used to demonstrate signal intensity in the linear range.

This has left several important questions about in vivo functions of Pik3r1 unresolved. Identification of a series of human genetic disorders caused by constitutional PIK3R1 mutations over the past 10 years has given fresh impetus to the field and has been mechanistically illuminating.</p><p>Homozygous truncating PIK3R1 mutations abolishing p85α expression while preserving p55α and p50α produce agammaglobulinaemia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Conley et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Tang et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).

Thereafter, human genetics has provided more novel insights. <italic>PIK3R1</italic> mutations were identified in SHORT syndrome in 2013 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chudasama et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dyment et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Thauvin-Robinet et al., 2013</xref>), nearly all in the C-terminal SH2 domain, which together with the N-terminal SH2 domain enables PI3K recruitment to activated RTKs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Rordorf-Nikolic et al., 1995</xref>). SHORT syndrome features short stature and insulin resistance consistent with impaired ligand-induced p110α action, a phenotype distinct from the enhanced insulin sensitivity produced by genetic ablation of one or more <italic>Pik3r1</italic> products in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chen et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fruman et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Mauvais-Jarvis et al., 2002</xref>). Mice with SHORT syndrome mutations knocked in were generated after human findings, and faithfully reproduce the human phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kwok et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Solheim et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Winnay et al., 2016</xref>), confirming that expression of a signalling-impaired PIK3R1 has different consequences to Pik3r1 knockout. No immunodeficiency has been described associated with classic SHORT syndrome mutations, however, suggesting a selective effect on PI3Kα, but the basis of this selectivity has not previously been investigated.</p><p>In contrast to SHORT syndrome, mutations in the inter-SH2 domain of PIK3R1, mostly leading to skipping of exon 11, were shown in 2014 to activate PI3K in vitro and to cause immunodeficiency (APDS2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Deau et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lucas et al., 2014b</xref>) similar to that caused by activating mutations in p110δ (APDS1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Angulo et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lucas et al., 2014a</xref>). Neither overgrowth nor metabolic features of APDS2 have been described to suggest p110α hyperactivation, and indeed short stature is common in APDS2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Elkaim et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Jamee et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Maccari et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Olbrich et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Petrovski et al., 2016</xref>), with a growing number of APDS2 patients described with features of SHORT syndrome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bravo García-Morato et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Maccari et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Nguyen et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Petrovski et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Ramirez et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Szczawińska-Popłonyk et al., 2022</xref>). Moreover mice with the common APDS2 causal Pik3r1 variant knocked in show impaired growth and in utero survival, unlike APDS2 murine models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Nguyen et al., 2023</xref>).</p><p>Thus, study of distinct PIK3R1-related syndromes shows that established loss-of-function PIK3R1 mutations produce phenotypes attributable to selectively impaired PI3Kα hypofunction, while activating mutations produce phenotypes attributable to selectively increased PI3Kδ signalling. Indeed, not only do such activating mutations not produce phenotypes attributable to PI3Kα activation, but they surprisingly have features characteristic of impaired PI3Kα function.</p><p>Lack of overgrowth in APDS2 has been attributed to greater ability of APDS2 PIK3R1 variants to activate p110δ than p110α (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dornan et al., 2017</xref>)<italic>,</italic> but the co-occurence of gain- and loss-of-function phenotypes has not been explained to date. Our findings suggest that the explanation may lie in competing effects of APDS2 PIK3R1 variants to activate PI3Kδ on one hand, as previously shown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Angulo et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dornan et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lucas et al., 2014b</xref>), while on the other hand interfering with PI3Kα through the dominant negative effect of non-p110α-bound mutant p85α.</p><p>The low expression of truncated p85a ΔEx11 we described in dermal fibroblasts is similar to observations made in lymphocytes; however, in lymphocytes this is associated with increased basal AKT phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Deau et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lucas et al., 2014b</xref>) that is abolished by p110δ inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lucas et al., 2014b</xref>). P110δ is also expressed in fibroblasts, but protein levels were reduced in the cells studied, consistent with the previously reported observation that when expressed in insect cells the PI3K holoenzyme containing p85a ΔEx11 has a low yield and is unstable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dornan et al., 2017</xref>). We speculate that in cells with low endogenous p110δ protein expression, the destabilising effect of mutant PIK3R1 predominates over its activating effect.</p><p>The balance between expression and signalling in different cells may be a fine one, however, as transient overexpression of FLAG-tagged p85a ΔEx11 did increase AKT phosphorylation in 3T3 fibroblasts in a previous study, although expression of p110α, β, and δ was not determined (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Deau et al., 2014</xref>). We find, in contrast, that overexpression of untagged p85a ΔEx11 has a strong inhibitory effect on insulin signalling, and we were unable to identify a window of overexpression where increased AKT phosphorylation could be observed. We further demonstrated that most or all of the mutant p85α expressed is not bound to p110α, while unbound mutant p85α still binds to Irs1/2, effectively competing with PI3K holoenzyme. The observation that p85a ΔEx11 can associate with Irs1/2 is in agreement with reports that p85α ΔEx11-containing PI3Kα and PI3Kδ can be stimulated by pY2-peptides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dornan et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dornan et al., 2020</xref>) and that p85a ΔEx11 is recruited to tyrosine-phosphorylated LAT in T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lucas et al., 2014b</xref>). The competition we suggest between unbound mutant p85α and PI3K holoenzyme for binding to the activated RTKs is in keeping with longstanding evidence that free p85 downregulates PI3K signalling through the same competitive mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Thorpe et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Ueki et al., 2002</xref>), with a single study suggesting in addition that overexpression of tagged p85α leads to Irs1 sequestration with free p85α in cytosolic foci where PI(3,4,5)P3 production does not occur (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Luo et al., 2005</xref>).</p><p>The current study has limitations. We have studied primary cells from only a single APDS2 patient, and in the 3T3-L1 cell model, we did not determine whether p110δ protein could be detected. If not, this could explain the lack of detectable AKT phosphorylation with induction of Pik3r1 ΔEx11. Indeed, previous pharmacological studies in 3T3-L1 adipocytes has shown that selective inhibition of p110δ or p110β does not alter insulin-induced phosphorylation of any protein studied in the PI3-K pathway, attesting to the dominance of p110α in insulin action in this cell model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Knight et al., 2006</xref>). Our study moreover raises further questions. Full-length p85α subunits can homodimerise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cheung et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Harpur et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">LoPiccolo et al., 2015</xref>), and it is speculated that homodimers may outcompete p85α/p110 heterodimers for binding to activated Irs1 due to configuration of the four SH2 domains. In the 3T3-L1 preadipocyte APDS2 models, p85a ΔEx11 expression was high despite impaired p110α association, but whether this is composed of monomeric or homodimeric p85α, and whether mutant p85α expression leads to sequestration of Irs1 remote from the insulin receptor, as previously suggested for tagged WT p85α (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Luo et al., 2005</xref>), is undetermined.</p><p>In summary, it is already established that: (1) genetic activation of PIK3CD causes immunodeficiency without disordered growth, while (2) inhibition of PIK3R1 recruitment to RTKs and their substrates impairs growth and insulin action, without immunodeficiency, despite all catalytic subunits being affected and (3) loss of p85α alone causes immunodeficiency. The current study, coupled with prior reports, suggests that the common APDS2 mutation in PIK3R1 has mixed consequences, producing greater hyperactivation of p110δ than p110α, based on subtle differences in the inhibitory interactions of regulatory and catalytic subunits, while also destabilising PI3K holoenzyme and exerting dominant negative activity on WT PIK3R1 function. We suggest that these competing activating and inhibitory consequences are finely balanced, potentially differing among tissues, leading to mixed clinical profiles of gain- and loss-of-function features.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides"

site-directed mutagenesis of an Hsp85α_pACEBac1 plasmid using a QuikChange II XL Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit (Agilent, 200521). In-Fusion cloning (Takara, 638909) was used to generate Hsp85α_pACEBac1_p85α ΔEx11. In brief, Hsp85α_pACEBac1 backbone was digested (BamHI/NotI) and purified using Zymoclean Gel DNA Recovery Kit (Zymo Research, D4001), while the cDNA insert was purified using NucleoSpin Clean-up Kit (Takara, 740609.10). Insert generation was performed by High-Fidelity PCR using primers designed to yield fragments containing exons 1–10 or 12–16 with the necessary overlap, with inserts verified by electrophoresis and purified using NucleoSpin Clean-up Kit. In-Fusion reactions were performed according to the manufacturer’s guideline using 100 ng each of linearised plasmid and both inserts in 10 μL. Products were transformed into Stellar Competent cells (Takara, 636763). Purified plasmid inserts were sequenced and verified by restriction enzyme digest, exploiting loss of a DpnI site within excised exon 11.</p><p>Hsp85α_pACEBac1, Hsp110α_pACEBac1, Hsp110β_pACEBac1, and Hsp110δ_pFastBacHT B plasmids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Burke et al., 2011</xref>) encoding N terminally tandem His-tagged p110 subunits were used to generate bacmid DNA. MAX Efficiency DH10Bac Competent Cells (Invitrogen, 10361-012) were transformed with 40 ng plasmid DNA and turbid cultures plated onto agar containing 50 μg/mL kanamycin, 10 μg/mL gentamicin, 10 μg/mL tetracycline, 100 μg/mL X-Gal, and 40 μg/mL IPTG. Single colonies were picked, expanded, and purified at 2 days and bacmid concentrations quantified by NanoDrop 1000 Spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific). 2–4 μg bacmid was transfected into Sf9 cells in six-well plates using Insect-XPRESS with L-Glutamine (Lonza, 12-730Q) and FuGENE HD (Promega E2311). Cells were incubated at 2°C for 5 days and bacmid YFP expression assessed by Leica DM IL LED Fluo microscope using a green fluorescent protein filter cube. Pooled virus from two wells of supernatant (P1 stock) was used to produce high titre P2 stock by transfection of 1.5×10<sup>6</sup> Sf9 cells/mL (Thermo Fisher, 11496015) in 450 mL using Insect-XPRESS with L-Glutamine and FuGENE HD. For catalytic subunits, 1–2 mL P2 stock was used for a further round of Sf9 transfection and expansion to generate P3 stock.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Purification of PI3K holoenzymes</title><p>1.5–2 L of 1.5×10<sup>6</sup> Sf9 cells/mL were co-infected with 18 mL P3 catalytic subunit and 4 mL P2 regulatory subunit baculovirus. Non-infected Sf9 cells were negative controls, and a prior protein preparation of 320 kDa was the positive control. Cells were cultured at 27°C, harvested 48 hr post-infection, pelleted, washed, and stored at –80°C. Pellets were later lysed by sonication in buffer containing 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 300 mM NaCl, 20 mM imidazole (pH 8.0), and 1 mM TCEP (pH 7.0) at 4°C. Universal Nuclease (Thermo Fisher, 88702) was added to lysates before ultracentrifugation at 35,000 rpm for 35 min at 4°C. p85α/p110 heterodimers were pulled down via six tandem p110 N-terminal His tags, preventing purification of monomeric p85α, using tandem Ni<sup>2+</sup>HisTrap Fast Flow columns (GE Healthcare) (equilibration buffer 20 mM Tris-HCl [pH 8.0], 100 mM NaCl, 20 mM imidazole, and 1 mM TCEP [pH 7.0]; elution buffer 20 mM Tris-HCl [pH 8.0], 100 mM NaCl, 200 mM imidazole, and 1 mM TCEP [pH 7.0]). Further purification utilised a heparin HiTrap Q HP column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated with 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) and 1 mM TCEP (pH 7.0), with proteins eluted in 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 1 M NaCl, and 1 mM TCEP (pH 7.0). Eluted fractions were concentrated to ≥1 mg/mL using Millipore Amicon Ultra-15 Centrifugal Filter Units with Ultracel-50 membrane, and 1 mL concentrated fractions were gel-filtered on Superdex 200 16/60 columns (GE Healthcare) equilibrated in 20 mM HEPES (pH 7.5), 100 mM NaCl, and 2 mM TCEP (pH 7.0). The p110 6-His tag was retained for proteins used in functional analyses. KTA Protein Purification Systems (GE Healthcare) and UNICORN Control Software version 5.11 (GE Healthcare) were used for all purifications. Purity of eluted complexes was verified by SDS-PAGE, and purified proteins were quantified using a NanoDrop 1000 Spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher). Protein concentration was calculated using the molecular extinction coefficient (assuming full cysteine reduction) determined by heterodimer sequence input to the ProtParam tool (ExPASy). Purified proteins were stored at –80°C in single-use aliquots.</p><p>Total injection volume onto gel filtration columns was kept at 1 mL. Yields of PI3K complexes were determined using the area under the curve (280 nm mAU per mL eluted protein) from gel filtration chromatograms, and normalised to the volume of Sf9 cells infected.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Liposome preparation</title><p>Chloroform/methanol solutions of sphingomyelin, cholesterol, porcine brain phosphatidylcholine, porcine brain phosphatidylethanolamine, porcine brain phosphatidylserine, and porcine brain PI(4,5)P2 (Avanti Polar Lipids) were mixed to generate a preparation containing 5/10/15/45/20/5% (wt/vol) of each lipid, with a total lipid concentration of 5 mg/mL and final PI(4,5)P2 concentration 250 μg/mL. Lipid preparations were dessicated under argon and then in a vacuum desiccator. Lipids were rehydrated in buffer containing 20 mM HEPES (pH 7.5), 100 mM KCl, and 1 mM EGTA (pH 8.0) using vortexing for 3 min, water bath sonication for 15 min, and 10 cycles between liquid nitrogen and a 43°C water bath. Unilamellar vesicles were generated by extrusion through polycarbonate filters with 100 nm pores, using a glass-tight syringe. Single-use aliquots were stored at –80°C.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Fluorescence polarisation assay</title><p>PI(3,4,5)P3 production was measured by modified PI3-kinase activity fluorescence polarisation assay (Echelon Biosciences, Salt Lake City, UT, USA). 10 μL reactions in 384-well black microtitre plates used 1 mM liposomes containing 50 μM PI(4,5)P2, optimised concentrations of purified PI3K proteins, 100 μM ATP, 2 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, with or without 1 μM tyrosine bisphosphorylated 33-mer peptide derived from mouse PDGFRβ residues 735–767, including phosphotyrosine at positions 740 and 751 (‘pY2’; 735-ESDGG<bold><underline>Y</underline></bold>MDMSKDESID<bold><underline>Y</underline></bold>VPMLDMKGDIKYADIE-767; Cambridge peptides). Reactions were quenched with 5 μL of solution containing 20 mM HEPES (pH 7.5), 150 mM NaCl, 30 mM EDTA (pH 7.4), and 400 nM GST-Grp1-PH, followed by addition of 5 μL 40 nM TAMRA Red Fluorescent Probe in HNT buffer. Identity of the lipid group coupled to the TAMRA probe was not disclosed by Echelon Biosciences, but as Grp1 recognises specific lipid head groups in competition with PI(3,4,5)P3, it is likely to be a lipid with a similar head group such as inositol 1,3,4,5-tetrakisphosphate. After 1 hr equilibration, fluorescence polarisation was measured using a PHERAstar spectrofluorometer (BMG Labtech, Ortenberg, Germany) with the FP/540-20/590-20/590-20 optical module. The concentrations of WT protein complexes used in the assay were: 20–40 nM p85α/p110α, 80–160 nM p85α/p110β, and 80–160 nM p85α/p110δ for basal activities, and 1–2 nM p85α/p110α, 2–4 nM p85α/p110β, and 2–6 nM p85α/p110δ for pY2-stimulated activities. Concentrations of thawed protein aliquots were assessed as 280 nm absorbance by NanoDrop 1000 Spectrophotometer, and samples of preparations used in assays were resolved by SDS-PAGE to confirm equal amounts of each complex. Three technical replicates were used per assay on at least three different occasions. Relevant WT p85α/p110 catalytic isoforms were included in each assay as controls. Other controls were (1) Stop mix+probe without lipids, to assess maximum fluorescence polarisation. (2) Stop mix+probe with lipids, to determine the effect of lipids on maximum fluorescence polarisation. (3) Probe without stop mix or lipids to determine minimum fluorescence polarisation. (4) Probe with lipids but no stop mix to determine the effect of lipids on minimum fluorescence polarisation. Standard curves of diC8-PI(3,4,5)P3 in the presence of liposomes were included in every experiment and used to infer PIP3 generated by purified PI3K. GraphPad Prism v6.0 was used to generate sigmoidal standard curves by plotting log-transformed diC8-PI(3,4,5)P3 concentrations against fluorescence polarisation. Standard curves for each experiment provided the linear range within which PIP3 could be accurately determined. Preliminary studies found only trivial differences in measured fluorescence polarisation in the presence of pY2, which was thus omitted from subsequent standard curves. Quadruplicate interpolated PIP3 concentrations were averaged and normalised by reaction time (30 min) and enzyme concentration in pM to yield PI3K activity in pmol PIP3/min/pM enzyme. Specific activities were then further normalised to activity of p85α WT controls in the presence of pY2 in each experiment.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Generation of 3T3-L1 cells conditionally expressing p85α or p110α</title><p>3T3-L1 preadipocytes (Zenbio, lot 3T3062104, passage 8) were cultured, differentiated, and stained for neutral lipid with Oil Red O as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Huang-Doran et al., 2011</xref>). Differentiation (visible as accumulation of multiple lipid droplets) served as a phenotypic assay validating cell identity. All cell lines used were confirmed mycoplasma free through a routine policy of monthly PCR-based screening. Generation of 3T3-L1 sublines inducibly expressing WT, Y657X, or R649W p85α was also previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Huang-Doran et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hussain et al., 2011</xref>). The 3T3-L1 lines inducibly expressing p85α ΔEx11 or p110α H1047R were generated using essentially the same procedure, starting with In-Fusion subcloning of the p85a ΔEx11 cDNA insert from the pACEBac1 p85a ΔEx11 plasmid described above, and of PIK3CA H1047R cDNA (based on Uniprot P42336) derived by PCR of a pre-existing expression vector, into the pEN_Tmcs entry vector. After sequence verification these inserts were integrated into a pSLIK-Hygro lentiviral vector, packaged into VSV-G-pseudotyped lentiviral particles, using packaging plasmids pMDLg/pRRE and pRSVREV, and VSV-G envelope plasmid pVSV, and used to infect 3T3-L1 preadipocytes (plasmids listed in Key resources table).

For Co-IP lysates (150–300 μg protein) were incubated in 500 μL Co-IP buffer with immunoprecipitating antibody overnight at 4°C. 10 μg lysate mixed with NuPAGE SDS Loading buffer and 5% β-mercaptoethanol was stored to represent Co-IP input. Co-IP samples were incubated for 2 hr with 1.5 mg PBST-washed Protein G Dynabeads (Life Technologies, 10003D) at 4°C before centrifugation and bead removal using a DynaMag-2 Magnet (Invitrogen). Supernatants mixed 1:1 with Co-IP elution buffer (2X NuPAGE LDS, 100 mM NuPAGE Sample Reducing Agent [Invitrogen, NP0009], in Co-IP lysis buffer) were boiled for 10 min. Beads were washed five times in 50 μL Co-IP lysis buffer, before protein elution with 25 μL Co-IP elution buffer and boiling for 10 min. Input, supernatant, and Co-IP samples underwent SDS-PAGE using NuPAGE 4–12% gradient Bis-Tris gels (Thermo Fisher, NP0321BOX) in NuPAGE MOPS SDS Running Buffer (Life Technologies, NP0001). Transfer to nitrocellulose was performed using the iBlot Dry Blotting System (Invitrogen), with preincubation in Equilibration Transfer Buffer for proteins above 150 kDa.</p><p>For immunoblotting, blocked membranes were incubated overnight at 4°C in primary antibody, washed and incubated with HRP-linked anti-rabbit or anti-mouse IgG secondary antibody diluted 1:5000 in blocking buffer. Proteins were visualised using the ChemiDoc MP System (Bio-Rad) and band intensities quantified using Image Lab software (Bio-Rad).</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>For quantitative data, all biological replicates (i.e. results of independent experiments on different days) are represented in figures, with paired points (e.g. with/without insulin in the same experiment) connected by lines. For fluorescence polarisation assays, each biological replicate shown is the mean of three technical replicates. Sample size for individual experiments was not pre-determined. To avoid the pitfalls of dichotomous significance testing on low-throughput biological datasets, we used estimation statistics (Data Analysis using Bootstrap-Coupled ESTimation) with default settings (5000 resamples, BCa bootstrap) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Ho et al., 2019</xref>). This focuses on effect sizes and derives confidence intervals derived from bootstrapping for differences in means; the small (but typical) sample size of the experiments analysed limits reliable bootstrapping, but it offers additional confidence to the consistent patterns seen in independent replicates. We have indicated significance in main text figures with an asterisk, and show the 95% confidence intervals for mean differences in extended view figures.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf2"><p>Consulting for Novartis on clinical aspects of PIK3CA-related overgrowth, and for Alnylam, Amryt and AstraZeneca on clinical aspects of monogenic insulin resistance and lipodystrophy</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing – original draft</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Formal analysis, Investigation, Visualization</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Supervision, Investigation, Methodology, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Resources, Funding acquisition, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Supervision, Methodology, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Supervision, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Methodology, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Data curation, Formal analysis, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Visualization, Writing – original draft, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>The APDS2 patient studied gave written informed consent for NIH IRB-approved research protocols 06-I-0015 and 09-I-0133 and was reported previously (Lucas et al., 2014b).

Using a 3T3-L1 model cell system, the authors show that overexpressed p85α(deltaExon 11) displays reduced association with the p110α catalytic subunit but strongly interacts with Irs1/2. Overexpression of PIK3R1 dominant negative mutants inhibit AKT phosphorylation and reduce cellular differentiation of preadipocytes. The experimental design, interpretation, and quantification broadly support the authors' conclusions, which establishes a new paradigm that warrants future studies.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>The strength of this study is the clear results derived from Western blots analysis of cell signaling markers (e.g. pAKT1), and co-immunoprecipitation of PI3K holoenzyme complexes and associated regulatory factors (e.g. Irs1/2). The authors analyze a variety of PIK3R1 mutants (i.e. deltaExon11, E489K, R649W, and Y657X), which reveals a range of phenotypes that support the proposed model for dominant negative activity. The use of clonal cell lines with doxycycline induced expression of the PIK3R1 mutants (deltaExon 11, R649W, and Y657X) provides convincing experimental data concerning the relationship between p85α mutant expression and AKT phosphorylation in vivo. This approach for overexpression is excellent and should be utilized more broadly by cell biologists. The authors convincingly show that p85α (deltaExon11, R649W, or Y657X) is unable to associate with p110α but instead more strongly associates with Irs1/2 compared to wild type p85α. Overall, this article does a great job of motivating future studies of SHORT and APDS2 PIK3R1 mutants expressed from their endogenous loci (e.g. knock-in mice).</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>The limitations for this study lie in the complexity of the cell signaling pathway under investigation, rather than a lack of rigor by the authors. Future experimentation will help reconcile the cell type specific differences (e.g. APDS2 patient derived cells vs. the 3T3-L1 cell model system) in PIK3R1 mutant behavior reported by the authors. This is also intimately linked to variable expression of PIK3R1 mutants and cell-type specific regulatory factors. Although beyond the scope of this work, an unbiased proteomic study that broadly evaluates the cell signaling landscape could provide a more holistic understanding of the APDS2 and SHORT mutants compared to a candidate-based approach. Additional structural biochemistry of the p110α/p85α(deltaExon 11) complex is needed to explain why PIK3R1 mutant regulatory subunits do not strongly associate with the p110 catalytic subunit. A more comprehensive biochemical analysis of p110α/p85α, p110β/p85α, and p110δ/p85α mutant protein complexes will also be necessary to explain various cell signaling phenotypes. A minor limitation of this study is the use of single end point assays to measure PI3K lipid kinase activity in the presence of one regulatory input (i.e. RTK-derived pY peptide). An expanded biochemical analysis of purified mutant PI3K complexes across the canonical membrane signaling landscape will be important for deciphering how competition between wild-type and mutant regulatory subunits are regulated in different cell signaling contexts.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="referee-report" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.94420.3.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Reviewer #2 (Public review):</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><anonymous/><role specific-use="referee">Reviewer</role></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>Patsy R.

The conclusion that this mutant serves as a dominant negative form of the protein, impacting PI3K complex assembly and IRS/AKT signaling, is important, and the evidence from constitutive and inducible systems in cultured cells is convincing.

Using a 3T3-L1 model cell system, the authors show that overexpressed p85α delta Exon 11 displays reduced association with the p110α catalytic subunit but strongly interacts with Irs1/2. Overexpression of PIK3R1 dominant negative mutants inhibits AKT phosphorylation and reduces cellular differentiation of preadipocytes. The strength of this article is the clear results derived from Western blots analysis of cell signaling markers (e.g. pAKT1), and co-immunoprecipitation of PI3K holoenzyme complexes and associated regulatory factors (e.g. Irs1/2). The experimental design, interpretation, and quantification broadly support the authors' conclusions.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>The authors analyze a variety of PIK3R1 mutants (i.e. delta Exon11, E489K, R649W, and Y657X), which reveals a range of phenotypes that support the proposed model for dominant negative activity. The use of clonal cell lines with doxycycline-induced expression of the PIK3R1 mutants (ΔExon 11, R649W, and Y657X) provides convincing experimental data concerning the relationship between p85α mutant expression and AKT phosphorylation in vivo. The authors convincingly show that p85α delta Exon11, R649W, or Y657X is unable to associate with p110α but instead more strongly associates with Irs1/2 compared to wild type p85α. This helps explain why the authors were unable to purify the recombinant p110α/p85α delta Exon 11 heterodimeric complex from insect cells.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>Future experimentation will be needed to reconcile the cell type specific differences (e.g. APDS2 patient-derived cells vs. the 3T3-L1 cell model system) in PIK3R1 mutant behavior reported by the authors.</p></disp-quote><p>This is a fair comment. It has been established for many years that relative protein levels even of wild type PIK3CA and PIK3R1 gene products influence sensitivity of PI3K to growth factor stimulation. Such issues of stoichiometry become exponentially more complicated when the numerous potential interactions among the full repertoire of Class 1 PI3K regulatory subunits (3 splice variants of PIK3R1, and also PIK3R2 and PIK3R3) and corresponding catalytic subunits (PIK3CA, PIK3CB, PIK3CD) are considered, and when different activities and stabilities of PIK3R1 mutants are added to the mix. It thus seems obvious to us that different levels of expression of different mutants in different cellular contexts will have different signalling consequences. We establish a paradigm in this paper using an overexpression system, and we strongly agree that this merits further investigation in a wider variety of primary cells (or cells with knock in at the endogenous locus), where available.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>An unbiased proteomic study that broadly evaluates the cell signaling landscape could provide a more holistic understanding of the APDS2 and SHORT mutants compared to a candidate-based approach.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree. This would be highly informative, but we think would best be carried out in both “metabolic” and “immune” cells with endogenous levels of expression of SHORT or APDS2 PIK3R1 mutants. These are not all currently available to us, and require follow up studies.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Additional biochemical analysis of p110α/p85α delta Exon 11 complex is needed to explain why this mutant regulatory subunit does not strongly associate with the p110 catalytic subunit.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree. We present this observation in our overexpression system, which is clear and reproducible, even though somewhat surprising. The failure to bind p110a is likely not absolute, as sufficient p110a-p85a<sup>ΔEx11</sup> was synthesised in vitro in a prior study to permit structural and biochemical studies, although a series of technical workarounds were required to generate enough heterodimeric PI3K to study in vitro given the manifest instability of the complex, particularly when concentrated (PMID 28167755). We already note in discussion that p85a can homodimerize and bind PTEN, likely among other partners, and it may be that the APDS2 deletion strongly favours binding to proteins that effectively compete with p110a. However this requires further study of the wider interactome of the mutant PIK3R1, which, as noted above, are beyond the scope of the current study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It remains unclear why p85α delta Exon 11 expression reduces p110δ protein levels in APDS2 patient-derived dermal fibroblasts.</p></disp-quote><p>We caution that we only had the opportunity to study dermal fibroblasts cultured from a single APDS2 patient, as noted in the paper, and so replication of this finding in future will be of interest. Nevertheless the observation is robust and reproducible in these cells, and we agree that this apparently selective effect on p110d is not fully explained. Having said that, it has been observed previously that heterodimers of the ΔEx11 p85a variant with either p110a or p110d are unstable, and when the unstable complexes were eventually synthesised, p110a and p110d were demonstrated to show differences in engagement with the mutant p85, with greater disruption of inhibitory interactions observed for p110d (PMID 28167755). It is thus not a great stretch to imagine that as well as disinhibiting p110d more, the ΔEx11 p85a variant also destabilises the p85a-p110d complex more, potentially explaining its near disappearance in cells with low baseline p110d expression. Following on from the preceding question and response, however, is an alternative explanation, based on the 3T3-L1 overexpression studies in this paper, wherein we were unable to demonstrate binding of p110a by ΔEx11 p85a. If, in any given cellular context, the mutant p85 could bind p110d but not p110a, then the destabilising effect would be observed only for p110d. So in summary, we believe the selective effect on p110d is explained by differences in binding kinetics and heterodimer stability for different ΔEx11 p85a-containing complexes. The net effect of these differences may vary among cell types depending on relative levels of subunit expression.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>This study would benefit from a more comprehensive biochemical analysis of the described p110α/p85α, p110β/p85α, and p110δ/p85α mutant protein complexes. The current limitation of this study to the use of a single endpoint assay to measure PI3K lipid kinase activity in the presence of a single regulatory input (i.e. RTK-derived pY peptide). A broader biochemical analysis of the mutant PI3K complexes across the canonical signaling landscape will be important for establishing how competition between wild-type and mutant regulatory subunits is regulated in different cell signaling pathways.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that a wider analysis of upstream inputs and downstream network would be of interest, though as noted above the ultimate functional consequences of mutants will be an amalgam of any differential signalling effects of complexes that are stable enough to function, and differential effects of mutant p85a on the kinetics of distinct heterodimer assembly and stability. In this paper we seek to suggest a paradigm worthy of further, deeper assessment. We note that the search space here is large indeed (A. different cell types with differing profiles of PI3K subunit expression B. Multiple upstream stimuli and C. Multiple downstream outputs, with timecourse of responses an additional important factor to consider). These studies are realistically beyond the scope of the current work, but we hope that further studies, as suggested by the reviewer, follow.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review)</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>Patsy R.

Perhaps the reviewer’s point is that changes in protein expression could be explained by reduced transcription rather than having anything to do with altered protein turnover? As shown in Figure 1 supplemental figure 1, sequencing cDNA from each of the primary cell lines studied indicates that both mutant and WT alleles are expressed at or close to 50% of the total mRNA for PIK3CA or PIK3R1 as relevant. While this is not strictly quantitative, allied to prior evidence that these are dominant alleles which require to be expressed to exert their effect, with no evidence for altered mRNA expression of these variants in prior studies, we don’t believe any further quantification of mRNA expression would add value.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Related to Figure 2</p><p>As mentioned by the authors in the manuscript the expression of p110delta but also p110beta in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes ectopically expressing p85alpha variants has not been analyzed.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that such determination would have been a useful addition to the study, but regretfully it was not undertaken in these modified 3T3-L1 cells at the time of study.

However these transcriptomic findings suggest that p110d protein is likely either undetectable, or else present at extremely low levels compared to endogenous p110a. p110b also appears to be expressed at a much lower level than p110a. In our studies overexpressing mutant PIK3R1 and assessing insulin action, we believe we are largely or perhaps entirely assaying the effect of the mutants on p110a, in keeping with the fact that genetic and pharmacological studies have firmly established that it is p110a that is responsible for mediating the metabolic actions of insulin in adipose tissue and preadipocytes including 3T3-L1 (e.g. PMID 16647110). Indeed, to quote from this study, in 3T3-L1 “… inhibitors of p110b (TGX-115 and TGX-286) and p110d (IC87114 and PIK-23) had no effect on the insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of any protein in the PI3-K pathway.”</p><p>We have added the following sentence to the discussion:</p><p>“The current study has limitations. We have studied primary cells from only a single APDS2 patient, and in the 3T3-L1 cell model, we did not determine whether p110d protein could be detected. If not, this could explain the lack of detectable AKT phosphorylation with induction of Pik3r1 ΔEx11. Indeed, previous pharmacological studies in 3T3-L1 adipocytes has shown that selective inhibition of p110d or p110b does not alter insulin-induced phosphorylation of any protein studied in the PI3-K pathway, attesting to the dominance of p110a in insulin action in this cell model (Knight et al, 2006).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Furthermore, a direct comparison of the truncated APDS2-causal p85alpha variant with SHORT syndrome-causal p85alpha variants in regard to pAKT level, and p85alpha expression level has not been performed.</p><p>These investigations would further strengthen the data.</p></disp-quote><p>The cell lines conditionally expressing SHORT syndrome variants have been reported already, as cited (PMID: 27766312). Remarkably, the degree of inhibition of insulin-stimulated signalling is actually less pronounced for the SHORT syndrome variants than for the overexpressed APDS2 variant, as seen in the excerpt from the prior paper below. In this prior paper the maximum insulin concentration used, 100nM, was the concentration used in the current study. While overexpression of the APDS2 p85a variant ablated the response to insulin entirely, it is still seen in the prior study, albeit at a clearly reduced level.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Related to Figure 3</p><p>The E489K and Y657X p85alpha variants should be also tested in combination with p110delta in the PI3K activity in vitro assay.

We elected to prioritise the PIK3R1 R649W variant as by far the most common causal SHORT syndrome variant, and as the variant showing the “cleanest” functional perturbation, namely severely impaired or absent ability to dock to phosphotyrosines in cognate proteins. The paradox that we sought to explain in this paper, namely the phenotypic combination of gain-of-function APDS2 with loss-of-function SHORT syndrome features holds only for APDS2 PIK3R1 variants, and so while it is interesting to document that the canonical SHORT syndrome variant also inhibits PI3Kb and PI3Kd activation in vitro, this was not the main purpose of our study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>Points of clarification and suggestions for improving the manuscript:</p><p>(1) Explain whether there are any PIK3R1-independent genetic alterations in the APDS2 and PROS-derived cell lines.

I recommend rewording this sentence to say exon 11 skipping results in an in-frame deletion of PIK3R1. The current wording makes it seem like APDS2-derived cells contain two genetic perturbations: (1) exon 11 skipping and (2) in-frame deletion. Include a diagram in Figure 1 to help explain the location of the mutations being studied in relationship to the PIK3R1 gene sequence and domains (i.e. nSH2, iSH2, cSH2). The description of the exon 11 skipping and in-frame deletions (lines 126-128) would benefit from having a complementary figure that diagrams the location of these mutations in the PIK3R1 gene.</p></disp-quote><p>On review we agree that clarity of description could be enhanced. We have now edited these lines as follows:</p><p>“We began by assessing dermal fibroblasts cultured from a previously described woman with APDS2 due to the common causal PIK3R1 mutation.

How strong is the genotype-phenotype link for these diseases? Are these diseases inherited or acquired through environmental stresses?</p></disp-quote><p>Both APDS2 and SHORT syndrome are very well established, highly penetrant and stereotyped monogenic disease. APDS is defined by the presence of activating PIK3R1 mutations such as the one studied here (by far the commonest causal mutation). SHORT syndrome clinically has some superficial resemblance to other human genetic syndrome including short stature, but when careful attention is paid to characteristic features it is nearly universally attributable to loss-of-function PIK3R1 mutations with the single exception of one case in which a putatively pathogenic PKCE mutation was described (PMID: 28934384). Although both syndromes are monogenic it is often not accurate to refer to them as inherited, as, particularly in SHORT syndrome, de novo mutations (i.e. not found in either parent) are common. Environmental modifiers of phenotypes have not been described. To the introduction has now been added the comment that both conditions are highly penetrant and monogenic.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(7) The data presented in Figure 5 would benefit from additional discussion and citations that describe the molecular basis of the interaction between PI3K and Irs1/2.

Alternatively, the authors can simply reference other papers to support the mechanism of interaction.</p></disp-quote><p>There is a voluminous literature dating back to the early 1990s documenting the mode of interaction of PI3K with Irs1/2.

This is distinct from the results in Figure 1 showing the ADPS2-derived dermal fibroblast express 5-10x lower levels of p85α delta Exon 11 compared to full-length p85α (Figure 1A), but still strongly inhibits pAKT S473 and T308 (Figure 1B-1C). The manuscript would benefit from more discussion concerning the cell type specific differences in phenotypes. Alternatively, do the APDS2-derived dermal fibroblasts have other genetic perturbations that are not accounted for that potentially modulate cell signaling differently compared to 3T3-L1 preadipocytes?</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer is astute to point out this apparent contrast. First of all, we have no reason to suppose there is any specific, PI3K-modifying genetic perturbation present in the primary dermal fibroblasts studied, although of course the genetic background of these cells is very distinct to that of 3T3-L1 mouse embryo fibroblasts. Related to such background differences, however, substantial variability is usually apparent in insulin-responsiveness even of healthy control dermal fibroblasts. This means that caution should be exercised in extrapolating from studies of the primary cells of a single individual. To illustrate this, we point the reviewer to our 2016 study in which we extensively studied the dermal fibroblasts of a proband with SHORT syndrome due to PIK3R1 Y657X:</p><p>From this study we conclude that A. WT controls show quite substantial variation in insulin-stimulated AKT phosphorylation and B. even the SHORT syndrome p85a Y657X variant, expressed at higher levels that WT p85a in dermal fibroblasts, does not produce an obvious decrease in insulin-stimulated AKT phosphorylation, despite extensive evidence from other human cell studies and knock-in mice that it does indeed impaired insulin action in metabolic tissues. For both these reasons we are not convinced that the lower insulin-induced AKT phosphorylation we described in Figure 1 should be overinterpreted until reproduced in other studies with primary cells from further APDS2 patients. This is why we did not comment more extensively on this. We now add the following qualifier in results:</p><p>“Despite this, no increase in basal or insulin-stimulated AKT phosphorylation was seen in APDS2 cells compared to cells from wild-type volunteers or from people with PROS and activating PIK3CA mutations H1047L or H1047R (Fig 1A-C, Fig 1 figure supplement 3A,B). Although insulin-induced AKT phosphorylation was lower in fibroblasts from the one APDS2 patient studied compared to controls, we have previously reported extensive variability in insulin-responsiveness of primary dermal fibroblasts from WT controls. Moreover even primary cells from a patient expressing high levels of the SHORT syndrome-associated p85a Y657X did not show attenuated insulin action, so we do not believe the reduced insulin action in APDS2 cells in the current study should be overinterpreted until reproduced in further APDS2 cells.”</p><p>Nevertheless we remind the reviewer that the main purpose of our primary cell experiment was to determine if there were any INCREASE in basal PI3K activity, or any difference in p110a or p110d protein levels, and we regard our findings in these regards to be clear.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The manuscript would benefit from additional explanation concerning why the E489K, R649W, and Y657X are equivalent substitutes for the characterization of p110α/p85α delta Exon 11. Perhaps a more explicit description of these mutations in relationship to the location of p85α delta Exon 11 mutation would help. I recommend including a diagram in Figure 3 showing the position of the delta Exon 11, E489K, R649W, and Y657X mutations in the PIK3R1 coding sequence. B. Also, please clarify whether all three holoenzyme complexes were biochemically unstable (i.e. p110α/p85α, p110β/p85α, p110δ/p85α) when p85α delta Exon 11 was expressed in insect cells.</p></disp-quote><p>A. Whether or not E489K, R649W and Y657X are “equivalent” to the APDS2 mutant is not really a meaningful issue here. These mutants are being studied because they cause SHORT syndrome without immunodeficiency, while the APDS2 mutant causes APDS2 often with features of SHORT syndrome. That is, it is naturally occurring mutations and the associated genotype-phenotype correlation that we seek to understand. Of the 3 SHORT syndrome causal mutations chosen, R649W is by far the commonest, effectively preventing phosphotyrosine binding, Y657X has the interesting attribute that it can be discriminated from full length p85 on immunoblots due to its truncation, and is moreover a variant that we have studied in cells and mice before, while the rarer E489K is an interesting SHORT syndrome variant as it is positioned more proximally in the p85a protein than most SHORT syndrome causal variants. All variants studied are now illustrated in the new Figure 1 figure supplement 1. B. Regarding stability of PI3K heterodimers containing the APDS2 p85a variant, we tried extensively to purify p110a and p110d complexes without success despite several approaches to optimise production. We did not try to synthesise the p110b-containing complex.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(10) I recommend presenting the results in Figure 4 before Figure 3 because it provides a good rationale for why it's difficult to purify the p110α/p85α delta Exon 11 holoenzyme from insect cells.</p></disp-quote><p>This would be true of p110d were studied in Figure 4 but it is not. Figure 4 looks instead at effects on p110a of heterologous overexpression of mutant p85, is a natural lead in to the ensuing figures 5 and 6, and we do not agree it would add value or enhance flow to swap Figures 3 and 4.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(11) The authors show that overexpression of the p85α delta Exon 11 did not result in p110α/p85α delta Exon 11 complex formation based on co-immunoprecipitation. Do the authors get the same result when they co-immunoprecipitation p110α/p85α and p110δ/p85α in the APDS2-derived dermal fibroblasts used in Figure 1A?</p></disp-quote><p>This is an interesting question but not an experiment we have done.

In both diseases, hyperactivated PI3Ka, composed of heterodimers of PIK3R1 products and p110a, drives pathological growth. Distinct inter-SH2 domain PIK3R1 mutations, mostly causing skipping of exon 11 and deletion of residues 434-475, hyperactivate PI3Kd in immune cells, causing highly penetrant monogenic immunodeficiency (Deau et al, 2014; Lucas et al, 2014b). This phenocopies the immunodeficiency caused by genetic activation of p110d itself, which is named Activated PI3K Delta Syndrome 1 (APDS1) (Angulo et al, 2013; Lucas et al, 2014a). The PIK3R1-related syndrome, discovered shortly afterwards, is thus named APDS2.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) Figure legend 1.

This may be important, as p85a mediates recruitment of PI3K to activated tyrosine kinase receptors and their tyrosine phosphorylated substrates, including the insulin-receptor substrate proteins Irs1 and Irs2. Excess free regulatory subunits compete with heterodimeric PI3K holoenzyme for binding to these phosphotyrosines (Ueki et al., 2002), raising the possibility that excess free, truncated APDS2 p85a ΔEx11 may exert its inhibitory action similarly by outcompeting PI3K holoenzyme for phosphotyrosine binding.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(14) Provide more information about the following statement and how it relates to the mutations in this study: &quot;Homozygous truncating PIK3R1 mutations abolishing p85α expression while preserving p55α and p50α produce agammaglobulinaemia&quot; (lines 271-272).

We do not challenge this, and cite evidence for any such claims in our report. The dominant negative activity we describe here towards PI3Ka activation is based not on inhibition of mutant-containing heterodimer, but rather on destabilisation of and/or competition with heterodimeric WT holoenzyme. This is the basis of the model we present; that is, a finely balanced competition between enzymic activation and mutant holoenzyme destabilisation and competition of mutant free p85a with WT holoenzyme, whose net effect likely differs among cells and tissues, most likely based on the repertoire and proportions of PI3K subunit expression.
