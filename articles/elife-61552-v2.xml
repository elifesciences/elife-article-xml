The impact of this post-translational modification on viral entry is yet unestablished. We expressed different glycoforms of the Spike-protein and ACE2 in CRISPR-Cas9 glycoengineered cells, and developed corresponding SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus. We observed that N- and O-glycans had only minor contribution to Spike-ACE2 binding. However, these carbohydrates played a major role in regulating viral entry. Blocking N-glycan biosynthesis at the oligomannose stage using both genetic approaches and the small molecule kifunensine dramatically reduced viral entry into ACE2 expressing HEK293T cells. Blocking O-glycan elaboration also partially blocked viral entry. Mechanistic studies suggest multiple roles for glycans during viral entry. Among them, inhibition of N-glycan biosynthesis enhanced Spike-protein proteolysis. This could reduce RBD presentation on virus, lowering binding to host ACE2 and decreasing viral entry. Overall, chemical inhibitors of glycosylation may be evaluated for COVID-19.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>COVID-19 is an infectious disease caused by the virus SARS-CoV-2. To access the internal machinery necessary for its replication, the virus needs to latch onto and then enter host cells. Such processes rely on specific ‘glycoproteins’ that carry complex sugar molecules (or glycans), and can be found at the surface of both viruses and host cells. In particular, the viral ‘Spike’ glycoprotein can attach to human proteins called ACE2, which coat the cells that line the inside of the lungs, heart, kidney and brain. Yet the roles played by glycans in these processes remains unclear.</p><p>To investigate the role of Spike and ACE-2 glycans, Yang et al. designed a form of SARS-CoV-2 that could be handled safely in the laboratory. How these viruses infect human kidney cells that carry ACE2 was then examined, upon modifying the structures of the sugars on the viral Spike protein as well as the host ACE2 receptor. In particular, the sugar structures displayed by the virus were modified either genetically or chemically, using a small molecule that disrupts the formation of the glycans. Similar methods were also applied to modify the glycans of ACE2. Together, these experiments showed that the sugars present on the Spike protein play a minor role in helping the virus stick to human cells.However, they were critical for the virus to fuse and enter the host cells. These findings highlight the important role of Spike protein sugars in SARS-CoV-2 infection, potentially offering new paths to treat COVID-19 and other coronavirus-related illnesses. In particular, molecules designed to interfere with Spike-proteins and the viral entrance into cells could be less specific to SARS-CoV-2 compared to vaccines, allowing treatments to be efficient even if the virus changes.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>SARS-CoV-2</kwd><kwd>COVID-19</kwd><kwd>glycoscience</kwd><kwd>furin</kwd><kwd>spike</kwd><kwd>kifunensine</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Virus</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>HL103411</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Neelamegham</surname><given-names>Sriram</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM133195</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Neelamegham</surname><given-names>Sriram</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM126537</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Neelamegham</surname><given-names>Sriram</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM139160</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Park</surname><given-names>Sheldon</given-names></name><name><surname>Neelamegham</surname><given-names>Sriram</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A critical role for glycosylation on viral entry and methods to use this knowledge to reduce SARS-CoV-2 infectivity has been demonstrated.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>SARS-CoV-2 is the virus causing the global pandemic ‘coronavirus diseases 2019’ (COVID-19).

The RBD region of Spike enables binding to its primary human cellular receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2), which is ubiquitously expressed on epithelial, endothelial and blood cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Li et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hamming et al., 2004</xref>). A role for heparan sulfates in viral entry has also been proposed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Clausen et al., 2020</xref>). Once bound, viral fusion and entry depends on two proteolysis sites, the furin/RRAR-S site located between the Spike S1 and S2 subunits, and a second S2’/SKR-S site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Belouzard et al., 2009</xref>). A variety of enzymes including TMPRSS2 (transmembrane protease, serine 2) and cathepsin-L may aid viral entry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hoffmann et al., 2020b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Matsuyama et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Shang et al., 2020</xref>). While inhibitors of viral binding, RNA transcription and protease activity are being tested to reduce viral load, this manuscript suggests an orthogonal approach based on glycan engineering.</p><p>Both the viral Spike-protein and ACE2 receptor are extensively glycosylated, with a majority of the 22 N-glycosylation sites of Spike and 7 N-glycosylation sites of ACE2 bearing carbohydrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Walls et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Wrapp et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Shajahan et al., 2020a</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). The exact distribution of the oligomannose, hybrid, complex, sialylated, and fucosylated structures in these macromolecules is likely dictated both by the protein structure and host expression system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Shajahan et al., 2020b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Watanabe et al., 2020</xref>).

Our results suggest that both the O- and N-linked glycans of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein, including sialylated glycan epitopes, have a relatively minor role in regulating direct Spike-ACE2 binding interactions. However, these glycans control the rates of viral entry into HEK293T cells expressing human ACE2. Here, blocking N-glycosylation on SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus at the high-mannose stage using CRISPR-Cas9 and also a small molecule inhibitor (kifunensine) resulted in extensive cleavage/shedding of the viral Spike protein at the time of production due to enhanced proteolysis at the S1-S2 interface. Our data also suggest that glycans may contribute to additional aspects of Spike proteolysis during viral entry. Due to these effects, viral entry into human ACE2 expressing cells was reduced by &gt;95% when virus was produced in the CRISPR-Cas9 MGAT-1 knockout cells lacking complex N-glycans, and by 85–90% upon production in the presence of kifunensine. These observations support the need to screen chemical inhibitors of glycosylation for the treatment of COVID-19.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Modest role for ACE2 sialic acids during Spike-protein molecular recognition</title><p>In order to study the impact of N- and O-linked glycosylation on SARS-CoV-2 function, we engineered cells over-expressing full-length Spike-protein and ACE2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). We also histidine-tag purified soluble, dimeric Fc-his fusion proteins for the Spike S1 region, RBD and extracellular portion of ACE2. The molecules were extensively glycosylated with their apparent molecular mass being greater than their theoretical mass based on peptide alone. Thus, RBD-Fc was ~60 kDa instead of a theoretical mass of 51 kDa, S1-Fc was ~150 kDa rather than 101 kDa, and ACE2-Fc was ~140 kDa instead of 110 kDa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). RBD-Fc and S1-Fc readily bound to HEK293T cells upon human ACE2 over-expression, confirming that they are functionally active (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). ACE2-Fc also specifically bound Spike-protein expressed on 293Ts.

This suggests expression of low amounts of Spike binding proteins on WT-293Ts. These basal Spike receptors may engage cell-surface Spike on 293 T/S cell (via <italic>cis</italic>-interactions) causing RBD-Fc and S1-Fc binding to be lower in 293 T/S cells compared to WT-293Ts.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Sialic acid has modest effect on Spike binding and viral entry.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Full-length proteins expressed on cells include wild-type Spike-protein [v1] and human ACE2 [v2].

Wild-type SARS-CoV-2 Spike-protein virus (‘Spike-WT’) only entered 293T/ACE2 cells confirming the strict dependence on cell-surface ACE2 receptor. A ‘Spike-mutant’ pseudovirus, where the ‘RRAR’ furin-site was swapped with an ‘SRAS’ sequence, also only entered 293T/ACE2 (22). This mutation results in reduced proteolysis at the S1-S2 interface, as discussed later, likely due to the presence of a single arginine site at the S1-S2 interface rather than the polybasic (‘RRAR’) sequence. To study the role of sialic acid on viral entry, we titered the Spike-WT and Spike-mutant virus using p24 ELISA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). The viruses were then treated with a pan-sialidase from <italic>Arthrobacter ureafaciens</italic>, and the same amount of Spike-WT and Spike-mutant particles were applied to stable 293T/ACE2 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Here, Spike-mutant pseudotyped virus was ~5–10 times more effective at stimulating DsRed-reporter expression compared to Spike-WT. Thus, the efficiency of cleavage at the S1-S2 interface can fine-tune SARS-CoV-2 infectivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hoffmann et al., 2020b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Shang et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Walls et al., 2020</xref>). Sialidase treatment of virus did not impact viral entry, consistent with the notion that Spike sialic acid does not regulate molecular recognition. Additionally, sialidase treatment of 293T/ACE2 did not alter either VSVG or Spike-WT pseudovirus entry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D</xref>). A partial increase in Spike-mutant viral entry was measured upon sialidase treatment (p=0.08), suggesting a minor inhibitory role for ACE2 sialic acid when viral infectivity is high. Glycoproteomics analysis of purified pseudovirus produced in HEK293T cells showed that ~45–100% of the viral N-glycans were complex-type, with up to ~55% of their antennae being terminated by sialic acid (K.C., et al. manuscript in preparation). Thus, the pseudovirus used in this study was processed by glycoenzymes that are typically found in the cellular medial and trans-Golgi compartments. Together, the binding and pseudovirus data suggest that ACE2 sialic acids may modestly shield virus/Spike binding in some biological contexts and perhaps some cell systems.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Blocking Spike-protein N-glycan biosynthesis at the high-mannose stage partially reduced ACE2 binding</title><p>To determine if other aspects of N- and O-linked glycosylation may impact SARS-CoV-2 function, we applied CRISPR-Cas9 technology to develop isogenic HEK293T clones that lack either the core-1 O-glycan forming galactosyltransferase C1GalT1 or the N-glycan branching β1,2GlcNAc-transferase MGAT1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Stolfa et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chugh et al., 2018</xref>).

These cells are termed ‘[O]<sup>-</sup>293T’. Knocking out MGAT1 blocks N-glycan biosynthesis at the Man-5 stage, and the resulting clone is called ‘[N]<sup>-</sup>293T’. Sanger sequencing confirmed that all three C1GalT1 alleles of [O]<sup>-</sup>293T contained indels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>).

In order to quantify the effect of glycosylation on ACE2-Spike binding, ACE2-Fc was applied to Spike bearing cells, either 293T or the O/N-glycan knockouts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). Similarly, either S1-Fc (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>) or RBD-Fc (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>) were applied to ACE2 bearing 293T or the N-/O-glycan knockouts. These Fc-proteins were applied at sub-saturation concentrations in the cytometry binding studies in order to quantitatively evaluate differences in receptor-ligand-binding. Here, we observed a 40% decrease in ACE2-Fc binding to cell-surface Spike expressed on [N]<sup>-</sup>293Ts, and a slight 20% increase when Spike was expressed on the [O]<sup>-</sup>293Ts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>).

Here, RBD-Fc bound ~10 times more avidly to ACE2 compared to S1-Fc. Together, the data suggest a modest role for Spike-protein glycosylation on direct Spike-ACE2 binding.

To determine the impact of ACE2 glycosylation, we transiently expressed this protein on wild-type 293Ts, [O]<sup>-</sup>293Ts and [N]<sup>-</sup>293Ts. The entry of the pseudovirus (VSVG, Spike-WT and Spike-mutant) to these three cell types was then evaluated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2B</xref>). Here, the pattern of viral entry was similar in all cell systems. Lower entry was measured for Spike-WT and Spike-mutant pseudovirus infection of [O]<sup>-</sup>293T/ACE2 cells, but this was also noted for the control VSVG-virus. Thus, this reduced infectivity in the O-glycan knockout is not exclusively due to ACE2 glycans. We conclude that ACE2 glycans may not regulate viral entry.</p><p>In contrast to ACE2, glycan engineering of viral Spike protein dramatically affected viral entry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). To study this, VSVG, Spike-WT and Spike-mutant pseudotyped virus were generated in wild-type 293T, [O]<sup>-</sup>293T and [N]<sup>-</sup>293T (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). All nine viruses were used to infect stable 293T/ACE2 cells. When produced in [O]<sup>-</sup>293T, Spike-WT and Spike-mutant pseudovirus resulted in a 70–85% loss in DsRed fluorescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>), and a partial reduction (35–70%) in the fraction of DsRed positive cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). In stark contrast, knocking out N-glycans in both pseudoviruses abrogated viral infection into 293T/ACE2 cells by &gt;95% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B and C</xref>). Dose studies confirmed loss of viral function upon inhibiting N-glycan elaboration over a range of viral titers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). This was observed for the Spike-mutant and also the Spike-WT pseudovirus (data not shown). Western blot with anti-S2 pAb (polyclonal antibody) suggest that both the Spike-WT and Spike-mutant virus expressed comparable levels of Spike protein, regardless of the glycosylation mutation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). The molecular mass of Spike expressed in [N]<sup>-</sup>293T was lower than that of other virus consistent with the extensive N-glycosylation of this protein. Additionally, the data suggest more extensive cleavage of Spike-WT compared to Spike-mutant, consistent with the presence of the proteolysis-sensitive polybasic furin-site in Spike-WT. The Spike pseudovirus produced in [N]<sup>-</sup>293Ts also appeared to have lower intact Spike protein. To examine this more closely as the anti-S2 pAb may have preference for binding the S2-domain over full Spike, we measured the FLAG-epitope at the C-terminus of Spike-mutant using an anti-FLAG mAb (monoclonal antibody). This may provide more uniform recognition of both the full Spike and the S2-subunit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). This blot suggests that N-glycan loss may trigger precipitous (95%, based on densitometry) loss of intact Spike protein due to enhanced cleavage at the S1-S2 interface. Consistent with the viral entry assay, we also noted greater proteolysis of virus produced in [O]<sup>-</sup>293Ts (52%) compared to that produced in wild-type 293Ts (32%). Together, the data suggest that both Spike N-glycans, and possibly also O-glycans, may play a role in regulating SARS-CoV-2 Spike-protein stability.</p><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>N-glycan modification of SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus abolishes entry into 293T/ACE2 cells.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Pseudovirus expressing VSVG envelope protein, Spike-WT and Spike-mutant were produced in wild-type, [O]<sup>-</sup> and [N]<sup>-</sup>293 T cells.

It demonstrates only a minor role for carbohydrates in regulating Spike-ACE2 direct binding. In this regard, we observed some enhancement in Spike binding and viral entry upon treating 293T/ACE2 with a pan-sialidase. Based on the published crystal structure and molecular modeling, the critical glycans regulating this process are likely located at Asn-90 or Asn-322, proximal to the Spike binding interface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lan et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>).

The data suggest additional roles for Spike N-glycans during viral entry.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-61552-fig6-v2.tif"/></fig><p>The studies performed with CRISPR-Cas9 cell lines containing disrupted O- and N-linked glycans also support the concept that glycosylation is not a critical regulator of ACE2-Spike binding. Here, blocking O- and N-glycan biosynthesis on ACE2 did not impact either viral entry or Spike-Fc binding. Thus, the functional change observed upon enzymatically removing sialic acid on ACE2 is likely a steric effect, as it can be offset by other modifications. Blocking elaboration of O- and N-glycans on Spike, also, only had a partial effect on ACE2-Fc binding. This observation is consistent with previous cryo-EM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Walls et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Wrapp et al., 2020</xref>) and molecular dynamics simulation results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Grant et al., 2020</xref>), which show that the active/‘up’ form of Spike RBD is largely exposed with few glycans at the binding interface. It is now well appreciated that this lack of glycan shielding, makes the exposed RBD a prime target for vaccine development.</p><p>In contrast to the modest effect of glycosylation on receptor-ligand-binding, we observed a much more profound role for glycans in regulating viral entry in part due to their impact on Spike proteolysis at the S1-S2 interface. In this regard, we observed that blocking N-glycan elaboration using both genetic approaches (i.e. MGAT1-KO/[N]<sup>-</sup>293T) and the natural product mannosidase-I inhibitor, kifunensine, dramatically reduced viral entry into 293T/ACE2 cells. This was observed for two virus types: Spike-WT and Spike-mut. In the case of Spike-mut, enzymatic and small molecule inhibition resulted in enhanced proteolysis of Spike-protein during pseudovirus production. These data suggest an inverse relation between furin cleavage and viral entry into 293T/ACE2 cells. Consistent with this, Spike-mut displayed reduced S1-S2 proteolysis compared to Spike-WT, and higher viral infectivity. Others have also noted a reduction in viral entry, upon increasing furin cleavage potential by addition of more basic residues (‘RRRKR’ mutation) at the S1-S2 interface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hoffmann et al., 2020b</xref>). Finally, a recent study observed that the introduction of the D614G mutation in Spike reduced furin cleavage, and this resulted in enhanced viral infectivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Korber et al., 2020</xref>). SARS-CoV-2 containing the D614G mutation is currently the dominant strain worldwide (&gt;80% prevalence, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Zhang et al., 2020</xref>), and the possibility that this is due to altered furin cleavage potential is hotly debated. Overall, our studies with MGAT1-KO, C1GalT1-KO and kifunensine suggest that both N- and O-glycans may modulate the rates of proteolysis at the S1-S2 interface, thus affecting viral entry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). While some S1 may be associated with Spike even after partial cleavage at the S1-S2 interface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Belouzard et al., 2009</xref>), this may potentiate a quantitative reduction in RBD presentation on viral surface, resulting in reduced ACE2 binding and lower viral entry. Indeed several N-glycans are located proximal to the furin-site: N<sup>603</sup> and N<sup>657</sup>, and also N<sup>61</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Watanabe et al., 2020</xref>). O-glycans have also been hypothesized to exist in this region at S<sup>673</sup>, T<sup>678</sup> and S<sup>686</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Andersen et al., 2020</xref>), and some of these have been experimentally verified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Sanda et al., 2020</xref>). How this site-specific glycosylation affects SARS-CoV-2 entry, remains to be determined.</p><p>In addition to its role in regulating RBD presentation, our data suggest that N-glycans may also have other roles in regulating viral entry. In this regard, we noted that even the robust entry of Spike-delta pseudovirus into 293T/ACE2 cells could be partially inhibited by kifunensine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>), and this is independent of S1-S2 proteolysis. Others have noted that the effect of ‘Spike-delta’ mutation may be cell type specific in that this mutation results in lower infectivity in some cell types like Calu-3 which rely on the enzyme TMPRSS2 for viral fusion, while this mutation does not affect entry into other cell types like VeroE6 which lacks TMPRSS2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hoffmann et al., 2020b</xref>). Based on these observations, we speculate that additional glycosylation sites proximal to S2’ may also modulate viral entry, perhaps because some proteases like TMPRSS2 have both ligand-binding and protease activity. The N-glycans proximal to S2’ include N<sup>801</sup>, and to a lesser extent N<sup>616</sup> and N<sup>657</sup>. Additional studies with more cell types and mutant virus are necessary in order to fully elucidate the molecular mechanism by which O- and N-glycans regulate host-cell specific viral entry response.</p><p>In addition to basic science understanding, our findings have translational potential as it suggests that both O- and N-glycan truncation may be used to reduce viral entry. In this regard, it would be attractive to test additional N-glycosylation inhibitors, like Swainsonine, which has a demonstrated safety profile in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Goss et al., 1997</xref>). Additional potential inhibitors that may modulate viral entry include α-mannosidase inhibitors (deoxymannojirimycin, mannostatin A), α-glucosidase inhibitors (N-butyl deoxynojirimycin, N-nonyl-deoxynojirimycin, castanospermine, celgosivir) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Clarke et al., 2020</xref>), and finally compounds like SNAP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Del Solar et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Wang et al., 2018</xref>) and 4F-GalNAc (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Marathe et al., 2010</xref>) which block various aspects of N- and O-glycan biosynthesis. These potentially represent off-the-shelf drugs and compounds that may be repurposed to reduce viral load and ameliorate SARS-CoV-2 related respiratory symptoms. Studies are currently underway in our laboratory to test these concepts, and extend the assay to authentic SARS-CoV-2 strains. Overall, while SARS-CoV-2 has developed a natural ability to enhance infectivity, we propose that glycoengineering may provide a strategy to take advantage of these evolutionary features to regulate viral entry and reduce disease transmission.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources

Stable HEK293T/ACE2 cells were kindly provided by Michael Farzan (Scripps Research, Jupiter, FL). All cells were mycoplasma negative. These cell types were maintained in culture using Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 1% Pen-Strep and 1% GlutaMAX supplement. All lectins were from Vector labs. These include VVA (<italic>Vicia Villosa</italic> lectin, binds GalNAcα on O-glycans), SNA (<italic>Sambucus nigra</italic> lectin, binds primarily α2,6 sialic acid), ECL (<italic>Erythrina cristagalli lectin</italic>, binds desialylated lactosamine Galβ1,4GlcNAc chains) and PHA-L (<italic>Phaseolus vulgaris</italic> Leucoagglutinin, binds Galβ1,4GlcNAcβ1,6(GlcNAcβ1,2Manα1,3)Manα1,3 on complex N-glycans). Goat anti-human ACE2 polyclonal antibody (AF933) and mouse anti-human ACE2 mAb MAB9332 were available from R and D Systems (Minneapolis, MA). Rabbit anti-SARS-CoV-2 RBD (40592-T62) and anti-S2 (40590-T62) pAbs were from Sino Biologicals (Beijing, China). Anti-FLAG clone L5 was from Biolegend (San Diego, CA). All secondary antibodies (Abs) were from Jackson ImmunoResearch (West Grove, PA). When necessary, lectins and Abs were labelled by addition of 25-fold molar excess succinimidyl ester coupled Alexa-405, Alexa-488, Alexa-555 or Alexa-647 dye (Fluoroprobes, Scottsdale, AZ) to protein suspended in phosphate buffered saline (PBS, pH 7.4) for 1 hr at room temperature (RT). Following this, the reaction was quenched with 1/10<sup>th</sup> volume 1 M Tris, and unreacted Alexa-dye was removed using 7 kDa molecular mass cutoff Zeba desalting spin columns (Thermo).

Missing residues in the structure were modeled using PyRosetta (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chaudhury et al., 2010</xref>). N-glycans were then added to the structure using Glycan Reader within CHARMM-GUI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Jo et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Jo et al., 2011</xref>). The identity of the glycans was assigned based on a published work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Watanabe et al., 2020</xref>). The final structure contained glycan modifications at 54 spike Asn and 6 ACE2 Asn.</p><p>All simulations were performed using NAMD2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Phillips et al., 2005</xref>) using the CHARMM36 parameters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Vanommeslaeghe et al., 2010</xref>). The complex was first placed in a water box of sufficient size to ensure a minimum 12 Å separation from the wall. Net charge in the molecule was neutralized by adding 841 K+ and 743 Cl- ions, resulting in 867,166 atoms total. Protein and glycan atoms were first fixed while water (TIP3) molecules were energy minimized for 10,000 steps. Next, the entire system was relaxed for another 10,000 steps, and the system temperature was gradually increased to 310 K in increments of 1 K with 120 fs of equilibration at each temperature. A time step of 2 fs was used. Constant temperature and pressure were maintained using the Langevin framework (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Martyna et al., 1994</xref>). Long range electrostatic interactions were treated using the particle mesh Ewald method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Darden et al., 1993</xref>). The simulation was continued for 26.5 ns.

To create plasmids <bold>[v3]</bold> and <bold>[v4]</bold>, the full S1 domain coding region (M1 to R682) or RBD coding region (R319 to F541) was PCR amplified and cloned into the NheI/XbaI or AgeI/XbaI sites, respectively of pCSCG-19FcHisP2AdTom (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lo et al., 2013</xref>). Human ACE2 plasmid was obtained from Addgene (#1786, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Li et al., 2003</xref>). The entire ACE2 coding region was amplified in two segments to silence an EcoRI cutting site in the coding region and joined by overlap extension PCR. The resulting PCR fragment was cloned into the EcoRI/NheI site of pKLV2-CMVpuroBFP vector to obtain [v2]. Additionally, [v5] was created by PCR amplifying the region encoding ACE2 extracellular domain (Q18 to S740) and cloning into the AgeI/XbaI sites of pCSCG-19FcHisP2AdTom plasmid. Plasmids [v2]-[v5] will be distributed via Addgene.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>CRISPR-Cas9 knockout cell lines</title><p>HEK293T CRISPR-Cas9 cells were generated by transfecting wild-type 293 T cells with pX330-U6-Chimeric_BB-CBh-hSpCas9 vector (Addgene, Plasmid# 42230) carrying single-guide RNA (sgRNA) targeting either the Core-1 β3Gal-T (<italic>C1GalT1</italic>, target site: <named-content content-type="sequence">GCAGATTCTAGCCAACATAA</named-content>) or β1,2 GlcNAc-transferase (<italic>MGAT1,</italic> <named-content content-type="sequence">GTGGGGCGCTATCCTCTTTGTGG</named-content>).

Protein secreted into serum-free media were passed through a 1 mL HisTrap FF column (Cytiva, Marlborough, MA) at 1 mL/min. Following extensive washing with 20 mM sodium phosphate buffer containing 0.5 M NaCl and 10 mM imidazole (pH7.2), the bound protein was eluted by collecting 0.5 mL fractions upon step increasing imidazole concentration in the above buffer to 100 mM (8 mL) followed by 500 mM (8 mL).</p><p>Protein concentration in each fraction was determined using a flow cytometry bead assay. To this end, briefly, 5 µm Polybead carboxylate microspheres (Polysciences, Warrington, PA) were covalently coupled with goat anti-human pAb using 1-Ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide/EDC chemistry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Marathe et al., 2008</xref>). 1 μL of each fraction collected during HisTRAP elution was incubated with these beads for 10 min at RT, before washing and addition of 1:200 diluted FITC conjugated secondary Ab for an additional 10 min. Bead-bound Fc-protein was then quantified using flow cytometry. All fractions containing the Fc-fusion proteins were then pooled and spin concentrated to ~150 μL volume. Buffer was exchanged to HEPES buffer (30 mM HEPES, 110 mM NaCl, 10 mM KCl, 10 mM glucose, 2 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>) using 7 kDa Zeba desalting columns. Final protein concentration was determined in ELISA format by using a calibrant Fc-protein of known concentration that was verified to be &gt;95% pure based on silver stain analysis.

These cells are called ‘293 T/S’ or ‘293T/ACE2’ when expressed on wild-type HEK293T cells, and ‘[O]<sup>-</sup>293 T/S’, ‘[O]<sup>-</sup>293T/ACE2’, ‘[N]<sup>-</sup>293 T/S’ or ‘[N]<sup>-</sup>293T/ACE2’ when expressed in the glycosylation-KO mutants. Here, just prior to functional studies, cells were released from the culture substrate 48–72 hr after transfection using PBS containing 5 mM EDTA, washed and re-suspended in HEPES buffer containing 1.5 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>. During the binding studies, 0–4 μg/mL S1-Fc, RBD-Fc or ACE2-Fc were added to 20 × 10<sup>6</sup> cells/mL at 4°C for 15 min. Following this, 1:200 diluted Alexa-647 (Ax647) conjugated goat anti-human-Fc (Fab')2 Ab was added for an additional 10 min. The cells were then washed, resuspended and read immediately using a 4-laser BD Fortessa flow cytometer. Transfected cells were gated based on EGFP expression for Fc-protein binding studies performed with 293T/S-protein cells, and BFP expression for studies using 293T/ACE2 cells. cell-surface expression of ACE2 and Spike on transiently transfected cells was also monitored on experimental day using flow cytometry. These studies used Alexa-647 conjugated anti-ACE2 (MAB9332, R and D systems) and anti-RBD (Sino Biologicals) antibodies. In some cases, binding studies were also performed with stable 293T/ACE2 cells, in which case fluorescence gating was not necessary.</p><p>In some assays, cells were treated with sialidase (200 U/mL <italic>Arthrobacter ureafaciens</italic> α2–3,6,8,9-Neuraminidase, New England BioLabs) for 1 hr at 37°C, and washed using HEPES buffer prior to the binding assay. Sialidase activity was verified based on SNA and ECL staining. In this case, control cells were treated identically, except that sialidase was withheld. SNA was directly conjugated with Alexa-555 and ECL was conjugated with Alexa-647 in order to simplify the implementation of dual color cytometry measurements.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Pseudovirus production and characterization</title><p>SARS-CoV-2 Spike-protein virus was generated by replacing the classical <italic>Vesicular stomatitis</italic> virus (VSV-G) envelope protein of 3<sup>rd</sup> generation lentivirus with either wild-type Spike protein (‘Spike-WT’, [v1]) or a mutant Spike plasmid (‘Spike-mutant’) containing an ‘SRAS’ sequence in place of furin sensitive ‘RRAR’ (gift from Michael Farzan, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Quinlan et al., 2020</xref>). In an additional variant called ‘Spike-delta’, the ‘SRAS’ site in Spike-mutant was replaced by a single ‘A’. To produce these viruses, Lenti-X 293 T cells (Takara Bio, MountainView, CA) were transiently transfected with 17.8 µg of pLKO.1 TRC-DsRed, 22 µg of psPAX2 and 5.8 µg of VSVG (or 9.9 µg of <bold>v1</bold> or 8.6 µg of Spike-mutant/Spike-delta) plasmid in a 15 cm dish using the calcium phosphate method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Buffone et al., 2013</xref>). Six hours post-transfection, the medium was changed to virus collection medium (OPTIMEM + 10% FBS). The first batch of virus was collected 18–20 hr thereafter. Virus collection medium was then supplemented with 10 mM sodium butyrate. The second virus batch was collected 18–20 hr later. Both virus batches were pooled, filtered through 0.45 μm filter and ultra-centrifuged at 50,000 × g to concentrate the particles. The viral pellet was resuspended in OPTIMEM + 10% FBS, aliquoted and stored at −80°C until use.</p><p>Following the above protocol, 14 additional virus types were generated in this manuscript. This includes virus with envelope composed of: i. VSVG, ii. Spike-WT or iii. Spike-mutant that were produced in either: a. wild-type HEK293T, b. [O]<sup>-</sup>293 T c. [N]<sup>-</sup>293T or d. wild-type HEK293T being cultured in the presence of 15 µM kifunensine (Toronto Research Chemicals, Canada). In addition, Spike-delta was produced in the presence and absence of 15 µM kifunensine. For many of the production lots, viral titer was determined using the lentiviral p24 ELISA kit from Takara Bio (MountainView, CA) following manufacturer’s instructions. Virus concentration was also verified by western blotting with anti-S2 pAb or anti-FLAG to detect equivalent amounts of Spike protein in each of the preparations.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Pseudovirus entry assay</title><p>In order to transduce cells, virus was added at various titers indicated in the main manuscript to either wild-type 293Ts, stable 293T/ACE2 cell lines or various glycoengineered variants that transiently overexpressed ACE2 (at 48 hr post-transfection). Such infection was performed in the presence of 8 µg/ml polybrene as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Buffone et al., 2013</xref>). In some cases, either the virus or cells were treated with sialidase for 1 hr at 37°C under conditions described above, prior to transduction. Virus was removed and fresh medium was added 8 hr post-transduction. DsRed fluorescence was monitored on a daily basis. All flow cytometry and microscopy data presented in this manuscript correspond to the 72 hr time point. Here, DsRed positive cells and the arithmetic mean fluorescence intensity (‘MFI’) of all cells in the PE-channel were also quantified using flow cytometry (BD Fortessa X-20). Microscopy images were acquired using a Zeiss AxioObserver instrument (10X/0.25 NA or 20X/0.4 NA objective).</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Statistics</title><p>All data are presented as mean ± standard deviation.

Spike protein and its receptor on viral binding and entry into host cells. While changes in the glycosylation of either the Spike protein or the ACE receptor have only modest effects in binding, disruption of N-glycosylation processing was shown to have a profound effect on the internalization and proteolytic processing of the spike protein. Chemical inhibitors of N-glycosylation also inhibited pseudovirus internalization, suggesting that therapeutic targeting of glycoenzymes could be used to reduce viral entry and transmission.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 viral entry upon blocking N-glycan elaboration&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, including Malcolm J McConville as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Bavesh Kana as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Morten Thaysen-Andersen (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>We would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). Specifically, when editors judge that a submitted work as a whole belongs in <italic>eLife</italic> but that some conclusions require a modest amount of additional new data, as they do with your paper, we are asking that the manuscript be revised to either limit claims to those supported by data in hand, or to explicitly state that the relevant conclusions require additional supporting data.</p><p>Our expectation is that the authors will eventually carry out the additional experiments and report on how they affect the relevant conclusions either in a preprint on bioRxiv or medRxiv, or if appropriate, as a Research Advance in <italic>eLife</italic>, either of which would be linked to the original paper.</p><p>This is a very interesting, well-conceived and highly relevant study exploring the role of glycosylation of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein and corresponding host ACE2 receptor on viral binding and entry. The authors provide evidence that N- and O-glycosylation of either the viral Spike protein or the host receptor has little effect on viral binding to host cells, but has a dramatic effect on protease cleavage of the Spike protein to allow viral entry.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The manuscript explores the impact of N- and O-linked glycosylation on SARS-CoV-2 viral binding to human ACE2 and entry into host cells. Both the viral Spike-protein and ACE2 are known to be heavily glycosylated, yet the functional relevance of the Spike and ACE2 glycans remains largely uncharacterized. In this submission, recombinant expression of several variants of the viral Spike-protein and human ACE2, together with CRISPR-Cas9-driven disruption of Core-1 β3GalT and MGAT1 enzymes were employed to study glycobiology of viral-host interactions. This was combined with the use of chemical inhibitors of key glycan processing enzymes, sialidase treatment, in addition to flow cytometry- and microscopy-based binding/entry assays using pseudoviruses. The study provides robust evidence for the involvement of protein glycosylation in key parts of the viral infection pathway including controlling the furin cleavage rate. On the other hand, the data suggest that Spike and ACE2 protein glycosylation is not required for ACE2-mediated direct binding and viral entry (at least in this model system). The manuscript is highly relevant and timely. The author team is one of the few globally that have the required expertise to study the glycobiology of COVID-19.</p><p>Revisions for this paper:</p><p>1) While the reviewers noted that the authors had undertaken some studies to confirm that the genetic or pharmacological inhibition of N-/O-glycosylation in HEK293 cells had the expected effects on protein glycosylation, the lack of more robust and direct biochemical characterization of the glycosylation changes in the recombinant glycoproteins used in this study (other than the lectin binding studies) was considered a significant shortcoming. For example, strong biochemical validation of the level of sialylation of the ACE2 and Spike proteins expressed in HEK293 cells or effectiveness of the sialidase treatment was lacking. Similarly, validation of the protein-specific changes in glycosylation arising from MGAT1 and C1GalT1 knock-out was also lacking. Further analysis of the S-protein glycoforms on the pseudovirus is warranted for several reasons including:</p><p>i) Most analyses of S1 glycosylation to date have been done on recombinant proteins that passes through the secretory pathway with canonical topology. In contrast, the S1 protein embedded in pseudovirus that has budded into the secretory pathway at the ERIC will be in a different membrane, which may alter the extent to which they can be accessed by Golgi glycosyltransferases/glycosidases.</p><p>ii) A previous study has reported that levels of O-glycosylation of the S-protein was negligible, contrary to the phenotype observed in this study.</p><p>iii) If wild-type Spike and ACE2 carry low levels of sialylation (as expected from the chosen HEK293 cell expression system), then the effect of the sialidase treatment would also be expected to be low. However, sialylation may still play crucial in vivo roles in virus-host interactions in human cells that have higher levels of sialylation than HEK293 cells.</p><p>Based on these concerns, it is strongly suggested that the authors provide additional biochemical characterization of the S1 and ACE2 proteins. However, if this is not possible within a reasonable time frame, it is essential that the authors provide a point-by-point discussion of limitations of their current glycan analysis, as well as the use of the HEK293 cells and pseudovirus.</p><p>2) In subsection “Knocking out N-glycans on Spike abrogates viral entry” it is mentioned that the Spike pseudovirus with disrupted MGAT1 showed less Spike protein on the surface. This is an important observation that should be expanded on in the manuscript. The altered binding and entry of this variant may arise from either aberrant glycosylation and/or less Spike protein on the surface. The cell surface expression level could be impacted by the glycosylation pattern of the protein. It is important to discuss such points in the manuscript to assist the reader and to leave open the possibility that altered binding and viral entry may be a result of less functional expression of Spike on the protein surface rather than a more direct involvement of the glycans in binding or protection against furin site cleavage.</p><p>3) Fc was used as the fusion protein for expression of S1, RBD and ACE2 – this Fc domain would also be glycosylated in these systems – has this been taken into account? Similarly, were the O-links also expressed in this system? Figure 1B does not show whether and where glycosylation was added to the Fc-His expressed proteins.</p><p>4) There seems to be some contradiction in the manuscript as to whether the Spike-mutant has increased or decreased proteolysis. Since the furin hydrolysis sequence has been modified to be less susceptible to hydrolysis by the arginine deletions it would be expected to cause decreased hydrolysis of the Spike proteins as is described. However, Figure 4F indicates that the Spike-mutant has increased proteolysis and thus enhanced viral entry. In contrast in Figure 3 the Spike-mutant behaves the same as the wild type in terms of viral entry although it is described as having reduced proteolysis</p><p>5) As the data also described O-glycosylation of S1/ACE2 proteins, the title should reflect changes in “protein glycosylation...” rather than just N-glycosylation.</p><p>Revisions expected in follow-up work:</p><p>6) Biochemical characterization of glycosylation (N-/O-/sialylation) of S1 protein in pseudovirus generated from HEK293 cells following inhibitor treatment or loss of expression of MGAT1 and C1 GatT1.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.61552.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Revisions for this paper:</p><p>1) While the reviewers noted that the authors had undertaken some studies to confirm that the genetic or pharmacological inhibition of N-/O-glycosylation in HEK293 cells had the expected effects on protein glycosylation, the lack of more robust and direct biochemical characterization of the glycosylation changes in the recombinant glycoproteins used in this study (other than the lectin binding studies) was considered a significant shortcoming.

In particular, we have completed detailed glycoproteomics analysis of S1-Fc, ACE2-Fc and Spike protein from pseudovirus (Cheng et al., manuscript in preparation). The work is still in progress as we are attempting to add the glycoproteomics of the authentic SARS-CoV-2 virus in the same manuscript. We also need to complete some molecular modeling in order to enhance biological relevance. Nevertheless, a summary of these results has been added to the revised manuscript text (Results subsections “Modest role for ACE2 sialic acids during Spike protein molecular recognition” and “Neither sialidase treatment of Spike nor ACE2 markedly impacted viral entry”). As suggested by the reviewers, we have also added a new Figure 3—figure supplement 1 to this manuscript, which contains detailed characterization of the CRISPR-Cas9 KO cell lines using a larger panel of lectins. We now address the 3 specific comments of the editor/reviewers in more detail:</p><p>i) Characterization of glycans on Spike (S1-Fc), ACE2 fusion protein (ACE2-Fc) and pseudovirus produced in HEK293T cells</p><p>Sialylation pattern of S1-Fc and ACE-2-Fc fusion proteins: We have performed extensive glycoproteomics analysis of these proteins including characterization of site-specific N-glycan mapping (data are freely available from corresponding author upon request, but not provided in this published response letter as it also involves other investigators who are not co-authors of the current manuscript). These runs were performed using an LTQ-Fusion Lumos mass spectrometer (MS) in the laboratory of Prof. Jun Qu (Buffalo, NY, USA) as part of a collaborative project. The experimental workflow involves protein/virus digestion with either the protease trypsin and/or Glu-C under standard conditions (1). Proteins were then subjected to HCD (High-Energy Collision Dissociation or beam-type CID) mode fragmentation. If glycans were observed in this spectrum based on the appearance of signature glycan B-ions, product-dependent CID (Collision induced dissociation) and EThcD (Electron-Transfer/HCD) fragmentation was triggered. All data were processed using GlycoPAT2.0, with FDR (False Discovery Rate) &lt;0.5% and semi-automated inspection to distinguish between isomeric species. Here CID and HCD provide partial information regarding glycan structure and peptide ID. When combined with EThcD a complete “sequencing” of the protein backbone is feasible along with partial characterization of site-specific glycans. Label-free quantitation of each glycopeptide is performed based on measurement of area under the precursor MS<sup>1</sup> curve (AUC). Using this area and knowledge of glycan structure, it is then possible to classify the relative abundance of different glycan species into 4 groups (see Author response image 1 legends for details). This includes the classification based on: (i) “core glycan type”: core, hybrid, complex or unglycosylated; (ii) “fucosylation type”: core, terminal or non-fucosylated; (iii) “branch type (only for complex glycans)”: mono-, bi-, tri- tetra-antennary; and (iv) “antennae type (only for complex glycans)”: % chains terminated by Gal, GlcNAc or Neu5Ac. (This is a <italic>very</italic> brief description of a complex data analysis framework. Due to the nuances involved, we feel it would be best to publish the glycoproteomics work as a separate manuscript.) Such analysis has been performed for 100s of MS/MS spectra at each of the glycosylation sites, and detailed MS/MS annotation for each is available upon request. This has been performed for ACE2-Fc, S1-Fc, and Spike protein from pseudo(lenti)virus.</p><p>In this analysis, we observed that the carbohydrate structures of both S1-Fc and ACE2-Fc contain a mixture of glycans including high-mannose, hybrid and complex structures. Paucimannose structures were not observed, and we are currently investigating the presence of diLacNAc glycans. Among the terminal antennae found on complex glycans, the extent of sialyation varied with protein type, with more sialylation being observed in ACE2-Fc (upto 60% at some sites) compared to S1-Fc (a maximum of 20% at Asn122, Asn147 etc.). Here, <italic>% sialylation</italic> is based on weighting the AUC for each complex glycan by the fraction of antennae what are sialylated.Thus, if a tri-antennary glycan is monosialylated, we only add 1/3<sup>rd</sup> of the AUC in the % sialylation calculation. It then follows that % sialylated glycans far exceeds % sialylated antennae data presented in the analysis.</p><p>Comparison of glycosylation on S1-Fc fusion protein vs. Spike protein of pseudovirus: Similar to the above, we also produced SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus using HEK293T cells in order to address the exact question raised by the reviewer, regarding potential differences in glycan structures between viral vs. recombinant proteins due to ERGIC trimeric assembly. We then compared a few N-glycosylation sites that were common between the soluble fusion protein (S1-Fc) and the pseudovirus Spike protein. In this analysis, we noted that the type of complex structures (in terms of branching, degree of sialylation etc.) were surprisingly similar in the soluble S1-Fc protein and Spike in virus. However, differences were observed in that Spike protein in pseudovirus tended to have more complex-structures at a given peptide site, compared to S1-Fc which had more high-mannose glycans. This may be due to the nature of viral assembly. Regardless of this subtlety, we observed that the viral coat was extensively sialylated with a high density of complex-type N-glycans. Thus, the absence of sialic acid is not the sole reason for our observation that ACE2-Spike binding proceeds largely in a glycan-independent manner.</p><p>With respect to the efficiency of sialidase activity, we are quite confident that these studies were done well. In support of this, a clear 10-fold reduction in SNA binding and 10-fold increase in ECL lectin is reported upon sialidase treatment in Figure 2—figure supplement 1A. All reagents used in this project were fresh and purchased within one month of the experiment. They were carefully aliquoted immediately upon receipt and stored at -20°C.</p><p>Overall, the above structural analyses suggests that there is considerable sialylation in both ACE2 and Spike. Perturbing these glycans by desialylation does not impact ACE2-Spike binding mostly because this monosaccharide does not play a major role in binding, except perhaps for a mild steric effect. These conclusions are based on our studies using HEK293T cells, but we would expect them to hold in other systems also. A brief summary of the above results is provided in Results subsections “Modest role for ACE2 sialic acids during Spike protein molecular recognition” and “Neither sialidase treatment of Spike nor ACE2 markedly impacted viral entry”.</p><p>ii) Role of O-glycosylation in viral entry</p><p>While the glycoproteomics analysis of N-glycans has proceeded well, the assignment of O-glycosylation sites is complicated and is still being finalized. Nevertheless, we have identified a few new O-glycosylation sites on Spike, validated others reported previously (2) and also measured up to 27% occupancy at some locations. Goldman and colleagues also present new data showing that T678 of Spike is glycosylated (3), and this is located adjacent to the R682 furin site. Finally, we have performed small molecule studies with an O-glycan inhibitor and observed inhibition of viral entry. Thus, it appears that O-glycans may impact viral entry though, much needs to be understood as discussed in the revised Discussion. In particular, it remains unknown if the reduced transduction by virus produced in the C1GalT1-KO is a direct effect of changes in O-glycans on Spike, or if this is an indirect effect due to changes in other glycoproteins in the host cell that impact viral assembly and function. These are aspects that we are currently investigating.</p><p>iii) Structural characterization of glycans produced in MGAT1 and C1GalT1 cells</p><p>As suggested by the reviewers, we have now expanded the characterization of the MGAT1 and C1GalT1-KO cell lines using a larger panel of fluorescent lectins (Figure 3—figure supplement 1). Here we observed that:</p><p>1) Many of the lectins that are considered to bind core N-glycan structures (LCA, PHA-L, PHA-E) had low binding to MGAT1-KO cells (both in the presence and absence of sialidase treatment). Their impact on the O-glycan/C1GalT1-KO cells was small.</p><p>2) Similarly, many of the lectins that recognize LacNAc structures (PCA, ECL and DSL) displayed low binding to the N-glycan-KO, both in the presence and absence of sialidase treatment.</p><p>3) Finally, O-glycan specific lectins (PNA, VVA and SBA) bound differentially to the C1GalT1/O-glycan-KO cells. The binding of these lectins to the MGAT1/N-glycan-KO cells was similar to that of wild-type cells. While we have not performed detailed glycoproteomics of virus produced in these knockout cells, these data and the Sanger sequencing results, are consistent with changes we would expect in <italic>MGAT1</italic> and <italic>C1GalT1</italic> knockout cell lines. The data are also consistent with previous CRISPR-Cas9 mutants from our laboratory (4).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) In subsection “Knocking out N-glycans on Spike abrogates viral entry” it is mentioned that the Spike pseudovirus with disrupted MGAT1 showed less Spike protein on the surface. This is an important observation that should be expanded on in the manuscript. The altered binding and entry of this variant may arise from either aberrant glycosylation and/or less Spike protein on the surface. The cell surface expression level could be impacted by the glycosylation pattern of the protein. It is important to discuss such points in the manuscript to assist the reader and to leave open the possibility that altered binding and viral entry may be a result of less functional expression of Spike on the protein surface rather than a more direct involvement of the glycans in binding or protection against furin site cleavage.</p></disp-quote><p>This comment is not very clear to us, perhaps because one word written as “protein” in the above comment, should have been “viral”? Assuming this, we note that the compounds we are testing are α-mannosidase inhibitors which function after protein folding and after processing via the calnexin/calreticulin pathway. Thus, unlike glucosidase-inhibitors that may impact viral assembly, our compounds do not alter Spike expression on virus surface/coat. We have observed this in our Western blots where protein loading is strictly based on p24 ELISA. We have also performed parallel blots with p24 and anti-Spike to confirm this assertion (data not shown).</p><p>Regardless of the above, we agree that our understanding of the impact of glycosylation on SARS-CoV-2 function is incomplete. To continue such examination, we have introduced additional mutations in Spike. In one study, we substituted the “RRAR” furin site with a single “A”, thus resulting in loss of furin based proteolysis (new Figure 5F). The resulting virus displayed robust transduction into 293T/ACE2 cells. Similar furin-independent viral entry has also been reported by others (5). However, surprisingly, we observed that kifunensine could also partially block even this viral entry. Thus, we agree that in addition to furin cleavage regulation, glycans may also have other functions. To investigate this aspect, our laboratory is currently beginning to study the impact of specific glycosylation sites on proteolysis at the Spike S1-S2 interface and also at the S2’ site. Overall, the new data have led us to revise our model (Figure 6C). To reflect this new knowledge, we have also updated portions of Introduction, Discussion and Materials and methods. The basic observation that N-glycans affect viral entry in this system still holds, as we have now repeated this more than a dozen times.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Fc was used as the fusion protein for expression of S1, RBD and ACE2 – this Fc domain would also be glycosylated in these systems – has this been taken into account? Similarly, were the O-links also expressed in this system? Figure 1B does not show whether and where glycosylation was added to the Fc-His expressed proteins.</p></disp-quote><p>Indeed, one N-glycosylation site was found in the Fc-his section. Similar to the figures by Cheng et al. discussed above, we have classified these into 4 groups in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref>.These panels describe the N-glycan distribution on the Fc glycopeptide of ACE2-Fc (at Asn815, top) and S1-Fc (at Asn757, bottom). Most of the glycans here were bi-antennary, complex type with abundant core-fucose and low levels of sialylation. The glycan structures in both fusion protein Fc sections are similar. Indeed, this mass is accounted for in our data interpretation. The presence of this glycan is also noted in the revised figure legend (see Figure 2A). We also observed one O-glycosylation site on Fc at high (~90%) occupancy. The presence of N- and O-glycans on Fc is incidental, and does not impact the findings presented in this manuscript.</p><fig id="respfig1"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Distribution of N-glycans in the Fc-section of ACE2-Fc (top, Asn815) and S1-Fc (bottom, Asn 757).</title><p>Label-free quantitative analysis helped classify glycans located at individual peptide sites into different sub-groups. This classification was based on: Group 1: relative abundance of high-mannose, hybrid, complex and unoccupied sites on the peptide backbone.; Group 2: relative abundance of fucosylated glycans containing either only core-fucose (i.e. α1,6 linked), terminal-fucose, or both core and terminal fucose. The remaining (glycol)peptide spectra did not contain fucose. Group 3: relative abundance of complex glycans in mono-, bi-, tri and tetra-antennary branched structures; Group 4: Relative abundance of terminal chains on complex glycans, that were capped by either Gal, GlcNAc or Neu5Ac (sialic acid). Each dot is from a single MS run that was either trypsin or Glu-C digested. For each site, we present: i. site of glycosylation, ii. # of PSM analyzed corresponding to this site, iii. Number of unique glycans detected at that location and iv. total number of unique glycopeptides that were analyzed at that site.

Since the furin hydrolysis sequence has been modified to be less susceptible to hydrolysis by the arginine deletions it would be expected to cause decreased hydrolysis of the Spike proteins as is described. However, Figure 4F indicates that the Spike-mutant has increased proteolysis and thus enhanced viral entry. In contrast in Figure 3 the Spike-mutant behaves the same as the wild type in terms of viral entry although it is described as having reduced proteolysis</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for this confusion. Indeed, Spike-mutant virus/protein has decreased proteolysis and increased (~6-10-fold higher) viral entry into 293T/ACE2 cells (see Figure 2F). There is no contradiction in the data, only miscommunication. We believe the problem may have risen because the previous Figure 4F was too complicated. Thus, we have taken effort to simplify this conceptual model and the new model is presented in Figure 6C. We have also rewritten a portion of the Discussion section to clarify this point. This section describes our data and also data from other laboratories that support the “inverse relation between furin cleavage and viral entry” in 293T/ACE2 cells and also other cell systems.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) As the data also described O-glycosylation of S1/ACE2 proteins, the title should reflect changes in “protein glycosylation…” rather than just N-glycosylation.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that O-glycans may also play a role in SARS-CoV-2 viral entry, although the exact mechanisms needs to be established.
