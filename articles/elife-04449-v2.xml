A cell may move alone or it may be attached to others and move as part of a group. One member of the group leads this ‘collective migration’, but it is not known how the cells are able to stick to each other and move together.</p><p>Collective migration takes place in the male gonad—the organ that makes sperm cells—in larvae of the nematode worm <italic>C. elegans</italic>. As the gonad matures, a group of cells form a simple chain that can move together. Kato et al. found that a protein called LINKIN must be present for this to happen.</p><p>LINKIN is found in the membrane that surrounds animal cells. One section of the protein—called the β-propeller—sits on the outside surface of the membrane. The structure of the β-propeller is similar to a section of another protein—called α-integrin—that also allows cells to attach, suggesting LINKIN may work in a similar way.</p><p>LINKIN is found in many animals, so Kato et al. searched for proteins that can interact with it in human cells. This search revealed three proteins that can interact with LINKIN and are required for the cells to move together. Two of the proteins control elements of the internal scaffolding of the cell: this scaffolding, which is known as the cytoskeleton, is involved in moving the cells.</p><p>The experiments suggest that LINKIN coordinates the process of binding together with the changes in the cytoskeleton that are needed to allow the cells to move as one. The next challenge is to understand how LINKIN changes the internal program of the cells to achieve this.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.04449.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.04449.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>human cell</kwd><kwd>cell migration</kwd><kwd>organogenesis</kwd><kwd>cell polarity</kwd><kwd>protein-protein interaction</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>C. elegans</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>047-101 Paul W Sternberg</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sternberg</surname><given-names>Paul W</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000900</institution-id><institution>California Institute for Regenerative Medicine</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Collin Z Yu</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yu</surname><given-names>Collin Z</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>LINKIN and three of its interactors-RUVBL1, RUVBL2, and α-tubulin-are required for cells to migrate together during organogenesis.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>In epithelial collective migration, interconnected cells migrate together in various configurations, such as sheets, branches, chains, and clusters, to produce organs of diverse shapes and possess both epithelial and mesenchymal characteristics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Montell, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Haas and Gilmour, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Ewald et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Zelenka and Arpitha, 2008</xref>). The cells develop apico-basal polarity and cell–cell adhesion as an epithelial tissue, but cells at leading edge of the group are also capable of migration. Many of the components involved in individual cell migration also affect collective cell migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Rorth, 2011</xref>), such as response to external guidance cues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Klämbt et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Haas and Gilmour, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bianco et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Pozzi and Zent, 2011</xref>) and establishment of front–back polarity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Prasad and Montell, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Janssens et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Ng et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Law et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lebreton and Casanova, 2014</xref>). Collective cell migration, however, additionally depends on the ability of cells to coordinate and follow the leader cells. Cell–cell adhesion molecules such as cadherins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cai et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Menko et al., 2014</xref>) and tissue organization through the planar cell polarity pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Muñoz-Soriano et al., 2012</xref>) impact the collective migratory ability by coordinating cytoskeleton movement. Effective collective migration therefore requires not only components promoting motility but also those that contribute to tissue integrity and coordination.</p><p>The <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> male gonad is shaped by a collective cell migration during larval development. It has a simple organization of one migratory leader cell, the linker cell (LC), that is followed by a stalk of adherent, passive follower cells that can be visualized in live animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kimble and Hirsh, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kato and Sternberg, 2009</xref>). After the migration leads the elongating gonad from its origin at the mid-body to the cloaca opening near the posterior end of the body, the gonad completes its differentiation into the mature structure. The migratory linker cell (LC) is a hybrid of mesenchymal and epithelial-like characteristics, while the follower somatic cells are epithelial-like.</p><p>The cellular organization of the migrating male gonad is similar to the migrating branches in lung, trachea, and vascular development, in which interconnected cells organize into stalks behind leader tip cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Affolter et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Eilken and Adams, 2010</xref>). As with other branching structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Ikeya and Hayashi, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Llimargas, 1999</xref>), Notch signaling is required to specify roles between leader and follower cells in the <italic>C. elegans</italic> gonad (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kimble and Hirsh, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Greenwald et al., 1983</xref>). However, unlike other systems, the role of the leader and follower is simplified, as they are not interchangeable once established (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kimble, 1981</xref>). Investigation into genes required for the migration of <italic>C. elegans</italic> gonadal leader cells has revealed similarities to other cell migrations, including their responding to netrin and Wnt guidance cues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hedgecock et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Merz et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cabello et al., 2010</xref>), binding to the extracellular matrix (ECM) through integrin receptors, and remodeling of surrounding ECM using metalloproteases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Blelloch and Kimble, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Nishiwaki et al., 2004</xref>). However, little is known about the interaction between cells to promote effective collective migration.</p><p>We have identified a new protein, LINKIN, required for maintaining tissue integrity through cell adhesion and apical polarization. LINKIN is a previously uncharacterized transmembrane protein conserved among metazoans. We identified seven atypical FG–GAP domains in LINKIN that may fold into a β-propeller domain resembling the α-integrin ligand-binding domain. We show that the <italic>C. elegans</italic> LINKIN protein, LNKN-1, is localized to membranes of interconnected cells, most pronouncedly at apical surfaces and cell–cell contacts. In particular, LNKN-1 is required for adhesion among collectively migrating gonadal cells in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, although it is also expressed in many other interconnected tissues. Taking advantage of the conservation between <italic>C. elegans</italic> and human LINKIN, we performed SILAC based mass spectrometry on a human cell line and functional testing in <italic>C. elegans</italic> to identify potential interactors of LINKIN. Members of the highly conserved AAA+ ATPase family, RUVBL1 and RUVBL2, and the cytoskeletal protein α-tubulin physically interacted with LINKIN and were required for collective gonadal migration. Our data support a function for LINKIN as an adhesion molecule that uses its extracellular domain to bind molecules on the surface of neighboring cells and its intracellular domain to regulate microtubule dynamics.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Characterizing the collective cell migration of the <italic>C. elegans</italic> male gonad</title><p>The developing male gonad is a collective cell migration consisting of a chain of passively migrating somatic and germ cells led by a migratory somatic cell, the linker cell (LC) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–C</xref>). After migration, the interconnected somatic cells behind the LC differentiate during the transition from the fourth larval (L4) stage to the adult into a mature gonad structure, a tube comprising the vas deferens and seminal vesicle. Behind the somatic gonad are the proliferating germ cells, arranged from the newest in the distal region to the most developed closest to the somatic gonad. Capping the distal end of the gonad are the two male distal tip cells, which maintain the mitotic germ cells. To form this gonad shape during the L2 through L4 stages of the larval development, the LC leads the elongating gonad from the mid-body region to the cloaca opening in the posterior body, where it dies after completing the migration. During the L3 stage of the migration, the somatic cells of the vas deferens and seminal vesicle precursors divide from seven to 53 cells to form the elongating gonad. The developing somatic gonad has epithelial-like characteristics consisting of strong intercellular connections and a developing apical domain running down the core of the gonad (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). The somatic cells have a radial symmetry around this core, and as they proliferate, the daughter cells are incorporated into the chain while maintaining this configuration.<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.04449.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>The collective migration of the male gonad in wild-type animals and its disruption in <italic>lnkn-1</italic> mutants.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Intact wild-type male gonad shape is generated by the collective migration of somatic and germ cells. The migration of the leader cell, the linker cell (LC; green), pulls the interconnected follower cells. The somatic gonad consists of the LC, the vas deferens precursors (yellow), the seminal vesicle precursors (blue), and the distal tip cells (orange). The germ cells (purple) follow behind most of the somatic gonad. At the beginning of its migration in the early L2 stage, the gonad is a small cluster of cells in the ventral mid-body of the animal (top left panel). As the LC migration defines the shape of the mature gonad, the gonad expands through the proliferation of the interconnected follower cells (bottom left panel). Longitudinal and transverse sections of the vas deferens precursor cells reveal the apical domain (red) running through the somatic gonad core (right panels).

By ablating the LC (15/15), we confirmed the findings of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kimble (1981)</xref> that the LC is necessary for migration and is not replaced by a follower cell taking on its migratory role. Without the LC, the gonad stopped elongating but continued to balloon through cell proliferation. The LC, however, was capable of migrating alone if the somatic cells around it were ablated in the L3 stage (8/10). In this case, the LC alone migrated along its normal course while the gonad stopped elongating at the point of LC detachment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Since LC migration was slower than normal, the LC often did not complete its migration by the L4-to-adult transition. The cause of the slower migration may be due to the missing contribution of gonadal cells or other factors such as drag from scarred tissue. The germ cells add to gonadal mass but are not necessary for migration, as the LC reaches the cloaca even when germ cell precursors are ablated.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>LNKN-1 is required for gonadal cells to migrate collectively</title><p>We discovered the <italic>lnkn-1</italic> mutant during a process of identifying new genes involved in LC migration by utilizing a database of expression patterns reported by the Genome BC <italic>C. elegans</italic> Gene Expression Consortium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hunt Newberry et al., 2007</xref>). Since the consortium only reports hermaphrodite expression patterns, we searched their database for genes expressed in the migratory leader cells for the hermaphrodite gonad, the distal tip cells (DTCs), which functionally are the closest cells to the male LC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kimble and Hirsh, 1979</xref>). We reasoned that the gonadal leader cells of both sexes may use partially overlapping genes for their migrations. One of the genes reported to be expressed in the hermaphrodite DTCs was <italic>ZK637.3</italic> (WBGene00014023), a conserved gene of unknown function that had an available deletion mutant, <italic>gk367</italic>. After obtaining this mutant and observing unusual male gonad defects, we decided to investigate this gene further. We have renamed this gene from <italic>tag-256</italic> (<italic>temporarily assigned gene-256</italic>, <italic>ZK637.3</italic>) to <italic>lnkn-1</italic> (<italic>LiNKiNg-1</italic>).</p><p>In males homozygous for <italic>lnkn-1(gk367)</italic>, gonadal cells near the LC became detached during gonad migration (n = 29/30) such that the LC continued to migrate, either alone or with a few remaining follower cells, but the rest of the gonad did not follow. This detachment resulted in a partially elongated gonad and, further ahead along the normal path, a detached LC alone or with a few adherent follower cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E,F</xref>). This phenotype is similar to that of the gonad with ablated follower cells behind the LC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). The position of detachment was variable but usually occurred within a few cell lengths behind the LC, suggesting that the pulling force generated by the LC may have caused detachment. Although the LC continued to migrate along its normal course after detachment and occasionally completed the migration, the male was sterile since the gonad did not connect to the cloaca opening. In <italic>lnkn-1(gk367)</italic> mutant hermaphrodites, the gonadal leader DTCs remained connected but migrated a shorter distance than the wild type and their shape appeared elongated and strained. The mutant also recessively caused maternal effect lethality (n = 30/30). The male gonad phenotype in <italic>lnkn-1(gk367)</italic> mutants suggested that <italic>lnkn-1</italic> is required for cell–cell interaction rather than LC migration.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>LINKIN is a conserved transmembrane protein</title><p>LNKN-1 was a conserved, poorly characterized protein predicted to be a type I single-pass transmembrane protein of 599 amino acids (AA), consisting of a 19 AA signal sequence, 533 AA extracellular domain, 23 AA transmembrane domain, and 24 AA intracellular domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>).

The FG–GAP is a domain that occurs in seven copies in α-integrins and folds into a seven-bladed β-propeller structure that serves as its ligand-binding domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Springer, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Xiong et al., 2002</xref>). We have identified seven atypical FG–GAP domains in the N-terminal of the extracellular domain, based on sequence similarities to the annotated LINKIN FG–GAP domains from <italic>H. sapiens</italic> and <italic>M. musculus</italic> and to α-integrin FG–GAP domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, ‘Materials and methods’). FG–GAP domains have a loosely conserved Phe-Gly and Gly-Ala-Pro sequence, which are separated by sequence that can include a calcium-binding motif. A comparison of all human α-integrin FG–GAP domains showed that their calcium-binding motif has a strong DxxxDxxxD signature (D = Asp, x = AA; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chouhan et al., 2011</xref>). We found a strong DxxxDxxxD signature in all seven calcium-binding domains of LINKIN, suggesting that these are similar to FG–GAP domains of α-integrins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). The significance of finding seven FG–GAP domains in the N-terminal of LINKIN is the possibility that LINKIN, like α-integrins, uses a seven-bladed β-propeller structure to bind ligand. We also identified a highly conserved extracellular region adjacent to the transmembrane domain, which is a yet unrecognized protein domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). LINKIN has a dozen predicted N-linked glycosylation sites (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://uniprot.org">uniprot.org</ext-link>). Taken together, our investigation shows that LINKIN is a conserved transmembrane glycoprotein pre-dating Metazoa and potentially containing a seven-bladed, β-propeller, ligand-binding domain.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>LNKN-1 is expressed in the apical and lateral membrane of tissues</title><p>We examined the expression pattern and subcellular localization of LNKN-1 in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, particularly in the male gonad.

Immunofluorescence staining was performed on dissected gonads and intestines, which greatly improves antibody penetration over whole animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A–D</xref>). Staining of other dissected parts of the worm confirmed expression in the pharynx, excretory canal, and seam cells, indicating that the tissue expression pattern of LNKN-1::YFP is accurate. However, there was an important difference in subcellular localization between the native and YFP-tagged proteins: the antibodies showed stronger localization of LNKN-1 to the apical and lateral domain of the gonad (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A,B</xref>) and intestine, while YFP-tagged LNKN-1 is uniformly distributed in the plasma membrane. While both antibodies show heavier localization to the apical and lateral plasma membrane, the extracellular domain antibody shows additional staining in large cytoplasmic puncta (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>), and the intracellular domain antibody shows nuclear staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1G</xref>). In <italic>lnkn-1</italic> mutants and <italic>lnkn-1</italic> RNAi-treated animals, we do not see plasma membrane staining with antibodies against either the extracellular or intracellular domain, but we do see non-specific staining in the cytoplasm and nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). This indicates that the membrane staining is due to LNKN-1 localization, but the cytoplasmic and nuclear stainings are due to non-specific binding of other proteins. The antibodies also stain the plasma membrane in the germ cells, where YFP expression could not be determined because germ cells do not readily express transgenes. The two antibodies reveal the true localization of native LNKN-1 to be in the plasma membrane with a preference for apical and lateral domains.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Characterization of the <italic>lnkn-1(gk367)</italic> deletion</title><p>Since this was the first reported use of the <italic>lnkn-1(gk367)</italic> deletion allele, we characterized it molecularly.

LINKIN is an apically and laterally enriched transmembrane protein that is expressed on the surface of interconnected cells in the <italic>C. elegans</italic> male gonad. Without this protein there are cell–cell adhesion defects during the collective migration of the male gonad. In the extracellular domain, we identified seven atypical FG–GAP domains that likely fold into a β-propeller structure, which is similar to the ligand-binding domain of α-integrins. We have also identified three intracellular interactors of LINKIN—RUVBL1, RUVBL2, and α-tubulin. β-tubulin may also be an interactor based on mass spectrometry identification, <italic>C. elegans</italic> gonadal adhesion function, and known interaction to α-tubulin, but we were unable to confirm β-tubulin interaction by immunoprecipitation/Western blot analysis. We propose that LINKIN interacts with the microtubule cytoskeleton, and this interaction is modulated by RUVBL1 and RUVBL2 AAA+ ATPases.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>LINKIN protein family is conserved in Metazoa</title><p>We have demonstrated that LINKIN is a unique transmembrane glycoprotein that functions as an adhesion molecule. This approximately 600 AA protein has a large extracellular domain of approximately 530 AA and a short 22 AA intracellular domain. We found a number of notable features about LINKIN. First, it is a protein pre-dating metazoans. Second, the size of the protein and organization of the domains have not changed during its evolution. The seven atypical FG–GAP domains, the extracellular region proximal to the transmembrane domain, and the intracellular sequence are all conserved. The identical sequence at the C-terminal of LINKIN suggested that some of its intracellular interactors may also be conserved proteins. In fact, LINKIN interactors, RUVBL1, RUVBL2, and α-tubulin are all highly conserved proteins that likely pre-date LINKIN. Third, among the genomes we searched, including those of <italic>H. sapiens</italic>, <italic>M. musculus</italic>, <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>, <italic>C. elegans</italic>, and <italic>T. adhaerens</italic>, LINKIN has no paralog. Even the highly conserved short 22 AA intracellular domain is not found in other proteins. The lack of paralogs is surprising considering that other highly conserved adhesion molecules like integrins and cadherins have numerous paralogs and have expanded into superfamilies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Angst et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Takada et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>The presence of seven atypical FG–GAP domains in the extracellular domain suggests that LINKIN might fold into a seven-bladed β-propeller. The significance of this prediction is that this structure resembles the ligand-binding domain of the adhesion molecule α-integrin. As with α-integrins, the β-propeller structure for LINKIN is located towards the amino-terminal of the extracellular domain. LINKIN is expressed on the surface of each adherent cell and might use the β-propeller domain to bind ligands on a neighboring cell to promote adhesion.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>LNKN-1 localizes to apical and lateral plasma membrane and functions in cell adhesion</title><p>The <italic>C. elegans</italic> gonad shape develops through a collective migration of epithelial-like cells lead by the LC. One of the striking phenotypes of the <italic>lnkn-1</italic> mutant was cell detachment in the migrating gonad. In <italic>lnkn-1</italic> mutants, gonadal cell dissociation occurs in the L3 stage. At this stage, although the adhesions are strong enough that these cells cannot be mechanically dissociated without lysing, they have not yet formed mature adherens junctions. The expression of adhesion junction markers, AJM (apical junction molecule)-1::GFP, and gap junction marker, INX(innexin)-5::GFP, was absent in the L3 stage, when gonad cells begin detaching in <italic>lnkn-1</italic> mutants; their expression only begins in the L4 stage and grows stronger in the fully differentiated adult gonad. The role of adhesion molecules, such as LINKIN, may therefore be more important before other, possibly stronger, adhesions are formed. The gonad detachment defect of <italic>lnkn-1</italic> mutants likely results from the combined effects of the absence of a functional LINKIN adhesion molecule, the lack of other permanent adhesion structures in the L3 stage, and the force generated by the migrating LC.</p><p>LNKN-1 was present in many <italic>C. elegans</italic> tissues that possess apical/basal polarity, including the intestine, excretory canal, vulva, hook cells, and gonad; its localization was stronger on the apical and lateral sides for the tissues examined. YFP-tagged to either the extracellular or intracellular domain of LNKN-1 changes its localization from apical- and lateral-biased to uniform plasma membrane localization, indicating that apical localization is an active process requiring the function of both extracellular and intracellular domains of the protein. YFP-tagging also disrupts the function of LINKIN, as neither YFP-tagged LINKN-1 construct rescued the mutant phenotype, suggesting that apical localization may be necessary for LNKN-1 function. Known adhesion molecules have preferential localization at the plasma membrane. Integrins are often enriched in the basal domain since they bind extracellular matrix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Schoenenberger et al., 1994</xref>), while cadherins are enriched in lateral domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Halbleib and Nelson, 2006</xref>).

Considering that the interactions between LINKIN, RUVBL1, RUVBL2, and α-tubulin were identified using a human cell line and were also required for gonad cell adhesion in a nematode worm, these interactions may have a conserved molecular function in Metazoa including human. We are proposing that LINKIN functions in maintaining tissue integrity through cell–cell adhesion and apically polarization, but further studies are necessary to show the generality of this function and to elucidate differences between the roles of LINKIN and other adhesion receptors.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Worm strains</title><p><italic>C. elegans</italic> strains were cultured at room temperature using standard protocols unless indicated otherwise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5a">Brenner, 1974</xref>).

Your article has been evaluated by Janet Rossant (Senior editor) and 2 reviewers.</p><p>The reviewers and the editor had an extensive discussion on this paper. All of us were intrigued by the identification of LINKIN as a member of new class of potentially conserved adhesion proteins. It was also agreed the work demonstrating a role for LINKIN in migration in <italic>C. elegans</italic> was convincing. However major flaws were identified in your molecular evidence for the LINKIN-RuvB complex and in your interpretation of the immunolocalization of the different components. If you wish to claim that this complex is important, more direct in vivo evidence (beyond IP/MS) is required for the complex proposed: both reviews point out weaknesses in this part of the paper.</p><p>In addition, we felt that you had drastically over-interpreted the functional significance of the phylogenetic distribution of LINKIN proteins. This part of the paper would need to be rewritten in a more cautious manner.</p><p>Although these are serious concerns, the novelty of the findings is attractive and we would encourage you to try to address the concerns raised in a careful revision of the paper and we will be happy to reconsider a revised version. The reviewers' comments are below for your responses.</p><p><italic>Reviewer</italic> #<italic>1</italic></p><p>The authors argue that LINKIN physically interacts with RUBVL1, RUVBL2, and alpha tubulin, based on mass spectrometry data and co-immunopreciation from a myc tagged LINKIN protein.
