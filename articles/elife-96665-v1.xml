tasks, such as planar reaching movements. This limitation prevents the study of how the motor system achieves adaptation by altering the movement patterns of our redundant body. To address this issue, we developed a redundant motor task in which participants reached for targets with the tip of a virtual stick held with both hands. Despite the redundancy of the task, participants consistently employed a stereotypical strategy of flexibly changing the tilt angle of the stick depending on the direction of tip movement. Thus, this baseline relationship between tip-movement direction and stick-tilt angle constrained both the physical and visual movement patterns of the redundant system. Our task allowed us to systematically investigate how the motor system implicitly changed both the tip-movement direction and the stick-tilt angle in response to imposed visual perturbations. Both types of perturbations, whether directly affecting the task (tip-movement direction) or not (stick-tilt angle around the tip), drove adaptation, and the patterns of implicit adaptation were guided by the baseline relationship. Consequently, tip-movement adaptation was associated with changes in stick-tilt angle, and intriguingly, even seemingly ignorable stick-tilt perturbations significantly influenced tip-movement adaptation, leading to tip-movement direction errors. These findings provide a new understanding that the baseline relationship plays a crucial role not only in how the motor system controls movement of the redundant system, but also in how it implicitly adapts to modify movement patterns.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>reaching movement</kwd><kwd>redundancy</kwd><kwd>bimanual movement</kwd><kwd>motor learning</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>20J13734</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kobayashi</surname><given-names>Toshiki</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>23K10739</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kobayashi</surname><given-names>Toshiki</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>17H00874</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Nozaki</surname><given-names>Daichi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>21H04860</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Nozaki</surname><given-names>Daichi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A novel motor task reveals the principle of how the motor system coordinates the redundant body for motor adaptation.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>If a movement error occurs while reaching a target, the motor system automatically and implicitly updates the motor command for the next movement to reduce the error. This remarkable motor learning ability contributes not only to maintaining accurate movements in the presence of noise but also to flexibly adapting the movement to new environments. In the standard planar arm-reaching task, which has been widely used to study the mechanisms of motor learning, participants manipulate a visual cursor with their hands primarily by moving their shoulder and elbow joints (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Flash and Hogan, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gordon et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). The arm-reaching task has contributed to uncovering many important properties of motor adaptation when a novel environment is introduced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Shadmehr and Mussa-Ivaldi, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Thoroughman and Shadmehr, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Mazzoni and Krakauer, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Taylor and Ivry, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Takiyama et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hayashi et al., 2016</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Kinematic redundancy and adaptation patterns.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) In the ordinary planar arm-reaching task which primarily uses elbow and shoulder joints, there is no redundancy between the task goal (<italic>x</italic><sub>c</sub>, <italic>y</italic><sub>c</sub>) and the joint angles (<italic>θ</italic><sub>1</sub>, <italic>θ</italic><sub>2</sub>). (<bold>b</bold>) The movement pattern at each target is determined by the joint angles. (<bold>c</bold>) The adaptation patterns to a visual rotation are also determined.

(<bold>e, f</bold>) In the case of planar reaching movement by a hypothetical limb with three joints (<italic>θ</italic><sub>1</sub>, <italic>θ</italic><sub>2</sub>, <italic>θ</italic><sub>3</sub>), the cursor can reach the target in a large number of patterns. (<bold>g</bold>) Given that the motor system solves the task redundancy by optimization, we should observe a stereotypical pattern of joint angles according to the targets. (<bold>h, i</bold>) The question is whether, when a visual rotation is imposed on the cursor (end-effector relevant perturbation), the motor system adopts the same joint movement pattern as when voluntarily aiming in the adapted direction (<italic>left</italic>) or a new joint movement pattern (<italic>right</italic>).

Alternatively, the joint angles may be corrected (<italic>right</italic>).</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-96665-fig1-v1.tif"/></fig><p>Notably, there is no redundancy between hand position and joint angles in such a planar arm-reaching task. The joint angles are primarily determined by the target to be reached (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>). Because of this non-redundancy, when the motor system adapts the reaching movement to the visual rotation imposed on the cursor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>, left), the adapted pattern of joint angles is also determined (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>, right). Naturally, the adapted pattern of joint angles should be identical to the pattern when reaching in the adapted direction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>). However, our body systems for performing practical motor tasks generally have more degrees of freedom than necessary to accomplish the tasks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bernstein et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Singh et al., 2016</xref>). For example, in the golf swing, there are countless patterns of whole-body configurations to achieve identical clubhead positions at ball contact.</p><p>The problem arising from such a redundant structure can be illustrated by considering the reaching movement of a hypothetical limb with three joints (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1e</xref>). In this case, there are a large number of possible joint angle patterns for the same hand position (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1f</xref>). However, given that the motor system solves task redundancy by minimizing motor cost (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Collins, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">O’Sullivan et al., 2009</xref>) or movement error (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">White and Diedrichsen, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Zhang et al., 2018</xref>), we should observe a stereotypical pattern of joint angles according to the targets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1g</xref>). The problem is how the motor system changes the direction of cursor movement to implicitly adapt to the visual rotation imposed on the cursor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1h</xref>). Are the joint angles after adaptation identical to those observed when aiming in the same adapted direction before adaptation? (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1i</xref>, left). Alternatively, does the motor system adopt a new joint movement pattern? (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1i</xref>, right). It has not been thoroughly investigated how the motor system coordinates to change the redundant body system to implicitly adapt to the perturbation to the cursor representing the position of the end-effector.</p><p>Redundancy poses another type of problem for implicit movement adaptation. If the joint angles are perturbed while the hand position remains unchanged (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1j</xref>), how does the motor system respond to the perturbation? The motor system may simply ignore the perturbation because it does not affect the cursor position (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1k</xref>, left). Alternatively, the motor system may attempt to correct the joint movements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1k</xref>, right). Conventionally, this type of problem has been investigated in the context of how the motor system responds to the movement variability that affects or does not affect task performance (i.e. task-relevant or task-irrelevant variability). Previous studies have consistently shown that the motor system actively corrects for task-relevant variability while allowing task-irrelevant variability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Mosier et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Latash, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">van Beers et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Sternad, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Scholz and Schöner, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Scholz et al., 2003</xref>). Optimal feedback control theory suggests that the strategies based on such a ‘minimal intervention principle’ are optimal in terms of achieving task goals (e.g. movement accuracy; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Todorov and Jordan, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Todorov, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Scott, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Diedrichsen, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Valero-Cuevas et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Ronsse et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Sternad et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Selgrade and Chang, 2015</xref>). These studies demonstrated that the motor system does not intervene movement change or variability as long as the task goal is achieved. Thus, the motor system should ignore the perturbations to joint angles that do not affect the task goal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1k</xref>, left). However, these studies did not directly test whether the redundant body movement pattern is also unchanged when the end-effector movement remains unchanged.</p><p>Conversely, it has also been reported that the motor system adapts to change the movement in response to the task-irrelevant perturbation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Wolpert et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Flanagan and Rao, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Morehead et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Diedrichsen et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Schaefer et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Franklin et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Kim et al., 2019</xref>). For example, when the cursor trajectory was curved only in the middle of the reaching movement, the hand movement was adaptively modified even though the perturbation did not cause a reaching error at the target (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Wolpert et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Flanagan and Rao, 1995</xref>). It should be noted that these previous studies created the task-irrelevant condition by applying the perturbation to the end-effector. In contrast, the present study focuses on how the motor system responds to the perturbation of the redundant body while the end-effector remains unaffected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1i</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1k</xref>). In light of this, in this study, we use the terms ‘end-effector relevant perturbation’ (e.g. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1h</xref>) and ‘end-effector irrelevant perturbation’ (e.g. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1j</xref>) when appropriate, instead of the more commonly used terms ‘task-relevant perturbation’ and ‘task-irrelevant perturbation’. The current study aims to develop a novel task that creates end-effector relevant and end-effector irrelevant perturbations.</p><p>To investigate the problem of how the motor system adapts the redundant body system to these perturbations, this study introduces a novel bimanual stick manipulation task specifically designed to address this issue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>). Participants manipulated a virtual stick held with both hands to reach visual targets by the tip of the stick. Redundancy in the task is achieved by acknowledging that the same tip position can be achieved with different stick angles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>). Importantly, this task allowed us to visually perturb the tip position (i.e. end-effector relevant perturbation) and the stick angle (i.e. end-effector irrelevant perturbation) either separately or simultaneously. Using this approach, we can directly investigate how the motor system makes use of the redundant body system when adapting to these two types of perturbations.</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Bimanual stick manipulation task.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Participants held handles of a manipulandum with both hands and moved the right tip of a virtual stick on the monitor.

They were asked to manipulate a virtual stick with both hands (length = 40 cm; distance between hands = 15 cm) to move the right tip of the stick towards the targets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>). This task is redundant because the same target can be reached in countless movement patterns. The participants could move both hands in parallel without tilting the stick (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>, top). Alternatively, they could perform the task by tilting the stick (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>, bottom). During the first part of the task (baseline phase: 360 trials) in all the experiments (Experiments 1–3), the participants moved the tip from a starting point to a target (movement distance = 10 cm) that appeared in one of nine directions (0°: horizontal direction,±10°,±20°,±30°, and ±40°; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref>).</p><p>The trajectories of the tip and both hands appeared to be almost straight, but both hands were not moved in parallel, except when aiming at the 0° target (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d</xref>, top).

The time-course changes in the stick-tilt angle relative to the initial horizontal tilt angle showed that the participants moved the tip while slightly tilting the stick, except when aiming at the 0° target (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2e</xref>).

Although each participant could have performed the task differently (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>), all participants showed stereotypical movement patterns: The stick-tilt angle was significantly modulated by the tip-movement direction (<italic>t</italic>-test compared with 0°, |<italic>t</italic>(71)|&gt;5.5, Bonferroni corrected p&lt;0.01; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>, inset). This monotonically increasing curve, which will be referred to as the ‘baseline TMD–STA relationship’, reflects a constraint between the direction of tip movement and the angle of stick tilt. The relationship showed that clockwise (CW) tip movement direction was accompanied by CW stick-tilt, and counterclockwise (CCW) tip-movement direction was accompanied by CCW stick-tilt. This constraint of movement patterns was likely created by minimizing the movement distance of the hands. If both hands are moved in parallel, the total distance between the initial and final positions of the hands should be 20 cm (10 cm for each) regardless of the targets; however, the experimentally observed distance was reduced by tilting the stick (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>).

Thus, this perturbation produced a positional dissociation between vision (i.e. the stick) and proprioception (i.e. the hands). The amount of tip directional rotation was gradually increased by 1° per a trial up to 30° so that the participants did not notice the presence of perturbation.</p><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Experiment 1: End-effector relevant visual perturbations.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) During the adaptation phase of Experiment 1, the tip-movement direction was rotated by 30° around the starting point (tip perturbation).

On a plane representing visual movement patterns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b</xref>, left), the visual perturbation to the tip can be expressed as a shift of the state along the x-axis. The error of the tip-movement direction in the visual space needs to be compensated by changing the movement of both hands.

Alternatively, they might adapt by changing the stick tilt as if they were aiming at a –30° target (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4c</xref>, bottom).

Experiment 2 (N=20) was designed to directly test this possibility by imposing a stick-tilt perturbation around the right tip (i.e., end-effector irrelevant perturbation) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6a</xref>). As the tip moved from the starting point, the stick started to tilt around the tip up to ±6° when the tip reached the target (the tilt amount was proportional to the tip’s distance from the starting point). The ±6° tilt perturbation was chosen according to the stick tilt at the movement offset when reaching the ±30° target for the baseline phase (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>). Ten participants participated in the CCW stick-tilt perturbation condition (E2CCW group: 6°), and the remaining ten participants took part in the CW stick-tilt perturbation condition (E2CW group: –6°). Because the amount was small, the participants did not notice the presence of perturbation throughout the experiment. Since this perturbation changed only the stick-tilt angle, it is expressed as a state shift along the y-axis on the visual plane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6b</xref>). According to the minimal intervention principle, the motor system does not need to change anything because the stick-tilt perturbation does not affect the tip position (i.e. the task goal; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6c</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6d</xref>, pattern i). However, if the motor system is actively compensating for the stick-tilt perturbation, it should change the stick-tilt angle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6c</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6d</xref>, pattern ii).</p><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Experiment 2: End-effector irrelevant visual perturbations.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) During the adaptation phase of Experiment 2, the stick-tilt angle was rotated around the tip.

Specifically, the CCW tip perturbation was combined with the CCW stick-tilt perturbation (E3CCW group: N=10) or with the CW stick-tilt perturbation (E3CW group: N=10). These visual perturbation patterns can be expressed as state shifts in the visual plane (green and orange arrows for E3CCW and E3CW groups, respectively, in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8b</xref>).

The second problem is how the motor system coordinates to modify redundant body movements when implicitly adapting to the perturbation imposed on the end-effector (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1i</xref>). The third problem is how the motor system responds to the perturbation to the redundant dimension that does not directly affect the end-effector (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1k</xref>). These two types of perturbations have been conventionally referred to as ‘task-relevant’ and ‘task-irrelevant’ perturbations. However, it should be noted that previous studies investigating the effect of task-irrelevant perturbations have applied perturbations to the end-effector (e.g. cursor) without affecting task performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Wolpert et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Flanagan and Rao, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Diedrichsen et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Schaefer et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Franklin et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Kim et al., 2019</xref>). In contrast, the present study focused on investigating the effect of perturbations on the redundant body while leaving the end-effector unaffected (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1k</xref>). To clearly emphasize these differences, we specifically used the terms ‘end-effector relevant perturbation’ and ‘end-effector irrelevant perturbation’.</p><p>To investigate these issues, we designed a novel stick manipulation reaching task. This redundant motor task enables the investigation of adaptation patterns in the redundant system following the introduction of perturbations that are either end-effector relevant, end-effector irrelevant, or both. Because our experiments were conducted with a specific configuration (stick length, hand distance, target location etc), we must be cautious about the generalizability of the results to other configurations, but we obtained the following four main results. First, we showed that participants adopted a stereotyped strategy to reach the target with the stick tip, and that the movement pattern (stick tip movement and stick tilt angle) was constrained by a baseline TMD–STA relationship. Second, when only end-effector relevant perturbations were imposed on the tip, the motor system attempted to modify the physical movement patterns along the baseline TMD–STA relationship to achieve the task goal (Experiment 1). Third, even when perturbations were applied only to the end-effector irrelevant dimension (i.e. the stick-tilt angle), the motor system still adapted to the end-effector irrelevant perturbation and this adaptation was accompanied by an end-effector relevant error (Experiment 2). Finally, when both types of perturbations were imposed simultaneously, the adaptation processes were influenced depending on the combination of perturbations (Experiment 3).</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Kinematic relationship between end-effector relevant and end-effector irrelevant dimensions</title><p>In our stick manipulation task, participants were asked to reach the tip of the stick to the targets. Participants can achieve the reaching task in different ways. For example, they can use a simple strategy by moving both hands in the same direction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>, top) or a more complicated strategy by tilting the stick (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>, bottom). Nevertheless, they showed stereotypical patterns of moving the stick tip by tilting the stick from the beginning of the task (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2f</xref>): Reaching the CW (or CCW) targets was accompanied by the CW (or CCW) stick tilt (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>). Such stereotypical movement patterns have been reported for the movements of the joints in the redundant three-dimensional reaching movements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Lacquaniti and Soechting, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Proietti et al., 2017</xref>). Notably, compared with the case where both hands moved in parallel, the movement distances of both hands to perform the task were significantly reduced to a near-optimal level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c</xref>), which contributed to the reduction of work required (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Collins, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">O’Sullivan et al., 2009</xref>). As a result of this optimization process, tip-movement and stick-tilt were associated with each other by the baseline TMD–STA relationship (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>). Physically, this relationship constrains how the motor system should move the stick. Visually, it tells the motor system how the stick movement should be seen.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>The strength of the task to investigate the motor adaptation in redundant system</title><p>Our task has several advantages. First, the task has created redundancy in a natural way. Manipulating a stick with both hands is relatively common in everyday life (using a broom, golf or bat swing etc.). This familiarity with the task was reflected in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2f</xref> which shows that all participants started tilting the stick to reach the tip toward the targets from the beginning of the experiment. This characteristic is ideal for investigating how this inherent movement pattern influences motor adaptation. Second, this task allows us to investigate how the perturbation to the tip-movement direction leads to a change in both the tip-movement direction itself and the stick-tilt angle. It has not been investigated how the motor system implicitly achieves adaptation to the end-effector perturbation (i.e. the end-effector relevant perturbation) by changing the movement patterns of the redundant body system. Third, this task can create a novel condition in which the perturbations are imposed on the redundant system while the tip position remains unchanged (i.e. the end-effector irrelevant perturbation). No previous studies have investigated how the motor system implicitly responds to such a perturbation by altering (or not altering) the movement of the redundant body system.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Adaptation to end-effector relevant perturbation</title><p>When the end-effector relevant perturbation was implicitly imposed to the tip-movement direction (visual rotation by 30° CCW), the participants adapted to change the tip-movement direction in the opposite CW direction (Experiment 1), as reported in many previous studies using an ordinary reaching movement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Cunningham, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Krakauer et al., 2000</xref>). Importantly, our task helped to investigate how such motor adaptations in the end-effector relevant dimension (tip-movement direction) are accompanied by the movement pattern changes in the end-effector irrelevant dimension (stick-tilt angle). Participants implicitly corrected the tip-movement direction by changing the stick tilt as if they were voluntarily aiming at the –30° target. This adaptation can be visualized as a state shift along the baseline TMD–STA relationship in the physical plane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5b</xref>). The baseline TMD–STA relationship originally contributes to dictate how the motor system voluntarily moves the stick. It is likely that the motor system also uses this relationship as a scaffold to implicitly guide how to correct the tip-movement direction. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hayashi et al., 2016</xref> have demonstrated that the adaptation of the standard reaching movement to a visual perturbation was significantly influenced by the baseline relationship between the movement and target directions (i.e. a visuomotor map). After distorting the visuomotor map so that the movement direction was more (or less) sensitively modulated by the target direction, the movement adaptation was enhanced (or reduced). The present finding that the baseline movement pattern is used for the implicit adaptation is consistent with this previous finding.</p><p>Notably, this adaptation pattern changed the visual feedback of the stick tilt. When reaching the 0° target in the baseline condition, the stick-tilt angle was almost 0° (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>). However, after adaptation, the amount of stick-tilt was equivalent to that when aiming at the –30° target (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5b</xref>). Thus, the visually observed stick-tilt after adaptation was different from that observed in the baseline condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a</xref>). Nevertheless, the adapted physical movement pattern persisted to follow the baseline TMD–STA relationship, suggesting that the motor system mainly paid attention to end-effector relevant tip-movement and ignored end-effector irrelevant stick-tilt angle. This adaptation pattern seems to be consistent with the minimal intervention principle.</p><p>However, a slight difference in the adaptation patterns between Experiment 1 A and Experiment 1B implies a violation of the minimal intervention principle. In Experiment 1 A, in which a 30° visual rotation was implicitly introduced by gradually increasing its amplitude, the final adapted tip-movement direction was slightly but significantly different from that when voluntarily aiming at the adapted direction (i.e. –30° target; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5b</xref>). In contrast, such a residual difference was not observed in Experiment 1B, where participants could use an explicit aiming strategy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>). Visuomotor adaptation is often incomplete even after sufficient training, and residual errors are observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Krakauer et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Ethier et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Malone et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Vaswani et al., 2015</xref>). Although the presence of residual errors has been attributed to the imbalance between learning and forgetting, a recent study demonstrated that only the implicit learning system is responsible for producing residual errors by modulating error sensitivity with the consistency of errors in previous trials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Albert et al., 2021</xref>). We speculate that an alternative mechanism is involved in the generation of a residual difference in Experiment 1 A. If the motor system does not ignore the abnormal stick-tilt but attempts to correct it, and this correction pattern is physically constrained by the baseline TMD–STA relationship, the stick-tilt correction should accompany the de-adaptation of the tip-movement direction and lead to the generation of a residual error. As discussed below, the results of Experiment 2 and Experiment 3 support this idea.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Adaptation to end-effector irrelevant perturbation</title><p>Our task can create a novel end-effector irrelevant stick-tilt perturbation and allows us to study how the motor system responds to it. According to the minimal intervention principle, the motor system should ignore stick-tilt perturbations because they do not influence task goal achievement (i.e. so called ‘task-irrelevant’ perturbation). However, inconsistent with this idea, Experiment 2 clearly demonstrated that the motor system responded to the stick-tilt perturbations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7b</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7c</xref>). This result indicates that the motor system predicts the visual feedback of an end-effector irrelevant stick-tilt angle when performing the task and tries to eliminate the dissociation between the observed and predicted stick-tilt angle (i.e. sensory prediction error). This idea was corroborated by the fact that participants who demonstrated a shallower TMD–STA relationship during the baseline phase showed a greater amount of stick-tilt correction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7e</xref>). The ±6° stick-tilt perturbation should cause the larger prediction error for these participants.</p><p>One might consider that previous studies have already shown that the motor system responds to the task-irrelevant perturbations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Wolpert et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Flanagan and Rao, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Diedrichsen et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Schaefer et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Franklin et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Kim et al., 2019</xref>). However, the task-irrelevant conditions implemented in these previous studies are quite different from the end-effector irrelevant condition in our study. These studies created the task-irrelevant condition by combining the perturbation of visual cursors with the manipulation of movement trajectory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Wolpert et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Flanagan and Rao, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Morehead et al., 2017</xref>), target/cursor shape (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Diedrichsen et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Schaefer et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Kim et al., 2019</xref>), or applying the simultaneous equal perturbations to the target and cursor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Franklin et al., 2016</xref>). Therefore, these perturbations are not ‘end-effector irrelevant’. Exceptionally, in several previous studies, an end-effector irrelevant perturbation was implemented in a bimanual postural task to investigate postural reflex activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Dimitriou et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Omrani et al., 2013</xref>). However, to our knowledge, such an end-effector irrelevant perturbation has never been used to investigate the motor adaptation pattern in a redundant system. Furthermore, as discussed in the next section, our task design revealed a novel aspect of motor adaptation to the end-effector irrelevant perturbation.</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Adaptation to end-effector irrelevant perturbation influences end-effector relevant performance</title><p>Unexpectedly, Experiment 2 shows that adaptation to the end-effector irrelevant stick-tilt perturbation was accompanied by an increase in the end-effector relevant tip-movement direction error (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7c</xref>). This counterintuitive result can be explained by the constraint of the adaptation pattern along the baseline TMD–STA relationship (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>). According to this constraint, CCW (or CW) stick-tilt adaptation should change the tip-movement direction in the CCW (or CW) direction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7c</xref>). The influence of stick-tilt perturbation on tip-movement direction error tended to be more pronounced for participants with a smaller stick-tilt angle at baseline, that is those with a shallower baseline TMD–STA relationship (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7f</xref>), further supporting this idea. The results of Experiment 3 also support the existence of such an interaction between tip-movement and stick-tilt adaptation. When the tip-movement and stick-tilt perturbations were imposed simultaneously, the adaptation trajectories on the physical plane were significantly influenced by the perturbation combination patterns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9c</xref>). If the motor system had simply attempted to correct the stick-tilt to reduce the sensory prediction error, this spillover effect on the tip-movement direction would not have been observed.</p><p>Given that the baseline TMD–STA relationship (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>) reflects the motor cost minimization, it is likely that the motor system is attempting to reduce both the sensor prediction error and the motor cost. One remaining question is why the motor system needs to correct for end-effector irrelevant stick-tilt errors in the first place. We speculate that there may be two reasons. First, a possible simple explanation is that the motor system predicts all sensory consequences generated by the action and attempts to correct any differences between the predicted and actual sensory information, even when the task is successfully achieved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Mazzoni and Krakauer, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Schaefer et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Morehead et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Kim et al., 2019</xref>). Similarly, it is possible that the correction for end-effector irrelevant stick errors reflects the motor system’s attempt to resolve the dissociation between stick (i.e. vision) and hands (i.e., proprioception) caused by the perturbation.</p><p>Second, given that tip-movement direction and stick-tilt angle are tightly coupled (i.e. the presence of baseline TMD–STA relationship), the presence of an end-effector irrelevant stick-tilt visual error implies the presence of an end-effector relevant tip-movement direction error. In other words, the motor system interprets end-effector irrelevant errors as evidence that end-effector relevant errors have been also produced. When sensory information contains noise and/or uncertainty, the reliability of sensory information estimation can be improved by utilizing additional sensory information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Ernst and Banks, 2002</xref>). From this viewpoint, utilizing stick-tilt information may be useful for improving the accuracy of the estimation of the tip-movement direction.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref> illustrates the possible mechanism by which the motor system alters the movement pattern of the redundant system when encountering visual errors. The motor system develops a stereotyped movement pattern through an optimization process that is expressed by abaseline TMD–STA relationship (gray lines in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10a</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10b</xref>). This relationship not only dictates how the motor system physically controls the redundant system, but also informs the resulting visual feedback. When visual perturbations are applied to the tip-movement direction or the stick-tilt angle (bold arrows in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10a</xref>), the motor system tries to eliminate the dissociation of the perturbed state from the original state (thin arrows in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10a</xref>). It even responds to the end-effector irrelevant perturbation (red and blue arrows in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10a</xref>), because the error in the end-effector irrelevant dimension implies the presence of an end-effector relevant error (black dashed arrows in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10a</xref>) under the condition that the stick-tilt angle is tightly coupled with the tip-movement direction (i.e. the baseline TMD–STA relationship). However, these correction patterns are not physically allowed. Since the tip-movement direction and the stick-tilt angle are physically constrained by the baseline TMD–STA relationship, these correction patterns are biased toward the relationship (bold arrows in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10b</xref>).</p><fig id="fig10" position="float"><label>Figure 10.</label><caption><title>A hypothesis for how the motor system alters the movement pattern of redundant system.</title><p>The motor system develops a stereotypical relationship in redundant space, possibly through an optimization process (a gray line).

This screen prevented the participants from directly seeing their arms and handles, and displayed a start position, a target (1.4 cm in diameter), and a virtual stick (length: 40 cm, width: 0.5 cm). A white circle (1 cm diameter) was displayed on the right tip of the stick. The participants held the left tip of the stick with their left hand (left handle) and the stick 15 cm away from the left hand with their right hand (right handle). The distance between the handles was fixed using a strong elastic force produced by the manipulandum (spring constant = 2000 N/m). The positions and velocities of the hands were analogue/digitally converted at 1.129 kHz and then recorded at 1 kHz for offline analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Baseline phase</title><p>All the experiments (Experiments 1–3) comprised a baseline phase (360 trials) followed by an adaptation phase (240 trials). The baseline phase, which was common to all experiments, was performed to investigate the basic strategy of how the participants moved the stick to reach the targets with the right tip. Before each reaching movement, the participants were asked to move the stick to the home position with the help of a manipulandum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref>). After maintaining the home position for 0.5–1 s, a gray target was pseudo-randomly chosen from nine possible targets (0°: horizontal direction,±10°,±20°,±30°,±40°) appearing 10 cm away from the initial right tip position of the stick. After waiting for another 0.5–1 s, the color of the target changed to pink, indicating that they should immediately start moving the tip to the target. The participants were instructed to maintain the peak velocities of the tip as constant as possible across the trials. When the tip reached the target, a feedback message, ‘fast’ or ‘slow’, was presented on the monitor if the peak movement speed was higher or lower than the range of 300–450 mm/s, respectively. After maintaining the tip at the target for 0.5 s, the visual feedback of the stick disappeared. Then, the handles automatically returned to their home position, and the next trial began. During the subsequent 240 trials in the adaptation phase, the target appeared only in the 0° direction, and distinct visual perturbations were introduced in Experiments 1–3 as described below.

The stick-tilt angle remained unchanged (i.e., the stick-tilt angle was identical to the angle of the line connecting both hands). In Experiment 1 A, participants did not perceive the presence of rotation and the adaptation was considered to be dominated by the implicit process.

Notably, these perturbations did not affect the tip-movement direction.

The complexity of control and learning is studied with a new task offering a myriad of possible coordination patterns. Findings are original and exemplify how baseline relationships determine learning.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>A new task is presented: it is a thoughtful one, but because it is a new one, the manuscript section is filled with relatively new terms and acronyms that are not necessarily easy to rapidly understand.</p><p>First, some more thoughts may be devoted to the take-home message. In the title, I am not sure manipulating a stick with both hands is a key piece of information. Also, the authors appear to insist on the term 'implicit', and I wonder if it is a big deal in this manuscript and if all the necessary evidence appears in this study that control and adaptation are exclusively implicit. As there is no clear comparison between gradual and abrupt sessions, the authors may consider removing at least from the title and abstract the words 'implicit' and 'implicitly'. Most importantly, the authors may consider modifying the last sentence of the abstract to clearly provide the most substantial theoretical advance from this study.</p><p>It seems that a substantial finding is the 'constraint' imposed by baseline control laws on sensorimotor adaptation. This seems to echo and extend previous work of Wu, Smith et al. (Nat Neurosci, 2014): their findings, which were not necessarily always replicated, suggested that the more participants were variable in baseline, the better they adapted to a systematic perturbation. The authors may study whether residual errors are smaller or adaptation is faster for individuals with larger motor variability in baseline. Unfortunately, the authors do not present the classic time course of sensorimotor adaptation in any experiment. The adaptation is not described as typically done: the authors should thus show the changes in tip movement direction and stick-tilt angle across trials, and highlight any significant difference between baseline, early adaptation, and late adaptation, for instance. I also wonder why the authors did not include a few no-perturbation trials after the exposure phase to study after-effects in the study design: it looks like a missed opportunity here. Overall, I think that showing the time course of adaptation is necessary for the present study to provide a more comprehensive understanding of that new task, and to re-explore the role of motor variability during baseline for sensorimotor adaptation.</p><p>The distance between hands was fixed at 15 cm with the Kinarm instead of a mechanical constraint. I wonder how much this distance varied and more importantly whether from that analysis or a force analysis, the authors could determine whether one hand led the other one in the adaptation.</p><p>I understand the distinction between task- and end-effector irrelevant perturbation, and at the same time results show that the nervous system reacts to both types of perturbation, indicating that they both seem relevant or important. In line 32, the errors mentioned at the end of the sentence suggest that adaptation is in fact maladaptive. I think the authors may extend the Discussion on why adaptation was found in the experiments with end-effector irrelevant and especially how an internal (forward) model or a pair of internal (forward) models may be used to predict both the visual and the somatosensory consequences of the motor commands.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="referee-report" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.96665.3.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Reviewer #2 (Public review):</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><anonymous/><role specific-use="referee">Reviewer</role></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>Summary:</p><p>The authors have developed a novel bimanual task that allows them to study how the sensorimotor control system deals with redundancy within our body. Specifically, the two hands control two robot handles that control the position and orientation of a virtual stick, where the end of the stick is moved into a target. This task has infinite solutions to any movement, where the two hands influence both tip-movement direction and stick-tilt angle. When moving to different targets in the baseline phase, participants change the tilt angle of the stick in a specific pattern that produces close to minimum movement of the two hands to produce the task. In a series of experiments, the authors then apply perturbations to the stick angle and stick movement direction to examine how either tip-movement (task-relevant) or stick-angle (task-irrelevant) perturbations effect adaptation. Both types of perturbations affect adaptation, but this adaptation follows the baseline pattern of tip-movement and stick angle relation such that even task-irrelevant perturbations drive adaptation in a manner that results in task-relevant errors. Overall, the authors suggest that these baseline relations affect how we adapt to changes in our tasks. This work provides an important demonstration that underlying solutions\relations can affect the manner in which we adapt. I think one major contribution of this work will also be the task itself, which provides a very fruitful and important framework for studying more complex motor control tasks.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>Overall, I find this a very interesting and well-written paper. Beyond providing a new motor task that could be influential in the field, I think it also contributes to studying a very important question - how we can solve redundancy in the sensorimotor control system, as there are many possible mechanisms or methods that could be used - each of which produces different solutions and might affect the manner in which we adapt.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>The visual perturbations were only provided while reaching to one target, which limits the amount of exploration of the environment that the participants experience. Overall, I would find the results even more compelling if the same perturbations applied to movements to more (or all) of the targets produced similar adaptation profiles. The question is to what degree the results derive from only providing a small subset of the environment to explore.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="referee-report" id="sa3"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.96665.3.sa3</article-id><title-group><article-title>Reviewer #3 (Public review):</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><anonymous/><role specific-use="referee">Reviewer</role></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>Summary:</p><p>This study investigated motor system adaptation to new environments through modifications in redundant body movements. Utilizing a novel bimanual stick-manipulation task, participants controlled a virtual stick to reach targets, focusing on how tip-movement direction perturbations affected tip movement and stick-tilt adaptation. The findings revealed a consistent strategy among participants who flexibly adjusted the tilt angle of the stick in response to errors. The adaptation patterns were influenced by physical space relationships, which guided the motor system's selection of movement patterns. This study underscores the motor system's adaptability through changes in redundant body movement patterns.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>This study introduces an innovative bimanual stick manipulation task to explore motor system adaptation to novel environments through alterations in redundant body movement patterns. It also expands the use of endpoint robots in motor control studies.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>The generalizability of the findings is limited. Future work may strengthen the present study's findings by examining whether the observed relationships hold for different stick lengths (i.e., varying hand positions along the virtual stick) or when reaching targets to the left and right of the starting position, not just at varying angles along one side. Additionally, a more comprehensive review of the existing literature on redundant systems, rather than primarily focusing on the lack of redundancy in endpoint-reaching tasks, would have strengthened this study. While the novel task expands the use of endpoint robots in motor control studies, its utility in exploring broader aspects of motor control and learning may be constrained.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="author-comment" id="sa4"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.96665.3.sa4</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Kobayashi</surname><given-names>Toshiki</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>The University of Tokyo</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Tokyo</named-content></addr-line><country>Japan</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Nozaki</surname><given-names>Daichi</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>The University of Tokyo</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Tokyo</named-content></addr-line><country>Japan</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p><p>We would like to thank all the reviewers for their positive evaluation of our paper, as described in the Strengths section. We are also grateful for their helpful comments and suggestions, which we have addressed below. We believe that the manuscript has been significantly improved as a result of these suggestions. In addition to these changes, we also corrected some inconsistencies (statistical values in the last sentence of a Figure 5 caption) and sentences in the main text (lines 155, 452, 522) (these corrections did not affect the results).</p><p>Fig. 5e: R=0.599, P&lt;0.001 -&gt; R=0.601, P=0.007</p><p>L150: &quot;the angle of stick tilt angle&quot; -&gt; &quot;the angle of stick tilt&quot;</p><p>L437: &quot;no such&quot; -&gt; &quot;such&quot;</p><p>L522: &quot;?&quot; -&gt; &quot;.&quot;</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>Summary/Strengths:</p><p>This manuscript describes a stimulating contribution to the field of human motor control. The complexity of control and learning is studied with a new task offering a myriad of possible coordination patterns. Findings are original and exemplify how baseline relationships determine learning.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>A new task is presented: it is a thoughtful one, but because it is a new one, the manuscript section is filled with relatively new terms and acronyms that are not necessarily easy to rapidly understand.</p><p>First, some more thoughts may be devoted to the take-home message. In the title, I am not sure manipulating a stick with both hands is a key piece of information. Also, the authors appear to insist on the term ‘implicit’, and I wonder if it is a big deal in this manuscript and if all the necessary evidence appears in this study that control and adaptation are exclusively implicit. As there is no clear comparison between gradual and abrupt sessions, the authors may consider removing at least from the title and abstract the words ‘implicit’ and ‘implicitly’. Most importantly, the authors may consider modifying the last sentence of the abstract to clearly provide the most substantial theoretical advance from this study.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your positive comment on our paper. We agree with the reviewer that our paper used a lot of acronyms that might confuse the readers. As we have addressed below (in the rebuttal to the Results section), we have reduced the number of acronyms.</p><p>Regarding the comment on the use of the word “implicit” in the title and the abstract, we believe that its use in this paper is very important and indispensable. One of our main findings was that the pattern of adaptation between the tip-movement direction and the stick-tilt angle largely followed that in the baseline condition when aiming at different target directions. This adaptation was largely implicit because participants were not aware of the presence of the perturbation as the amount of perturbation was gradually increased. This implicitness suggests that the adaptation pattern of how the movement should be corrected is embedded in the motor learning system. On the other hand, if this adaptation pattern was achieved on the basis of the explicit strategy of changing the direction of the tip-movement, the adaptation pattern that follows the baseline pattern is not at all surprising. For these reasons, we will continue to use the word &quot;implicit&quot;.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It seems that a substantial finding is the ‘constraint’ imposed by baseline control laws on sensorimotor adaptation. This seems to echo and extend previous work of Wu, Smith et al. (Nat Neurosci, 2014): their findings, which were not necessarily always replicated, suggested that the more participants were variable in baseline, the better they adapted to a systematic perturbation. The authors may study whether residual errors are smaller or adaptation is faster for individuals with larger motor variability in baseline. Unfortunately, the authors do not present the classic time course of sensorimotor adaptation in any experiment. The adaptation is not described as typically done: the authors should thus show the changes in tip movement direction and stick-tilt angle across trials, and highlight any significant difference between baseline, early adaptation, and late adaptation, for instance. I also wonder why the authors did not include a few noperturbation trials after the exposure phase to study after-effects in the study design: it looks like a missed opportunity here. Overall, I think that showing the time course of adaptation is necessary for the present study to provide a more comprehensive understanding of that new task, and to re-explore the role of motor variability during baseline for sensorimotor adaptation.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer for raising these important issues.</p><p>Regarding the learning curve, because the amount of perturbation was gradually increased except for Exp.1B, we were not able to obtain typical learning curves (i.e., the curve showing errors decaying exponentially with trials). However, it may still be useful to show how the movement changed with trials during adaptation. Therefore, following the reviewer's suggestion, we have added the figures of the time course of adaptation in the supplementary data (Figures S1, S2, S4, and S5).</p><p>There are two reasons why our experiments did not include aftereffect quantification trials (i.e., probe trials). First, in the case of adaptation to a visual perturbation (e.g., visual rotation), probe trials are not necessary because the degree of adaptation can be easily quantified by the amount of compensation in the perturbation trials (however, in the case of dynamic perturbations such as force fields, the use of probe trials is necessary). Second, the inclusion of probe trials allows participants to be aware of the presence of the perturbation, which we would like to avoid.</p><p>We also appreciate the interesting additional questions regarding the relevance of our work to the relationship between baseline motor variability and adaptation performance. As this topic, although interesting, is outside the scope of this paper, we concluded that we would not address it in the manuscript. In fact, the experiments were not ideal for quantifying motor variability in the baseline phase because participants had to aim at different targets, which could change the characteristics of motor variability. In addition, we gradually increased the size of the perturbation except for Exp.1B (see Author response image 1, upper panel), which could make it difficult to assess the speed of adaptation. Nevertheless, we think it is worth mentioning this point in this rebuttal. Specifically, we examined the correlation between baseline motor variability when aiming the 0 deg target (tip-movement direction or stick-tilt angle) and adaptation speed in Exp 1A and Exp 1B (Author response image 1 and Author response image 2). To assess adaptation speed in Exp.1A, we quantified the slope of the tip-movement direction to a gradually increasing perturbation (Author response image 1, upper panel). The adaptation speed in Exp.1B was obtained by fitting the exponential function to the data (Author response image 2, upper panel). Although the statistical results were not completely consistent, we found that the participants with greater the motor variability at baseline tended to show faster adaptation, as shown in a previous study (Wu et al., Nat Neurosci, 2014).</p><fig id="sa4fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Correlation between the baseline variability and learning speed (Experiment 1A).</title><p>In Exp 1A, the rotation of the tip-movement direction was gradually increased by 1 degree per trial up to 30 degrees.

I wonder how much this distance varied and more importantly whether from that analysis or a force analysis, the authors could determine whether one hand led the other one in the adaptation.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you very much for this important comment. Since the distance between the two hands was maintained by the stiff virtual spring (2000 N/m), it was kept almost constant throughout the experiments as shown in Author response image 3 (the averaged distance during a movement). The distance was also maintained during reaching movements (Author response image 4).</p><p>We also thank the reviewer for the suggestion regarding the force analysis. As shown in Author response image 5, we did not find a role for a specific hand for motor adaptation from the handle force data. Specifically, Author response image 5 shows the force applied to each handle along and orthogonal to the stick. If one hand led the other in adaptation, we should have observed a phase shift as adaptation progressed. However, no such hand specific phase shift was observed. It should be noted, however, that it was theoretically difficult to know from the force sensors which hand produced the force first, because the force exerted by the right handle was transmitted to the left handle and vice versa due to the connection by the stiff spring.</p><fig id="sa4fig3" position="float"><label>Author response image 3.</label><caption><title>The distance between hands during the task.</title><p>We show the average distance between hands for each trial.

In line 32, the errors mentioned at the end of the sentence suggest that adaptation is in fact maladaptive. I think the authors may extend the Discussion on why adaptation was found in the experiments with end-effector irrelevant and especially how an internal (forward) model or a pair of internal (forward) models may be used to predict both the visual and the somatosensory consequences of the motor commands.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you very much for your comment. As we already described in the discussion of the original manuscript (Lines 519-538 in the revised manuscript), two potential explanations exist for the motor system’s response to the end-effector irrelevant perturbation (i.e., stick rotation). First, the motor system predicts the sensory information associated with the action and attempts to correct any discrepancies between the prediction and the actual sensory consequences, regardless of whether the error information is end-effector relevant or end-effector irrelevant. Second, given the close coupling between the tip-movement direction and stick-tilt angle, the motor system can estimate the presence of end-effector relevant error (i.e., tip-movement direction) by the presence of end-effector irrelevant error (i.e., stick-tilt angle). This estimation should lead to the change in the tip-movement direction. As the reviewer pointed out, the mismatch between visual and proprioceptive information is another possibility, we have added the description of this point in Discussion (Lines 523-526).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>Minor</p><p>Line 16: “it remains poorly understood” is quite subjective and I would suggest reformulating this statement.</p></disp-quote><p>We have reformulated this statement as “This limitation prevents the study of how….” (Line 16).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Introduction</p><p>Line 49: the authors may be more specific than just saying ‘this task’.

Specifically, the two hands control two robot handles that control the position and orientation of a virtual stick, where the end of the stick is moved into a target. This task has infinite solutions to any movement, where the two hands influence both tip-movement direction and stick-tilt angle. When moving to different targets in the baseline phase, participants change the tilt angle of the stick in a specific pattern that produces close to the minimum movement of the two hands to produce the task. In a series of experiments, the authors then apply perturbations to the stick angle and stick movement direction to examine how either tipmovement (task-relevant) or stick-angle (task-irrelevant) perturbations affect adaptation. Both types of perturbations affect adaptation, but this adaptation follows the baseline pattern of tip-movement and stick angle relation such that even task-irrelevant perturbations drive adaptation in a manner that results in task-relevant errors. Overall, the authors suggest that these baseline relations affect how we adapt to changes in our tasks. This work provides an important demonstration that underlying solutions/relations can affect the manner in which we adapt. I think one major contribution of this work will also be the task itself, which provides a very fruitful and important framework for studying more complex motor control tasks.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>Overall, I find this a very interesting and well-written paper. Beyond providing a new motor task that could be influential in the field, I think it also contributes to studying a very important question - how we can solve redundancy in the sensorimotor control system, as there are many possible mechanisms or methods that could be used - each of which produces different solutions and might affect the manner in which we adapt.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>I would like to see further discussion of what the particular chosen solution implies in terms of optimality.</p><p>The underlying baseline strategy used by the participants appears to match the path of minimum movement of the two hands. This suggests that participants are simultaneously optimizing accuracy and minimizing some metabolic cost or effort to solve the redundancy problem. However, once the perturbations are applied, participants still use this strategy for driving adaptation. I assume that this means that the solution that participants end up with after adaptation actually produces larger movements of the two hands than required. That is - they no longer fall onto the minimum hand movement strategy - which was used to solve the problem. Can the authors demonstrate that this is either the case or not clearly? These two possibilities produce very different implications in terms of the results.</p><p>If my interpretation is correct, such a result (using a previously found solution that no longer is optimal) reminds me of the work of Selinger et al., 2015 (Current Biology), where participants continue to walk at a non-optimal speed after perturbations unless they get trained on multiple conditions to learn the new landscape of solutions. Perhaps the authors could discuss their work within this kind of interpretation. Do the authors predict that this relation would change with extensive practice either within the current conditions or with further exploration of the new task landscape? For example, if more than one target was used in the adaptation phase of the experiment?</p><p>On the other hand, if the adaptation follows the solution of minimum hand movement and therefore potentially effort, this provides a completely different interpretation.</p><p>Overall, I would find the results even more compelling if the same perturbations applied to movements to all of the targets and produced similar adaptation profiles. The question is to what degree the results derive from only providing a small subset of the environment to explore.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you very much for pointing out this significant issue. As the reviewer correctly interprets, the physical movement patterns deviated from the baseline relationship as exemplified in Exp.2. However, this deviation is not surprising for the following reason. Under the perturbation that creates the dissociation between the hands and the stick, the motor system cannot simultaneously return both the visual stick motion and physical hands motion to the original motions: When the motor system tries to return the visual stick motion to the original visual motion, then the physical hands motion inevitably deviates from the original physical hands motion, and vice versa.</p><p>Our interpretation of this result is that the motor system corrects the movement to reduce the visual dissociation of the visual stick motion from the baseline motion (i.e., sensory prediction error), but this movement correction is biased by the baseline physical hands motion. In other words, the motor system attempts to balance the minimization of sensory prediction error and the minimization of motor cost. Thus, our results do not indicate that the final adaptation pattern is non-optimal, but rather reflect the attempts for optimization.</p><p>In the revised manuscript, we have added the description of this interpretation (Lines 515-517).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>The authors have suggested that the only study (line 472) that has also examined an end-effector irrelevant perturbation is the bimanual study of Omrani et al., 2013, which only examined reflex activity rather than adaptation. To clarify this issue - exactly what is considered end-effector irrelevant perturbations - I was wondering about the bimanual perturbations in Dimitriou et al., 2012 (J Neurophysiol) and the simultaneous equal perturbations in Franklin et al., 2016 (J Neurosci), as well as other recent papers studying task-irrelevant disturbances which aren’t discussed. I would consider these both to also be end-effector irrelevant perturbations, although again they only used these to study reflex activity and not adaptation as in the current paper. Regardless, further explanation of exactly what is the difference between task-irrelevant and end-effector irrelevant would be useful to clarify the exact difference between the current manuscript and previous work.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your helpful comments. We have included as references the study by Dimitriou et al. (Line 490) and Franklin et al. (Lines 486-487), which use an endeffector irrelevant perturbation and the task-irrelevant perturbation condition, respectively.

Using a novel bimanual stick manipulation task, participants manipulated a virtual stick to reach targets, focusing on how tip-movement direction perturbations affected both tip movement and stick-tilt adaptation. The findings indicated a consistent strategy among participants who flexibly adjusted the tilt angle of the stick in response to errors. The adaptation patterns are influenced by physical space relationships, guiding the motor system’s choice of movement patterns. Overall, this study highlights the adaptability of the motor system through changes in redundant body movement patterns.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>This paper introduces a novel bimanual stick manipulation task to investigate how the motor system adapts to novel environments by altering the movement patterns of our redundant body.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>The generalizability of the findings is quite limited. It would have been interesting to see if the same relationships were held for different stick lengths (i.e., the hands positioned at different start locations along the virtual stick) or when reaching targets to the left and right of a start position, not just at varying angles along one side. Alternatively, this study would have benefited from a more thorough investigation of the existing literature on redundant systems instead of primarily focusing on the lack of redundancy in endpointreaching tasks. Although the novel task expands the use of endpoint robots in motor control studies, the utility of this task for exploring motor control and learning may be limited.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you very much for the important comment. Given that there are many parameters (e.g., stick length, locations of hands, target position etc), one may wonder how the findings obtained from only one combination can be generalized to other configurations. In the revised manuscript, we have explicitly described this point (Lines 356-359).</p><p>Thus, the generalizability needs to be investigated in future studies, but we believe that the main results also apply to other configurations. Regarding the baseline stick movement pattern, the control with tilting the stick was observed regardless of the stick-tip positions (Author response image 6).
