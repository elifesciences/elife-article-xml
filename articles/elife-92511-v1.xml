conductance (BK<sub>Ca</sub>) reportedly promote breast cancer (BC) development and progression. Underlying molecular mechanisms remain, however, elusive. Here, we provide electrophysiological evidence for a BK<sub>Ca</sub> splice variant localized to the inner mitochondrial membrane of murine and human BC cells (mitoBK<sub>Ca</sub>). Through a combination of genetic knockdown and knockout along with a cell permeable BK<sub>Ca</sub> channel blocker, we show that mitoBK<sub>Ca</sub> modulates overall cellular and mitochondrial energy production, and mediates the metabolic rewiring referred to as the ‘Warburg effect’, thereby promoting BC cell proliferation in the presence and absence of oxygen. Additionally, we detect mitoBK<sub>Ca</sub> and BK<sub>Ca</sub> transcripts in low or high abundance, respectively, in clinical BC specimens. Together, our results emphasize, that targeting mitoBK<sub>Ca</sub> could represent a treatment strategy for selected BC patients in future.</p></abstract><kwd-group

Despite many available anti-cancer treatments which largely depend on the steroid and epidermal growth factor (HER2) receptor status (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Dunnwald et al., 2007</xref>), cancer cells frequently escape from existing therapies due to adaptions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Wu et al., 2021b</xref>). Therefore, the identification of novel targets and therapeutic strategies that confer benefits for at least a subset of patients, whose cancer displays specific molecular or cellular features, is of utmost relevance.</p><p>Important factors that emerged as new cancer targets are ion channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Li and Xiong, 2011</xref>). Especially alterations in the expression levels and function of potassium ion (K<sup>+</sup>) channels are critically related to cancer malignancy and progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Li et al., 2022</xref>). One of these channels represents the calcium ion (Ca<sup>2+</sup>)- and voltage-activated K<sup>+</sup> channel of large conductance (BK<sub>Ca</sub>, <italic>KCNMA1</italic>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Mohr et al., 2022</xref>). Canonical BK<sub>Ca</sub> channels usually localize in the plasma membrane (PM) of cells, and contribute to the regulation of the cytosolic K<sup>+</sup> content, the PM potential (ΔΨ<sub>PM</sub>), cell cycle, and cell motility, as well as regulatory volume, changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Burgstaller et al., 2022a</xref>). Opening of BK<sub>Ca</sub> channels results in K<sup>+</sup> efflux, increasing the electrochemical driving force for Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry into the cancer cell and affecting pathological cell growth and survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Ouadid-Ahidouch and Ahidouch, 2013</xref>). Accordingly, in BC cells (BCCs), an upregulation of BK<sub>Ca</sub> has been associated with increased malignancy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Huang and Jan, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Mohr et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Oeggerli et al., 2012</xref>). However, besides their localization in the PM, several K<sup>+</sup> channels, including BK<sub>Ca</sub>, have also been identified in the inner mitochondrial membrane (IMM; mitoBK<sub>Ca</sub>), a topic which has been extensively reviewed recently (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Checchetto et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kulawiak and Szewczyk, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Szabo and Szewczyk, 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Szewczyk et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Wrzosek et al., 2020</xref>). MitoBK<sub>Ca</sub> was first described by Siemen et al. in a human glioma cell line more than 20 years ago <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Siemen et al., 1999</xref>. So far, mitoBK<sub>Ca</sub> has further been found for example in bronchial epithelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dabrowska et al., 2022</xref>), neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Douglas et al., 2006</xref>), skeletal muscle cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Skalska et al., 2008</xref>), and in cardiac myocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Xu et al., 2002</xref>). In the latter, a splice variant, the BK<sub>Ca</sub>-DEC isoform containing a unique C-terminal exon of 50 amino acids, forms the functional mitoBK<sub>Ca</sub> channel at the IMM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Singh et al., 2013</xref>). Little, however, is known about the molecular identity of mitoBK<sub>Ca</sub> in other cell types, and mitochondrial localization of BK<sub>Ca</sub> in BCCs has not been demonstrated so far.</p><p>Cancer cells show increased energy demands due to their high proliferation rates. Thus, tumor cells compensate for their elevated energy demand by increasing metabolic activities and adapting to nutrient-poor metabolic niches in the tumor microenvironment, allowing them to overcome oxygen (O<sub>2</sub>)-dependent mitochondrial metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Eales et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gross et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Jang et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Nazemi and Rainero, 2020</xref>). This metabolic switch from oxidative phosphorylation to glycolysis, frequently referred to as the ‘Warburg effect’, describes the phenomenon that cancer cells rather secrete lactate to the extracellular matrix (ECM), instead of utilizing pyruvate to fuel the TCA cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Warburg, 1924</xref>). This lactate secretion towards the ECM was shown to promote multiple microenvironmental cues eventually causing tumor progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">de la Cruz-López et al., 2019</xref>). Interestingly, extracellular K<sup>+</sup> may also impair effector T-cell function, and, thus, the anti-tumor immune response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Eil et al., 2016</xref>), while, within the cancer cell, functions of several glycolytic enzymes rely on K<sup>+</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bischof et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gohara and Di Cera, 2016</xref>). Further, the presence of mitoBK<sub>Ca</sub> contributes to the K<sup>+</sup> entry into the mitochondrial matrix to interfere with mitochondrial volume changes and the mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨ<sub>mito</sub>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Krabbendam et al., 2018</xref>). Consequently, (mito)BK<sub>Ca</sub>-dependent mechanisms may severely affect energy production pathways and the resulting energy supply of cancer cells.</p><p>To elucidate how BK<sub>Ca</sub> contributes to increasing BCC malignancy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Oeggerli et al., 2012</xref>), we utilized BK<sub>Ca</sub> (<italic>KCNMA1</italic>) pro- and deficient human BCC lines including MDA-MB-453 and MCF-7 cells, and primary murine BCCs derived from the mouse mammary tumor polyoma middle T-antigen (MMTV-PyMT)-induced wild type (WT) or BK<sub>Ca</sub> knock-out (BK-KO, <italic>Kcnma1-KO</italic>) BC model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Mohr et al., 2022</xref>). In these cells, either isoforms of BK<sub>Ca</sub> were expressed, or BK<sub>Ca</sub> was pharmacologically blocked by paxilline or iberiotoxin, two frequently used inhibitors of BK<sub>Ca</sub>, that either penetrate the cell or act exclusively at PM localized channels, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Candia et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Zhou and Lingle, 2014</xref>). These approaches were complemented by patch-clamp experiments and by measuring the cellular ion homeostasis and metabolism with fluorescence live-cell imaging, extracellular flux analysis and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS)-based methods.</p><p>Our results emphasize that the presence of BK<sub>Ca</sub> in the IMM affects mitochondrial bioenergetics, thereby increasing BCC malignancy. This effect was specifically mediated by the DEC isoform of BK<sub>Ca</sub>, that is, mitoBK<sub>Ca</sub>. Functional expression of BK<sub>Ca</sub>-DEC was validated by single-channel patch-clamp recordings of BCC-derived mitoplasts. Importantly, we also identified BK<sub>Ca</sub>-DEC expression in a subset of BC patient biopsies using nanostring-based mRNA expression analysis.

Primary BCCs obtained from transgenic, BC-bearing MMTV-PyMT WT or BK-KO mice were used as positive or negative controls, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Mohr et al., 2022</xref>). Patch-clamp experiments revealed, that depolarizing stimuli delivered in 20 mV increments induced K<sup>+</sup> outward currents that were larger in MMTV-PyMT WT compared to BK-KO cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and B</xref><bold>,</bold> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A and B</xref> ). To validate that these increased currents were elicited by BK<sub>Ca</sub>, we pharmacologically inhibited the channel by using either paxilline or iberiotoxin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Candia et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Zhou and Lingle, 2014</xref>). While the current remained unaffected by these treatments in MMTV-PyMT BK-KO cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>), peak currents (I<sub>max</sub>) were drastically reduced in MMTV-PyMT WT cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Further, we analyzed the plasma membrane potential (ΔΨ<sub>PM</sub>) in these cells using the voltage-sensitive fluorescent dye Dibac4(3) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adams and Levin, 2012</xref>) as well as current-clamp experiments. The ΔΨ<sub>PM</sub> was more polarized in MMTV-PyMT WT compared to BK-KO cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>), as expected, due to the presence of hyperpolarizing BK<sub>Ca</sub> channels in WT cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">N’Gouemo, 2014</xref>). Current-clamp experiments unveiled a basal ΔΨ<sub>PM</sub> of –46.4±2.5 mV and –32.2±2.1 mV for MMTV-PyMT WT and BK-KO cells, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Iberiotoxin treatment equalized the ΔΨ<sub>PM</sub> of the two genotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). In line with these findings, using a recently developed, genetically encoded K<sup>+</sup> sensor, NES lc-LysM GEPII 1.0 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bischof et al., 2017</xref>), we found reduced cytosolic K<sup>+</sup> concentrations ([K<sup>+</sup>]<sub>cyto</sub>) in MMTV-PyMT WT cells under basal conditions (83.1±5.8 mM for WT ctrl vs. 121.2±7.1 mM for BK-KO ctrl), which increased to the BK-KO cell level in response to iberiotoxin treatment (109.8±10.8 mM for WT +IBTX vs. 114.6±9.8 mM for BK-KO +IBTX) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D and E</xref>), explaining the PM depolarization. Subsequently, we recorded current-voltage relationships using the human BCC lines MDA-MB-453 and MCF-7, expressing either high or low levels of BK<sub>Ca</sub> mRNA transcripts, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Mohr et al., 2022</xref>). Analysis of the outward currents activated by depolarization demonstrated a paxilline- and iberiotoxin-sensitive current in MDA-MB-453 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1F</xref>), indicative for functional BK<sub>Ca</sub> channels in their PM, but not in MCF-7 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1G</xref>), which is well in line with previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Mohr et al., 2022</xref>). Based on the almost non-existent level of BK<sub>Ca</sub>-mediated PM currents in MCF-7 cells, we utilized these cells to express different BK<sub>Ca</sub> isoforms fused to a red fluorescent protein (RFP). Therefore, we either used an earlier identified mitoBK<sub>Ca</sub> isoform (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Singh et al., 2013</xref>), namely BK<sub>Ca</sub>-DEC<sup>RFP</sup>, or the same channel lacking C-terminal amino acids including the DEC exon, hereinafter referred to as BK<sub>Ca</sub><sup>RFP</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). We hypothesized, that, in analogy to cardiac myocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Singh et al., 2013</xref>), the expression of BK<sub>Ca</sub>-DEC<sup>RFP</sup> in MCF-7 cells may yield a functional channel present in the IMM. To test this, MCF-7 cells were first transiently transfected either with RFP fused to a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchor (RFP-GPI) directing RFP to the PM, or an RFP linked to a cytochrome c oxidase subunit 8 (COX8) mitochondrial leading sequence, yielding a mitochondrial targeted fusion protein (mtRFP; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1H</xref> and grey dotted lines in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). Analysis of the colocalization of mtRFP with MitoGREEN, a dye that specifically stains the mitochondrial matrix, resulted in high colocalization scores, while a low overlap was observed for RFP-GPI transfected MCF-7 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1H</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>, grey dotted lines). Subsequently, the same experiments were performed with MCF-7 cells expressing BK<sub>Ca</sub><sup>RFP</sup> or BK<sub>Ca</sub>-DEC<sup>RFP</sup>. Although the mitochondrial localization score was lower for BK<sub>Ca</sub>-DEC<sup>RFP</sup> compared to mtRFP (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1H</xref>), this BK<sub>Ca</sub> variant showed a significantly higher overlap with the mitochondrial dye than BK<sub>Ca</sub><sup>RFP</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1I</xref>). Despite rather moderate colocalization scores of BK<sub>Ca</sub>-DEC<sup>RFP</sup> with MitoGREEN, on the level of single mitochondria, the RFP signal derived from BK<sub>Ca</sub>-DEC<sup>RFP</sup> surrounded the MitoGREEN fluorescence signal originating from the mitochondrial matrix, as expected for a K<sup>+</sup> channel located in the IMM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1I</xref>). As not all RFP signal in the BK<sub>Ca</sub>-DEC<sup>RFP</sup> overexpressing MCF-7 originated from mitochondria, we investigated the PM localization of the two channel isoforms by patch-clamp. Compared to native MCF-7 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>), both, BK<sub>Ca</sub><sup>RFP</sup> and BK<sub>Ca</sub>-DEC<sup>RFP</sup>, increased the PM outward current (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1J and K</xref>). Despite comparable expression levels of the RFP signals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1L</xref>), presence of BK<sub>Ca</sub><sup>RFP</sup> caused significantly bigger currents across the PM compared to BK<sub>Ca</sub>-DEC<sup>RFP</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>), indicative either for (i) higher intracellular abundance or (ii) major functional differences of BK<sub>Ca</sub>-DEC<sup>RFP</sup>. Importantly, the conductance of both channels was sensitive to the BK<sub>Ca</sub> blockers paxilline and iberiotoxin, as treatment of the cells with both compounds resulted in PM conductance values comparable to those of native MCF-7 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E and H</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1G, J and K</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Characterization of BK<sub>Ca</sub> channels in murine and human BCCs.</title><p>(<bold>A, B</bold>) I-V curves (left) and corresponding maximal currents (right) of MMTV-PyMT WT (<bold>A</bold>) and MMTV-PyMT BK-KO (<bold>B</bold>) cells, either under control conditions, or in the presence of paxilline or iberiotoxin.

Throughout all BCCs investigated, expression of BK<sub>Ca</sub> reduced [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>ER</sub>, potentially indicating that the channel was (i) functional in this cell compartment and (ii) involved in regulating the Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis of the ER. In MMTV-PyMT WT cells, [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>ER</sub> was restored by the cell-permeable BK<sub>Ca</sub> inhibitor paxilline (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1K</xref>) but not by the cell-impermeable iberiotoxin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1L</xref>), while both inhibitors restored the [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>ER</sub> in MDA-MB-453 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). Accordingly, overexpression of both RFP-tagged BK<sub>Ca</sub> isoforms in MCF-7 cells depleted the [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>ER</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>).</p><p>[Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>cyto</sub> and [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>ER</sub> reportedly affect the mitochondrial [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] ([Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>mito</sub>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Wacquier et al., 2019</xref>). Since an accumulation of K<sup>+</sup> within the mitochondrial matrix may oppose mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Checchetto et al., 2021</xref>), we assessed the effects of functional BK<sub>Ca</sub> expression on [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>mito</sub> utilizing 4mtD3cpV, a genetically encoded Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensor targeted to the mitochondrial matrix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Palmer et al., 2006</xref>). Again, BCCs were treated with ATP to investigate the [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>mito</sub> upon cell stimulation. In MMTV-PyMT WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>) as well as MDA-MB-453 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>), functional expression of BK<sub>Ca</sub> reduced basal [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>mito</sub>. Interestingly, in these two BCC types, basal and maximally elicited [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>mito</sub> peaks increased in response to paxilline (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G and H</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1M—P</xref>), but not iberiotoxin treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G and H</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1M—P</xref>). These findings confirm a role of intracellular located BK<sub>Ca</sub> channels in modulating [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>mito</sub> dynamics. Importantly, in MCF-7 cells, basal [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>mito</sub> was only affected upon expression of the mitochondrially targeted BK<sub>Ca</sub>-DEC<sup>RFP</sup>, but not BK<sub>Ca</sub><sup>RFP</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I</xref>), whereas neither of the two isoforms affected the maximal [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>mito</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1Q</xref>). Presumably, by facilitating K<sup>+</sup> fluxes across the IMM, BK<sub>Ca</sub>-DEC<sup>RFP</sup> expression reduces the driving force for Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake and thus the resulting Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals in the mitochondrial matrix. Basal differences in all the utilized cell lines under the different conditions were additionally validated by ionomycin treatment, followed by intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> chelation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1R-V</xref>).</p><p>In total, our [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] imaging approaches emphasize that different BK<sub>Ca</sub> isoforms at different localizations, i.e. the PM or intracellular organelles, may either amplify or weaken [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>cyto</sub> and [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>ER</sub> signals, respectively. These opposing effects are expected, as BK<sub>Ca</sub>-mediated uptake of K<sup>+</sup> into the ER should limit the Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake capacity of this subcellular compartment, while functional channel expression at the PM might increase the driving force for Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx to fuel [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>cyto</sub>. [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>mito</sub>, however, seems to be exclusively and effectively suppressed by the activity of intracellularly located BK<sub>Ca</sub> variants in MMTV-PyMT WT and MDA-MB-453 cells and solely by the expression of BK<sub>Ca</sub>-DEC<sup>RFP</sup> in MCF-7 cells.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>The metabolic activity of murine and human BCCs is modulated by intracellular BK<sub>Ca</sub></title><p>Given the involvement of Ca<sup>2+</sup> and K<sup>+</sup> in regulating key features of cellular metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bischof et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dejos et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gohara and Di Cera, 2016</xref>), we proposed, that BK<sub>Ca</sub> may alter metabolic activities of BCCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Rossi et al., 2019</xref>). Hence, we analyzed the extracellular acidification rate (ECAR) as a measure of lactate secretion, that is glycolytic activity in MMTV-PyMT and MDA-MB-453 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Burgstaller et al., 2021a</xref>). ECAR measurements unveiled an increased basal ECAR of MMTV-PyMT WT compared to BK-KO cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A and B</xref>). Subsequently, we performed a mitochondrial stress test by injection of Oligomycin-A, FCCP, and Antimycin-A, which increased ECARs in both cell types due to ATP-synthase inhibition, mitochondrial uncoupling and complex III blockade, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Maximal ECAR, received upon FCCP injection, was elevated in WT compared to BK-KO cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). Besides this evidence derived from a gene-targeted BK<sub>Ca</sub> channel-deficient model, we used paxilline or iberiotoxin as pharmacological BK<sub>Ca</sub> modulators (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A and B</xref>). Interestingly, only paxilline, but not iberiotoxin treatment equalized basal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>) and maximal ECARs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>) between WT and BK-KO, suggesting that intracellular BK<sub>Ca</sub> channels stimulate the glycolytic activity of BCCs. Moreover, in MDA-MB-453 cells iberiotoxin treatment did neither affect basal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D and E</xref>) nor maximal ECARs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). Contrary to MMTV-PyMT WT cells, however, paxilline increased basal and maximal ECAR in these cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E and F</xref>), suggesting that the cell lines examined strongly differ in their metabolic settings or in other H<sup>+</sup> releasing processes contributing to extracellular acidification.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>BK<sub>Ca</sub> channels alter the metabolic activity of BCCs.</title><p>(<bold>A, D</bold>) Average ECAR over-time ± SEM of MMTV-PyMT WT (<bold>A</bold>, red) and BK-KO cells (<bold>A</bold>, black), or MDA-MB-453 cells (<bold>D</bold>) in response to administration of Oligomycin-A (+O), FCCP (+F) and Antimycin-A (+A) at time points indicated.

Again, in MDA-MB-453 cells, paxilline treatment had an opposite effect to the observations that were made in MMTV-PyMT WT cells, as paxilline treatment increased the OCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3J–L</xref>), potentially due to the increased supply of oxidative phosphorylation with glycolytic substrates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D–F</xref>).

(<bold>H, I</bold>) Schematic representation of processes involved in 2-NBDG uptake. 2-NBDG is taken up via glucose transporters (GLUTs, green), and ATP-dependently phosphorylated by hexokinase isoforms (HKs, red) to 2-NBDG-6-phosphate (2-NBDG-6P). Under basal conditions, if F<sub>O</sub>F<sub>1</sub> ATP-synthase is running in forward mode (<bold>H</bold>), mitochondria contribute to 2-NBDG uptake by ATP generation and delivery to HKs via the adenine nucleotide transporter (ANT, yellow), and the voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC, violet). Contrary, under basal conditions, if F<sub>O</sub>F<sub>1</sub> ATP-synthase activity is reversed (<bold>I</bold>) it competes with HKs for ATP. Subsequent inhibition of mitochondria due to their depolarization with FCCP (red) stops ATP-synthase activity. Under these conditions, 2-NBDG uptake will decrease if F<sub>O</sub>F<sub>1</sub> ATP-synthase operates in forward mode (<bold>H</bold>), but will increase if F<sub>O</sub>F<sub>1</sub> ATP-synthase shows reversed activity (<bold>I</bold>).

Under high [GLU]<sub>ex</sub> conditions (25.0 mM), the difference in ΔΨ<sub>mito</sub> between MMTV-PyMT WT and BK-KO cells disappeared, as ΔΨ<sub>mito</sub> increased significantly in WT and decreased significantly in BK-KO cells compared to low [GLU]<sub>ex</sub> (2.0 mM) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Because F<sub>O</sub>F<sub>1</sub>-ATP-synthase (ATP Synthase) may hydrolyze ATP in an attempt to maintain ΔΨ<sub>mito</sub>, these results strongly suggest that the forward (ATP producing) vs reverse (ATP consuming) mode of the ATP synthase is affected by the BK<sub>Ca</sub> status of the cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Naguib et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>To unravel the substrate dependency of these BCCs for maintaining their energy homeostasis in dependency of BK<sub>Ca</sub>, we measured the mitochondrial ATP concentration ([ATP]<sub>mito</sub>) using a genetically encoded ATP sensor targeted to the mitochondrial matrix, mtAT1.03 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Imamura et al., 2009</xref>). Mitochondrial ATP reportedly responds most dynamically to energy metabolism perturbations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Depaoli et al., 2018</xref>). To assess the sources of ATP in the cells, we either deprived the cells of [GLU]<sub>ex</sub>, or administered Oligomycin-A to inhibit the ATP-synthase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Depaoli et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E–J</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B—G</xref>). In MMTV-PyMT cells, glucose removal as well as ATP-synthase inhibition reduced [ATP]<sub>mito</sub>, albeit the effect was more pronounced upon [GLU]<sub>ex</sub> depletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E and F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B and C</xref>). Remarkably, paxilline, but not iberiotoxin treatment reduced the glucose, and increased ATP-synthase dependency of MMTV-PyMT WT cells for maintaining [ATP]<sub>mito</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E and F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B and C</xref>). These observations were confirmed in MDA-MB-453 cells, even though (i) these cells showed an overall higher dependency on the ATP-synthase, and (ii) the paxilline-sensitivity of [ATP]<sub>mito</sub> maintenance was much less pronounced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G and H</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1D and E</xref>).</p><p>To validate these findings in a BK<sub>Ca</sub> minimal to depleted model, these experiments were performed with MCF-7 cells either expressing exclusively RFP as control, BK<sub>Ca</sub><sup>RFP</sup>, or BK<sub>Ca</sub>-DEC<sup>RFP</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4I and J</xref>). Expression of BK<sub>Ca-</sub>DEC<sup>RFP</sup>, but not BK<sub>Ca</sub><sup>RFP</sup>, resulted in a high dependency on [GLU]<sub>ex</sub> to maintain [ATP]<sub>mito</sub> while the [ATP]<sub>mito</sub> rundown in the presence of Oligomycin-A was identical for both BK<sub>Ca</sub> splice variants. This suggests that BK<sub>Ca</sub>-DEC<sup>RFP</sup> specifically triggers a high [GLU]<sub>ex</sub> sensitivity and simultaneously an independency on ATP derived from ATP-synthase for maintaining [ATP]<sub>mito</sub> as demonstrated by the ratio of the respective changes under these experimental conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4I and J</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1F and G</xref>). These findings suggest that intracellular (mitochondrial) BK<sub>Ca</sub> contributes to the metabolic reprogramming of BCCs.</p><p>In an extension to extracellular flux analyses, single time-point LC-MS metabolomics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>), and high-resolution live-cell imaging experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A–J</xref>), pointing to a BK<sub>Ca</sub>-dependent ‘oncometabolic’ phenotype, we assessed the concentrations of mitochondrial hydrogen peroxide ([H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>]<sub>mito</sub>) using mitoHyPer3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bilan et al., 2013</xref>), a genetically encoded fluorescent indicator for monitoring H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> in the mitochondrial matrix (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4K–M</xref>). These experiments demonstrated increased levels of [H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>]<sub>mito</sub> in MMTV-PyMT WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4K</xref>) and MDA-MB-453 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4L</xref>), or specifically upon BK<sub>Ca</sub>-DEC<sup>RFP</sup> expression in MCF-7 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4M</xref>). Excessive reactive oxygen species (ROS) synthesis is caused by uncoupling of the respiratory chain and it is considered as an indicator of mitochondrial stress, which, among other reasons, promotes mutagenesis and BCC progression. In this regard, mitoBK<sub>Ca</sub> may serve as an “uncoupling” protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gałecka et al., 2021</xref>), triggering ATP synthase to operate in reverse mode to consume instead of producing ATP, thereby counteracting the dissipation of the proton gradient and consequently the loss of ΔΨ<sub>mito</sub>. Consequently, the lack of ATP must be compensated, e.g. by accelerating glycolysis. To investigate this assumption, we performed glucose uptake measurements using 2-NBDG, a fluorescent glucose analogue, which is taken up via glucose transporters (GLUTs), phosphorylated by hexokinase (HK) isoforms to generate 2-NBDG-6-phosphate and subsequently remains within the cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bischof et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1H and I</xref>). Unexpectedly, we found that MMTV-PyMT BK-KO cells showed a higher rate of glucose uptake and phosphorylation compared to WT cells under basal conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4N</xref>). To unravel the role of mitochondria in contributing to glucose uptake by supplying ATP to HKs, we next performed these experiments in the presence of FCCP, which disrupts mitochondrial ATP production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Losano et al., 2017</xref>). If ATP-synthase works in forward mode, FCCP treatment should reduce or even prevent oxidative ATP production, and, subsequently, ATP-dependent 2-NBDG phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1H</xref>). Contrary, if ATP-synthase works in reverse mode, it may compete with HKs for ATP, and FCCP treatment should abolish this competition, leading to increased 2-NBDG phosphorylation in BCCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1I</xref>). Interestingly, our experiments unveiled increased 2-NBDG uptake in MMTV-PyMT WT and reduced uptake in BK-KO cells upon mitochondrial depolarization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4N</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1J and K</xref>). To facilitate the interpretation, we calculated the FCCP-induced change in 2-NBDG uptake. These analyses revealed that mitochondria are less effective in assisting 2-NBDG uptake and phosphorylation in MMTV-PyMT WT cells, while they ‘support’ these processes in BK-KO cells under control conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4O</xref>). To test whether the changes in 2-NBDG uptake are sensitive to pharmacological modulation of BK<sub>Ca</sub>, we performed a similar set of experiments in the presence of paxilline or iberiotoxin. While iberiotoxin treatment did not have any effect, paxilline treatment shifted the activity of the ATP-synthase to the ATP-supplying ‘forward’ mode (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4O</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1J, K</xref>). Comparable effects were obtained in MDA-MB-453, despite paxilline treatment reduced basal accumulation of 2-NBDG in these cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4P and Q</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1L</xref>). Overall, the experiments performed so far suggest that mitochondria rather consume than generate ATP if BK<sub>Ca</sub> was functionally expressed intracellularly in BCCs.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>BK<sub>Ca</sub> locates functionally in the IMM of murine and human BCCs</title><p>So far, our data suggest an important contribution of intracellularly located BK<sub>Ca</sub>, possibly mitoBK<sub>Ca</sub>, in reprogramming cancer cell metabolism. Thus, we applied an electrophysiological approach to provide functional evidence for endogenous mitoBK<sub>Ca</sub>. Single-channel patch-clamp experiments were conducted using mitoplasts isolated from MMTV-PyMT WT and BK-KO, MDA-MB-453, and MCF-7 cells. In MDA-MB-453- and MMTV-PyMT WT-derived mitoplasts we indeed detected channels of large conductance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>). For these channels, the open probability did not significantly vary with the voltage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). Only at very negative and positive voltages of approximately –150 mV and +150 mV differences in the open probabilities were observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). The bursts of single-channel openings showed an average conductance of 212±2 pS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). This large conductance and the sensitivity towards Ca<sup>2+</sup>- (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E and F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B</xref>) and paxilline (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E and F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1C</xref>) pointed to mitoBK<sub>Ca</sub> that exhibits the pharmacologic characteristics of canonical BK<sub>Ca</sub> channels present at the PM. Overall, our electro-pharmacological experiments unveiled 3 different classes of channels with either small (≤100 pS), medium (≤150 pS), or large (~210 pS) conductance, where the latter conductance corresponds to mitoBK<sub>Ca</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Liu et al., 1999</xref>). The lower conductance values may represent mitochondrial IK<sub>Ca</sub>, SK<sub>Ca</sub>, or K<sub>ATP</sub> channel activity, but this was not investigated further in our study. Notably, mitoBK<sub>Ca</sub> was detected at a frequency of 15% in 210 patches of MDA-MB-453 mitoplasts and at a lower frequency of 6% in 127 mitoplast patches of MMTV-PyMT WT cells. These numbers may, however, underestimate the actual abundance of the channel, as only a small area of the mitoplast is examined with each patch. Importantly, this channel was absent in 76 mitoplast patches from MMTV-PyMT BK-KO and 58 mitoplast patches from MCF-7 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>).

These profound ionic and bioenergetic changes ultimately trigger the proliferation of BCCs in a low oxygen environment, as found in solid tumors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6N</xref>).

BK<sub>Ca</sub>-DEC modulates BCC metabolism, stimulates the Warburg effect, and accelerates cell proliferation rates in the presence and absence of O<sub>2</sub>. These tumor- and malignancy-promoting effects were sensitive to BK<sub>Ca</sub> inhibition using the cell-permeable BK<sub>Ca</sub> inhibitor paxilline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Zhou and Lingle, 2014</xref>), but not the cell-impermeable blocker iberiotoxin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Candia et al., 1992</xref>), indicating that intracellular BK<sub>Ca</sub>, presumably mitoBK<sub>Ca</sub>, mediates malignant BCC behaviors and tumor development.</p><p>In line with recent single-cell RNA sequencing data of 26 primary breast tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Wu et al., 2021a</xref>), we found high transcript levels for BK<sub>Ca</sub> throughout the analyzed BC samples, in addition to BK<sub>Ca</sub>-DEC, albeit in a much smaller subset of BC. The analyzed BC samples were, however, all positive for hormone receptors. Whether BK<sub>Ca</sub> expression is different in hormone receptor negative specimens hence needs to be further investigated. Further, we confirmed functional BK<sub>Ca</sub> expression in the PM of MMTV-PyMT WT and MDA-MB-453 cells, while MMTV-PyMT BK-KO and MCF-7 cells showed no or very low PM BK<sub>Ca</sub> currents. Therefore, MCF-7 cells represented a suitable model to investigate the effects of BK<sub>Ca</sub> over-/expression on the metabolic homeostasis of human BCC. If the low BK<sub>Ca</sub> expression correlates with hormonal receptor status or alternatively with human epidermal growth factor 2 (HER2) expression levels must be clarified by future studies. Interestingly, however, recent data have shown that BK<sub>Ca</sub> is overexpressed in triple-negative BC, a fact that led the authors to draw similar conclusions to ours, that BK<sub>Ca</sub> may represent a novel anti-cancer treatment strategy for selected BC patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Sizemore et al., 2020</xref>). Nevertheless, similarly to cardiac myocytes (CM), expression of BK<sub>Ca</sub>-DEC yielded mitochondrial localization of BK<sub>Ca</sub>-DEC, although its abundance in the IMM appeared less pronounced compared to CM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Singh et al., 2013</xref>). While a direct comparison is difficult as plasmid transfections may have caused unexpected effects, our finding that BK<sub>Ca</sub>-DEC<sup>RFP</sup> caused significantly reduced currents across the PM compared to BK<sub>Ca</sub><sup>RFP</sup> putatively confirm its increased intracellular abundance.</p><p>Based on the potential impact of BK<sub>Ca</sub> on the cellular ΔΨ<sub>PM</sub> and ion balance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Burgstaller et al., 2022a</xref>), we conducted an in-depth investigation of the (sub)cellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis. Across the BCCs examined, we observed that functional BK<sub>Ca</sub> expression modulated [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>cyto</sub> dynamics. These alterations showed, however, differential sensitivities to BK<sub>Ca</sub> inhibitors in MMTV-PyMT WT and MDA-MB-453 cells. While basal [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>cyto</sub> in MDA-MB-453 cells was reduced by both, paxilline and iberiotoxin treatment, MMTV-PyMT WT cells were only sensitive to paxilline. Examination of [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>ER</sub> confirmed the results from [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>cyto</sub>, as [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>ER</sub> levels increased with paxilline and iberiotoxin in MDA-MB-453, but only upon paxilline exposure in MMTV-PyMT WT cells, suggesting differential effects of intracellular and PM-localized BK<sub>Ca</sub> on Ca<sup>2+</sup> handling in these cells. Interestingly, in MCF-7 cells, both BK<sub>Ca</sub> splice variants mediated the opposing effects on the basal [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>cyto</sub> and [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>ER</sub> levels, which either in- or decreased, respectively, upon transient BK<sub>Ca</sub><sup>RFP</sup> or BK<sub>Ca</sub>-DEC<sup>RFP</sup> expression. This is expected as the transitory hyperpolarization and the efflux of K<sup>+</sup> due to the opening of PM BK<sub>Ca</sub> provides the driving force for Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry into cytoplasm, while a BK<sub>Ca</sub>-mediated K<sup>+</sup> increase within the ER, presumably through PM-directed channels crossing the ER membrane in the secretory pathway, would oppose the Ca<sup>2+</sup> refilling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Burgstaller et al., 2022a</xref>). Moreover, these results are in line with the higher proliferative capability of BK<sub>Ca</sub> proficient BCCs due to the manifold roles of Ca<sup>2+</sup> as second messenger (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Burgstaller et al., 2022a</xref>). Importantly, however, [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>mito</sub> of BK<sub>Ca</sub> proficient MMTV-PyMT WT and MDA-MB-453 cells was exclusively sensitive for paxilline, and it was specifically affected by the expression of BK<sub>Ca</sub>-DEC<sup>RFP</sup>, but not by BK<sub>Ca</sub><sup>RFP</sup>, in MCF-7 cells, suggesting that this Ca<sup>2+</sup> pool is exclusively controlled by intracellular BK<sub>Ca</sub>.</p><p>Subcellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> alterations could reportedly alter cellular bioenergetics, as Ca<sup>2+</sup> directly regulates metabolic enzymes and activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Rossi et al., 2019</xref>). Indeed, extracellular flux analysis, LC-MS-based metabolomics and fluorescence-based live-cell imaging confirmed, that the observed alteration in sub-cellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis caused by BK<sub>Ca</sub>, especially mitoBK<sub>Ca</sub>, has severe effects on cell metabolism. Our data further emphasize, that the presence of mitoBK<sub>Ca</sub>, as confirmed by mitoplast patch-clamp and western blot analyses of isolated mitochondria, depolarizes BCC mitochondria, which is in line with a previous study showing an impact of mitoBK<sub>Ca</sub> activation on ΔΨ<sub>mito</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kicinska et al., 2016</xref>). mitoBK<sub>Ca</sub>-dependent depolarization of ΔΨ<sub>mito</sub> in turn triggers cellular glucose dependency and reverses the activity of the mitochondrial ATP-synthase to consume ATP for restoring ΔΨ<sub>mito</sub>. Finally, BK<sub>Ca</sub>-DEC-derived mitoBK<sub>Ca</sub> channels promote the Warburg effect and ultimately stimulated proliferation rates of BCCs. Our data fit earlier findings from glioma cells, where an O<sub>2</sub>-sensitivity of mitoBK<sub>Ca</sub> was observed, which probably increased the hypoxic resistance of these cancer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gu et al., 2014</xref>). It may seem contradictory that mitoBK<sub>Ca</sub> is highly expressed in CM, which are among one of the most oxidative cell types known. It is, however, important to mention, that CM, under physiologic conditions, do not show a metabolic Warburg setting, which is a common phenomenon of cancer cells propelling their O<sub>2</sub> independency, due to the hypoxic microenvironment. Moreover, it was demonstrated recently that the absence of (mito)BK<sub>Ca</sub> does not alter physiologic cardiac function. Only upon induction of ischemia and reperfusion injury, a lack of (mito)BK<sub>Ca</sub> promoted the susceptibility of the heart to cell death, resulting in increased infarction size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Frankenreiter et al., 2017</xref>). Hence, it can be concluded that (mito)BK<sub>Ca</sub> only played a role under conditions where mitochondria are, due to the absence of O<sub>2</sub>, not properly functioning. Taking this view into account, the results derived from CM are consistent with our findings in BCCs, as (mito)BK<sub>Ca</sub> mediates the resistance to hypoxic stress to BCC.</p><p>Excessive production and release of lactate, a hallmark of the Warburg effect, leads to extracellular acidification, subsequently creating a microenvironment that promotes tumorigenesis and metastasis as well as the resistance to anti-tumor immune responses and therapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">de la Cruz-López et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Nazemi and Rainero, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Wu et al., 2021b</xref>).

To elucidate whether mitoBK<sub>Ca</sub> directly contributes to lactate-induced tumor aggressiveness or [K<sup>+</sup>]<sub>ex</sub>, live-cell imaging of extracellular metabolites in 3D BCC models should be applied in future investigations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Burgstaller et al., 2022b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Burgstaller et al., 2021b</xref>).</p><p>Finally, our results demonstrate for the first time that BK<sub>Ca</sub>-DEC transcripts are present in human BC biopsies. Although only a small proportion of patients was positive for BK<sub>Ca</sub>-DEC expression, this finding could be of considerable clinical relevance considering the link between mitoBK<sub>Ca</sub> function and BCC metabolism. Importantly, the design of our study likely underestimates the incidental number of BK<sub>Ca</sub>-DEC positive BC, as (i) only hormone-receptor positive BC specimens were included, and (ii) bulk-tumor mRNA was analyzed, hampering the detection of low-abundant or tightly regulated transcripts against a strong background of non-cancer cells present in bulk tumor tissues. Finally, due to the small number of positive hits (N = 10 positive <italic>versus</italic> N = 541 BK<sub>Ca</sub>-DEC negative specimens) and the lack of (sufficient) follow-up information in some of these cases, we are currently unable to correlate BK<sub>Ca</sub>-DEC expression with, for example, treatment response or survival. Thus, future studies are warranted to show how the tumor’s BK<sub>Ca</sub>-DEC status can help to predict or therapeutically improve standard chemo-endocrine treatments. The rather low abundance of BK<sub>Ca</sub>-DEC in the clinical samples, however, is in agreement with our mitoplast patch clamp experiments with mitoBK<sub>Ca</sub>-mediated K<sup>+</sup> currents being detected at frequencies between 6 to 15%, suggesting that either a small proportion of mitochondria express functional mitoBK<sub>Ca</sub>, or that the abundance of the channel per mitochondrion is low, requiring sensitive mechanistic approaches for its detection.</p><p>In summary, our data highlight a potentially druggable mitoBK<sub>Ca</sub> isoform in BCCs, whose molecular entity is mainly formed by the <italic>Kcnma1</italic> encoded BK<sub>Ca</sub>-DEC splice variant. This channel promotes metabolic alterations in cancer cells, even under low-oxygen conditions, which may ultimately be of clinical interest for new anti-cancer therapies.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Buffers and solutions</title><p>If not otherwise stated, all chemicals were purchased from Carl Roth GmbH, Karlsruhe, Germany.</p><p>Buffers used in this study comprised the following:</p><p>Physiologic buffer for single-cell live recordings contained (in mM): 138 NaCl, 5 KCl, 2 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 2 glucose, 10 HEPES, pH set to 7.4 with NaOH.

Ion source parameters were as follows: nebulizer gas (GS1, zero grade air) 50 psi, heater gas (GS2, zero grade air) 30 psi, curtain gas (CUR, nitrogen) 30 psi, source temperature (TEM) 450 °C, ion source voltage +5,500 V (positive mode) and –4500 V (negative mode). Due to the large number of transitions monitored simultaneously, the Scheduled-MRM function was enabled. A window of 30 s was set around the designated metabolite-specific retention time and the total cycle time was 1 s. Blank solvents (mobile phase A and B) followed by QCs were injected in the beginning of the chromatographic batch to ensure proper column and system equilibration.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Plasma- and mitochondrial membrane potential measurements</title><p>ΔΨ<sub>PM</sub> was determined using Bis-(1,3-dibutylbarbituric acid)trimethine oxonol (Dibac4(3); Thermo Fisher Scientific).

After cell cultivation on 30 mm glass coverslips in the presence or absence of paxilline, iberiotoxin or DMSO for 12 hr, the cell culture medium was replaced with cell equilibration buffer containing 200 nM TMRM and cells were incubated in ambient environment for 30 minutes. Subsequently, cells were washed with physiologic buffer containing 2 mM or 25 mM glucose and 200 nM TMRM, and cells were equilibrated for further 30 min. The glass coverslips were transferred to the PC30 perfusion chamber and experiments were started using the gravity-based perfusion system (NGFI GmbH). Paxilline, iberiotoxin or DMSO (control) and 200 nM TMRM remained present throughout the experiment. Mitochondrial depolarization was induced by the perfusion of a buffer containing 200 nM FCCP. For analysis, the fluorescence emission at ≥600 nm upon excitation at 575/15 nm of a region of interest (ROI) above mitochondria was divided by a ROI in the nucleus (mitochondria free area) and the ratio was plotted over-time, or basal values were given.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>2-NBDG based glucose uptake measurements</title><p>Glucose uptake was assessed using 2-(N-(7-Nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazol-4-yl)Amino)–2-Deoxyglucose (2-NBDG) (Biomol GmbH). Therefore, cells were seeded on 30 mm glass coverslips (Marienfeld GmbH) in 6-well plates (Corning) and cultivated over-night at 37 °C and 5% CO<sub>2</sub> in a humidified incubator. The next day, cells were taken from the incubator, cell culture medium was replaced for cell equilibration buffer and cells were equilibrated for 30 min at ambient environment. Subsequently, cells were washed 3 x with glucose-free physiologic buffer, and glucose free physiologic buffer containing 100 µM 2-NBDG, with or without paxilline and 200 nM FCCP or an equivalent amount of DMSO, was added to the cells, followed by incubation at 37 °C for 30 min. Next, cells were washed 3 x with glucose free physiologic buffer to remove any residual 2-NBDG and were analyzed by fluorescence microscopy using 485/20 excitation light.

The supernatant was collected, followed by centrifugation at 9200 x <italic>g</italic> for 10 min and resuspension of the mitochondrial fraction in the mitochondrial storage buffer. All procedures were performed at 4 °C.</p><p>An osmotic swelling procedure was used for the preparation of mitoplasts from the isolated mitochondria. Therefore, mitochondria were added to the hypotonic buffer for ~1 min to induce swelling and breakage of the outer mitochondrial membrane. Subsequently, isotonicity of the solution was restored by the addition of hypertonic buffer at a dilution of 1:5.</p><p>Patch-clamp experiments on mitoplasts were performed as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bednarczyk et al., 2013</xref>). The experiments were carried out in mitoplast-attached single-channel mode using borosilicate glass pipettes with a mean resistance of 10–15 MΩ. The patch-clamp glass pipette was filled with mitochondrial storage buffer. This isotonic solution was used as a control solution for all experiments. The size of the pipettes and the formation of the gigaseal were monitored by measuring electrical resistance. Connections were made with Ag/AgCl electrodes and an agar salt bridge (3 M KCl) for the ground electrode. The current was recorded using an Axopatch 200B patch-clamp amplifier (Molecular Devices, California, USA). To apply substances, a self-made perfusion system containing a holder with a glass pipe, a peristaltic pump, and Teflon tubing was used. All channel modulators were added as dilutions in the isotonic solution containing 100 μM CaCl<sub>2</sub>.</p><p>The presented single-channel current-time recordings are representative for the most frequently observed conductances under the given conditions. The conductance was calculated from the current-voltage relationship.

The present study, carried out in breast cancer cell lines, concludes that BK located in mitochondria reprograms cells towards the Warburg phenotype, one of the metabolic hallmarks of cancer.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>The use of a wide array of modern complementary techniques, including metabolic imaging, respirometry, metabolomics and electrophysiology. On the whole experiments are astute and well designed, and appear carefully done. The use of a BK knock out cells to control for the specificity of the pharmacological tools is a major strength. The manuscript is clearly written. There are many interesting original observations that may give birth to new studies.</p><p>Weaknesses: The main conclusion regarding the role of a BK channel located in mitochondria appears is not sufficiently supported. Other perfectible aspects are the interpretation of co-localization experiments and the calibration of Ca2+ dyes. These points are discussed in more detail in the following paragraphs:</p><p>(1) May the metabolic effects be ascribed to a BK located in mitochondria? Unfortunately not, at least with the available evidence. While it is clear these cells have a BK in mitochondria (characteristic K+ currents detected in mitoplasts) and it is also well substantiated that the metabolic effects in intact cells are explained by an intracellular BK (paxilline effects absent in the BK KO), it does not follow that both observations are linked. Given that ectopic BK-DEC appeared at the surface, a confounding factor is the likely expression of BK in other intracellular locations such as ER, Golgi, endosomes, etc. To their credit authors acknowledge this limitation several times throughout the text (&quot;...presumably mitoBK...&quot;) but not in other important places, particularly in title and abstract.</p><p>(2) mitoBK subcellular location. Pearson correlations of 0.6 and about zero were obtained between the locations of mitoGREEN on one side, and mRFP or RFP-GPI on the other (Figs. 1G and S1E). These are nice positive and negative controls. For BK-DECRFP however the Pearson correlation was about 0.2. What is the Z resolution of apotome imaging? Assuming an optimum optical section of 600 nm, as obtained a 1.4 NA objective with a confocal, that mitochondria are typically 100 nm in diameter and that BK-DECRFP appears to stain more structures that mitoGREEN, the positive correlation of 0.2 may not reflect colocalization. For instance, it could be that BK-DECRFP in not just in mitochondria but in a close underlying organelle e.g. the ER. Along the same line, why did BK-RFP also give a positive Pearson? Isn´t that unexpected? Considering that BK-DEC was found by patch clamping at the plasma membrane, the subcellular targeting of the channel is suspect. Could it be that the endogenous BK-DEC does actually reside exclusively in mitochondria (a true mitoBK), but overflows to other membranes upon overexpression? Regarding immunodetection of BK in the mitochondrial Percoll preparation (Fig. S5), absence of NKA demonstrates absence of plasma membrane contamination, but does not inform about contamination by other intracellular membranes.</p><p>(3) Calibration of fluorescent probes. The conclusion that BK blockers or BK expression affects resting Ca2+ levels should be better supported. Fluorescent sensors and dyes provide signals or ratios that need be calibrated if comparisons between different cell types or experimental conditions are to be made. This is implicitly acknowledged here when monitoring ER Ca2+, with an elaborate protocol to deplete the organelle in order to achieve a reading at zero Ca2+.</p><p>(4) Line 203. &quot;...solely by the expression of BKCa-DECRFP in MCF-7 cells&quot;. Granted, the effect of BKCa-DECRFP on the basal FRET ratio appears stronger than that of BK-RFP, but it appears that the latter had some effect. Please provide the statistics of the latter against the control group (after calibration, see above).</p><p>The revised version of the manuscript has incorporated my suggestions to a very reasonable degree, in several cases with new experiments. The details of these improvements can be found in the correspondence.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="referee-report" id="sa3"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.92511.3.sa3</article-id><title-group><article-title>Reviewer #3 (Public Review):</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><anonymous/><role specific-use="referee">Reviewer</role></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>The original research article, titled &quot;mitoBKCa is functionally expressed in murine and human breast cancer cells and promotes metabolic reprogramming&quot; by Bischof et al, has demonstrated the underlying molecular mechanisms of alterations in the function of Ca2+ activated K+ channel of large conductance (BKCa) in the development and progression of breast cancer.

Additionally, Ca2+cyto was calibrated under basal and inhibitor treated conditions, and values in nM are given in the text (p. 5, lines 185-190, 193-195 and 199-200, in the tracked changes version of the MS). The new data can be found in new Figure S2F – Figure S2J and new Figure S2R – Figure S2V. Moreover, we calculated basal [Ca2+]cyto in the different BKCa pro- and deficient cell lines and under inhibitor treated conditions.

Without calibration, it is hard to compare unless the identical uptake of the dye is shown. Does paxilline or IbTx also induce depolarization?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the suggestion. Indeed, membrane potential calibrations/ measurements using the membrane potential sensitive dye Dibac4(3) would be interesting, however, technically hardly feasible. The reason is that the principle of the dye is based on different uptake in response to differences in membrane potential, and not ratiometric as for most other dyes/ sensors used. Considering this limitation, we decided to perform membrane potential measurements by patch-clamp analysis. Additionally, we performed these experiments upon inhibition of PM-located BKCa by IBTX. Current-clamp experiments confirmed the difference in basal membrane potential between MMTV-PyMT WT and BK-KO cells (consult new Figure S1C and lines 127-130 in the tracked changes version of the manuscript). Interestingly, IBTX treatment depolarized the PM potential to the BK-KO cell level, which validates that BK activity and PM potential are connected. In addition to this approach, we utilized our recently developed genetically encoded K+ sensors revealing basal differences in [K+]cyto between MMTV-PyMT WT and BK-KO cells. Also this difference between both genotypes was equalized by IBTX as the respective treatment increased [K+]cyto only in WT cells, which most likely explains the cause of PM depolarization (consult lines 130-135 in the tracked changes version of the manuscript and new Figure S1D and Figure S1E).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) Mito-potential measurements: Why did the authors use such a long time course and preincubate cells with channel blockers overnight? Why did they not perform paired experiments and record the immediate effect of the BK channel blockers in the mito potential?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the suggestion. We performed TMRM-based experiments with MMTV-PyMT WT cells in response to short-term exposure to paxilline, which did not significantly affect the mitochondrial membrane potential, at least within 15 minutes of treatment (Author response image 2). This indicates, that further downstream processes subsequent to (mito) BKCa inhibition affect the mitochondrial membrane potential(MMP), most probably including remodeling processes of the respiratory chain, mitochondrial ion homeostasis or glycolytic activity, ultimately also delivering reduction equivalents to mitochondria. Our final goal was to validate potential differences between a BKCa pro-and deficient cell model, whereby the latter cells lacked the BKCa channel since its origination. Hence, “long-term” (~12h) BKCa inhibition as performed in our experiments rather reflects the BK-KO cell situation. Taken together with the new experiment (Author response image 2), we can now state that the effect of BK inhibition on the MMP is at least not the consequence of an acute (within minutes) channel blockade.</p><fig id="sa4fig2" position="float"><label>Author response image 2.</label><caption><title>Mitochondrial membrane potential, as measured using TMRM, in response to acute short-term administration of 5µM paxilline, followed by mitochondrial depolarization using FCCP.</title></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-92511-sa4-fig2-v1.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) MTT assays are also based on mitochondrial function - since modulation of mito function is at the core of this manuscript, an alternative method should be used.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the important comment.

Is it possible to theoretically predict the number of mitoBK channels per mitochondrion to elicit the observed effects? Can these results be correlated with the immuno-localization of mitoBK channels?</p></disp-quote><p>Indeed, the number of BKCa-positive mitoplasts appears low on a first view. However, as these experiments were performed in a mitoplast-attached mode, it is important to keep in mind that only a very small area of the actual mitoplast is investigated with each patch. If no channel was detected in such region, the patch was depicted as “empty”, as presented in Fig.5G, which does, however, not mean that the entire mitochondria was actually BKCa negative. Hence, the density of BKCa in the IMM might be higher than expected from our experiments. Nevertheless, already earlier results using glioblastoma cell lines – considered to be one of the cell lines mostly enriched in mitoBKCa – demonstrated a quite low density of BKCa β4 regulatory subunit in mitochondria – please see figure 2B in the following paper: 10.1371/journal.pone.0068125 – which (based on 1:1 stoichiometry of α and β subunits) also suggests that the density of the alpha subunit of BKCa might be low in this compartment.</p><fig id="sa4fig3" position="float"><label>Author response image 3.</label><caption><title>Author response image 3: Schematic representation of mitoplast attached patch-clamp experiments.</title></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-92511-sa4-fig3-v1.tif"/></fig><p>Theoretically, density predictions of mitoBK compared to PM localized BKCa would be possible if whole-mitoplast experiments were performed, however, we are unsure what added value this information would actually burst, allowing the pharmacologic modulation of structures originally located within the mitochondrial matrix.

According to the most recent models, even if there are other views on this, mitoBKCa is oriented in a way, that the C-terminus with its Ca2+ binding bowl is located within the mitochondrial matrix. Hence, to allow Ca2+ sensitivity experiments of the channel, broken up (by swelling) mitoplasts are required to make the Ca2+ binding bowl accessible for Ca2+ manipulations in the bath solution.

This is also consistent with our data (Fig.5G), where we observed other channels in the mitoplasts of BCCs as well. These all four cell lines tested. According to their conductance and our expectations from literature, these channels may e.g. include mitoIKCa, mitoSKCa, mitoKATP orothers (10.1146/annurev-biophys-092622-094853). As we focused, however, on patches containing a mitoBKCa, we did not further pharmacologically characterize these channels. Two examples of channels we found in these mitoplasts besides BKCa are presented for reviewers’ inspection (Author response image 4). As our manuscript focusses on mitoBKCa, we did not further classify these channels in smaller subgroups according to their conductance, as we feel that a differentiation between BKCa (~210 pS), and channels showing a conductance ≤150pS, or a conductance ≤100 pS is sufficient. Furthermore, this additional information would dilute our story too much making it difficult for the (non-specialist) reader to follow the red thread of the study. We added respective information in the manuscript, however. Please consult lines 365-366 in the tracked changes version of the manuscript.</p><p>Reviewer #1 is right, the observed the different K+ channels might of course be organ- or tumor-specific. For example, it has been reported that the expression of K+ channels is different in various cancer cell (lines) (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.2174/13816128113199990032">https://doi.org/10.2174/13816128113199990032</ext-link>, 10.1016/j.pharmthera.2021.107874, 10.1038/nrc3635), a fact, which also according to our study might be exploited for pharmacological manipulation, aiming to affect proliferation/apoptosis of cancer cells. Further, a recently published single-cell and spatially resolved atlas of human breast cancer implies that the expression of different K+ channels (such as mitoIKCa, mitoSKCa, mitoKATP) might even differ between cancer- and non-cancer cells within a single tumour (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41588-021-00911-1">https://doi.org/10.1038/s41588-021-00911-1</ext-link>).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>The large-conductance Ca2+ activated K+ channel (BK) has been reported to promote breast cancer progression, but it is not clear how.

The manuscript is clearly written.</p><p>There are many interesting original observations that may give birth to new studies.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>The main conclusion regarding the role of a BK channel located in mitochondria appears is not sufficiently supported. Other perfectible aspects are the interpretation of co-localization experiments and the calibration of Ca2+ dyes. These points are discussed in more detail in the following paragraphs:</p></disp-quote><p>We thank reviewer #2 for the thorough assessment of our study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(1) May the metabolic effects be ascribed to a BK located in mitochondria? Unfortunately not, at least with the available evidence. While it is clear these cells have a BK in mitochondria (characteristic K+ currents detected in mitoplasts) and it is also well substantiated that the metabolic effects in intact cells are explained by an intracellular BK (paxilline effects absent in the BK KO), it does not follow that both observations are linked. Given that ectopic BKDEC appeared at the surface, a confounding factor is the likely expression of BK in other intracellular locations such as ER, Golgi, endosomes, etc. To their credit, authors acknowledge this limitation several times throughout the text (&quot;...presumably mitoBK...&quot;) but not in other important places, particularly in the title and abstract.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this important comment and amended the title and abstract, respectively. The title of the manuscript was changed to “mitoBKCa is functionally expressed in murine and human breast cancer cells and potentially contributes to metabolic reprogramming.” Additionally, we changed appropriate passages in the text, to emphasize that mitoBKCa potentially mediates the metabolic reprogramming, but other intracellular channels could also contribute to these processes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) MitoBK subcellular location. Pearson correlations of 0.6 and about zero were obtained between the locations of mitoGREEN on one side, and mRFP or RFP-GPI on the other (Figs. 1G and S1E). These are nice positive and negative controls. For BK-DECRFP however, the Pearson correlation was about 0.2. What is the Z resolution of apotome imaging? Assuming an optimum optical section of 600 nm, as obtained by a 1.4 NA objective with a confocal, that mitochondria are typically 100 nm in diameter and that BK-DECRFP appears to stain more structures than mitoGREEN, the positive correlation of 0.2 may not reflect colocalization. For instance, it could be that BK-DECRFP is not just in mitochondria but in a close underlying organelle e.g. the ER. Along the same line, why did BK-RFP also give a positive Pearson? Isn´t that unexpected? Considering that BK-DEC was found by patch clamping at the plasma membrane, the subcellular targeting of the channel is suspect. Could it be that the endogenous BK-DEC does actually reside exclusively in mitochondria (a true mitoBK), but overflows to other membranes upon overexpression? Regarding immunodetection of BK in the mitochondrial Percoll preparation (Fig. S5), the absence of NKA demonstrates the absence of plasma membrane contamination but does not inform about contamination by other intracellular membranes.</p></disp-quote><p>Indeed, it seems that BKCa-DEC is not an exclusive mitoBKCa, at least not upon (over-/)expression in MCF-7 cells. It is known from literature, that mitochondrial K+ channels are encoded by the nuclear genome, as no obvious gene for a K+ channel is found in the mitochondrial genome. Channel proteins are synthetized by cytosolic ribosomes and likely translocated into mitochondria via the TOM/TIM system. Although some K+ channels possess a mitochondrial targeting sequence at the N-terminus, their import is mostly far from a general mechanism, and this seems also to be true for BK channels. In the case of the K+ channel Kv1.3, an even more complex scenario is hypothesized, as the channel located in the PM could be transferred to mitochondria via mitochondria-associated membranes (MAM) structures of the ER (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms20030734">https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms20030734</ext-link>). Yet, the detailed mechanism for BK shuttling to mitochondria is not fully understood. Possibly, overflow is exactly what is happening, due to very high levels of BK-DEC expression upon transfection. However, that the channel translocates to the IMM upon transfection is not surprising and was also demonstrated for other cell models including HEK293 – see e.g. 10.1038/s41598-021-904653. Unfortunately, transfection efficiency of MCF-7 is quite low compared to HEK293 – hence, quantitative statements from mito-patches upon transfection are difficult.</p><p>In order to ensure that the mitochondrial colocalization is not a matter of poor microscope resolution, we reperformed these experiments using confocal imaging on a Zeiss LSM980 with an Airyscan 2 detector, yielding z resolutions of ~ 450 nm. These experiments confirmed the increased colocalization of BKCa-DEC with mitochondria compared to BKCa lacking the DEC exon. Furthermore, this imaging at higher resolution demonstrated, that, unfortunately, colocalization might not be the best analysis, as especially fragmented mitochondria showed a clear MitoGREEN stained matrix, surrounded by red fluorescence derived from BKCaDECRFP present in the IMM (revised Fig. 1G).</p><p>To validate the results derived from immunoblotting, we additionally stained the membranes for TMX1, a marker for the ER membrane. This analysis confirmed the high purity of the mitochondrial isolation without ER-membrane contamination after percoll purification, and hence validated the presence of BKCa in the mitochondrial membrane (revised Fig. S5D). The additional information can be found in lines 156-159 in the tracked changes version of the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) Calibration of fluorescent probes. The conclusion that BK blockers or BK expression affects resting Ca2+ levels should be better supported. Fluorescent sensors and dyes provide signals or ratios that need to be calibrated if comparisons between different cell types or experimental conditions are to be made. This is implicitly acknowledged here when monitoring ER Ca2+, with an elaborate protocol to deplete the organelle in order to achieve a reading at zero Ca2+.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the important comment. Please note that at no point in the manuscript we aim to compare different cell lines concerning their intracellular Ca2+ concentration, but we only compare the same cell lines after the different treatments, as we are aware of this limitation of fluorescent probes. However, to validate the differences in intracellular Ca2+ concentrations, we calibrated the signals derived from Fura-2 and 4mtD3cpV using ionomycin in combination with cellular Ca2+ depletion/ saturation.

The statement &quot;Similar results were obtained in MDA-MB-453 cells&quot; is confusing. As shown in Fig.3, pax reduced ECAR and OCR in MMTV-PyMT WT cells. As ibtx was without effect, it is suggested that intracellular BK support metabolism. However, the effect of pax on MDA cells was the opposite. Doesn´t this divergence speak against a universal role of intracellular BKs in promoting metabolism in BCCs? A similar point may be made regarding metabolomics, which showed no effects of pax on lactate and pyruvate in MMTV-PyMT WT cells but stimulation in MDA cells. Perhaps the word &quot;promotes&quot; in the title of the figure should be replaced by something more neutral like &quot;affects&quot; or &quot;alters&quot;, as used elsewhere,</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for pointing out the overstatement regarding intracellular BK functions and changed the title of the figure as suggested.</p><p>With regard to the experiments mentioned, we would like to point out the following aspects:</p><p>First, the cell lines used strongly differ in their metabolic settings under basal conditions. While both, MMTV-PyMT and MDA-MB-453 cells seem to show similar basal ECAR levels (if BKCa was present), their OCR seems to differ strongly. MMTV-PyMT cells seem to show a basal OCR which is almost at the maximum already, while MDA-MB-453 cells possess a tremendous capacity in their OCR, as observed upon mitochondrial uncoupling using FCCP. Of note, both, ECAR and OCR are indirect metabolic measures. On the one hand, ECAR measures extracellular acidification, which is accomplished by H+ along with lactate secretion. However, lactate secretion is not the only process leading to extracellular acidification, and ECAR may hence measure a variety of H+ releasing processes, including processes of vesicle secretion. On the other hand, OCR is not directly linked to ATP production, as mitochondrial complex IV is consuming O2, ATP, however, is produced by mitochondrial complex V. This becomes even more evident when having a look on OCRs after FCCP treatment – under these conditions, the H+ gradient is destroyed and ATP synthase activity is reduced, OCR, however, increases to the maximum due to increased supply of mitochondrial complex IV with H+.</p><p>Second, please note that the LC-MS-based metabolomics derive from a static single time point and not from an over-time “live” read-outs. Moreover, underlying dynamics of the parameters measured can not be assessed. Hence, as an example, increasing levels of pyruvate can e.g. indicate faster generation, or slower subsequent degradation/ metabolization. A clear in-depth statement about what is happening under basal and BKCa inhibitor treated conditions is hence not possible. The only conclusion possible to draw from these experiments is that paxilline treatment differentially affects metabolic pathways in these cells.</p><p>Based on these limitations of both methods, we decided to perform our in-depth fluorescence microscopy-based analysis, which provided strong evidence for intracellular BKCa channels on mitochondrial ATP production. Despite opposing effects of BKCa inhibition on OCR in MMTV-PyMT WT and MDA-MB-453 cells, mitochondrial ATP production was reduced, if BKCa-DECRFP was expressed/ intracellular BKCa was functional.</p><p>In line with these findings, mitoBKCa was recently described as an uncoupling protein, which could furthermore explain the differential effects of intracellular BKCa inhibition on OCR. <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-90465-3">https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-90465-3</ext-link></p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Minor</p><p>(6) Fig. 1C.

It is correct that fluorescent proteins vary widely between the sensors (used). Please note, however, the following: The emission measured from these sensors actually represents FRET, as CFP but not YFP is directly excited. Hence, emission is FRET, not the “intrinsic” fluorescence of the YFP. This is getting more and more important to differentiate, as there are probes existing, which can also be “alternately” excited, i.e. CFP and YFP separately, which will then yield the YFP/CFP ratio (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1021/acssensors.8b01599">https://doi.org/10.1021/acssensors.8b01599</ext-link>).

However, BK-DEC was first described in cardiomyocytes, which are among the most oxidative cell types. It would be useful if authors could address this apparent contradiction in the Discussion Section.</p></disp-quote><p>That is an exciting point that we addressed as follows in the revised MS:</p><p>First, it is important to mention that cardiac myocytes do not show a metabolic Warburg setting and are – under physiologic conditions – maintained in a high O2 environment.</p><p>Second, a recent study from our group addressed the question about the role of mitoBKCa in primary cardiac myocytes. Indeed, mitoBKCa was functionally expressed in these cells. Interestingly, under physiologic conditions, the channel did not alter (multiple) cell behaviours nor overall cardiac physiology in a mouse model. However, upon induction of ischemia/ reperfusion injury, a lack of BK increased cardiac susceptibility to cell death resulting in increased infarction size (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.117.028723">https://doi.org/10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.117.028723</ext-link>). Hence, also in this cell model, BKCa only played a role under oxygen limited conditions/ conditions where mitochondria were not properly functioning. Thus, the results derived from cardiac myocytes support our recent findings in BCCs, as BKCa mediates BCC resistance to hypoxic stress/ makes BCCs more independent from oxidative metabolism.</p><p>Parts of this discussion were included in the revised MS.
