homeostasis, also regulates adhesion and migration in CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells. <italic>Wnk1</italic> is highly expressed in thymocytes, and since migration is important for thymocyte maturation, we investigated a role for WNK1 in mouse thymocyte development. We find that WNK1 is required for the transition of double negative (DN) thymocytes through the β-selection checkpoint and subsequent proliferation and differentiation into double positive (DP) thymocytes. Furthermore, we show that WNK1 negatively regulates LFA1-mediated adhesion and positively regulates CXCL12-induced migration in DN thymocytes. Despite this, migration defects of WNK1-deficient thymocytes do not account for the developmental arrest. Instead, we show that in DN thymocytes WNK1 transduces pre-TCR signals via OXSR1 and STK39 kinases, and the SLC12A2 ion co-transporter that are required for post-transcriptional upregulation of MYC and subsequent proliferation and differentiation into DP thymocytes. Thus, a pathway regulating ion homeostasis is a critical regulator of thymocyte development.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>thymocytes</kwd><kwd>signal transduction</kwd><kwd>WNK1</kwd><kwd>pre-TCR</kwd><kwd>CXCR4</kwd><kwd>MYC</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000265</institution-id><institution>Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>U117527252</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tybulewicz</surname><given-names>Victor LJ</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010438</institution-id><institution>Francis Crick Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>FC001194</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tybulewicz</surname><given-names>Victor LJ</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000265</institution-id><institution>Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>FC001194</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tybulewicz</surname><given-names>Victor LJ</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>FC001194</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tybulewicz</surname><given-names>Victor LJ</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000289</institution-id><institution>Cancer Research UK</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>FC001194</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tybulewicz</surname><given-names>Victor LJ</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000268</institution-id><institution>Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BB/L00805X/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tybulewicz</surname><given-names>Victor LJ</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000265</institution-id><institution>Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MR/N000919/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Anderson</surname><given-names>Graham</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Development of mouse thymocytes through the pre-TCR checkpoint requires WNK1 kinase signalling via the OXSR1 and STK39 kinases and the SLC12A2 ion co-transporter leading to MYC-dependent cell proliferation.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>With No Lysine kinase 1 (WNK1) is a member of a family of four mammalian serine/threonine-specific protein kinases that are broadly conserved across evolution and are found in all multicellular organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Veríssimo and Jordan, 2001</xref>). Mutations in <italic>WNK1</italic> and <italic>WNK4</italic> result in familial hypertension due to altered salt reabsorption in the kidney, because they regulate ion transport in kidney epithelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Wilson et al., 2001</xref>). WNK kinases phosphorylate and activate the related OXSR1 and STK39 kinases, which in turn phosphorylate and activate the Na<sup>+</sup>K<sup>+</sup>Cl<sup>-</sup> co-transporters SLC12A1 and SLC12A2 and the Na<sup>+</sup>Cl<sup>-</sup> co-transporter SLC12A3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Rafiqi et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Thastrup et al., 2012</xref>), allowing Na<sup>+</sup>, K<sup>+</sup>, and Cl<sup>-</sup> ions to enter the cell. Furthermore, they phosphorylate and inhibit the K<sup>+</sup>Cl<sup>-</sup> co-transporters SLC12A4, SLC12A5, SLC12A6, SLC12A7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Mercado et al., 2016</xref>), blocking K<sup>+</sup> and Cl<sup>-</sup> from leaving the cell. Thus, the net effect of WNK kinase signaling is to promote movement of Na<sup>+</sup>, K<sup>+</sup>, and Cl<sup>-</sup> ions into the cell. Beyond its role in ion homeostasis, WNK1 has been proposed to regulate vesicular trafficking, proliferation and cell volume (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">de Los Heros et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">McCormick and Ellison, 2011</xref>).</p><p>Unexpectedly, we recently showed that signaling from both the T-cell antigen receptor (TCR) and from the CCR7 chemokine receptor in CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells lead to activation of WNK1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Köchl et al., 2016</xref>). Furthermore, we found that WNK1 is a negative regulator of TCR- or CCR7-induced adhesion to ICAM1 mediated by LFA1. Conversely, WNK1 is a positive regulator of chemokine-induced migration through OXSR1, STK39, and SLC12A2. As a result, WNK1-deficient T cells home less efficiently to lymphoid organs and migrate more slowly through them. Thus, a pathway that regulates salt homeostasis in the kidney, also controls T-cell adhesion and migration.</p><p><italic>Wnk1</italic> expression levels are particularly high in the thymus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Shekarabi et al., 2013</xref>), where αβ and γδ T cells develop. Generation of αβ T cells occurs through a series of well-defined developmental subsets. The most immature double negative (DN) thymocytes, expressing neither CD4 nor CD8, can be subdivided into DN1 (CD25<sup>-</sup>CD44<sup>+</sup>CD117<sup>+</sup>, early thymic progenitors, ETP), DN2 (CD25<sup>+</sup>CD44<sup>+</sup>CD117<sup>+</sup>), DN3 (CD25<sup>+</sup>CD44<sup>-</sup>CD117<sup>-</sup>) and DN4 (CD25<sup>-</sup>CD44<sup>-</sup>CD117<sup>-</sup>) subsets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bhandoola et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Godfrey et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Yui et al., 2010</xref>). Subsequently, the cells upregulate CD8 and then CD4, becoming CD4<sup>-</sup>CD8<sup>+</sup>immature single positive (ISP) cells and then CD4<sup>+</sup>CD8<sup>+</sup>double positive (DP) thymocytes. Finally, they lose expression of either CD4 or CD8 to become CD4<sup>+</sup> or CD8<sup>+</sup> single positive (4SP or 8SP) cells and emigrate from the thymus as CD4<sup>+</sup> or CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells.</p><p>To generate T cells that have successfully rearranged both TCRα and TCRβ genes and express an αβTCR that is both restricted by self-MHC and self-tolerant, thymocytes need to pass three checkpoints (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Carpenter and Bosselut, 2010</xref>). Thymic progenitors migrate from the bone marrow via the blood, entering the thymus at the cortico-medullary junction as DN1 cells (ETP). DN2 and DN3 thymocytes begin to re-arrange TCRβ genes and migrate to the sub-capsular zone of the cortex. If rearrangement is successful, TCRβ protein binds to pre-Tα and together with CD3γ, CD3δ, CD3ε and CD3ζ forms the pre-TCR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Yamasaki and Saito, 2007</xref>). Signals from the pre-TCR within DN3 cells result in an increase in cell size and expression of CD27 andCD28, changes which can be used to distinguish DN3a and DN3b cells before and after pre-TCR signaling respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hoffman et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Taghon et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Teague et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Williams et al., 2005</xref>). Pre-TCR signals are required for the survival and proliferative expansion of DN3b and DN4 thymocytes, and subsequent differentiation into ISP and DP cells, a checkpoint termed β-selection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kreslavsky et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Mingueneau et al., 2013</xref>). Progression through this checkpoint is also supported by signals from CXCR4 and NOTCH1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Janas et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Maillard et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Trampont et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>Subsequently, DP thymocytes, now in the cortex, rearrange TCRα genes. If they successfully make an αβTCR that can bind weakly to self-peptide-MHC complexes, the cells undergo positive selection into 4SP and 8SP cells and migrate into the medulla (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Klein et al., 2014</xref>). Alternatively, if the αβTCR binds strongly to self-peptide-MHC, auto-reactive T cells are eliminated by negative selection.</p><p>In view of the important role of migration during thymocyte development, the high expression of <italic>Wnk1</italic> in the thymus, and our previous work showing that WNK1 regulates adhesion and migration of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, we investigated a potential role for WNK1 during thymocyte development. We find that WNK1 is required for DN thymocytes to progress past the β-selection checkpoint. We show that in DN thymocytes, WNK1 is a negative regulator of LFA1-mediated adhesion and a positive regulator of chemokine-induced migration. However, changes in migration are unlikely to cause the developmental arrest in WNK1-deficient thymocytes. Instead, WNK1, acting through OXSR1, STK39 and SLC12A2, is required for pre-TCR-induced post-transcriptional upregulation of MYC, and subsequent proliferation of DN4 thymocytes and differentiation into DP cells. Thus, a pathway that regulates ion homeostasis is a critical and previously unknown regulator of early thymocyte development.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>WNK1 pathway genes expressed throughout thymic development</title><p>To extend the previous observation that <italic>Wnk1</italic> is expressed at a high level in the thymus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Shekarabi et al., 2013</xref>), we re-analyzed RNAseq data from multiple stages of thymic development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hu et al., 2013</xref>), focusing on expression of WNK-family kinases and proteins in the WNK pathway. We found that <italic>Wnk1</italic> is the only member of the WNK-family expressed in thymocytes, with high expression at all stages of development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).

To determine if this β-selection checkpoint might be compromised in WNK1-deficient thymocytes, we used cell size and expression of CD28 to separate DN3 thymocytes into DN3a (small, CD28<sup>-</sup>) and DN3b (large, CD28<sup>+</sup>) cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hoffman et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Teague et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Williams et al., 2005</xref>), which correspond to cells before and after the checkpoint respectively. Loss of WNK1 results in no change in the number of DN3a cells, but a substantial drop in DN3b and DN4 cells, consistent with a block at the pre-TCR β-selection checkpoint (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). To evaluate if this block could be due to a failure to assemble the pre-TCR, we assessed expression of pre-TCR components. Flow cytometric analysis of DN2 and DN3 thymocytes showed that a similar fraction (~10%) of both control and WNK1-deficient cells expressed intracellular TCRβ, corresponding to cells that have successfully rearranged the TCRβ locus, indicating that loss of WNK1 does not impair TCRβ locus rearrangement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). A similar analysis of DN4 cells showed that most control cells expressed intracellular TCRβ, as would be expected for cells successfully undergoing β-selection. In contrast, only ~10% of WNK1-deficient DN4 cells express intracellular TCRβ, similar to the percentage in DN3 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Thus, in the absence of WNK1, there is no selective expansion of TCRβ<sup>+</sup> cells. Cell-surface levels of CD3ε and pre-Tα in WNK1-deficient DN2 and DN3 cells were comparable to controls, while CD3ε levels were increased in WNK1-deficient DN4 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Taken together, these results show that the developmental block in WNK1-deficient DN thymocytes is unlikely to be due to a failure to make pre-TCR subunits.

Thus, the block in development of WNK1-deficient thymocytes may be due to defects in this stereotypical CXCR4-induced migration. To address this, we generated mixed bone marrow chimeras by reconstituting irradiated B6.SJL mice (CD45.1<sup>+</sup>CD45.2<sup>-</sup>) with an 80:20 mixture of marrow from B6.SJL mice and from either <italic>Wnk1</italic><sup>fl/+</sup><italic>Rag1</italic><sup>-/-</sup>CD2-Cre or <italic>Wnk1</italic><sup>fl/fl</sup><italic>Rag1</italic><sup>-/-</sup>CD2-Cre mice (CD45.1<sup>-</sup>CD45.2<sup>+</sup>). In the thymi of these animals, the RAG1-deficient hematopoietic cells can only develop as far as the DN3 stage, and we were able to analyze their distribution within normal thymic architecture generated by the excess of wild-type B6.SJL thymocytes. We found that WNK1-deficient DN3 cells accumulated in the sub-cortical zone with a similar frequency to WNK1-expressing cells and showed no excess accumulation at the cortico-medullary junction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>). Thus, despite an in vitro migration defect, WNK1-deficient DN3 thymocytes migrate to the correct anatomical location in vivo, even when in competition with WT counterparts. Collectively these data indicate that the developmental block seen in WNK-1 deficient thymocytes is unlikely to be caused by defective localization within intra-thymic microenvironments.</p><p>To extend this, we made use of an in vitro thymocyte development assay in which DN thymocytes are cultured on OP9-DL1 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Schmitt and Zúñiga-Pflücker, 2002</xref>). In this system, over the course of 7d, thymocyte expansion and development occurs independently of the intra-thymic migration events seen in the thymus in vivo.

As expected, we found that WNK1-expressing DN thymocytes expanded 100-fold in number and the majority differentiated into DP, 4SP and 8SP cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>).

Instead, the developmental block in WNK1-deficient thymocytes is more likely caused by defective signaling from the pre-TCR, CXCR4 or both.</p><p>Interestingly, the loss of WNK1 does not affect development of γδ thymocytes. The decision of whether DN thymocytes develop into the αβ or the γδ lineage is most likely driven by signal strength: a weak pre-TCR signal or a strong TCRγδ signal resulting in αβ or γδ development respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Sumaria et al., 2019</xref>). Our data imply that the stronger TCRγδ signal does not require WNK1.</p><p>Our results demonstrate that WNK1 transduces signals from the pre-TCR and CXCR4 in DN thymocytes. Furthermore, we showed that WNK1-deficient cells have increased anti-CD3ε- and CXCL12-induced LFA1-mediated adhesion and reduced CXCL12-induced migration. Thus, WNK1 is a negative regulator of adhesion and a positive regulator of migration in DN3 thymocytes. This mirrors our findings in CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, where we showed that WNK1 transduces signals from the TCR and CCR7 in CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells to regulate both adhesion and migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Köchl et al., 2016</xref>). WNK1 may be independently acting downstream of both the pre-TCR and CXCR4, but the two receptors may co-localize, with CXCR4 acting as a co-receptor for the pre-TCR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Trampont et al., 2010</xref>); other studies have shown that the TCR and CXCR4 physically associate to form a complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kumar et al., 2006</xref>). Thus, WNK1 may transduce signals from a pre-TCR–CXCR4 complex.</p><p>CXCR4-deficient mice show a strong developmental block at the β-selection checkpoint, similar to that seen in the absence of WNK1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Janas et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Trampont et al., 2010</xref>). This block was ascribed to mislocalization of DN3 thymocytes, with fewer cells reaching the sub-capsular zone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Trampont et al., 2010</xref>). Reduced CXCL12-induced migration of WNK1-deficient DN3 thymocytes in vitro suggested that mislocalization of DN3 cells may also account for the developmental arrest in WNK1-deficient thymi. However in vivo we found that WNK1-deficient DN3 thymocytes localized correctly to the sub-capsular zone and defective migration is unlikely to account for the developmental defect. This conclusion is further supported by the strong developmental arrest of WNK1-deficient thymocytes cultured on OP9-DL1 cells, a system where thymocyte development does not require migration. Since development of DP cells in this system requires CXCL12 produced by the OP9-DL1 cells, CXCR4 contributes to development through the β-selection checkpoint by more than just controlling thymocyte migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Janas et al., 2010</xref>). Indeed, CXCR4, acting with the pre-TCR is required for proliferation of DN thymocytes as they undergo β-selection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Trampont et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>Analysis of WNK1-deficient DN3 thymocytes responding to pre-TCR signals showed that the initial responses of the cells are largely normal. They increase rates of translation, transiently induce expression of <italic>Nur77</italic>, upregulate expression of <italic>Cd27</italic> and <italic>Cd28</italic>, downregulate expression of <italic>Il2ra</italic>, <italic>Rag2</italic> and <italic>Ptcra</italic>, and lose surface expression of CD25, phenotypically becoming DN4 thymocytes. Furthermore, after 3 hr of stimulation with anti-CD3ε, they progress into the late G1 phase of the cell cycle as indicated by upregulation of <italic>Cdk6</italic>, <italic>Ccnd2,</italic> and <italic>Ccnd3</italic>. However, they have a profound block in entry into S-phase 24 hr after stimulation, with reduced expression of <italic>Cdk2</italic>, <italic>Ccne1,</italic> and <italic>Ccne2</italic>, as well as genes encoding E2F-, ORC-, and MCM-family proteins. In agreement with this, many fewer WNK1-deficient DN4 thymocytes entered S/G2/M phases of the cell cycle. Since proliferation of DN thymocytes is required for their differentiation into DP cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kreslavsky et al., 2012</xref>), this proliferative defect also accounts for the failure of WNK1-deficient cells to develop into DP thymocytes.</p><p>MYC is upregulated at the β-selection checkpoint as thymocytes transit from the DN3 to DN4 stage and start to proliferate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dose et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Mingueneau et al., 2013</xref>). Importantly, we found that WNK1-deficient DN3 thymocytes failed to upregulate MYC in response to pre-TCR stimulation. Furthermore, many MYC target genes were dysregulated in the absence of WNK1, especially cell- cycle genes. MYC-deficiency results in a similar thymic phenotype to that seen in the absence of WNK1 – reduced proliferation of DN thymocytes, failure to increase in cell size and a substantial reduction of DP thymocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dose et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Douglas et al., 2001</xref>). Importantly, ectopic expression of MYC provided a selective advantage for WNK1-deficient thymocytes developing across the pre-TCR checkpoint. Taken together, we propose that the reduced proliferation of WNK1-deficient DN4 thymocytes may be caused by failure to upregulate MYC, and hence reduced expression of genes required for S-phase entry.</p><p>The upregulation of MYC at the β-selection checkpoint is post-transcriptional – MYC protein increases despite constant <italic>Myc</italic> mRNA levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Mingueneau et al., 2013</xref>). Loss of WNK1 affects this post-transcriptional regulation since mutant DN thymocytes had reduced MYC protein, but unchanged levels of <italic>Myc</italic> mRNA. MYC is regulated at the level of protein stability. It has a short half-life, estimated to be around 20 min, caused by rapid proteasomal degradation and its stability is regulated by phosphorylation; ERK phosphorylation stabilizes MYC, whereas GSK3β-dependent phosphorylation results in ubiquitination of MYC by E3-ligases such as FBXW7 and subsequent proteasomal degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Dang, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gregory et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Welcker et al., 2004a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Welcker et al., 2004b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Yada et al., 2004</xref>). Notably, deletion of <italic>Fbxw7</italic> in the thymus results in high levels of MYC, increased proliferation and hypercellularity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Onoyama et al., 2007</xref>). Interestingly, the expression of <italic>Fbxw7</italic> is increased in WNK1-deficient DN3 thymocytes 24 hr after anti-CD3ε stimulation, which may contribute to destabilizing MYC.</p><p>Since loss of both OXSR1 and STK39 also leads to a block at the pre-TCR checkpoint, along with reduced MYC levels and decreased proliferation of DN4 thymocytes, we hypothesize that WNK1 transduces pre-TCR and CXCR4 signals via OXSR1 and STK39 to the upregulation of MYC, and hence to entry into S-phase and increased cell division. OXSR1 and STK39 phosphorylate multiple members of the SLC12A-family of ion co-transporters. Deficiency of SLC12A2, a Na<sup>+</sup>K<sup>+</sup>Cl<sup>-</sup> transporter, showed a block at the pre-TCR checkpoint, which was less complete than that seen in the absence of WNK1. This suggests that OXSR1 and STK39 may be transducing signals that regulate MYC via several SLC12A-family proteins, including SLC12A2. The WNK1-OXSR1-STK39-SLC12A2 pathway regulates ion uptake in kidney epithelial cells. Our results suggest that regulation of ion homeostasis may be essential for pre-TCR induced proliferation of thymocytes. Further studies will be needed to establish if it is the ion movement per se or the subsequent osmotic movement of water into the cell which is essential for thymic development.</p><p>Interestingly, among &gt;1400 cancer cell lines, the expression of WNK1 is highest in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) lines, many of which originate from immature thymocytes (Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia, CCLE <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://portals.broadinstitute.org/ccle">https://portals.broadinstitute.org/ccle</ext-link>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Barretina et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Tan et al., 2017</xref>). Furthermore, T-ALL lines are the most sensitive to loss of WNK1, as measured by growth inhibition (CCLE) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Tsherniak et al., 2017</xref>), implying that WNK1 plays a key role in these thymically-derived tumors. Since T-ALL cells express high levels of MYC, which is essential for their proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Sanchez-Martin and Ferrando, 2017</xref>), we hypothesize that WNK1 may contribute to the growth of T-ALL by maintaining high levels of MYC, making WNK1 a potential therapeutic target in this thymocyte-derived leukemia.</p><p>In summary we have shown that WNK1 is an essential regulator of early thymocyte development, where, during β-selection, it transduces signals from the pre-TCR and CXCR4 via OXSR1, STK39, and SLC12A2 that lead to upregulation of MYC, proliferation of DN4 thymocytes and differentiation into DP cells.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Mice</title><p>Mice with a conditional allele of <italic>Wnk1</italic> containing loxP sites flanking exon 2 (<italic>Wnk1</italic><sup>tm1Clhu</sup>, <italic>Wnk1</italic><sup>fl</sup>), with a conditional allele of <italic>Oxsr1</italic> containing loxP sites flanking exons 9 and 10 (<italic>Oxsr1</italic><sup>tm1.1Ssy</sup>, <italic>Oxsr1</italic><sup>fl</sup>) with a transgenic Cre recombinase under the control of the human CD2 promoter (Tg(CD2-icre)4Kio, CD2-Cre), with a kinase-inactive allele of <italic>Wnk1</italic> (<italic>Wnk1</italic><sup>tm1.1Tyb</sup>, <italic>Wnk1</italic><sup>D368A</sup>), with a tamoxifen-inducible Cre in the <italic>ROSA26</italic> locus (<italic>Gt(ROSA)26Sor</italic><sup>tm1(cre/ERT2)Thl</sup>, <italic>ROSA26</italic><sup>CreERT2</sup>, RCE), mice expressing OXSR1-T185A (<italic>Oxsr1</italic><sup>tm1.1Arte</sup>, <italic>Oxsr1</italic><sup>T185A</sup>), STK39-T243A (<italic>Stk39</italic><sup>tm1.1Arte</sup>, <italic>Stk39</italic><sup>T243A</sup>), and carrying loss of function alleles of <italic>Slc12a2</italic> (<italic>Slc12a2</italic><sup>tm1Ges</sup> <italic>Slc12a2</italic><sup>-</sup>, imported from MMRRC), <italic>Rag2</italic> (<italic>Rag2</italic><sup>tm1Fwa</sup>, <italic>Rag2</italic><sup>-</sup>) and <italic>Rag1</italic> (<italic>Rag1</italic><sup>tm1Mom</sup>, <italic>Rag1</italic><sup>-</sup>) have been described before (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">de Boer et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">de Luca et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Flagella et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Köchl et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lin et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Mombaerts et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Rafiqi et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Shinkai et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Xie et al., 2009</xref>).

The following antibodies were used for detection of proteins by Western blotting: anti-ERK2 (C-14, Santa Cruz), anti-pS325-OXSR1/pS383-STK39 (MRC-PPU).</p></sec><sec id="s4-16"><title>Histology</title><p>Lethally irradiated B6.SJL mice were reconstituted with an 80:20 mixture of bone marrow from B6.SJL (CD45.2<sup>-</sup>) and either <italic>Wnk1</italic><sup>fl/+</sup><italic>Rag1</italic><sup>-/-</sup>CD2-Cre or <italic>Wnk1</italic><sup>fl/fl</sup><italic>Rag1</italic><sup>-/-</sup>CD2-Cre mice (both CD45.2<sup>+</sup>). Thymic tissue was isolated from the chimeras 8–12 weeks after reconstitution, and frozen 7 µm sections were cut and the fixed in acetone. Sections were stained with the following antibodies: ERTR5 (a gift from Dr W van Ewijk, Riken Research Centre for Allergy and Immunology, Yokohama, Japan) and detected with goat anti-rat IgM coupled to AlexaFluor647, biotinylated anti-CD45.2 detected with streptavidin-AlexaFluor555, anti-CD25 coupled to FITC, anti-CD11b coupled to eFluor450, and anti-CD11c coupled to eFluor450. For confocal quantification, a minimum of three separate thymus sections from each mouse were analyzed at least 10 µm apart, and the frequency of CD45.2<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>+</sup>CD11b<sup>-</sup>CD11c<sup>-</sup> cells was recorded in the subcapsular zone, cortex, and cortico-medullary junction (CMJ) in a set area as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cowan et al., 2014</xref>). The CMJ was defined by ERTR5 staining for medullary epithelial cells. Images were obtained using a Zeiss LSM 780 microscope and analyzed using Zeiss LSM software.</p></sec><sec id="s4-17"><title>In vitro thymocyte development</title><p>OP9-DL1 cells were maintained as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Ciofani and Zúñiga-Pflücker, 2005</xref>). DN2+DN3 thymocytes (Lineage<sup>-</sup>, Thy1.2<sup>+</sup>, CD25<sup>+</sup>) were sorted and for each experimental condition, 25,000 cells were cultured with 10 ng/ml IL7 in 48-well plates that had been previously seeded with 10,000 irradiated OP9-DL1 cells. Cells were cultured for 7 d and then analyzed by flow cytometry.</p></sec><sec id="s4-18"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>All statistical comparisons were carried out using the nonparametric two-tailed Mann-Whitney test, Hypergeometric test, Wald test, or two-way ANOVA. The specific analysis used is described in each Figure Legend, along with the number of times experiments were carried out and the number of samples (n numbers) for each experiment. N numbers always refer to biological repeats, not to technical repeats. Biological repeats were defined as analysis carried out on different animals, or on cells from different animals. Repeat measurements on cells from the same animal were defined as technical repeats. Only biological repeats were used for statistical analysis. No outliers were removed and no experiments were excluded.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank George Kassiotis, Andreas Wack and Edina Schweighoffer for critical reading of the manuscript, Rob de Bruin, Daniel Pennington and Nital Sumaria for advice and Richard Mitter for help with bioinformatics analysis.

early T cells in the thymus. The WNK1-OXSR1-STK39-SLC12A2 signaling axis was specifically found to be used by the pre-TCR for the post-transcriptional upregulation of MYC and the subsequent proliferation and differentiation of developing T cells.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Critical role of WNK1 in MYC-dependent early thymocyte development&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Satyajit Rath as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Juan Carlos Zuniga-Pflucker (Reviewer #2); David Wiest (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>As the editors have judged that your manuscript is of interest, but as described below that additional experiments are required before it is published, we would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). First, because many researchers have temporarily lost access to the labs, we will give authors as much time as they need to submit revised manuscripts.

Unfortunately, the paper has issues regarding the data presentation and interpretation as a result of unclear definitions of the precise developmental stages. This leads to conflicting data and renders it difficult to understand the precise value of the work. In addition, the direct evidence for the proposed axis is insufficiently demonstrated. Therefore, I believe that a major reanalysis using more appropriate markers and with inclusion of rescue experiments would be required to support the claims of the authors.</p><p>1) There is a lack in clarity and accuracy for the dissection and identification of the stages of early thymocyte development (in the Introduction and experimental data in the manuscript) which is important for the interpretation of the data. This is already the case for the DN1 and DN2 stages which are poorly defined in light of the current state-of-the-art (DN1/ETP and DN2a/DN2b, Yui et al., 2010), but this is particularly an issue for understanding the impact at β-selection which now is confusingly associated with DN2/DN3 to DN4 as well as DN4 to ISP and DP stages. This renders the interpretation of the data extremely difficult and inconsistent despite the fact that β-selection has been clearly defined by various labs (Hayday using size, Rothenberg using CD27 and Hodes using CD28). Figure 3B suggests that there is no impact of β-selection in fact since the DN3 to DN4 transition there seems unaffected. However, the DN4 subsets also need a clear and better definition since this is a mixture of cells if insufficient markers are included in the panel. This fraction may include γδ T cells and other lineages. This is also important for clearly understanding the frequency of TCRβ expressing thymocytes in DN3 and DN4 stages (Figure 2A). Thus, it is extremely difficult to make clear conclusions on the precise developmental stage that is impacted by WNK1. This needs extensive revision in my opinion.</p><p>2) Another major issue relates to the choice of the mouse model for conditional deletion of <italic>Wnk1</italic>. The authors use hCD2-iCre to mediate deletion of floxed <italic>Wnk1</italic> gene and state that this deletion started at the DN2 stage. This is not in agreement with literature on this mouse model since hCD2-iCre expression has been detected in immature (ETP for T; pro-B for B lineage) and mature B/T cells, and also in bone marrow lymphoid progenitors (CLPs), natural killer cells and dendritic cells (Siegemund et al., 2015). In fact, the authors show in Figure 1D that significant reduction of <italic>Wnk1</italic> mRNA expression was detected at DN1 stage of <italic>Wnk1</italic><sup>fl/fl</sup>/hCD2-iCre thymocytes compared to the control. So, the authors need to consider the pleiotropic effects of conditional deletion of <italic>Wnk1</italic> using hCD2-iCre mice which might be particularly important in relation to intrathymic DC development. Cpa3-Cre mice would allow T-specific deletion of <italic>Wnk1</italic> (Feyerabend, Immunity. 2009). Alternatively, the authors could perform knockdown of <italic>Wnk1</italic> in sorted wild type thymocytes and performed in-vitro co-culture assay to demonstrate the similar developmental defects observed in the mouse model.</p><p>3) There appear to be some inconsistencies in the data. In Figure 1A, the DN fraction of <italic>Wnk1</italic>-deleted thymi is much higher compared to the control (1.77% in <italic>Wnk1</italic><sup>fl/+</sup>/hCD2-iCre vs. 55.8% in <italic>Wnk1</italic><sup>fl/fl</sup>/hCD2-iCre). However, this is inconsistent with Figure 1B/C where none of the DN subsets have increased cell numbers or frequencies. In general, to understand the precise impact on cellularity and for clear interpretation of Figure 1, it is important to provide the data for total thymic cellularity. In Figure 2, the authors shown that DN4 cells are reduced in the KO. However, in Figure 3B, the authors show that there is no blockade or arrest in development of DN3 cells to DN4 stage. This is also inconsistent with the data in Figure 1B-C and may relate to the unclear definitions of the developmental stages.</p><p>4) It is not clear to me how many mice were analyzed and how the data is presented. For instance, the legend of Figure 1 states that data are from one of two experiments but according to the reporting form this should be more given that 5-7 mice were analyzed according to that same legend.</p><p>5) In general, there is insufficient direct evidence for the proposed regulatory axis as proposed by the authors. The data mainly shows indirect relationships and the paper would strongly benefit from functional rescue experiments to support these strong conclusions.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>The work by Köchl investigates the role of WNK1, a S/T kinase, during T cell development, by performing a set of elegant and beautifully executed experiments, which support the conclusion that WNK1 is necessary for the differentiation of thymocytes from the early CD4-CD8- (DN) to the CD4<sup>+</sup>CD8<sup>+</sup> stage of T cell differentiation. The authors establish a signaling paradigm in which WNK1 appears to function downstream of preTCR/CXCR4 signaling and acts on OXSR1 and STK39 to somehow affect the post-translational stability of MYC, which is known to play a critical role at the DN to DP transition. Using elegant genetic approaches and adoptive transfer experiments, the intrinsic requirement for WNK1 function is clearly established, and the use of in vitro cultures separates the effect on cell adhesion and chemokine signaling from the differentiation block. Using an in vivo model of pre-T cell receptor signaling, RNAseq analyses reveals that proliferation and protein synthesis regulation are affected in the absence of WNK1. Overall, the findings are exciting and provide important insights as to the role of WNK1 signaling in T cell development are revealed by the work, which are major contributions to our current understanding.</p><p>1) The authors clearly establish that MYC protein levels in thymocytes are lower in the absence of WNK1, however it would be important to show whether ectopic expression of MYC could lead the rescue of the proliferation and/or differentiation defect. This can be easily performed, as per Wong et al. (PMID: 22649105), a related paper that examined the role of pre-TCR, Notch and MYC during T cell development.</p><p>2) The clear effect on pre-TCR signaling and the block in the DN to DP differentiation begs the question as to whether γ/δ-T cell differentiation is similarly affected or not, which would position WNK1 as uniquely required for α/β-T lineage differentiation or as shared signaling axis for both lineages. Simply showing whether γδ T cells are present in the thymus and peripheral tissues would directly address this point.</p><p>3) It curious that the authors did not directly address whether the absence of WNK1 in DN cells has an effect on any aspects of ion transport.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>The study by Kochl et al. explores the role of the Ser/Thr kinase WNK1 in regulating early T cell development. <italic>Wnk1</italic> function has been implicated in numerous cellular processes, including controlling the balance of migration vs. adhesion of mature T cells; however, its role in T cell development had not previously been assessed. The authors provide compelling evidence that <italic>Wnk1</italic> function is required for early thymocytes to traverse the β-selection checkpoint, proliferate and differentiate to the CD4<sup>+</sup>CD8<sup>+</sup> stage. While defects in adhesion and migration of <italic>Wnk1</italic>-deficient thymocytes are noted, the impaired development appears to result from other <italic>Wnk1</italic>-regulated events and it is associated with impaired MYC induction. The authors propose that the failure to induce MYC results from attenuation of the activity of OXSR1 and STK39 kinases, which are necessary to induce the sodium/potassium/chloride ion transporter, SLC12A2, upon which MYC induction depends. While the link between <italic>Wnk1</italic> and the OXSR1/STK39/SLC12A2 axis had been described in other cells, it's role in MYC regulation and T cell development was not previously appreciated. Consequently, the authors provide support for a new role of this axis in controlling T cell development at least in part through effects on an ion channel.</p><p>This study is well designed, executed, and thoughtfully interpreted and brings new understanding to signaling axes controlling T cell development.

However, we note that despite the reduced numbers of DN3b and DN4 cells, they are not completely absent. As shown in Figure 1C, DN4 cell numbers are reduced to ~40% of controls, and these residual cells have lost almost all <italic>Wnk1</italic> mRNA (Figure 1D). Thus, the loss of WNK1 is not equivalent to, for example, loss of RAG1 which results in a complete arrest of development at the DN3a stage just before the pre-TCR checkpoint. Instead, in the absence of WNK1, development can still proceed to the DN3b and DN4 stages, albeit with greatly reduced efficiency.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 3B suggests that there is no impact of β-selection in fact since the DN3 to DN4 transition there seems unaffected.</p></disp-quote><p>Stimulation of WNK1-deficient <italic>Rag1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> thymocytes with anti-CD3 clearly induces early transcriptional and cell surface makers changes typical of transition of DN3a to DN4 cells: there is upregulation of <italic>Cd27</italic> and <italic>Cd28</italic> (new data added to Figure 4B) and downregulation of <italic>Il2ra</italic> (Figure 4B) accompanied by loss of CD25 from the surface (Figures 3B, 4C). Thus, the cells are phenotypically becoming DN4 cells. However, they do not expand in number and do not progress to the DP stage (Figure 2D), both of which are hallmark features of β-selection.</p><p>On the face of it, as the reviewer suggests, this looks different from the result in Figures 1B and 2A which shows a block between DN3a and DN3b, with reduced numbers of DN4 cells. However, the two experiments are different. In Figures 2D and 3B we analysed RAG1-deficient mice in which maturation from the DN3a compartment was acutely induced by injection of anti-CD3 antibody, resulting in a synchronous development of the cells into DN4 cells over a period of 48 h. In contrast, in Figures 1B and 2A the development across the β-selection checkpoint was driven by the normal physiological pre-TCR signal, and the analysis is of a thymus under steady state conditions, with continuous production of DN3a cells and then pre-TCR induced maturation of some of these into DN3b, DN4 etc. It is thus not surprising that there are some differences in the measured percentages of cells in the DN3 v DN4 compartments. Nonetheless, as noted above, even in the steady state conditions in Figures 1B and 2A some WNK1-deficient DN3a cells develop into DN3b and DN4 cells, but they are reduced in number. In the anti-CD3 induced development the cells become DN4 cells, but do not expand in number.</p><p>In our view, these two studies give a consistent picture that WNK1-deficient DN3a cells can differentiate into DN3b and DN4 cells, but that they then do not expand in number as control cells do, supporting our conclusion that WNK1 is required for the pre-TCR driven cell proliferation, but not the initial differentiation into DN3b and DN4 cells.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>However, the DN4 subsets also need a clear and better definition since this is a mixture of cells if insufficient markers are included in the panel.

The DN subsets were defined as being positive for Thy1, but negative for a mixture of ‘Lineage’ antibodies specific for B220, CD3, CD4, CD8, CD11b, CD11c, CD19, DX5, GR-1, NK1.1, TCRβ and TCRγδ. Using this mixture, we excluded B cells, DCs, macrophages, NK cells, neutrophils as well as DP and SP thymocytes, and αβ and γδ T cells. The DN cells were then further separated by CD25 and CD44 for the DN1-4 subsets as shown in the manuscript. We note that DN4 cells were CD28+ as would be expected for bona fide DN4 thymocytes. Thus, we believe that the DN3 (a and b) and DN4 cells are well defined. This information is detailed in the Materials and methods.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Thus, it is extremely difficult to make clear conclusions on the precise developmental stage that is impacted by WNK1.

Indeed, as noted by the reviewer, analysis of <italic>Wnk1</italic> mRNA in Figure 1D showed a 50% loss already in DN1 and DN2 cells. So, deletion is seen at DN1 stage, and may well occur earlier, but at these stages it is only partial. Deletion is not complete until DN3 stage (&gt;90% loss of mRNA). We do not expect this 50% loss of <italic>Wnk1</italic> mRNA at the DN1 and DN2 stages to have an effect because heterozygous loss of <italic>Wnk1</italic> does not cause an arrest in thymic development.</p><p>Regarding the possibility that loss of <italic>Wnk1</italic> in DCs is affecting thymic development, this is possible in Figure 1A-C, but the experiment in Figure 1E-F (analysis of the <italic>Wnk1</italic><sup>D368A</sup> mutation) uses radiation chimeras made in sub-lethally irradiated RAG1-deficient mice, hence the DCs are largely <italic>Wnk1</italic><sup>+/+</sup> in these mice and unlikely to affect the phenotype.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) There appear to be some inconsistencies in the data.

Note that in Figure 1C we show the <italic>normalized</italic> abundance of each subset in the WNK1-deficient thymus expressed as a percentage of the number of cells in the control thymi – this is not a graph of the % of cells in each subset.

However, they are not all gone. In the experiments shown in Figures 2D and 3B development of RAG1-deficient DN3a cells is triggered by anti-CD3. This causes the DN3a cells to become DN4 cells (Figure 3B), but there is no expansion of cell numbers or differentiation into DP cells (Figure 2D). Overall the data in the two studies give a consistent picture that WNK1 is required for pre-TCR driven cell proliferation, but not the initial differentiation into DN3b and DN4 cells.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) It is not clear to me how many mice were analyzed and how the data is presented.
