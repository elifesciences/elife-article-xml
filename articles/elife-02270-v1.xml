The P21-activated kinase 2 (Pak2) is an effector for the Rho family GTPases Rac and Cdc42 that regulate actin cytoskeletal remodeling, but its role in the immune system remains poorly understood. In this study, we show that T-cell specific deletion of <italic>Pak2</italic> gene in mice resulted in severe T cell lymphopenia accompanied by marked defects in development, maturation, and egress of thymocytes. Pak2 was required for pre-TCR β-selection and positive selection. Surprisingly, Pak2 deficiency in CD4 single positive thymocytes prevented functional maturation and reduced expression of S1P1 and KLF2. Mechanistically, Pak2 is required for actin cytoskeletal remodeling triggered by TCR. Failure to induce proper actin cytoskeletal remodeling impaired PLCγ1 and Erk1/2 signaling in the absence of Pak2, uncovering the critical function of Pak2 as an essential regulator that governs the actin cytoskeleton-dependent signaling to ensure normal thymocyte development and maturation.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.02270.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.02270.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.02270.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>T cells are a key element of the immune system. There are many different types of T cells, and they all have their origins in hematopoietic stem cells that are found in the bone marrow. These stem cells leave the bone marrow and circulate in the body until they reach an organ called the thymus, where they become early thymic progenitor cells. These progenitor cells then undergo a process called differentiation to become specific types of T cells, which mature in the thymus before moving to the blood. Although various molecules and mechanisms are known to be involved in the development of T cells, many details of this process are not understood.</p><p>One group of molecules that has been implicated in the differentiation of T cells is the p21-activated kinases. Kinases are proteins that activate or deactivate other proteins by adding phosphate groups to specific amino acids. Pak2 adds phosphorylate groups to various proteins that are involved in the reorganization of an important structure inside the cell called the cytoskeleton.</p><p>A kinase called Pak2 has an important role in the reorganization of the cytoskeleton, and since this reorganization is involved in almost all aspects of T cell biology, it seems plausible that Pak2 is also involved in the development of T cells. However, it has not been possible to test this idea because deleting the gene for Pak2 in mice results in their death.</p><p>Now, Phee et al. have overcome this problem by performing experiments in which the gene for Pak2 was only deleted in T cells. These mice had significantly fewer mature T cells than healthy mice. In particular, the absence of Pak2 in thymocytes (the cells that become T cells) prevented them from maturing into T cells, and also prevented them from producing a receptor protein that is needed for mature T cells to leave the thymus. This work implies that disruption of the Pak2-mediated signaling pathway that regulates the cytoskeleton may weaken the immune system in humans.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.02270.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.02270.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>signal transduction</kwd><kwd>T cell development</kwd><kwd>p21-activated kinase</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>K01 AR059754</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Phee</surname><given-names>Hyewon</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 CA142928</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chernoff</surname><given-names>Jonathan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Weiss</surname><given-names>Arthur</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The p21-activated kinase 2 (Pak2) is an essential regulator that governs the actin cytoskeleton-dependent signaling to ensure normal thymocyte development, maturation and egress.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>To generate mature T cells that express functional and self-tolerant T cell receptors (TCRs), T cells undergo elaborate developmental selection and maturation processes within the thymus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Starr et al., 2003</xref>). Signals that result from successful TCR β-chain rearrangement and a pre-TCR formation drive the most immature CD4 and CD8 double negative (DN) thymocytes to become CD4 and CD8 double positive (DP), known as β-selection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Mallick et al., 1993</xref>). Following TCR α-chain rearrangement and mature TCR expression, DP thymocytes undergo positive selection using their newly assembled TCRs to recognize self peptide-major histocompatibility (pMHC) proteins expressed by the cTECs (cortical thymic epithelial cells). A small number of DP thymocytes successfully undergo positive selection and ultimately mature into CD4 or CD8 single positive (SP) cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Scollay and Shortman, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Petrie et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Starr et al., 2003</xref>). TCR-mediated signals that determine thymocyte development are only partially understood.</p><p>Following positive selection in the thymic cortex, positively selected thymocytes migrate into the medulla and mature to ensure their functional competency to react to cognate antigens and to survive in the periphery. Fully mature SP thymocytes become competent to proliferate, when stimulated via their TCR, in contrast to DP or semi-mature SP thymocytes that are subject to apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hogquist et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Takada et al., 2011</xref>). Moreover, post-positive selection DP and SP thymocytes increase their IL-7R expression to promote their survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Van De Wiele et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Yu et al., 2006</xref>). As SP thymocytes mature, they decrease expression of CD69 and CD24 and concurrently increase expression of CD62L and Qa2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Vernachio et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Ramsdell et al., 1991</xref>). Therefore, stages of CD4SP thymocyte maturation can be further defined as ‘semi-mature’ (CD69/CD24<sup>hi</sup> CD62L/Qa2<sup>low</sup>) and ‘mature’ (CD69/CD24<sup>low</sup> CD62L/Qa2<sup>hi</sup>) states. Only functionally mature T cells exit the thymus, which is enabled, in part, by the marked increase in expression of egress receptors, including sphingosine 1 phosphate receptor 1 (S1P1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Allende et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Matloubian et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Weinreich and Hogquist, 2008</xref>). The transcription factor Kruppel Lung Factor 2 (KLF2) controls expression of S1P1 and CD62L (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Carlson et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Weinreich and Hogquist, 2008</xref>), thereby governing egress of T cells from the thymus and facilitating entry to the lymph nodes. However, it is not clear which signaling pathways control maturation of SP thymocytes after selection and promote egress by increasing KLF2.</p><p>The actin cytoskeleton and proteins that regulate it are involved in almost all aspects of T cell biology. The cytoskeleton, composed of actin filaments, microtubules, and intermediate filaments, provides mechanical support for organization of cellular structure. Reorganization of the cytoskeleton generates dynamic changes in cell shape during cell–cell interaction and migration. TCR engagement drastically induces changes in actin cytoskeletal architecture and reorganizes it. Actin cytoskeletal reorganization influences T cell signaling leading to T cell activation. For instance, TCR-mediated actin polymerization is required to form extensive contacts between T cells and antigen presenting cells (APCs), organize gross cell polarity, and stabilize signaling complexes acting as a scaffold for further assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Wülfing and Davis, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kaizuka et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Babich et al., 2012</xref>). However, the mechanism that links the actin cytoskeleton to T cell signaling is not well known.</p><p>Rho family GTPases such as Rac and Cdc42 regulate cytoskeletal reorganization, microtubule dynamics, and cell polarity in many cell types, including T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Zhao and Manser, 2005</xref>). Activation of Rho family GTPases is tightly regulated by guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) and GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Tybulewicz and Henderson, 2009</xref>). Vav family proteins (Vav1, Vav2 and Vav3) are GEFs for Rac and Cdc42 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Tybulewicz, 2005</xref>). Rac, Cdc42, and Vav play crucial roles in T cell development and activation. For example, mice lack both isoforms of Rac1 and Rac2 or mice deficient in Vav1 show defects in pre-TCR β-selection and positive selection and T cell activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Turner et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Fujikawa et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Guo et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dumont et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Tybulewicz and Henderson, 2009</xref>). Cdc42-deficient mice display impaired positive selection and homeostasis of T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Guo et al., 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">2011</xref>). Rac and Cdc42 exert their functions by binding and activating to a large collection of their effector molecules. However, it is not known which protein among many effector molecules of Rac and Cdc42 is required to mediate their defined functions in T cells.</p><p>The p21-activated kinases (PAKs), effector molecules of Rac and Cdc42, participate in diverse cellular signaling pathways including cell spreading, adhesion, migration, activation, proliferation, and survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Manser et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bokoch, 2003</xref>). PAKs are serine/threonine kinases that phosphorylate multiple substrates, including those that are involved in cytoskeletal reorganization, cell proliferation, and survival. The group I PAK family consists of three kinases (Pak1, Pak2 and Pak3) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bokoch, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kelly and Chernoff, 2012</xref>). Pak2 is the major PAK expressed in T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chu et al., 2004</xref>) and has been implicated in T cell function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bubeck Wardenburg et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Yablonski et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Phee et al., 2005</xref>). However, the in vivo role of Pak2 in T cells is not known due to embryonic lethality of Pak2 knock-out (KO) mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hofmann et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kelly and Chernoff, 2012</xref>). Given that Pak2 is one of the well-described effector molecules of Rac and Cdc42, it has long been speculated that Pak2 may mediate the function of Rac and Cdc42 in T cell development and activation. However, considering the fact that Rac and Cdc42 have many effector molecules and may utilize a combination of effectors to mediate a defined cellular function, it was unclear whether Pak2 is the effector molecule that mediates the function of Rac and Cdc42 in T cell development and activation.</p><p>In this study, we show for the first time that Pak2 is required for the development, maturation, and timed egress of thymocytes. Lineage-specific deletion of Pak2 at an early T cell developmental stage using the <italic>Lck</italic>-Cre impaired pre-TCR β-selection and positive selection similar to the mice that lack Rac1/2 or Vav1. Surprisingly, deletion of Pak2 at a later developmental stage using the <italic>Cd4</italic>-Cre severely inhibited functional maturation of CD4SP thymocytes, including impaired expression of S1P1 accompanied by reduced expression of its transcription factor, KLF2. TCR-mediated signaling was greatly decreased in the absence of Pak2, including Nur77 induction and S6 phosphorylation, leading to decreased proliferation. Mechanistically, Pak2 deficiency impaired actin cytoskeletal remodeling and activation of PLCγ1 and Erk1/2 triggered by plate-bound TCR stimulation. These findings reveal a critical function of Pak2 as an essential regulator that drives the actin cytoskeleton-dependent signaling for normal thymocyte development and maturation.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Generation of T cell-specific Pak2-deficient mice</title><p>To examine the role of Pak2 in vivo, we generated Pak2<sup>−/−</sup> mice using a conventional knock-out (KO) strategy.

The transcription factor KLF2 plays a key role in controlling expression of S1P1 in SP thymocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Carlson et al., 2006</xref>). Expression of KLF2 is controlled during thymocyte development. In DN and DP stages, expression of KLF2 is minimal to prevent premature egress of DN or DP thymocytes. SP thymocytes gradually increase expression of KLF2, reaching highest expression amounts at the mature stage. KLF2 also controls expression of CD62L, which promotes T cell entry to the lymph nodes in the periphery. The signaling pathway that controls timed egress of thymocytes by increasing KLF2 has not been identified. Since CD62L expression was reduced in Pak2-deficient CD4SP thymocytes, we asked whether KLF2 expression is altered in the absence of Pak2.

Moreover, within CD4SP thymocytes there is a subset that increases Qa2 expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E,F</xref>), which could represent a mature subset. Thus, we examined directly whether CD4SP thymocytes from <italic>Pak2</italic><sup><italic>F/F</italic></sup><italic>;Cd4-</italic>Cre mice contain functionally mature cells. One of the hallmarks of functional maturity of CD4SP thymocytes is their ability to proliferate in response to CD3 and CD28 stimulation, unlike semi-mature thymocytes that are more susceptible to cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hogquist et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Takada et al., 2011</xref>).

As expected, the CD24<sup>low</sup>Qa2<sup>hi</sup> CD4SP thymocytes from WT mice underwent 2–3 rounds of cell division following CD3 or CD3 and CD28 stimulation, suggesting these cells are functionally mature. In contrast, most CD4SP thymocytes from <italic>Pak2</italic><sup><italic>F/F</italic></sup><italic>;Cd4-</italic>Cre mice including the CD24<sup>low</sup>Qa2<sup>hi</sup> subset did not proliferate following TCR/CD28 stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>).

Of note, Pak2-deficient CD4SP thymocytes are more susceptible to cell death following 24 hr of incubation in resting or stimulated conditions because they contain more semi-mature thymocytes that undergo cell death (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1B–D</xref>). Together, these results indicate that functional maturity of CD4SP thymocytes depends on Pak2.</p><p>Since we found that Pak2 is required for proliferative response of CD4SP thymocytes following plate-bound anti-CD3 or anti-CD3/CD28 stimulation, we sought to determine the mechanism by which Pak2 affects signaling pathways activated by the TCR and CD28 stimulation. The PI3K/Akt/mTORC1 signaling pathway has been reported to be activated by the TCR and CD28 stimulation, reflected in the phosphorylation of S6 ribosomal protein (S6), a direct target of the mTORC1-activated p70S6 kinase (p70S6K) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hay and Sonenberg, 2004</xref>). Activation of the mTORC1 pathway increases rates of mRNA translation and protein synthesis, which permits increased cell growth and proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Mills and Jameson, 2009</xref>). Activation of mTORC1 pathway was absolutely required for phosphorylation of S6 at the S235/S236 sites and p70S6K at the T389 site, as phosphorylation of these sites were completely abrogated by rapamycin, an inhibitor of mTOR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2B–E</xref>). Phosphorylation of S6 at S235/S236 in CD4SP thymocytes from WT mice was increased after 24 hr of stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>, top panels). On the contrary, most of the CD4SP thymocytes from <italic>Pak2</italic><sup><italic>F/F</italic></sup><italic>;Cd4-</italic>Cre mice displayed minimal S6 phosphorylation. Since TCR-induced S6 phosphorylation reaches its optimal amounts after 1 or 2 hr of TCR stimulation and lasts up to 5 hr (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Salmond et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">van den Brink et al., 1999</xref>), we examined S6 phosphorylation following 2 hr of plate-bound anti-CD3 stimulation. Phosphorylation of S6 at S235/S236 was substantially decreased in the absence of Pak2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>, bottom panels). Activation of MAPK-RSK pathway contributes to phosphorylation of S6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Salmond et al., 2009</xref>). Indeed, treatment of thymocytes with a MEK inhibitor, UO126, partially reduced phosphorylation of S6 at S235/S236 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2C–E</xref>). However, since rapamycin treatment completely abrogated phosphorylation of S6 at these sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2C–E</xref>), the MAPK-dependent phosphorylation of S6 also seems to depend on activation of mTORC1-mediated pathway. To determine whether reduced phosphorylation of S6 in the absence of Pak2 is due to inhibition of mTORC1-mediated pathway, we examined phosphorylation of p70S6K at the T389 site because phosphorylation of this site was completely dependent on mTORC1-mediated pathway but independent of MAPK-mediated pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2C–E</xref>). Phosphorylation of p70S6K at T389 was also decreased following 30 min and 1 hr of plate-bound CD3 stimulation in the absence of Pak2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>). These findings demonstrate that Pak2 participates in mTORC1-mediated activation of p70S6K and phosphorylation of S6 following plate-bound TCR stimulation.</p><p>To determine whether Pak2-deficient CD4SP thymocytes have a defect in optimal activation of integrated TCR-mediated signaling events, we examined expression of Nur77, an orphan nuclear hormone receptor induced in response to TCR stimulation, as a reporter for TCR strength of signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Moran et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Zikherman et al., 2012</xref>).

These results reveal that Pak2 is required for downstream events reflective of TCR signaling, including those inducing Nur77 induction and p70S6K activation.</p></sec><sec id="s2-8"><title>Pak2 is required for optimal activation of PLCγ1 following plate-bound TCR stimulation</title><p>Decreased induction of Nur77 following TCR or TCR/CD28 stimulation suggests that Pak2 is required for TCR-dependent signaling events. Since Pak2 is required for multiple processes of development and maturation of thymocytes, it is possible that Pak2 regulates these processes by governing TCR-mediated signaling. Because activation of Erk1/2 following TCR stimulation plays a key role in thymic development as well as in induction of Nur77 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">van den Brink et al., 1999</xref>), we examined activation of Erk1/2 following TCR or TCR/CD28 stimulation. Phosphorylation of Erk1/2 was markedly reduced in the absence of Pak2, when cells were stimulated by plate-bound anti-CD3 or anti-CD3/CD28 stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7G,H</xref>). In contrast, phosphorylation of Erk1/2 was not reduced when cells were stimulated by soluble anti-CD3 or anti-CD3/CD28 in the absence of Pak2 (data not shown), suggesting that Pak2 is required for transducing signaling events that are specifically provoked by plate-bound TCR stimulation. TCR engagement by plating T cells on surfaces coated with antibodies to the TCR mimics T cell activation by antigen-presenting cells (APCs) and triggers dynamic changes in actin cytoskeletal architecture, such as formation and expansion of contacts bounded by continuously remodeled actin-rich rings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Wear et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bunnell et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Babich et al., 2012</xref>). These actin-rich rings are associated with extension of lamellipodia that requires assembly and disassembly of actin filament neworks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bunnell et al., 2001</xref>). Changes in actin cytoskeletal architecture induced by TCR engagement promote T cell signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Babich et al., 2012</xref>). Interestingly, actin dynamics that mediate ongoing actin polymerization and retrograde flow promotes sustained PLCγ1 signaling during plate-bound TCR activation, while disruption of F-actin dynamics inhibits sustained PLCγ1 phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Babich et al., 2012</xref>). Since activation of PLCγ1 plays a critical role in activating Erk1/2 following TCR stimulation, we hypothesized that Pak2 participates in activation of Erk1/2 via promoting PLCγ1 activation by regulating actin cytoskeletal dynamics during T cell spreading triggered by TCR engagement. Indeed, we found that phosphorylation of PLCγ1 that is known to be associated with its activation status (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kim et al., 1991</xref>) is profoundly decreased in the absence of Pak2, indicating that Pak2 is required for optimal PLCγ1 activation, possibly by regulating actin cytoskeletal reorganization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7H</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-9"><title>Pak2 is required for actin cytoskeletal remodeling during T cell spreading triggered by plate-bound TCR stimulation</title><p>Our results suggest that Pak2 may participate in actin cytoskeletal dynamics during T cell spreading triggered by TCR stimulation. To determine whether the loss of Pak2 affects the actin cytoskeleton in CD4SP thymocytes, we first examined actin polymerization and Rac1 activation in resting conditions. To our surprise, the amount of polymerized filamentous actin (F-actin) was greatly increased in resting conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>), suggesting processes regulating actin assembly and disassembly were disrupted in the absence of Pak2. Consistent with these data, Rac1 activation was consistently increased under resting conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>). However, despite increased F-actin and activated Rac levels, Pak2-deficient CD4SP thymocytes did not reorganize their actin cytoskeleton and spread when triggered by plate-bound TCR stimulation. WT CD4SP thymocytes exhibited intense spreading at 60 min of stimulation, when they were plated on the coverslips coated with antibodies to the TCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D</xref>, upper left and middle panels), while polarizing F-actin of the cell body towards to the contact sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D</xref>, upper right panel). In stark contrast, Pak2-deficient CD4SP thymocytes displayed poor spreading at the contact sites and actin polymerization at the contact sites was markedly impaired (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D</xref>, lower left and middle panels), while F-actin in the cell was not polarized towards to the contact sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D</xref>, lower right panel). As a result, areas where cells spread at the contact sites were significantly reduced in the absence of Pak2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>). These findings revealed that Pak2 plays a vital role in regulating the actin cytoskeletal reorganization induced by TCR stimulation. Since the integrity of dynamic actin cytoskeletal structure and actin cytoskeletal reorganization triggered by TCR engagement are fundamental for the proper signal transmission in many biological processes of T cells, we propose that Pak2 controls multiple stages of T cell development in the thymus by governing dynamic rearrangement of the actin cytoskeleton.<fig id="fig8" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.02270.015</object-id><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Pak2 regulates actin dynamics of CD4SP thymocytes.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Increased actin polymerization in resting DP, CD4 and CD8 SP thymocytes from <italic>Pak2</italic><sup><italic>F/F</italic></sup><italic>Cd4</italic>-Cre mice.

T cell-specific deletion of Pak2 at two different developmental stages using stage-specific Cre transgenic mice demonstrated that Pak2 is critical for T cell development, maturation and egress. We found that deletion of Pak2 at either the DN2 or DP stages using the <italic>Lck</italic>-Cre or <italic>Cd4</italic>-Cre transgenic mice resulted in severe T cell lymphopenia. Development of DP and SP thymocytes was inhibited in <italic>Pak2</italic><sup><italic>F/F</italic></sup><italic>;Lck</italic>-Cre mice due to impaired pre-TCR β-selection and positive selection, resulting in reduced numbers of DP and SP thymocytes. In contrast, generation of SP thymocytes was not affected, nor were numbers of DP and SP thymocytes reduced in <italic>Pak2</italic><sup><italic>F/F</italic></sup><italic>;Cd4-</italic>Cre mice. Apparent normal development was due to compensatory changes in the TCR repertoire because positive selection was impaired when the OTII transgene was introduced in <italic>Pak2</italic><sup><italic>F/F</italic></sup><italic>;Cd4-</italic>Cre mice. Pak2 deletion in <italic>Pak2</italic><sup><italic>F/F</italic></sup><italic>;Cd4-</italic>Cre mice presented a unique opportunity to decipher the role of Pak2 in maturation of CD4SP thymocytes after positive selection since generation of CD4SP thymocytes was not impaired. We found that Pak2 is required for the functional maturation and timed egress of CD4SP thymocytes in <italic>Pak2</italic><sup><italic>F/F</italic></sup><italic>;Cd4-</italic>Cre mice.</p><p>To define the mechanisms by which Pak2 regulates thymocyte development and maturation, we sought to determine Pak2's function in TCR-induced signaling events. We found that Pak2 is required to remodel actin cytoskeletal architecture during T cell spreading induced by TCR stimulation. Since TCR engagement induces rapid changes in cytoskeletal reorganization in T cells, which is critical for transducing signals, it is possible that perturbation of the actin cytoskeletal reorganization processes in Pak2-deficient thymocytes prevents normal TCR-mediated signaling events. Indeed, inability to remodel the actin cytoskeleton during T cell spreading was accompanied by impaired activation of PLCγ1 and Erk1/2, suggesting Pak2 is required to drive actin cytoskeleton-dependent signaling induced by the TCR. As a result, induction of Nur77 and phosphorylation S6 were inhibited, and proliferative responses were diminished in the absence of Pak2. Activation of PLCγ1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Sommers et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fu et al., 2010</xref>) and Ras-mediated MAPK pathway leading to Erk1/2 activation are essential for positive selection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alberola-Ila et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Swan et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">O'Shea et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Swat et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Pagès et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fischer et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">McGargill et al., 2009</xref>). Since positive selection is initiated by TCR/pMHC interaction between DP thymocytes and cTECs and controlled by avidity and affinity of this interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Starr et al., 2003</xref>), inefficient signaling such as impaired activation of PLCγ1 and Erk1/2 could lead to defects in positive selection in the absence of Pak2. We also confirmed that disruption of actin dynamics by administration of either the F-actin stabilizing agent jasplakinolide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bubb et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Murthy and Wadsworth, 2005</xref>) or the actin depolymerizing agent latrunculin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Spector et al., 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Coué et al., 1987</xref>) completely abrogated signaling events such as induction of Nur77 and S6 phosphorylation following plate-bound TCR stimulation (data not shown), suggesting actin cytoskeletal reorganization is critical for activation of TCR-induced signaling events. Together, these findings suggest that Pak2 is required to coordinate T cell signaling network by controlling actin cytoskeletal reorganization during thymocyte development.</p><p>After completing positive selection, post-positive selection DP thymocytes migrate from the thymic cortex to the medulla and spend about 4–5 days there prior to exiting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">McCaughtry et al., 2007</xref>). Newly selected SP thymocytes acquire ‘mature’ features in the medulla before they egress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">McCaughtry et al., 2007</xref>). During this time, they decrease expression of CD69 and CD24 and increase expression of CD62L, integrin β7, and Qa2. In addition, SP thymocytes become functionally mature as they acquire competency to proliferate in response to TCR stimulation, rather than die like their immature precursors DP or semi-mature SP thymocytes. We found that CD4SP thymocytes from <italic>Pak2</italic><sup><italic>F/F</italic></sup><italic>;Cd4-</italic>Cre mice were arrested at the semi-mature stage, unable to increase expression of CD62L and integrin β7. CD4SP thymocytes from <italic>Pak2</italic><sup><italic>F/F</italic></sup><italic>;Cd4-</italic>Cre mice did not contain a functionally mature subset because they failed to proliferate following CD3 or CD3/CD28 stimulation. Rather, CD4SP thymocytes from <italic>Pak2</italic><sup><italic>F/F</italic></sup><italic>;Cd4-</italic>Cre mice contain more semi-mature cells that undergo cell death when stimulated, confirming that Pak2 is required for functional maturation of CD4SP thymocytes. The effect of Pak2 deficiency in CD4-expressing SP thymocytes was specific to the transition from the semi-mature to the mature stage after positive selection, since the generation of semi-mature CD4SP thymocytes from DP thymocytes was normal in <italic>Pak2</italic><sup><italic>F/F</italic></sup><italic>;Cd4-</italic>Cre mice. The mechanism by which Pak2 mediates the transition from the semi-mature to the mature stage of CD4SP thymocytes is not clear. Since semi-mature CD4SP thymocytes from <italic>Pak2</italic><sup><italic>F/F</italic></sup><italic>;Cd4-</italic>Cre mice were more prone to cell death following 24 hr of in vitro culture, Pak2 may be required for maintenance of semi-mature CD4SP thymocytes. However, Pak2 deficiency in CD4-expressing SP thymocytes did not increase cell death or apoptosis in freshly isolated thymocytes ex vivo or after 1–2 hr of in vitro culture. Moreover, the number of semi-mature CD4SP thymocytes was not reduced in <italic>Pak2</italic><sup><italic>F/F</italic></sup><italic>;Cd4-</italic>Cre mice, suggesting that the effect of Pak2 deficiency may be specific to the semi-mature CD4SP thymocytes that received a maturation signal. For example, the maturation signal may activate Pak2 in semi-mature cells to provide protection from apoptosis and to make the transition to the mature stage. The nature of the upstream pathway that controls maturation and is also dependent upon Pak2 is currently unknown.</p><p>Another key feature linked to SP thymocyte functional maturation is the increased expression of the egress receptor S1P1 as a result of expression of KLF2, a crucial transcription factor that regulates expression of S1P1 and CD62L (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Carlson et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Weinreich and Hogquist, 2008</xref>). Failure to generate mature CD4SP thymocytes in the absence of Pak2 greatly impeded both KLF2 and S1P1 expression. Although KLF2 plays a critical role in egress and trafficking, KLF2 does not contribute to functional maturation of thymocytes because KLF2-deficient SP thymocytes are not defective in proliferation following CD3/CD28 stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Takada et al., 2011</xref>). On the other hand, Pak2 plays essential roles in promoting functional maturation as well as KLF2 expression. These results indicate that Pak2-mediated functional maturation is required for the increased expression of KLF2. We propose that timed egress of thymocytes by KLF2 is tightly coordinated by a Pak2-dependent maturation process as a quality checkpoint mechanism. As a consequence, <italic>Cd4-</italic>Cre mediated Pak2 deletion results in severe T cell lymphopenia due to Pak2's multiple roles in T cell maturation and timed egress of thymocytes.</p><p>Since Pak2 is a serine/threonine kinase that phosphorylates multiple targets, it is of great interest to identify which substrates mediate Pak2's function in thymocyte development and maturation. Our results indicate that Pak2 facilitates actin cytoskeletal reorganization following TCR stimulation. Therefore, Pak2 may regulate thymic development by controlling TCR-mediated signaling strength by facilitating actin cytoskeletal reorganization. Among the known Pak2 substrates that are involved in cytoskeletal networks are: GEF-H1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Zenke et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kosoff et al., 2013</xref>), ArhGAP15 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Radu et al., 2013</xref>), filamin A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Vadlamudi et al., 2002</xref>), Rho GDI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">DerMardirossian and Bokoch, 2006</xref>), α and β PIX (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Koh et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Shin et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Rennefahrt et al., 2007</xref>), regulatory myosin light chain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Ramos et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chew et al., 1998</xref>), myosin heavy chain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Yamashita and May 1998</xref>), tubulin cofactor B (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Vadlamudi et al., 2005</xref>), LIMK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Edwards et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dan et al., 2001</xref>), and dynein light chain 1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Vadlamudi et al., 2004</xref>). Moreover, it is likely that Pak2 is required for transcriptional responses that mediate the transition from the semi-mature to the mature stage since loss of Pak2 severely impaired this transition. It is not clear whether Pak2 is directly involved in regulating transcription responses by phosphorylating components of transcriptional machinery which mediate this transition, or whether Pak2 phosphorylates a signaling component that ultimately leads to the transcription response facilitating this transition. Further studies to determine the mechanism of Pak2's function in thymic development and maturation are warranted.</p><p>The Paks were the first Rho family GTPase-regulated kinases to be identified and are among the well-characterized effectors of Rac and Cdc42 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arias-Romero and Chernoff, 2008</xref>). Here, we show that Pak2 is required for thymic development, including pre-TCR β selection and positive selection, and T cell activation, closely resembling the functions of Rac, Cdc42 or their activator Vav in T cell development and activation. Together, our findings suggest that Pak2 is the primary effector for mediating the functions of Rac and Cdc42 in T cell development and activation.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Mice</title><p>To generate a conditional knock-out of <italic>Pak2</italic> gene, a targeting vector was designed to flank exon 2 of <italic>Pak2</italic> gene with <italic>loxP</italic> sites as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kosoff et al., 2013</xref>).

The contact areas where the cell spreads were measured by using the NIS-Elements Viewer.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors would like to thank the Phee and Weiss laboratories for discussions.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by a Senior editor, a Reviewing editor, and 2 reviewers.</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>This manuscript explains the signal transduction pathways that control the development of T cells in the thymus using selective deletions of the Set/Thr kinanse Pak2. The data show that Pak2 is important for TCR-beta selection and thymocyte maturation in vivo. Overall the experiments are well performed and the conclusions are justified by the data. Both reviewers felt that some discussion of the options for Pak2 substrates in the context of T cell development is necessary to place this study in the context of other information concerning Pak 1 and Pak2 in the literature.</p><p>Minor comments:</p><p>1) The data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1–figure supplement 1</xref> are used to show that the deletion of Pak in thymocytes causes a peripheral lymphopenia. Cell numbers should be shown in the main Figure rather than as supplemental data.</p><p>2) In the text (in the context of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>), authors mention as data not shown that the levels of expression of CD69 in DP and CD4SP are normal in Pak2f/f;CD4-Cre, but data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref> show increased CD69 expression in Pak2f/f;CD4-Cre CD4SP. Which is correct?</p><p>3) The authors state that deletion of Pak2 at the DN2 stage blocks positive selection. Given their later results this statement should be modified to say that the decreased numbers of SPs in the <italic>Lck</italic>-Cre pakfl/flOTII mice could be due to decreased selection or decreased maturation.</p><p>4) Levels of TCRb or CD3 expression in Pak2<sup>f/f</sup>;CD4-Cre CD4SP. Authors include the cell surface expression of TCRb in CD4-SP in the mixed bone marrow chimera experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>), but not for the Pak2<sup>f/f</sup>;CD4-Cre CD4SP mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). Inclusion of that data will be valuable to prove that the defects on TCR signalling shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> are not due to impaired levels of TCR expression at cell surface.</p><p>5) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> the authors claim that the loss of Pak1 prevents expression of KLF2 and S1P1. However, these molecules are expressed at the highest level in the most mature SPs subsets. Hence the fact that there is a decrease in KLF2 and S1P1 in Pak2 deficient CD4s probably reflects that this mature subset is not present. This point should be discussed.</p><p>6) The authors use the phosphorylation of the ribosomal S6 subunit as a readout of the mTOR signalling pathway in CD4SP. However, Salmond et al show that pS6 is controlled by MAPK-Rsk and mTOR. Thus, the phosphorylation of S6 can measure either pathway and more work is required to verify which one (e.g., rapamycin sensitivtity of S6 phosphorylation indicates the mTOR pathway).</p><p>7) The ordering of panels in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> is a bit confusing as it does not match the order in the text</p><p>8) There should be some discussion about possible Pak2 substrates responsible for these defects.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.02270.017</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Both reviewers felt that some discussion of the options for Pak2 substrates in the context of T cell development is necessary to place this study in the context of other information concerning Pak 1 and Pak2 in the literature</italic>.</p><p>We have added a paragraph in the Discussion to specifically address the options for Pak2 substrates that could influence T cell development.</p><p><italic>1) The data in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1"><italic>Figure 1</italic></xref> <italic>and</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1"><italic>Figure 1–figure supplement 1</italic></xref> <italic>are used to show that the deletion of Pak in thymocytes causes a peripheral lymphopenia.

Inclusion of that data will be valuable to prove that the defects on TCR signalling shown in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7"><italic>Figure 7</italic></xref> <italic>are not due to impaired levels of TCR expression at cell surface</italic>.</p><p>We added figures showing that expression levels of CD3 and TCRβ are similar between <italic>Pak2<sup>F/F</sup></italic> and <italic>Pak2<sup>F/F</sup></italic>;<italic>Cd4</italic>-Cre mice in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>.</p><p><italic>5) In</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7"><italic>Figure 7</italic></xref> <italic>the authors claim that the loss of Pak1 prevents expression of KLF2 and S1P1. However, these molecules are expressed at the highest level in the most mature SPs subsets. Hence the fact that there is a decrease in KLF2 and S1P1 in Pak2 deficient CD4s probably reflects that this mature subset is not present. This point should be discussed</italic>.</p><p>This is a valid point. Since Pak2 is required for the transition from the semi-mature to the mature stage, the decrease in KLF2 and S1P1 mRNA expression may reflect the lack of the mature CD4SP thymocyte subset in the absence of Pak2. However, we also observed a reproducible decrease of KLF2 mRNA expression even at the semi-mature stage of CD4SP thymocytes from <italic>Pak2<sup>F/F</sup>;Cd4-</italic>Cre mice, suggesting Pak2 contributes to expression of KLF2 even at an earlier stage than the mature stage, when CD4SP thymocytes are just starting to upregulate KLF2. Therefore, we have now added a new panel (right) in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>, showing the relative expression of KLF2 in the absence of Pak2 at the semi-mature stage. S1P1 is minimally expressed at the semi-mature stage compared to the mature stage. Although expression levels of S1P1 were minimal, we consistently saw a decrease in S1P1 mRNA expression in the semi-mature CD4SP thymocytes of <italic>Pak2<sup>F/F</sup>;Cd4-</italic>Cre mice compared to <italic>Pak2<sup>F/F</sup></italic> mice. We also have added a new panel (right) in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>, showing relative expression of S1P1 in the absence of Pak2 at the semi-mature stage. Therefore, we believe that, although the decrease in mRNA expression of KLF2 or S1P1 may reflect the lack of the mature subset, Pak2 regulates expression of KLF2 even at the earlier semi-mature stage when KLF2 expression is just beginning to increase.</p><p>We have now added text explaining this in detail: “Since Pak2 is required for the transition from the semi-mature to the mature stage, the decrease in KLF2 and S1P1 mRNA expression may reflect the lack of the mature CD4SP thymocytes in the absence of Pak2.

However, Salmond et al show that pS6 is controlled by MAPK-Rsk and mTOR. Thus, the phosphorylation of S6 can measure either pathway and more work is required to verify which one (e.g., rapamycin sensitivtity of S6 phosphorylation indicates the mTOR pathway)</italic>.</p><p>This is a good suggestion. To assess the role of the mTOR and MAPK-RSK pathways in TCR-induced p70S6K and S6 phosphorylation, we performed inhibitor studies using an mTOR inhibitor, rapamycin, and a MEK inhibitor, UO126.</p><p>First, we confirmed that efficacy of the MEK inhibitor UO126 (10 μM). WT thymocytes were pretreated with UO126 (10 μM) for 30 min, then stimulated for 30 and 60 minutes with plate-bound anti-CD3 antibodies. Cells were lysed following stimulation, and cell lysates were subjected to immunoblotting analysis using anti-phosphospecific antibodies. Phosphorylation of Erk1/2 and RSK was completely abrogated as Erk and RSK have been shown to be downstream targets of MEK (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7–figure supplement 2A</xref>). We also treated cells with rapamycin to determine whether inhibition of mTOR affects phosphorylation of Erk1/2 or RSK. We found that rapamycin did not substantially affect phosphorylation of Erk1/2 or RSK (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7–figure supplement 2A</xref>).</p><p>Next, we tested that whether the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin reduces TCR-induced phosphorylation of p70S6K at the T389 site as this site has been shown to be dependent on mTOR activity as shown in Salmond et al. Phosphorylation of p70S6K at the T389 site after 30 and 60 minutes of anti-CD3 stimulation was completely inhibited by rapamycin treatment, suggesting phosphorylation of p70S6K at T389 site is dependent on mTOR activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7–figure supplement 2B</xref>).</p><p>To determine whether phosphorylation of p70S6K at T389 site is dependent on the MAPK pathway, we measured phosphorylation of p70S6K at T389 site following MEK inhibitor UO126 treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7–figure supplement 2C-2E</xref>). We saw minimal reduction on phosphorylation of p70S6K at T389 in cells treated with the MEK inhibitor UO126, while rapamycin completely inhibited phosphorylation of p70S6K at T389, suggesting phosphorylation of p70S6K at T389 is mediated by mTOR-dependent, not by a MAPK-dependent pathway.</p><p>We showed that Pak2 is required for optimal phosphorylation of S6 at S235/S236 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>), and that phosphorylation of these sites is highly dependent on mTOR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7–figure supplement 2C-2D</xref>). To determine whether reduced phosphorylation of S6 at S235/S236 in the absence of Pak2 is due to inhibition of mTORC1-mediated pathway, we examined phosphorylation of p70S6K at the T389 site because phosphorylation of this site was completely dependent on mTORC1-mediated pathway but independent of MAPK-mediated pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7–figure supplement 2C-2E</xref>). Phosphorylation of p70S6K at T389 was also decreased following 30 min and 1 hour of plate-bound CD3 stimulation in the absence of Pak2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>). Therefore, we conclude that Pak2 participates in mTORC1-mediated activation of p70S6K and phosphorylation of S6.
