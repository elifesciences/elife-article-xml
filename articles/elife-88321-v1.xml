cerebellum to coordinate movements. Numerous cerebellar functions are thought to require the maintenance of a sensory representation that extends beyond the input signal. Granule cells receive sensory input, but they do not prolong the signal and are thus unlikely to maintain a sensory representation for much longer than the inputs themselves. Unipolar brush cells (UBCs) are excitatory interneurons that project to granule cells and transform sensory input into prolonged increases or decreases in firing, depending on their ON or OFF UBC subtype. Further extension and diversification of the input signal could be produced by UBCs that project to one another, but whether this circuitry exists is unclear. Here we test whether UBCs innervate one another and explore how these small networks of UBCs could transform spiking patterns. We characterized two transgenic mouse lines electrophysiologically and immunohistochemically to confirm that they label ON and OFF UBC subtypes and crossed them together, revealing that ON and OFF UBCs innervate one another. A Brainbow reporter was used to label UBCs of the same ON or OFF subtype with different fluorescent proteins, which showed that UBCs innervate their own subtypes as well. Computational models predict that these feed-forward networks of UBCs extend the length of bursts or pauses and introduce delays—transformations that may be necessary for cerebellar functions from modulation of eye movements to adaptive learning across time scales.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>cerebellum</kwd><kwd>synapse</kwd><kwd>mossy fiber</kwd><kwd>unipolar brush cell</kwd><kwd>Brainbow</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100002243</institution-id><institution>National Ataxia Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Balmer</surname><given-names>Timothy S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100002046</institution-id><institution>Hearing Health Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Balmer</surname><given-names>Timothy S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000055</institution-id><institution>National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DC016905</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Balmer</surname><given-names>Timothy S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Unipolar brush cells subtypes, classified by their excitatory or inhibitory response to glutamate, form circuits with one another that may enhance the capacity of the cerebellum to transform input signals.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Head movement signals are encoded by the firing rate of vestibular afferents that project to the cerebellum and brainstem. The vestibular nuclei maintain a sensory representation of the head movement for tens of seconds after the vestibular signal ends through a mechanism called velocity storage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fernandez and Goldberg, 1971</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Raphan et al., 1979</xref>). The cerebellum dynamically modulates the activity of the cells that encode velocity storage to control vestibular responses such as compensatory eye movements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Yakushin et al., 2017</xref>). It is unclear how the cerebellar circuit maintains a representation of a head movement long after the firing of the afferents cease.</p><p>Granule cells receive direct input from vestibular afferents, but cannot maintain the signal long enough to underlie velocity storage, because they produce only transient firing responses. The only other excitatory neuron type in the cerebellar cortex that could provide feed-forward excitation to prolong the signal to granule cells is the unipolar brush cell (UBC). UBCs are powerful circuit elements that amplify their input signals by extending them in time and projecting them to numerous granule cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Berthié and Axelrad, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Mugnaini et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Mugnaini et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Rossi et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Nunzi et al., 2001</xref>). UBCs receive direct input from vestibular afferents, produce long-duration spiking responses, and could therefore contribute to the maintenance of a sensory representation necessary to modulate low-frequency vestibular responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Rossi et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Mugnaini et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Balmer and Trussell, 2019</xref>). Although a single UBC can prolong its input for seconds, multiple UBCs connected in series could extend the signal much further. Indeed, there is some evidence suggesting that UBCs provide direct synaptic input to other UBCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Diño et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Nunzi and Mugnaini, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">van Dorp and De Zeeuw, 2015</xref>).</p><p>In addition to prolonging signals, UBCs may play important roles in diversifying granule cell firing patterns, which is essential for expansion recoding models of cerebellar learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Marr, 1969</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Albus, 1971</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Ito, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kennedy et al., 2014</xref>). This diversity in UBC responses is due to different subtypes of UBCs that can be classified by their expression of specific proteins or neurotransmitter receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Nunzi et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Nunzi et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kim et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Sekerková et al., 2014</xref>) or by their electrophysiological response to synaptic stimulation: ON UBCs that express mGluR1 are excited by glutamate and OFF UBCs that express calretinin are inhibited by glutamate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Borges-Merjane and Trussell, 2015</xref>). Whether UBCs target UBCs of their own subtype, the other, or both, remains unclear and is necessary to understand how sensory signals are extended and diversified in the granule cell layer.</p><p>The connectivity of different subtypes of UBCs is difficult to address. Paired electrophysiological recordings of synaptically connected UBCs are challenging because of their long axons and their relative scarcity among the granule cells. Labeling UBCs of the same subtype with a single fluorophore provides ambiguous results—the axon terminals of UBCs look similar to UBC dendritic brushes, so a UBC axon contacting a dendritic brush of the same color would appear essentially identical to a large brush. We overcame this challenge by utilizing a Brainbow approach and combining mouse lines to label UBC subtypes with different fluorescent proteins. We find that all UBC connectivity patterns are present and develop computational models to simulate how these feed-forward circuits dynamically transform their inputs. Interconnected UBCs prolong and diversify input spiking patterns by producing an extended burst (ON to ON), extended pause (ON to OFF), pause after a delay (OFF to ON), or burst after a delay (OFF to OFF). Thus, UBCs connected in series increase the computational power of the circuit and could underlie mechanisms of cerebellar function that require transmission delays or prolonged activity.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Electrophysiological responses of GRP and P079 UBCs reveal that they are ON and OFF UBC subtypes</title><p>To label a population of UBCs that are excited by glutamate (ON UBCs), we used a mouse line that expressed Cre recombinase (Cre) under the control of the <italic>Grp</italic> (gastrin-releasing peptide [GRP]) promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gerfen et al., 2013</xref>), a promoter that had been reported to be active in mGluR1-expressing (mGluR1(+)) UBCs in a similar mouse line (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kim et al., 2012</xref>).

The latency between presynaptic stimulation and the beginning of the fast EPSC was 1.24 ± 0.29 ms (mean ± SD; n = 13), had a low jitter (defined as the SD of latency; 0.074 ± 0.046 ms; mean ± SD; n = 13), and was reliable, having no failures across all cells and trials, which confirms that they were monosynaptic. Note that these monosynaptic currents are most likely due to the stimulation of mossy fibers, but could also be due to stimulation of severed axons of UBCs. The slow EPSCs peaked 70.13 ± 33.45 ms after the end of the 200-ms-long 50 Hz stimulus train and their decay was well approximated by an exponential with a time constant of 358.31 ± 213.83 ms (mean ± SD; n = 14) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). In current-clamp recordings, synaptic stimulation produced a burst of action potentials in GRP UBCs that varied in duration from 510 to 900 ms (n = 3) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). The synaptic currents in GRP UBCs were confirmed to be mediated by mGluR1 and AMPA receptors because they were blocked by JNJ16259685 and GYKI53655 (99.3 ± 2.4%; paired <italic>t</italic>-test; p=0.0068; n = 9; mean ± SEM) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E and F</xref>). While the two drugs together blocked most of the inward current (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>), their individual contribution ranged widely in different cells (3–70% block by JNJ16259685 and 30–100% block by GYKI53655). This indicates that GRP UBCs are ON UBCs and their synaptic responses vary from being mediated mainly by mGluR1 to being entirely mediated by AMPA receptors.</p><p>Using the same approach, we tested the response to synaptic stimulation in a population of UBCs that expressed mCitrine in a mouse line (P079) that was generated in an enhancer trap forward genetic screen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Shima et al., 2016</xref>). In all P079 UBCs recorded that responded to presynaptic stimulation, a 50 Hz train evoked a slow outward current (n = 12). Faster rates of synaptic stimulation produced larger outward currents (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). The slow outward currents peaked 52.7 ± 46.86 ms after the end of the 200-ms-long 50 Hz stimulus train and their decay was well approximated by an exponential with a time constant of 489.2 ± 350.4 ms (mean ± SD; n = 11) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>). These outward currents hyperpolarized the cells and produced a pause in spontaneous spiking activity that varied from 0.5 to 3.9 s, averaging 1.72 ± 1.19 s (mean ± SD; n = 10) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref>). The outward current was mediated by mGluR2 receptors as it was blocked by the mGluR2 antagonist LY341495 (96.53 ± 1.79%; paired <italic>t</italic>-test; p=0.0033; mean ± SEM) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1J and K</xref>). These electrophysiological characteristics confirm that the P079 UBCs that can be visualized in acute brains slices are OFF UBCs.</p><p>The slow postsynaptic currents were inward in every GRP UBC and outward in every P079 UBC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1L</xref>). The capacitance of GRP UBCs was less than half that of P079 UBCs, which suggests that the membrane area of the OFF UBCs is greater (GRP UBCs: 11.34 pF ± 0.59, n = 15; P079 UBCs: 26.08 pF ± 1.96, n = 12; <italic>t</italic>-test; p&lt;0.0001; mean ± SEM; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1M</xref>). We did not observe a significant difference in input resistance between the two cell types (GRP UBCs: 0.56 GΩ ± 0.04, n = 9; P079 UBCs: 0.64 GΩ ± 0.09, n = 10; <italic>t</italic>-test; p=0.44; mean ± SEM; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1N</xref>). Current steps were injected into both UBC types to characterize their excitability. There was a significant interaction between the UBC type and response to current steps (mixed model ANOVA, p&lt;0.0001, n = 17). GRP UBCs had a higher firing rate in response to the same level of injected current compared to P079 UBCs, despite their similar input resistance, suggesting that GRP ON UBCs are more excitable and can fire at faster rates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1O and P</xref>). Hyperpolarizing current steps produce a sag that is mediated by the h-current (Ih) in UBCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kim et al., 2012</xref>). P079 UBCs had a significantly more prominent sag than GRP UBCs, measured in response to a –100 pA current step (P079: 0.39 ± 0.04, n = 7; GRP: 0.16 ± 0.01, n = 15; <italic>t</italic>-test; p&lt;0.0001; mean ± SEM) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1P and Q</xref>). This is consistent with previous work showing that OFF UBCs have a larger h-current than ON UBCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kim et al., 2012</xref>). In summary, electrophysiological recordings from GRP and P079 UBCs confirm that they are ON and OFF UBC subtypes, respectively.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>GRP and P079 UBCs are distinct subpopulations that differ in size and distribution</title><p>Besides the functional differences in the GFP and mCitrine-expressing UBCs outlined above, these neurons also showed significant differences in their size and distribution.

GRP and P079 UBCs were present in the lobes of the cerebellar vermis in different densities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>).

Action potentials triggered glutamate concentration transients that drove the conductance of model AMPA receptors in ON UBCs and mGluR2 in OFF UBCs (see ‘Materials and methods’). We contrasted simple cases of an excitatory input to either an ON or OFF UBC, with a more complex case in which the excitatory input drove an ‘intermediate’ UBC, which then synapsed on a second UBC.

The length of the delay before the pause began is related to the strength of the AMPA receptor-mediated current in the postsynaptic ON UBC. The length of the pause in the ON UBC depends on how long the intermediate OFF UBC pauses. Thus, an intermediate OFF UBC converts the usual excitatory ON UBC response to a pause that is similar to that of the OFF UBC itself.

Virtually no neurons expressed both fluorescent proteins. Immunohistochemical analysis showed that all GRP UBCs expressed mGluR1 and most P079 UBCs expressed calretinin in both cerebellum and dorsal cochlear nucleus. GRP and P079 UBCs had different average soma sizes and distributions in the cerebellum. Whole-cell recordings in acute brain slices confirmed that the GRP UBCs produce excitatory ON responses mediated by mGluR1 and AMPA receptors, and that P079 UBCs produce inhibitory OFF responses mediated by mGluR2. Their membrane capacitance and excitability were so distinct that the distributions of these properties were almost nonoverlapping. These results provide further evidence that some UBC subtypes are genetically and functionally distinct, despite the observation that when the entire population of UBCs is examined, their electrophysiological responses form a continuum from entirely excited by glutamate to entirely inhibited by glutamate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Guo et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kozareva et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>The UBCs in these mouse lines expressed the fluorescent proteins throughout their axons and presynaptic terminals, which revealed for the first time that axon terminals from one UBC subtype contact the dendric brushes of the other UBC subtype. We also showed that UBCs of the same subtype provide input to one another by labeling GRP or calretinin-Cre UBCs with different fluorescent proteins using the Brainbow2.1-Confetti reporter line. This result was confirmed with additional approaches that utilized the incomplete labeling of mGluR1(+) ON UBCs in the GRP line and the incomplete labeling of calretinin(+) OFF UBCs in the P079 line. Earlier work reported that mGluR1(+) UBCs and calretinin(+) UBCs form parallel pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Nunzi et al., 2002</xref>). Our current data extends the previous result by showing that the even more specific subtypes of GRP or P079 UBCs provide input to members of their own subtype. These networks of UBCs could provide the granule layer with a circuit mechanism to diversify and extend the pattern of spiking produced by mossy fiber input.</p><p>Anatomically identifiable connections between UBCs were not present in all brain slices and finding them required a careful search. UBC labeling was sparse due to the highly specific genetic labeling techniques and further sparsification by the Brainbow reporter, which made it impossible to accurately estimate the density of these UBC to UBC connections. Electrophysiological evidence suggests that UBC to UBC connections are not common because spontaneous EPSCs that would indicate a spontaneously firing presynaptic UBC are not frequently observed in intracellular recordings of UBCs in acute brain slices. In an analysis of feed-forward excitation of granule layer neurons, only 4 out of 140 UBCs were reported to have this indirect evidence of a firing presynaptic UBC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">van Dorp and De Zeeuw, 2015</xref>), which suggests that UBC to UBC connections may be rare. On the other hand, previous work using organotypic slice cultures from P8 mice estimated that 2/3 of the UBC population receives input from other UBCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Nunzi and Mugnaini, 2000</xref>). This suggests a much higher density of UBC to UBC connections, but could be due to the young age of the brains used, which is before UBCs have matured (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Morin et al., 2001</xref>), and also due to increased collateral sprouting that can occur in culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jaeger et al., 1988</xref>). Another study imaged 2–4-week-old rat cerebellar slices at an electron microscopic level and found that 4 out of 14 UBC axon terminals contacted UBC brushes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Diño et al., 2000</xref>). Future work is necessary to accurately estimate the density and impact of feed-forward UBC circuits.</p><p>The purpose of this study was to reveal the postsynaptic targets of UBCs with a focus on ON and OFF UBC subtypes. However, it is important to emphasize that the final output and main target of UBCs are granule cells. Most of the labeled UBC axon terminals did not synapse on UBCs and are therefore presumed to synapse on numerous granule cells. Even the axon terminals that targeted UBCs likely also contacted granule cells. Thus, UBCs are interneurons that, when positioned between mossy fibers and granule cells, modify the input to granule cells and have the capacity to synchronize the firing of large ensembles of granule cells via their branching axons and large terminals.</p><p>The approaches used here were not able to determine the existence of networks of more than two UBCs connected one after the other. If present, three or more UBCs in series could extend and transform the input in even more dramatic ways. The temporal diversity that UBC circuits generate may underlie the flexibility of the cerebellum to coordinate movements over a broad range of behaviors.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Limitations of the model</title><p>Here we addressed how feed-forward glutamatergic excitation and inhibition is transformed from one UBC to the next depending on their subtype. The model focuses on AMPA receptor-mediated excitation and mGluR2-mediated inhibition. One limitation of the model is that it does not consider feed-forward and lateral inhibition from Golgi cells, which shapes the spiking of UBCs in response to afferent stimulation. Golgi cells receive mossy fiber input and inhibit UBCs through their corelease of GABA and glycine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dugué et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Rousseau et al., 2012</xref>). Golgi cells control the temporal dynamics of the firing of granule cells as well as their gain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Rossi et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kanichay and Silver, 2008</xref>) and are critical to larger-scale dynamics of the cerebellar cortical network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">D’Angelo, 2008</xref>). Purkinje cells provide additional inhibition to ON UBCs that could influence how UBC circuits transform signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Guo et al., 2016</xref>). A more complex model that implements Golgi cells and other critical circuit elements will be needed to investigate the role of feed-forward UBC circuits in cerebellar network dynamics and motor behaviors in vivo.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>UBC circuits generate a broad range of firing patterns and may be essential for cerebellar learning</title><p>Vestibular afferents that encode head movements synapse on both UBCs and granule cells. Granule cells that receive this input are likely to fire in phase with the input signal. A single intermediate UBC would shift the phase of firing of its postsynaptic granule cells, depending on the UBC’s response to glutamatergic input, which varies from nearly complete inhibition (e.g., P079 OFF UBC) to complete excitation (e.g., GRP ON UBC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Guo et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kozareva et al., 2021</xref>). For example, an intermediate ON UBC between a presynaptic input and another UBC extended the signal markedly in our models. In circuits with an intermediate OFF UBC, the postsynaptic UBCs signal was inverted: ON UBCs paused when they were no longer driven by glutamate, and OFF UBCs fired when they were no longer inhibited by glutamate. The signal that granule cells subsequently receive would be a burst or pause in firing that lasts for hundreds or thousands of milliseconds. We suggest that these transformations could provide a circuit mechanism for maintaining a sensory representation of movement for seconds, which is thought to be necessary to modulate low-frequency vestibular responses such as compensatory eye movements.</p><p>The delays introduced by an intermediate UBC were due to the slow decay of the excitatory or inhibitory synaptic currents produced by the presynaptic input. Other cellular and synaptic properties that would shape the timing of pauses, delays, and bursts include the amount of glutamate released and the rate of its removal, the geometry of the extracellular space, glutamate receptor number and localization, short-term synaptic plasticity, currents underlying rebound spiking, and intrinsic excitability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kim et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kinney et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Locatelli et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Zampini et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lu et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Balmer et al., 2021a</xref>). The combination of numerous mechanisms that shape the signal as it is transmitted along the granule layer circuit could produce tunable delay lines essential for sensory representation on an enormous range of time scales.</p><p>Extending the duration of a sensory feedback signal may also be essential for motor learning when there is a significant delay between the motor output and the sensory feedback, for example, when throwing an object at distant target, a challenge referred to as the credit assignment problem (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Sutton and Barto, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Raymond and Lisberger, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Suvrathan, 2019</xref>). There are a variety of ways that the cerebellum could extend a signal in time, such as slow axonal conduction, long membrane time constants, inhibition followed by rebound spiking, and slow intracellular processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Braitenberg, 1967</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Rossi et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fiala et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hooper et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">D’Angelo and De Zeeuw, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">van Dorp and De Zeeuw, 2014</xref>). UBCs circuits represent another mechanism that could prolong granule cell firing and contribute to the maintenance of sensory signals that underlie motor learning in behaviors with delayed sensory feedback.</p><p>The diversification of spiking patterns by intermediate UBCs may contribute to the pattern separation that is necessary for theories of cerebellar learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Marr, 1969</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Albus, 1971</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Ito, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kennedy et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Zampini et al., 2016</xref>). In one of the best understood cerebellum-like circuits, the electrosensory lobe of electric fish, UBCs are essential to produce temporally diverse and delayed spiking patterns that are necessary for accurate cancellation of self-generated signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kennedy et al., 2014</xref>). The authors report that a post-inhibitory rebound that occurred in UBCs may account for the delayed spiking patterns. The presence of synaptic pathways with multiple UBCs could contribute to these long pauses and delays that may be critical for adaptive learning on time scales ranging from hundreds of milliseconds to tens of seconds.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Sources of synaptic input to UBC subtypes</title><p>The firing rates of putative UBCs recorded in vivo in the vestibular cerebellum of mammals follow head velocity and eye movements, in some cases with delays of hundreds of milliseconds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Simpson et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Barmack and Yakhnitsa, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hensbroek et al., 2015</xref>). Our data suggests that these long delays could be implemented by feed-forward circuits containing multiple UBCs. It is unknown whether UBCs that are labeled in the GRP or P079 mouse lines are a subtype that receives a specific source of input. In lobe X, ON UBCs defined by their electrophysiological response or mGluR1-expression receive input from both primary vestibular afferents and second-order mossy fibers from the vestibular nucleus, while OFF UBCs only receive vestibular nuclear input (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Balmer and Trussell, 2019</xref>). Understanding whether the UBCs labeled in these mouse lines receive head or eye movement signals, integrated signals that encode head orientation relative to gravity, or another type of signal would help elucidate their specific roles in cerebellar functions.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals</title><p>Mice of both sexes were used from the following mouse lines and their crosses: P079 line: Et(tTA/mCitrine)P079Sbn (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Shima et al., 2016</xref>); GRP-Cre line: Tg(Grp-Cre)KH107Gsat (MMRRC_031182-UCD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gerfen et al., 2013</xref>); Ai9 line: Gt(ROSA)26Sor<sup>tm9(CAG-tdTomato)Hze</sup> (IMSR_JAX:007909) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Madisen et al., 2010</xref>); Brainbow2.1-Confetti line: Gt(ROSA)26Sor<sup>tm1(CAG-Brainbow2.1)Cle/J</sup> (IMSR_JAX:017492) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Snippert et al., 2010</xref>); and calretinin-Cre line: Calb2<sup>tm2.1(cre/ERT2)Zjh/J</sup> (IMSR_JAX:013730) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Taniguchi et al., 2011</xref>).

A train of 10 presynaptic release events produced an 865-ms-long burst in the ON UBC model and a 1545 ms pause in the OFF UBC model, which is within the range observed in our data set.</p><table-wrap id="table3" position="float"><label>Table 3.</label><caption><title>Glutamate diffusion at AMPA and mGluR2 receptors.</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom">Glutamate diffusion parameter</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">AMPA synapse</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">mGluR2 synapse</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Molecules released (#)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">3e6</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">3e5</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Distance (nm)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">750</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">1750</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Diffusion coefficient (cm<sup>2</sup>/s)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">0.33</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">0.33</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Tortuosity</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">1.55</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">1.55</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Volume fraction</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">0.21</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">0.21</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Ambient glutamate (mM)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">0.005</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">0</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><table-wrap id="table4" position="float"><label>Table 4.</label><caption><title>Synaptic conductances.</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom">Synaptic receptor</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">gmax (S/cm<sup>2</sup>)</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Erev (mV)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">ON UBC, AMPA</td><td align="char" char="hyphen" valign="bottom">4e-9</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">0</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">OFF UBC, mGluR2</td><td align="char" char="hyphen" valign="bottom">1e-8</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">–90</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Visualization, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Visualization, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Data curation, Software, Formal analysis, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>All animals were handled according to the approved institutional animal care and use committee (IACUC) protocol #21-1817R.</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s6"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="mdar"><label>MDAR checklist</label><media xlink:href="elife-88321-mdarchecklist1-v1.docx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="docx"/></supplementary-material></sec><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="s7"><title>Data availability</title><p>All data associated with this study are present in the article.

Based on the two types of UBCs known as ON and OFF UBC subtypes, they have highlighted the existing gaps in understanding UBCs connectivity and the need to investigate whether UBCs target UBCs of the same subtype, different subtypes, or both. The importance of this knowledge is for understanding how sensory signals are extended and diversified in the granule cell layer.</p><p>The authors designed very interesting approaches to study UBCs connectivity by utilizing transgenic mice expressing GFP and RFP in UBCs, Brainbow approach, immunohistochemical and electrophysiological analysis, and computational models to understand how the feed-forward circuits of interconnected UBCs transform their inputs.</p><p>This study provided evidence for the existence of distinct ON and OFF UBC subtypes based on their electrophysiological properties, anatomical characteristics, and expression patterns of mGluR1 and calretinin in the cerebellum. The findings support the classification of GRP UBCs as ON UBCs and P079 UBCs as OFF UBCs and suggest the presence of synaptic connections between the ON and OFF UBC subtypes. In addition, they found that GRP and P079 UBCs form parallel and convergent pathways and have different membrane capacitance and excitability. Furthermore, they showed that UBCs of the same subtype provide input to one another and modify the input to granule cells, which could provide a circuit mechanism to diversify and extend the pattern of spiking produced by mossy fiber input. Accordingly, they suggested that these transformations could provide a circuit mechanism for maintaining a sensory representation of movement for seconds.</p><p>Overall, the article is well written in a sound detailed format, very interesting with excellent discovery and suggested model.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="author-comment" id="sa3"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.88321.4.sa3</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author Response</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Hariani</surname><given-names>Harsh N</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Arizona State University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Tempe</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Algstam</surname><given-names>A Brynn</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Arizona State University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Tempe</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Candler</surname><given-names>Christian T</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Arizona State University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Tempe</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Witteveen</surname><given-names>Isabelle F</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Arizona State University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Tempe</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Sidhu</surname><given-names>Jasmeen K</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Arizona State University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Tempe</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Balmer</surname><given-names>Timothy S</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Arizona State University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Tempe</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>The following is the authors’ response to the previous reviews.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>eLife assessment</bold></p><p>This study presents valuable findings about synaptic connectivity among subsets of unipolar brush cells (UBCs), a specialized interneuron primarily located in the vestibular lobules of the cerebellar cortex.

The focus on UBCs, which are largely restricted to vestibular lobes of the cerebellum reduces the breadth of likely interest somewhat. The overall design of specific experiments is rigorous and the use of fluorophore expressing mouse lines is creative. The data that is presented and the writing are clear. However, despite some additional analysis in response to the initial review, the overall experimental design still has issues that reduce overall interpretation (please see specific issues for details), which combined with a lack of thorough analysis of the experimental outcomes undermines the value of the NEURON model results and the advance in our understanding of cerebellar processing in situ (again, please see specific issues for details).</p><p>Specific issues:</p><p>1. All data gathered with inhibition blocked. All of the UBC response data (Fig. 1) was gathered in the presence of GABAAR and Glycine R blockers. While such an approach is appropriate generally for isolating glutamatergic synaptic currents, and specifically for examining and characterizing monosynaptic responses to single stimuli, it becomes problematic in the context of assaying synaptic and action potential response durations for long lasting responses, and in particular for trains of stimuli, when feed-forward and feed-back inhibition modulates responses to afferent stimulation. I.e. even for single MF stimuli, given the &gt;500ms duration of UBC synaptic currents, there is plenty of time for feedback inhibition from Golgi cells (or feedforward, from MF to Golgi cell excitation) to interrupt AP firing driven by the direct glutamatergic synaptic excitation. This issue is compounded further for all of the experiments examining trains of MF stimuli. Beyond the impact of feedback inhibition on the AP firing of any given UBC, it would also obviously reduce/alter/interrupt that UBC's synaptic drive of downstream UBCs. This issue fundamentally undermines our ability to interpret the simulation data of Vm and AP firing of both the modeled intermediate and downstream UBC, in terms of applying it to possible cerebellar cortical processing in situ.</p></disp-quote><p>The goal of Figure 1 was to determine the cell types of labeled UBCs in transgenic mouse lines, which is determined entirely by their synaptic responses to glutamate (Borges-Merjane and Trussell, 2015). Thus, blocking inhibition was essential to produce clear results in the characterization of GRP and P079 UBCs. While GABAergic/glycinergic feedforward and feedback inhibition is certainly important in the intact circuit, it was not our intention, nor was it possible, to study its contribution in the present study. Leaving inhibition unblocked does not lead to a physiologically realistic stimulation pattern in acute brain slices, because electrical stimulation produces synchronous excitation and inhibition by directly exciting Golgi cells, rather than their synaptic inputs. The main inhibition that UBCs receive that are crucial to determining burst or pause durations is not via GABA/glycine, but instead through mGluR2, which lasts for 100-1000s of milliseconds. The main excitation that drives UBC firing is mGluR1 and AMPA, which both last 100-1000s of milliseconds. Thus, these large conductances are unlikely to be significantly shaped by 1-10 ms IPSCs from feedforward and feedback GABA/glycine inhibition. Recent studies that examined the duration of bursting or pausing in UBCs had inhibition blocked in their experiments, presumably for the reasons outlined above (Guo et al., 2021; Huson et al., 2023).</p><p>Below is an example showing the synaptic currents and firing patterns in an ON UBC before and after blocking inhibition. The GABA/glycinergic inhibition is fast, occurs soon after the stimuli and has little to no effect on the slow inward current that develops after the end of stimulation, which is what drives firing for 100s of milliseconds.</p><fig id="sa3fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Example showing small effect of GABAergic and glycinergic inhibition on excitatory currents and burst duration.</title><p>(A) Excitatory postsynaptic currents in response to train of 10 presynaptic stimuli at 50 Hz before (black) and after (Grey) blocking GABA and glycine receptors.

That was not the issue raised. The issue raised was that then using only such information to generate a model of in situ behavior becomes problematic, given that feedback and lateral inhibition will sculpt action potential output, which of course will then fundamentally shape their synaptic drive of secondary UBCs, which will be further sculpted by their own inhibitory inputs. This issue undermines interpretation of the NEURON model.</p><p>The argument that taking inhibition into account is not possible because of assumed or possible direct electrical excitation of Golgi cells is confusing for two interacting reasons. First, one can certainly stimulate the mossy fiber bundle to get afferent excitation of UBCs (and polysynaptic feedback/lateral inhibitory inputs) without directly stimulating the Golgi cells that innervate any recorded UBC. Yes, one might be stimulating some Golgi cells near the stimulating electrode, but one can position the stimulating electrode far enough down the white matter track (away from the recorded UBC), such that mossy fiber inputs to the recorded UBC can be stimulated without affecting Golgi cells near or synaptically connected to the recorded UBC. Moreover, if the argument were true, then presumably the stimulation protocol would be just as likely to directly stimulate neighboring UBCs, which then drove the recorded UBC's responses. Thus, it is both doable and should be ensured that stimulation of the white matter is distant enough to not be directly activating relevant, connected neurons within the granule cell layer.</p><p>Finally, the authors present three examples of UBC recordings with and without inhibitory inputs blocked, and state &quot;Thus, these large conductances are unlikely to be significantly shaped by 1-10 ms IPSCs from feedforward and feedback GABA/glycine inhibition&quot; and &quot;GABA/glycinergic inhibition...has little to no effect on the slow inward current that develops after the end of stimulation&quot;. This response reflects on original concerns about lack of quantification or consideration of important parameters. In particular, while the traces with and without inhibition are qualitatively similar, quantitative considerations indicate otherwise. First, unquantified examples are not adequate to drive conclusions. Regardless, the main issue (how inhibition affects actual responses in situ) is actually highlighted by the authors current clamp recordings of UBC responses, before and after blocking inhibition. The output response is dramatically different, both at early and late time points, when inhibition is blocked. Again, a lack of quantification (of adequate n's) makes it hard to know exactly how important, but quick &quot;eye ball&quot; estimates of impact include: (1) a switch from only low frequency APs initially (without inhibition blocked) to immediate burst of high frequency APs (high enough to not discern individual APs with given figure resolution) when inhibition is blocked, (2) Slow rising to a peak EPSP, followed by symmetrical return to baseline (without inhibition blocked) versus immediate rise to peak, followed by prolonged decay to baseline (with inhibition blocked), (3) substantially shorter duration (~34% shorter) secondary high frequency burst (individual APs not discernible) of APs (with inhibition blocked versus without inhibition blocked), and (4) substantial reduction in number of long delayed APs (with inhibition blocked versus without inhibition blocked). Thus, clearly, feedback/lateral inhibition is actually sculpting AP output at all phases of the UBC response to trains of afferent stimulations. Importantly, the single voltage clamp trace showing little impact of transient IPSCs on the slow EPSC do not take into account likely IPSC influences on voltage-activated conductances that would not occur in voltage-clamp recordings but would be free to manifest in current clamp, and thereby influence AP output, as observed.</p><p>So again, our ability to understand how interconnected UBCs behave in the intact system is undermined by the lack of consideration and quantification of the impact of inhibition, and it not being incorporated into the model. At the very least a strong proviso about lack of inclusion of such information, given the authors' data showing its importance in the few examples shown, should be added to the discussion.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this substantive explanation. Your points are well described and we agree that the single experiment shown is not strong evidence for a lack of importance of Golgi cell inhibition, especially on the temporal dynamics of spiking. Previous work has clearly shown that Golgi cells have several important roles in shaping the activity of the granular layer, including affecting the temporal dynamics of granule cell spikes. However, the work presented here focuses on the feedforward circuitry of UBCs and the large inward and large outward glutamatergic currents that drive spiking or pausing for 100s of milliseconds. Our model does not focus on the aspects that are most sensitive to Golgi cell inhibition, including timing of the first spikes in the UBC’s response. Nor does our model focus on short term plasticity, which we thought was reasonable because the slow currents in UBCs are quite insensitive to the temporal characteristics of glutamate release (See the example in the previous rebuttal). Our model does not include long term plasticity, which is also affected by Golgi cells. For these reasons we agree that the model presented does not explain how feedforward UBC circuits might “play out in the actual brain circuit and how it would impact the processing of feedback or feedforward activity that would be required to promote behavior.” We have included a new paragraph in the discussion clarifying the limitations of this study and the model, reproduced below.</p><p>&quot;Limitations of the model</p><p>Here we addressed how feedforward glutamatergic excitation and inhibition is transformed from one UBC to the next depending on their subtype. The model focuses on AMPA receptor mediated excitation and mGluR2 mediated inhibition. One limitation of the model is that it does not consider feedforward and lateral inhibition from Golgi cells, which shape the spiking of UBCs in response to afferent stimulation. Golgi cells receive mossy fiber input and inhibit UBCs through their corelease of GABA and glycine (Dugue et al., 2005; Rousseau et al., 2012). Golgi cells control the temporal dynamics of the firing of granule cells as well as their gain (Rossi et al., 2003; Kanichay and Silver, 2008) and are critical to larger scale dynamics of the cerebellar cortical network (D‘Angelo, 2008). Purkinje cells provide additional inhibition to ON UBCs that could influence how UBC circuits transform signals (Guo et al., 2016). A more complex model that implements Golgi cells and other critical circuit elements will be needed to investigate the role of feedforward UBC circuits in cerebellar network dynamics and motor behaviors in vivo.&quot;</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. No consideration for involvement of polysynaptic UBCs driving UBC responses to MF stimulation in electrophysiology experiments. Given the established existence (in this manuscript and Dino et al. 2000 Neurosci, Dino et al. 2000 ProgBrainRes, Nunzi and Mugnaini 2000 JCompNeurol, Nunzi et al. 2001 JCompNeurol) of polysynaptic connections from MFs to UBCs to UBCs, the MF evoked UBC responses established in this manuscript, especially responses to trains of stimuli could be mediated by direct MF inputs, or to polysynaptic UBC inputs, or possibly both (to my awareness not established either way). Thus the response durations could already include extension of duration by polysynaptic inputs, and so would overestimate the duration of monosynaptic inputs, and thus polysynaptic amplification/modulation, observed in the NEURON model.</p></disp-quote><p>We are confident that the synaptic responses shown are monosynaptic for several reasons. UBCs receive a single mossy fiber input on their dendritic brush, and thus if our stimulation produces a reliable, short-latency response consistent with a monosynaptic input, then there is not likely to be a disynaptic input, because the main input is accounted for by the monosynaptic response. In all cells included in our data set, the fast AMPA receptor-mediated currents always occurred with short latency (1.24 ± 0.29 ms; mean ± SD; n = 13), high reliability (no failures to produce an EPSC in any of the 13 GRP UBCs in this data set), and low jitter (SD of latency; 0.074 ± 0.046 ms; mean ± SD; n = 13). These measurements have been added to the results section.</p><p>In some rare cases, we did observe disynaptic currents, which were easily distinguishable because a single electrical stimulation produced a burst of EPSCs at variable latencies. Please see example below. These cases of disynaptic input, which have been reported by others (Diño et al., 2000; Nunzi and Mugnaini, 2000; van Dorp and De Zeeuw, 2015) support the conclusion that UBCs receive input from other UBCs.</p><fig id="sa3fig2" position="float"><label>Author response image 2.</label><caption><title>Example of GRP UBC with disynaptic input.</title><p>Three examples of the effect of a single presynaptic stimulus (triangle) in a GRP UBC with presumed disynaptic input.

Comp. Neurol.) indicating that UBCs are innervated by 1-2 mossy fibers, which are as likely other UBC terminals as MFs. This leaves open the possibility that so called monosynaptic responses do, as originally suggested, already include polysynaptic feedforward amplification of duration. While the authors also indicate that isolated disynaptic currents can be observed when they occur in isolation, a careful examination and objective documentation of &quot;monosynaptic&quot; responses would address this issue. Presumably, if potential disynaptic UBC inputs occur during a monosynaptic MF response, it would be detected as an abrupt biphasic inward/outward current, due to additional AMPA receptor activation but further desensitization of those already active (as observed by Kinney et al. 1997 J. Neurophysiol: &quot;The delivery of a second MF stimulus at the peak of the slow EPSC evoked a fast EPSC of reduced amplitude followed by an undershoot of the subsequent slow current&quot;). If such polysynaptic inputs are truly absent and are &quot;rare&quot; in isolation, some estimation of how common or not such synaptic amplification is, would improve our understanding of the overall significance of these inputs.</p></disp-quote><p>We are confident that these currents are monosynaptic, because, as suggested, we carefully analyzed the latency, jitter and reliability, which was added to the previous revision. The latency and jitter are strong (quantitative) evidence that the first EPSC evoked was monosynaptic. While some UBCs have been reported to have multiple brushes, or brushes that branch and may contact multiple mossy fibers, or receive synaptic input onto their somas, these cases are rare in our experience in this age of mouse and there is no evidence for them in this dataset. For every trace we made a careful examination and documented that no delayed EPSCs were present. The presence of delayed EPSCs (or ‘abrupt biphasic inward/outward currents’ as described in Kinney et al 1997) would indeed suggest the presence of disynaptic activity or multiple inputs to the UBC, but these would be easily identified, even during a stimulation train. For these reasons we feel that we have established that polysynaptic feedforward amplification of duration is not present</p><p>We agree that the monosynaptic responses could be due to the stimulation of UBC axons. However, the absence of delayed EPSCs again suggests that if stimulation of a presynaptic UBC axon was producing the currents in the recorded UBC, then the axon was severed from the soma and AIS, because this region is necessary for the cell to produce more than a single spike per stimulation. We added a sentence describing the potential for the monosynaptic EPSCs to be due to the stimulation of presynaptic UBC axons.</p><p>Your point is well taken that a discussion of how common or rare these UBC to UBC connections is necessary to more clearly explain how we interpret their significance and we have expanded the paragraph in the discussion that does so. Thank you for this suggestion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. Lack of quantification of subtypes of UBC interconnectivity. Given that it is already established that UBCs synapse onto other UBCs (see refs above), the main potential advance of this manuscript in terms of connectivity is the establishment and quantification of ON-ON, ON-OFF, OFF-ON, and OFF-OFF subtypes of UBC interconnections. But, the authors only establish that each type exists, showing specific examples, but no quantification of the absolute or relative density was provided, and the authors' unquantified wording explicitly or implicitly states that they are not common. This lack of quantification and likely small number makes it difficult to know how important or what impact such synapses have on cerebellar processing, in the model and in situ.</p></disp-quote><p>As noted by the reviewer, the connections between UBCs were rare to observe. We decided against attempting to quantify the absolute or relative density of connections for several reasons. A major reason for rare observations of anatomical connections between UBCs is likely due to the sparse labeling. First, the GRP mouse line only labels 20% of ON UBCs and we are unable to test whether postsynaptic connectivity of GRP ON UBCs is the same as that of the rest of the population of ON UBCs that are not labeled in the GRP mouse line. Second, the Brainbow reporter mouse only labels a small population of Cre expressing cells for unknown reasons. Third, the Brainbow reporter expression was so low that antibody amplification was necessary, which then limited the labeled cells to those close to the surface of the brain slices, because of known antibody penetration difficulties. Therefore, we refrained from estimating the density of these connections, because each of these variables reduced the labeling to unknown degrees and we reasoned that extrapolating our rare observations to the total population would be inaccurate.</p><p>A paper that investigated UBC connectivity using organotypic slice cultures from P8 mice suggests that 2/3 of the UBC population receives UBC input, based on the observation that 2/3 of the mossy fibers did not degenerate as would be expected after 2 days in vitro if they were severed from a distant cell body (Nunzi and Mugnaini, 2000). It remains to be seen if this high proportion is due to the young age of these mice or is also the case in adult mice. Even if these connections are indeed rare, they are expected to have profound effects on the circuit, as each UBC has multiple mossy fiber terminals (Berthie and Axelrad, 1994), and mossy fiber terminals are estimated to contact 40 granule cells each (Jakab and Hamori, 1988). We have added a comment regarding this point to the discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>To address this issue, the authors added the following text to the discussion section: &quot;We did not estimate the density of these UBC to UBC connections, because the sparseness of labeling using these approaches made an accurate calculation impossible. Previous work using organotypic slice cultures from P8 mice estimated that 2/3 of the UBC population receives input from other UBCs (Nunzi &amp; Mugnaini, 2000), although it is unclear whether this is the case in older mice.&quot;</p><p>While accurate, the addition doesn't really address the situation, which is that apparently the reported connections are rare. Adding the information about 2/3 of UBCs having UBC inputs in culture, implies the opposite might be true (i.e. that they might be quite common), which is in contrast to the authors' data, so should be reworded for clarity, which should also incorporate the considerations covered in point #2 above. I.e. if the authors do establish that none of their recordings have polysynaptic inputs, and if they determine that the number of cells that showed isolated di-synaptic inputs is indeed rare, then it suggests that these specific polysynaptic connections are in fact rare.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for pointing this out. We agree that adding this information is somewhat contradictory to our results and we have added more to this section in the discussion, provided below.</p><p>Anatomically identifiable connections between UBCs were not present in all brain slices and finding them required a careful search. UBC labeling was sparse due to the highly specific genetic labeling techniques and further sparsification by the Brainbow reporter, which made it impossible to estimate the density of these UBC to UBC connections. Electrophysiological evidences suggest that UBC to UBC connections are not common, because spontaneous EPSCs that would indicate a spontaneously firing presynaptic UBC are only rarely observed in UBCs recorded in acute brain slices. In an analysis of feedforward excitation of granule layer neurons, only 4 out of 140 UBCs had this indirect evidence of a firing presynaptic UBC (van Dorp and De Zeeuw, 2015), which suggests that UBC to UBC connections may be rare. On the other hand, previous work using organotypic slice cultures from P8 mice estimated that 2/3 of the UBC population receives input from other UBCs (Nunzi &amp; Mugnaini, 2000). This suggests a much higher density of UBC to UBC connections, but could be due to the young age of the brains used, which is before UBCs have matured (Morin et al., 2001), and also due to increased collateral sprouting that can occur in culture (Jaeger et al., 1988). Another study imaged 2-4 week old rat cerebellar slices at an electron microscopic level and found that 4 out of 14 UBC axon terminals contacted UBC brushes (Diño et al., 2000). Future work is necessary to accurately estimate the density and impact of these feedforward UBC circuits.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. Lack of critical parameters in NEURON model.</p><p>A) The model uses # of molecules of glutamate released as the presumed quantal content, and this factor is constant.</p><p>However, no consideration of changes in # of vesicles released from single versus trains of APs from MFs or UBCs is included. At most simple synapses, two sequential APs alters release probability, either up or down, and release probability changes dynamically with trains of APs. It is therefore reasonable to imagine UBC axon release probability is at least as complicated, and given the large surface area of contact between two UBCs, the number of vesicles released for any given AP is also likely more complex.</p><p>B) the model does not include desensitization of AMPA receptors, which in the case of UBCs can paradoxically reduce response magnitude as vesicle release and consequent glutamate concentration in the cleft increases (Linney et al. 1997 JNeurophysiol, Lu et al. 2017 Neuron, Balmer et al. 2021 eLIFE), as would occur with trains of stimuli at MF to ON-UBCs.</p></disp-quote><p>A) The model produces synaptic AMPA and mGluR2 currents that reproduce those we recorded in vitro. We did not find it necessary to implement changes in glutamate release during a train as the model was fit to UBC data with the assumption that the glutamate transient did not change during the train. If there is a change in neurotransmitter release during a train, it is therefore built into the model, which has the advantage of reducing its complexity. UBCs are a special case where the postsynaptic currents are mediated mostly by the total amount of transmitter released. Most of the evoked current occurs tens to hundreds of milliseconds after neurotransmitter release and is therefore much more sensitive to total release and less sensitive to how it is released during the train. The figure below shows the effect of reducing the amount of glutamate released by 10% on each stimulus in the model. Despite a significant change in the pattern of neurotransmitter release, as well as a reduction in the total amount of glutamate, the slow EPSC still decays over the course of hundreds of milliseconds.</p><p>B) The detailed kinetic AMPA receptor model used here accurately reproduces desensitization, which in fact mediates that the slow ON UBC current. This AMPA receptor is a 13-state model, including 4 open states with 1-4 glutamates bound, 4 closed states with 1-4 glutamates bound, 4 desensitized states with 1-4 glutamates bound, and 5 closed states with 0-4 glutamates bound. The forward and reverse rates between different states in the model were fit to AMPA receptor currents recorded from dissociated UBCs and they accurately reproduced the ON UBC currents evoked by synaptic stimulation in our previous work (Balmer et al., 2021).</p><fig id="sa3fig3" position="float"><label>Author response image 3.</label><caption><title>Effect of short-term depression of neurotransmitter release.</title><p>(A) The top trace shows the glutamate transient that drives the AMPA receptor model used in our study. No change in release is implemented, although the slow tail of the transient summates during the train. The bottom trace shows the modeled AMPA receptor mediated current.

The duration of the slow AMPA current is similar, despite a profound change in the pattern of neurotransmitter exposure.</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-88321-sa3-fig3-v1.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>While the authors have not added the suggested additional parameters, their clarifications regarding the implications of existing parameters, and demonstration of reasonable fits to experimental data, and lack of substantial effect of simulating reduced vesicle release probability,</p><p>5. Lack of quantification of various electrophysiological responses. UBCs are defined (ON or OFF) based on inward or outward synaptic response, but no information is provided about the range of the key parameter of duration across cells, which seems most critical to the current considerations. There is a similar lack of quantification across cells of AP duration in response to stimulation or current injections, or during baseline. The latter lack is particularly problematic because in agreement with previous publications, the raw data in Fig. 1 shows ON UBCs as quiescent until MF stimulation and OFF UBCs firing spontaneously until MF stimulation, but, for example, at least one ON UBC in the NEURON model is firing spontaneously until synaptically activated by an OFF UBC (Fig. 11A), and an OFF UBC is silent until stimulated by a presynaptic OFF UBC (Fig. 11C). This may be expected/explainable theoretically, but then such cells should be observed in the raw data.</p></disp-quote><p>To address this reasonable concern of a general lack of quantification of electrophysiological responses we have added data characterizing the slow inward and outward currents evoked by synaptic stimulation in GRP and P079 UBCs in the results section and in new panels in Figure 1. We report the action potential pause lengths in P079 UBCs and burst lengths in ON UBCs in the results section. However, we favor the duration of the currents to the length of burst and pause, because the currents do not depend on a stable resting membrane potential, which is itself difficult to determine in intracellular recordings of these small cells. In a series of recent publications that focused on UBC firing, the authors argue that cell-attached recordings are necessary to determine accurately the burst and pause lengths, as well as spontaneous firing rates (Guo et al., 2021; Huson et al., 2023). (The trade-off of these extracellular recordings is that the monosynaptic nature of the input is nearly impossible to confirm.) Spontaneous firing rates were variable within both GRP and P079 UBCs from silent to firing regularly or in bursts, as previously reported (Kim et al., 2012; van Dorp and De Zeeuw, 2015). For clarity, we chose to model the GRP UBCs as silent unless receiving synaptic input and P079 UBCs as active unless receiving synaptic input. As the reviewer suggests, we have observed UBCs firing in the patterns similar to those shown in the model UBCs having input from spontaneous presynaptic UBCs. Below are some examples of spontaneous EPSCs and IPSCs in UBCs that suggest the presence of a presynaptic UBC.</p><fig id="sa3fig4" position="float"><label>Author response image 4.</label><caption><title>Examples of UBCs that receive spontaneous input.</title><p>(A) Three ON UBCs that had spontaneous EPSCs, suggesting the presence of an active presynaptic UBC.

Based on the two types of UBCs known as ON and OFF UBC subtypes, they have highlighted the existing gaps in understanding UBCs connectivity and the need to investigate whether UBCs target UBCs of the same subtype, different subtypes, or both. The importance of this knowledge is for understanding how sensory signals are extended and diversified in the granule cell layer.</p><p>The authors designed very interesting approaches to study UBCs connectivity by utilizing transgenic mice expressing GFP and RFP in UBCs, Brainbow approach, immunohistochemical and electrophysiological analysis, and computational models to understand how the feed-forward circuits of interconnected UBCs transform their inputs.</p><p>This study provided evidence for the existence of distinct ON and OFF UBC subtypes based on their electrophysiological properties, anatomical characteristics, and expression patterns of mGluR1 and calretinin in the cerebellum. The findings support the classification of GRP UBCs as ON UBCs and P079 UBCs as OFF UBCs and suggest the presence of synaptic connections between the ON and OFF UBC subtypes. In addition, they found that GRP and P079 UBCs form parallel and convergent pathways and have different membrane capacitance and excitability. Furthermore, they showed that UBCs of the same subtype provide input to one another and modify the input to granule cells, which could provide a circuit mechanism to diversify and extend the pattern of spiking produced by mossy fiber input. Accordingly, they suggested that these transformations could provide a circuit mechanism for maintaining a sensory representation of movement for seconds.</p><p>Overall, the article is well written in a sound detailed format, very interesting with excellent discovery and suggested model.</p><p>I believe the authors have provided appropriate responses and have consequently revised the manuscript in a convincing manner.
