subsarcolemmal mitochondria (SSM) with unknown role. Here, we investigated the development and functional role of CM crests during the postnatal period. We found in rodents that CM crest maturation occurs late between postnatal day 20 (P20) and P60 through both SSM biogenesis, swelling and crest-crest lateral interactions between adjacent CM, promoting tissue compaction. At the functional level, we showed that the P20-P60 period is dedicated to the improvement of relaxation. Interestingly, crest maturation specifically contributes to an atypical CM hypertrophy of its short axis, without myofibril addition, but relying on CM lateral stretching. Mechanistically, using constitutive and conditional CM-specific knock-out mice, we identified ephrin-B1, a lateral membrane stabilizer, as a molecular determinant of P20-P60 crest maturation, governing both the CM lateral stretch and the diastolic function, thus highly suggesting a link between crest maturity and diastole. Remarkably, while young adult CM-specific Efnb1 KO mice essentially exhibit an impairment of the ventricular diastole with preserved ejection fraction and exercise intolerance, they progressively switch toward systolic heart failure with 100% KO mice dying after 13 months, indicative of a critical role of CM-ephrin-B1 in the adult heart function. This study highlights the molecular determinants and the biological implication of a new late P20-P60 postnatal developmental stage of the heart in rodents during which, in part, ephrin-B1 specifically regulates the maturation of the CM surface crests and of the diastolic function.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>cardiac postnatal devleopment</kwd><kwd>cardiomyocyte architecture</kwd><kwd>subsarcolemmal mitochondria</kwd><kwd>cardiac hypertrophy</kwd><kwd>diatolic function</kwd><kwd>ephrin-B1</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd><kwd>Rat</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Fondation Bettencourt Schueller</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>-</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Galés</surname><given-names>Celine</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004431</institution-id><institution>Fondation de France</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>75807</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Galés</surname><given-names>Celine</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Fondation Recherche Médicale</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DEQ20170336733</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Galés</surname><given-names>Celine</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Eprhin B1 in the cardiomyocyte regulates the maturation of the adult surface crest architecture and of the diastolic function during a late postnatal stage in rodents.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The mammalian adult cardiomyocyte (CM) harbors a typical rod shape specifically dedicated to the function of the adult heart. Understanding the maturation of the adult rod-shaped CM can provide important insights for regenerative medicine, especially for the differentiation of hiPSC cells into fully mature rod-shaped adult CMs, which still remains an obstacle. To date, the molecular events leading to the setting of the CM rod shape during the postnatal stage are still unknown.</p><p>Indeed, despite fetal and adult CMs being extensively studied, the postnatal stage has only recently garnered an unprecedented interest with the discovery of the potential of adult CMs to proliferate and regenerate the heart (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bergmann et al., 2009</xref>). Thus, strategies in this field have focused on boosting this regenerative process by exploiting factors specifically involved in the early CM proliferation arrest that occurs during the postnatal period (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Karra and Poss, 2017</xref>). However, despite the postnatal maturation period characterizing the exit of the CM from the cell cycle, it also coincides with a morphogenesis step during which the CM switches from a proliferative rounded shape to a nonproliferative mature rod shape (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Anversa et al., 1980</xref>). In situ, mammalian CMs stop dividing and start their morphogenesis maturation around postnatal day 7 (P7) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Porrello et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Porrello et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>The postnatal morphogenesis stage of the CM relies on a polarization process that results in the asymmetric organization of the plasma membrane components underlying specific functions with an atypical basolateral polarity. It begins with a longitudinal elongation process of the CM to progressively evolve into the rod-shaped characteristic of the mature adult state. Contrary to epithelial cells harboring a basolateral and apical side, the adult CM lacks the apical side and looks like a barrel surrounded by a unique basal side with a basement membrane connecting the fibrillar extracellular matrix (ECM) and flanked by two intercalated disks (ID) involved in the CM-CM tight interactions, shaping the longitudinal alignment of myofibers within the tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kanzaki et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kanzaki et al., 2012</xref>). The ID phenocopies the lateral side of polarized epithelial cells with the presence of tight, adherent, gap junctions and desmosomes that play a specific role in the anchorage of the contractile myofilaments but also in the synchronization of the contraction. One architectural feature of the basal side of the adult CM, also called the lateral membrane, also relies on its important intracellular invaginations into transverse T-tubules, which play a key role in both action potential propagation and Ca<sup>2+</sup> handling/excitation–contraction coupling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Ibrahim et al., 2011</xref>. Likewise, the extracellular side of the lateral membrane seems more complex than initially suspected since, besides the presence of a costamere structure expressing classical transmembrane receptors (integrin and DGC dystroglycan-glycoprotein complex) that connect the ECM components to the intracellular myofibrils, we and others have reported the atypical presence of transmembrane proteins, claudin-5 and ephrin-B1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Genet et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Sanford et al., 2005</xref>), more likely involved in cell–cell communication. This finding was unexpected since, contrary to the ID, the lateral membrane was until recently viewed as a CM side lacking physical interactions with neighboring CMs. However, these last years, using high-resolution nanoscale imaging, i.e., SCIM, AFM, and MET, we and Gorelik’s lab have described a highly organized architecture of the lateral membrane on adult CMs with periodic crests (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Dague et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Guilbeau-Frugier et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Nikolaev et al., 2010</xref>) filled with subsarcolemmal mitochondria (SSM) whose role is unknown. Furthermore, we provided evidence for the existence, in the 3D cardiac tissue, of intermittent lateral crest–crest contacts all along the lateral membrane through claudin-5/claudin-5 tight junctional interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Guilbeau-Frugier et al., 2019</xref>), thus reconciling the presence of such cell–cell communication proteins on the lateral face of the adult CM. However, exactly when and how the lateral membrane crests of the CM maturate is completely unknown.</p><p>In this study, we investigated the maturation of the CM crests and their role during the postnatal period. We provide evidence for a late postnatal development stage, following the set-up of the rod shape, during which crests fully maturate through SSM swelling. We also show that this maturation step of the crests is ephrin-B1-dependent and specifically regulates the diastolic function of the adult heart.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>CM lateral surface crests maturate late after postnatal day 20</title><p>In-depth study of the CM crests is only meaningful when studied in situ, i.e., within the cardiac tissue, since (1) we have previously shown that these structures rapidly shrink and disappear following CM isolation and culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Dague et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Guilbeau-Frugier et al., 2019</xref>) and (2) we have demonstrated that CMs establish intermittent lateral interactions through physical crest–crest interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Guilbeau-Frugier et al., 2019</xref>), an observation unique to the cardiac tissue since adult CMs loss their physical contacts in culture. Also, we investigated crest maturation during the postnatal period on the left ventricle tissue of male rat hearts from different postnatal days (P0/birth, P5, P20, P60/young adult) using transmission electron microscopy (TEM) as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Guilbeau-Frugier et al., 2019</xref>). We first focus our attention on the rat species for facilitating visualization of the CM crests/SSM at early postnatal stages. Surprisingly, at P0, while the contractile apparatus is disorganized in the neonatal CM, myofibrils are already orientated on the longitudinal axis of the cell with the first layer already anchored to the plasma membrane through Z-lines, and thus outlining a periodic crest-like architecture, more likely plasma membrane protrusions, which can yet be visualized all along the CM surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). These immature and disordered crests already attempt to interact with crests from a neighboring CM. At this stage, no SSM could be observed. Then, crest maturation throughout the postnatal period occurs in two steps. A first early step, already completed by P5, relies on the maturation of the Z-lines, which delimits each sarcomere from the outer myofibril, allowing better visualization of the surface crest structure, concomitant to the myofilament alignment/organization that follows the morphological elongation of the CM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, P5). However, crests still display an unstructured morphology and their heights, directly correlated with the SSM number as previously described in adult CMs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Guilbeau-Frugier et al., 2019</xref>), are small ('flat'-appearance) due to the lack or the presence of very small SSM, likely immature SSM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). By comparison, much larger but disorganized interfibrillar mitochondria (IFM) can be visualized in CMs at birth (P0) predominantly around CM nuclei (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>), while they mature until P60 through both swelling (completed at P20) and alignment along the myofilaments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). The crest immaturity persists until P20, a late stage of the postnatal period, while the CM has already implemented its rod shape (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>) and completed its whole cytoarchitecture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Piquereau et al., 2010</xref>), as indicated by the perfect alignment of sarcomere Z-lines between myofibril layers inferred from the α-actinin staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>). It is worth noting that at P20, CMs from left ventricular myocardium display different morphologies with both rod-shaped and spindle-shaped CMs when compared with only rod-shaped CMs at P60 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>, lower panels). Interestingly, a second but delayed maturation step of the surface crests occurs between P20 and the adult stage (P60) through substantial SSM swelling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), during which crest heights significantly expand up, correlating with an increase in both the SSM number and area (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Similar P20-P60 crest/SSM maturation was depicted in the mouse heart tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5</xref>), thus agreeing with conservation of the postnatal maturation of the heart in mouse and rat as recently reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Li et al., 2022</xref>). We further confirmed this maturation of the CM surface crests after P20 by analyzing the expression and localization of claudin-5, a tight-junctional protein that we previously described as a determinant of the lateral crest–crest interactions between the lateral membrane of neighboring CMs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Guilbeau-Frugier et al., 2019</xref>). While claudin-5 protein expression is progressively induced in the cardiac tissue at birth (P0), reaching its maximal expression at P5-P10 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, left panel), complete localization of the protein at the lateral membrane of the CM occurs only between P20 and P60 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, right panel), most likely in agreement with the implementation of claudin-5/claudin-5-dependent interactions necessary to clip crests from neighboring CMs that we previously described at the adult stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Guilbeau-Frugier et al., 2019</xref>). In line with this mechanism, atypical tight junctions connecting crests from the lateral face of neighbor CMs could be observed only in the P60 adult stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s6">Figure 1—figure supplement 6</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Cardiomyocyte (CM) surface crests mature after postnatal day 20 (P20).</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) micrographs showing representative CM surface crest relief (yellow arrows) and associated subsarcolemmal mitochondria (SSM) (red stars) during rat postnatal maturation at postnatal day 0 (P0), 5 (P5), 20 (P20), and 60 (P60).

Thus, while connexin 43 (gap junctions), desmoplakin 1/2 (desmosomes), and N-cadherin (Adherens junctions) are located on both the lateral membrane and the ID at P20, they fully relocalize to the ID at P60 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s7">Figure 1—figure supplement 7</xref>).

Volcano plot analysis of the transcriptome and the heat map clearly show a significant difference between P20 and P60 heart gene expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A and B</xref>) with 1000 protein-coding genes that are up- or downregulated between P20 and P60 (p&lt;0.05, fold change ˃ 1.5). The gene ontology (GO) enrichment analysis revealed significantly affected biological pathways (p&lt;0.05) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>) that are upregulated and mainly related to processes of the immune defense system, muscle cell differentiation, angiogenesis, positive regulation of cell death, different metabolisms including antioxidant defense, plasma membrane-related transport/signaling together with many pathways related to the nervous system development. By contrast, many ECM and developmental processes are downregulated. It is worth noting that some upregulated metabolic pathways relate to heart fuels other than fatty acids and glucose (tryptophan, glutamate, glycine/serine/threonine metabolisms), thus suggesting that the heart increases its metabolic flexibility between P20 and P60. To get a better idea of the cardiac cells impacted by the P20-P60 transition, we next performed a gene clustering according to the whole cardiac cell populations established by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Tucker et al., 2020</xref> in the human heart ('Materials and methods'). This analysis has to be taken only from a global qualitative standpoint since we assumed between murine and human heart (1) similar populations of the largest cardiac cells (cardiomyocytes, endothelial cells, fibroblasts, etc.), (2) similar main transcriptomic features of these largest cardiac cells, and (3) similar cardiac cell populations at P20 and P60. In line with the GO analysis, we found that the main downregulation of the transcriptome between P20 and P60 occurs primarily in the fibroblast populations known to be involved in the synthesis of the fibrillar ECM but also to a lesser extent in the CM populations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>), consistent with the skeletal system and heart development pathways. By contrast, although all cardiac cells seem to be involved in the transcriptional maturation, the P20-P60 upregulated transcriptome largely referred to the ventricular CM populations compared to the downregulated one (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>), in agreement with the evidence of a prominent muscle cell differentiation pathway depicted through the GO analysis. The existence of an important transcriptional maturation step of the CM during the P20-P60 postnatal window is further reinforced by the modulation of key CM-specific protein-encoding genes, especially several proteins from the contractile apparatus or regulating the contractile machinery at the lateral membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A</xref>). Another CM maturation also occurs at the metabolic level while the metabolic switch of the heart from glycolysis to fatty acid (FA) oxidation was already established during the early postnatal period (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lopaschuk and Jaswal, 2010</xref>), with the remarkable upregulation of the <italic>BDH1</italic> gene that encodes the β-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase, the limiting mitochondrial enzyme for ketone body (KB) uptake during fatty acid catabolism, but also to a lesser extent the upregulation of key actors in the glycolytic metabolism (<italic>PFKFB2, SLC2A4</italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2B</xref>).

Interestingly, we have previously hypothesized that the CM surface crests, a hallmark of the adult stage in mammals, might play a specific role in the control of the diastole but not the systole, based on a hypothetic model in which crest height and lateral crest–crest interaction limit the sarcomere maximal extension during relaxation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Guilbeau-Frugier et al., 2019</xref>). Altogether, these observations raise questions about a specific contribution of the crest maturation, including the setting of crest–crest interactions with intermittent tight junctions, in the lateral stretch of the CM that could fine-tune the adult diastole. Hence, we next asked whether the maturation of the CM surface crests occurring after P20 could directly control the CM lateral hypertrophy and the diastolic function of the heart.</p><p>For that purpose, we examined the role of ephrin-B1, a transmembrane protein that we previously identified as a new protein of the lateral membrane of the adult CM independent from the integrin or the dystroglycan systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Genet et al., 2012</xref>). More interestingly for the P20-P60 maturation, we demonstrated that ephrin-B1 stabilizes the adult rod-shape of the CM through specific regulation of its lateral membrane overall structure through an hypothetic mechanical stretching, the mechanism of which was unsolved. However, we showed that ephrin-B1 directly interacts with claudin-5, another atypical protein at the lateral membrane of the adult CM, and controls its expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Genet et al., 2012</xref>). Interestingly, we showed that young adult mice harboring a CM-specific deletion of <italic>Efnb1</italic> did not demonstrate contractile defects, but the diastolic function was not studied. By contrast, these animals demonstrated a high susceptibility to cardiac stresses. Also, given the importance of claudin-5 in the setting of the crest–crest lateral interactions within the adult cardiac tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Guilbeau-Frugier et al., 2019</xref>) and its regulation by ephrin-B1, we next explore the potential role of ephrin-B1 as a specific determinant of CM surface crests and the diastole.</p><p>We first studied ephrin-B1 expression/localization in the cardiac tissue from rat hearts during the early postnatal development. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref> and similarly to what we observed for claudin-5, ephrin-B1 reaches maximal expression very early during the postnatal period (P5). However, the complete trafficking of ephrin-B1 from the cytosol to the CM surface is only achieved at P60. To further explore the role of ephrin-B1 during the late postnatal developmental stage, we took advantage of a knock-out mouse model harboring a CM-specific deletion of <italic>Efnb1</italic> (KO) that we previously described but only at the young adult stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Genet et al., 2012</xref>). Indeed, while 2-month-old young adult CM-specific <italic>Efnb1</italic> KO mice were highly sensitive to cardiac stresses, we did not find any major cardiac dysfunction at resting state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Genet et al., 2012</xref>). It is worth noting that ephrin-B1 does not contribute to major cardiac developmental processes before P20 since P20 CM-specific <italic>Efnb1</italic> KO mice and WT mice demonstrate almost similar left ventricular transcriptome as highlighted by the volcano plot (only six genes different between the two genotypes) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). At the cellular level, the lack of ephrin-B1 in the CM partially impairs the P20-P60 physiological hypertrophy of the CM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>), without modification of the myofibril number (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). Consistent with ephrin-B1-specific expression at the lateral membrane, <italic>Efnb1</italic> deletion more specifically impedes the lateral stretch (short axis) of the CM but not the longitudinal one (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>) and accordingly leads to a decrease in both the sarcomere heights (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>) and the tissue compaction (increased lateral interspace) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>). Of note, <italic>Efnb1</italic> deletion only partially prevents CM hypertrophy (partial CM short-axis elongation), most likely due to the other molecular events taking place at the lateral membrane during the P20-P60 stage, i.e., the interactions with the ECM (integrin, dystroglycan complex) that we previously showed to be independent of ephrin-B1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Genet et al., 2012</xref>). At the lateral membrane level, P20 CM-specific <italic>Efnb1</italic> KO and WT mice harbor similar unstructured surface crests with immature SSM but only WT mice underwent crest maturation at P60 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>), thus demonstrating a key role for ephrin-B1 in the postnatal maturation of the surface crest/SSM.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title><italic>Efnb1</italic>-specific knockdown in the cardiomyocyte (CM) impairs the late maturation of CM surface crests.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) (Left panel) Western blot quantification of ephrin-B1 protein expression in heart tissue from P0 to P60 rats (upper) and representative immunoblot (lower) (P0 n = 6, P3 n = 7; P5 n = 7, P10 n = 8, P20 n = 8, P60 n = 8 rats); (right panel) immunofluorescent localization of ephrin-B1 (white arrows) in heart cryosection from P10, P20, and P60 old rats.

As previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Genet et al., 2012</xref>), we did not notice differences in heart rate and LVEF between 2-month-old WT and CM-specific <italic>Efnb1</italic> KO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). This result is more likely consistent with a preserved function of the IFM subpopulation in the CM-specific <italic>Efnb1</italic> KO mice, spatially more specifically dedicated to the myofibril contractility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hollander et al., 2014</xref>). However, and consistent with the role of ephrin-B1 in the lateral stretch-based hypertrophy of the CM, CM-specific <italic>Efnb1</italic> KO mice display a significant decrease in LVPWd conversely to an increase in left ventricular internal diameter (left ventricular internal diameter end diastole [LVIDd]) and volume (LV end-diastolic volume [LVEDV]) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>), in agreement with our previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Genet et al., 2012</xref>). More interestingly, compared with WT mice, CM-specific <italic>Efnb1</italic> KO mice display significantly elongated IVRT, increased left atrial volume (left atrial to aortic root ratio [LA/Ao]), and decreased E/A as well as heterogeneous E/E’ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>), all indicative of impaired LV relaxation. Despite preservation of the LVEF, we also measured a significant decrease in ventricular global longitudinal strain (LV-GLS) in KO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>) reflecting abnormal longitudinal systolic function. Diastolic dysfunction in KO mice was further confirmed by cardiac catheterization since 2-month-old CM-specific <italic>Efnb1</italic> KO mice exhibit increased EDP and heterogeneous dP/dt but with similar relaxation time constants (tau) compared with age-matched WT mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). The diastolic defects of CM-specific <italic>Efnb1</italic> KO mice rely on a specific impairment of the CM relaxation since both the diastolic basal sarcomere length (SL) shortening and relaxation velocities are significantly reduced in isolated intact CMs from CM-specific <italic>Efnb1</italic> KO compared to WT mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). Furthermore, consistent with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) phenotype in which CM contraction defects coexist with the relaxation impairment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Methawasin et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Primessnig et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Schiattarella et al., 2019</xref>), the auxotonic contraction indexed by the SL shortening as well as the SL shortening velocities are also significantly decreased in CMs from CM-specific <italic>Efnb1</italic> KO compared to WT CMs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). Finally, CM-specific <italic>Efnb1</italic> KO mice also display significant exercise intolerance compared with WT mice, as indicated by the significant decrease in maximum oxygen uptake (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). Together, these results indicate that young adult male CM-specific <italic>Efnb1</italic> KO mice recapitulate some features of clinical HFpEF, thus demonstrating a pivotal role for ephrin-B1 in the control of the diastolic function. In line with this assumption, a recent RNAseq study performed on ventricles from HFpEF, heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), and control patients reported a specific and more significant downregulation of the <italic>Efnb1</italic> gene in HFpEF than HFrEF patients (p=9.10<sup>–14</sup> HFpEF vs. control, p=2.10<sup>–5</sup> HFrEF vs. control, p=0.005 HFpEF versus HFrEF) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hahn et al., 2021</xref>).</p><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Constitutive <italic>Efnb1</italic>-specific knockdown in the cardiomyocyte (CM) impairs diastolic function.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Echocardiography performed on P60 <italic>Efnb1<sup>CM-/-</sup></italic>KO or WT mice with 2D, TM, Doppler flow, and tissular Doppler analysis to measure morphometry, systolic and diastolic function.

We demonstrate that this mechanism regulates the adult diastolic function. Hence, these results shed light on the molecular mechanism by which ephrin-B1 regulates the CM lateral membrane that we described before (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Genet et al., 2012</xref>). Taken together, our findings identify crest subdomains of the adult CM lateral surface as novel specific determinants of cardiac diastole.</p><fig id="fig9" position="float"><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><title>Schematic illustration of cardiomyocyte (CM) surface crest maturation between P20 and P60 supporting the setting of the adult diastolic function.</title><p>At postnatal day 20 (P20), cardiomyocytes express low levels of ephrin-B1 and its claudin-5 partner at the lateral surface and surface crests/subsarcolemmal mitochondria (SSM) are still immature. CMs do not interact with neighboring CMs at their lateral surfaces. After P20, CMs undergo substantial hypertrophy relying on elongation of both their long and short axes. From the short-axis standpoint, the hypertrophy is independent from myofibril addition but relies on the maturation of the CM surface architecture. Hence, at P60, the increase in ephrin-B1/claudin-5 expression at the lateral membrane promotes crest–SSM swelling but also crest–crest interactions between neighboring CMs most likely leading to a lateral stretch of the CM. This ephrin-B1-dependent lateral maturation of the CM surface allows maturation of the diastolic function.</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-80904-fig9-v1.tif"/></fig><p>Postnatal maturation of the heart in mammals has been paid much less attention than embryonic and fetal development. This would be a prerequisite for future pediatric clinical trials, which are seriously lacking. It also contributes to a significant knowledge gap that impedes research progression in regenerative medicine since this postnatal maturation coincides with the proliferation blockage of the CM. To date, at the cellular level, postnatal cardiac maturation has been essentially described until P20 in rodents, most likely related to the implementation of the typical adult rod shape of the CM. Very few studies have examined the specific P20-adult stage window, assuming that the genetic maturation of the heart is completed by P20 and that the heart merely undergoes a substantial growth beyond P20 until the young adult stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Piquereau et al., 2010</xref>). A recent study analyzed early gene expression of rodent hearts and of CMs during different postnatal days, including P21 and P56 (young adult), and while the authors clearly identified different transcriptomic signatures between these two periods, they focused their study on the P1-P7 transition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Li et al., 2022</xref>). However, this P20-Adult period coincides with the weaning time in rodents (~P21) and thus with a critical nutritional/metabolic switch in the organism likely to influence heart function. So far, research has focused on the P0 (birth) to P20 postnatal window, during which the heart switches from a hyperplasic growth (CM proliferation) (~P3-P5) to an hypertrophic growth (increase in CM size) (P20-21) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bishop et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Leu et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Li et al., 1996</xref>). Recent omics studies have detailed the molecular changes associated with the postnatal development of the mouse heart but only until P20 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">DeLaughter et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Talman et al., 2018</xref>). Thus, the P0-P20 postnatal development period essentially relies on the ECM remodeling of the cardiac tissue and, at the CM level, myofibril and Ca<sup>2+</sup> handling maturation, metabolic switch from glycolysis to major fatty acid oxidation and the transition from CM proliferation to CM hypertrophy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Guo and Pu, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Karbassi et al., 2020</xref>). This metabolic change most likely occurs as an adaptation of the postnatal heart to cardiac tissue oxygenation and the newborn diet, which essentially consists of mother’s milk and thus on high fatty acid availability. Our transcriptome analysis of mouse hearts reveals an additional developmental genetic program between P20 and P60 originating from all the cardiac cells of the left ventricle, thus indicating that the heart and the CM had not completed maturation by P20. Of interest, while the primary metabolic reliance of the heart on fatty acids and then glucose is already programmed between birth and P20, we found that the P20-P60 late postnatal stage programs the metabolic diversification of the heart. Such a new final metabolic adaptation of the heart coincides with the weaning process occurring around P20 in rodents, during which the newborn switches from milk to solid food (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Sengupta, 2013</xref>). This step is also in line with the capacity of the heart to metabolize a large panel of substrates to meet the energy demands of the adult stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Murashige et al., 2020</xref>). Remarkably, we found that the <italic>Bdh1</italic> gene was increased by more than 37-fold between P20 and P60, most likely indicating that the capacity of the heart to oxidize KB (<italic>coming essentially from the liver</italic>) as a fuel is not only restricted to the adaptation of the failing heart, as previously shown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Horton et al., 2019</xref>), but is also necessary for the adult physiological state. These results also agree with recent findings demonstrating that the human adult heart can use a large panel of substrates as a fuel, including a large proportion of KB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Murashige et al., 2020</xref>). Horton et al. did not report a major cardiac phenotype under basal conditions in CM-specific <italic>Bdh1</italic> KO mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Horton et al., 2019</xref>). However, more in-depth cardiac phenotyping of these mice would undoubtedly be necessary to depict the role of KB in the adult cardiac physiology, such as diastolic function.</p><p>An intriguing finding from our study is the physiological cardiac hypertrophy of the heart between P20 and P60, which, from a CM lateral standpoint, does not rely on a classical myofibril addition in the CM but, at least in part, on an ephrin-B1-dependent- (1) crest maturation through SSM swelling at the CM surface and (2) lateral stretching of the CM. During postnatal development, heart growth occurs primarily through CM proliferation (hyperplasia) but transitions rapidly after birth (~P5-7) to CM growth (hypertrophy) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Leu et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Li et al., 1996</xref>) through new myofibril biogenesis. Although physiological CM hypertrophy has been described beyond P20 and is related to increased cardiac mass (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Piquereau et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Anversa et al., 1986</xref>), the underlying molecular mechanisms have never been explored. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Piquereau et al., 2010</xref> already reported and questioned such atypical hypertrophy of the rat heart after P21 without fiber addition, which was not classically related to the increase in heart weight to body weight index but conversely to a marked decrease. Here, we show that the P20-P60 hypertrophy relies on both an enlargement of the short and long axes of the CM. Interestingly, we demonstrated that the short-axis elongation is dependent on the architectural maturation of the CM surface trough an ephrin-B1 mechanism. Thus, the ephrin-B1 lateral membrane protein, a partner and regulator of claudin-5<sup>9</sup>, participates in P20-P60 lateral CM hypertrophy, likely by bringing claudin-5 into the vicinity of neighboring CM, allowing intermittent but direct lateral crest–crest interactions (claudin-5/claudin-5 interactions), crest/SSM maturation, and the ensuing stretching of the CM lateral membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). In agreement with this model, we previously showed that CMs from <italic>Efnb1<sup>CM-/-</sup></italic> KO mice exhibit substantially decreased levels of claudin-5 expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Genet et al., 2012</xref>), likely accounting for the lack of crest maturation and lateral crest–crest interactions in these adult KO mice. However, other mechanisms also likely contribute to the short-axis elongation since it was only partially prevented by ephrin-B1 deletion. More specifically, lateral membrane interactions with the ECM, i.e., through integrin or the dystroglycan complex, which we previously showed to be independent of ephrin-B1<sup>9</sup>, could also play a role. In line with this assumption, our transcriptomic analysis identified the regulation of genes from the ECM remodeling pathway during the P20-P60 maturation period and the dystrobrevin-encoding gene (DTNA, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref>) from the dystroglycan complex. Apart from the short axis, P20-P60 CM hypertrophy also depends on the elongation of the CM long axis, which we show here to be independent from ephrin-B1 and which probably depends on the assembly of new sarcomeres at the myofibril extremities, thus contributing to the classical heart hypertrophy.</p><p>A new finding of our study is the specific maturation of SSM during the late P20-P60 postnatal period of the CM. Coinciding with this late cardiac mitochondria maturation in the CM, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Piquereau et al., 2010</xref>) previously reported a substantial increase in maximum respiratory capacity occurring after P21 and the adult stage in cardiac tissues from rats while the postnatal maturation of IFM occurred earlier. Biogenesis/maturation of cardiac mitochondria occur early during the embryogenesis, concurrently with the energy demand of the heart during the development period (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lopaschuk and Jaswal, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Zhao et al., 2019</xref>.) Thus, they can adapt their morphology and function according to the energy need and metabolic conditions of the cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Packer, 1963</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Schönfeld et al., 2000</xref>). In this field, most of the works on the postnatal period have focused on the characterization of the IFM (the most abundant in the adult CM) or the global cardiac mitochondria activity dedicated to the energy supply to the CMs for the contractile machinery, without distinguishing the different mitochondria subpopulations of the adult CM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hollander et al., 2014</xref>). IFM maturation during the P0-P7 stage occurs both through swelling and through architectural reorganization along the myofibrils (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Piquereau et al., 2010</xref>), concomitantly with the well-known metabolic shift of the heart from glycolysis to a central oxidative metabolism more efficient for adult CM contraction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lopaschuk and Jaswal, 2010</xref>). It follows that IFM function is primarily dedicated to supplying the CM with the energy necessary for adult contraction. The delayed maturation of SSM at the CM surface compared to intracellular IFM supports the concept that these mitochondria regulate different CM functions. In agreement with this notion, we demonstrated in this study that crests/SSM specifically regulate heart diastole. Several results support this conclusion: (1) young adult CM-specific <italic>Efnb1</italic> KO mice with immature SSM display diastolic defects with no impairment of systolic function, and (2) systolic function is already mature by P20 in rat hearts while the diastolic function is highly variable. Moreover, supporting our results about the late maturation of diastole, Zhou et al. previously reported that the diastolic function in the left ventricle of mice matures around the weaning period (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Zhou et al., 2003</xref>). In the future, it would be interesting to investigate whether cardiac SSM defects are a specific feature of diastolic dysfunction pathologies, such as HFpEF frequently associated with a metabolic syndrome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Valero-Muñoz et al., 2017</xref>). In support of this concept, a recent study of myocardial gene expression signatures in human HFpEF reported that the ephrin-B1-encoding gene, which we demonstrated here as a specific determinant of the CM crests/SSM, is specifically downregulated in HFpEF heart patients compared with HFrEF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hahn et al., 2021</xref>). Unfortunately, while several works have reported the influence of different cardiac pathologies on specific subpopulations of cardiac mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hollander et al., 2014</xref>), these results require some caution, given the technical difficulty of specifically purifying and distinguishing the populations in the absence of reliable markers and due to the fact that these mitochondria are morphologically highly similar (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Guilbeau-Frugier et al., 2019</xref>). Today, electron microscopy still remains the gold standard for accurately examining the cardiac mitochondria subpopulations.</p><p>An essential and new finding of our study is the identification of the ephrin-B1/crest/SSM module at the lateral membrane of the CM as a specific determinant of the physiological diastolic function of the adult heart. So far, the diastolic determinants have been proposed only in the context of diastolic dysfunction in cardiac pathologies such as HFpEF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lewis et al., 2017</xref>). However, until rather recently, the lack of specific and compelling therapeutics in HFpEF underlines our limited knowledge of the control of diastole. This is overcomplicated in the context of HFpEF due to the contributions of several comorbidities delineating highly heterogeneous clinical features (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lewis et al., 2017</xref>). Here, our study demonstrates that <italic>Efnb1</italic> deletion specifically in the CM recapitulates at the young adult stage (2 months) some features of the diastolic dysfunction depicted in HFpEF, i.e., an elevated EDP and altered filling patterns combined with exercise intolerance. One important concern is understanding how ephrin-B1 at the lateral membrane of the adult CM can impact diastolic function. We previously demonstrated that ephrin-B1 controls the architecture of the lateral membrane and the overall adult rod shape of the CM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Genet et al., 2012</xref>). Here, we now further demonstrated that ephrin-B1 controls the maturity of the crest/SSM architectural motif at the lateral membrane, thus playing a key role in the adult crest–crest interactions between neighboring CMs and in overall tissue cohesion. These lateral CM interactions likely dictate a mechanical lateral stretch of the CM, allowing perfect stacking between myofibril layers. Consequently, crest–crest interactions might contribute to controlling the relaxation length of the sarcomere, a mechanism that we previously suggested to be dependent on crest height (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Guilbeau-Frugier et al., 2019</xref>). This ephrin-B1-dependent lateral stretch of the CM is also necessary for the spatial arrangement of the T-tubules and most likely its ensuing function during the P20-P60 development, as supported by the T-tubule disorganization in the CM-specific <italic>Efnb1</italic> KO mice. Thus, by altering the T-tubule structure, lack of ephrin-B1 could influence the Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry/Ca<sup>2+</sup> exit. It is worth noting that T-tubule disorganization in the CMs of <italic>Efnb1<sup>CM-/-</sup></italic> KO mice is progressive with mild disorganization correlating with diastolic dysfunction only, while extensive disorganization is observed in HFrEF. Although defects in T-tubule architecture/function are a hallmark of HFrEF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Guo et al., 2013</xref>), it has been poorly examined in HFpEF, only one recent study reported that this mechanism is etiology-dependent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Frisk et al., 2021</xref>). An exciting feature of the CM-specific <italic>Efnb1</italic> KO mice is the progressive cardiac phenotype starting from a primarily diastolic defect that progressively switches toward a mild and then severe HFrEF and finally to death, thus highlighting the substantial cardioprotective role of the surface crests/SSM of the lateral membrane. Although this switch toward HFrEF is not a common feature of HFpEF patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lupón et al., 2019</xref>), definitive conclusions cannot be reached on the natural evolution of HFpEF, given that HFpEF patients received medication for their different comorbidities, which could protect them from HFrEF. In the future, an accurate characterization of the CM surface crests/SSM in different HFpEF models with diastolic dysfunction will undoubtedly shed light on whether crest disruption might be a hallmark of HFpEF and could thus contribute to the setting of the pathology.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animal models and euthanasia</title><p>CM-specific <italic>efnb1</italic> knock-out mice (<italic>Efnb1<sup>CM-/-</sup></italic>KO) have already been described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Genet et al., 2012</xref>).

Thus, immediately after removal, the heart was washed in cold PBS for several seconds, then cautiously sliced (~1 mm<sup>3</sup> biopsies) on a glass slide lying on an ice bed and fixed in 2% glutaraldehyde in Sorensen’s buffer at 4°C and processed for TEM as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Dague et al., 2014</xref>). Each tissue pieces was embedded in a different resin block. We first controlled for correct tissue orientation, i.e., with longitudinal fibers necessary to visualize the CM surface crests, through observation of semi-thin section stained with Toluidine blue with light microscopy. Then, two grids/resin block were proceeded. Next, we first evaluated the quality of the myocardium for each grid. TEM observation begins by checking for the absence of fixation artifacts based on mitochondria ultrastructure. When the fixation is not correct, the mitochondrial matrix appears clear and the cristae are disrupted and spaced out. In extreme cases, mitochondria are swollen and small clear spots can be seen into the mitochondria or into the cytoplasm of CMs. These spots are larger than the lipid droplets and are randomly located within the cell. The observation of such fixation artifacts precludes the grid analysis. Moreover, sometimes CMs harbor contraction bands, reflecting a problem with cell relaxation at the time of animal sacrifice. Again, whether too many contraction bands are observed within a CM, it is not analyzed and we switch to the observation of another resin block. Generally, we analyzed ~10 CMs/grid if a specimen does not have 10 suitable CMs, another grid from another resin block is analyzed.</p><p>The observation goes on with an analysis of the orientation of CMs at low magnification (300×). A CM is correctly oriented for lateral crest observation if it is possible to see the staircase arrangement of the intercalated discs at the CM extremities and if the contractile apparatus of two adjacent longitudinal CMs is continuous. In the CM, sarcomeres should be aligned. It is preferable that the image section goes through the axis of the CM nucleus to reinforce the correct longitudinal orientation of the CM. The nucleus should be elongated with an indented electron-dense border. The IFM shape should appear elongated and mitochondria oriented along the contractile apparatus.</p><p>For quantifications, pictures are always taken at identical magnification. A CM is first photographed at low magnification (×300 or ×500, depending on the CM length) to attest to the quality and the orientation of the selected area. When crests can be visualized at the CM surface, then a crest is analyzed/quantified only if it is anchored on both sides of the Z-line. The crests must have a periodically repeated pattern. For each CM, several successive crests are photographed (each crest is photographed at ×7000 magnification) and subsequently quantified. Crest heights were quantified as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Guilbeau-Frugier et al., 2019</xref>) relative to the sarcomere length to compensate for indifferent diastolic or systolic state of the cardiac tissue and taking into account that we have previously shown that crest height correlates with sarcomere length (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Guilbeau-Frugier et al., 2019</xref>). The crest heights were measured manually from the top of the crest to the first myofibril top layer using Fiji software and the SSM number was quantified for each crest. The sarcomere lengths were measured similarly on the first myofibril layer below the CM surface crests. To analyze the interlateral space between two CMs, orientation of CMs in the longitudinal axis is mandatory. The selected area for quantification of the lateral space must not go through the crest architecture, so that the interlateral space appears regular and almost straight (in control conditions). The interlateral space is then photographed at high magnification (×5000) and five independent measurements were conducted. Myofibril numbers were quantified on the longitudinal axis of the CM at the level of their anchorage on an entire intercalated disk from top to bottom of the cell, thus allowing better individual counting of the myofibrils.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Echocardiography, speckle tracking echocardiography/strain analysis, and Doppler imaging</title><p>All echocardiographies were performed under isoflurane anesthesia (1.5–2%).

Your article has been reviewed by 5 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and a Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Stephane Hatem (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Please address the comments raised by the reviewers, particularly reviewers #2, #3, and 4#.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1. Authors should clearly state the genotypes of the mice used, and whether controls are littermates or not. The word littermate does not appear in the paper, so I am guessing they are not, in which case the mouse experiments must be repeated with appropriate controls.</p><p>2. The authors appear to conflate a developmental phenotype that ephrin-b1 appears to be involved with vs HFpEF, which is typically an acquired human disease. An inducible, conditional-knockout (Mer-Cre-Mer) for example would be the appropriate model to determine that ephrin-b1 is linked to HFpEF. Frankly, their prior manuscript in Cardiovascular Res could have linked this pathway to more of a HFpEF phentype using their pressure overload/TAC model. Specifically, the authors didn't observe a major decline in ejection fraction in those animals and it seems like the diastolic parameters simply were not examined. If the echo data are available, a re-examination of those data could provide more evidence of diastolic dysfunction. In any case, the ephrin-b1 mice examined in this paper go on to develop significant systolic dysfunction and mortality, which is unlikely to be due to the mild diastolic abnormalities presented in the manuscript.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1. Concerning the maturation of crest at P20 and P60 which might be related, at least partly, to changes in myocardial working conditions, I wonder if this ultrastructural organization changes between cardiac areas such as septum, apex, out-put track, left and right ventricle?</p><p>2. Is the maturation of the diastolic function between P20 and P60 associated with changes in the expression in gene encoding for proteins of the EC coupling notably SERCA and phsopholamban (volcano plot)?</p><p>3. Could you comment, igure 3 B, is the increase in blood pressure caused by an increased cardiac output while peripheral resistance are unchanged?</p><p>4. A major finding of the study is that the protein ephrin-B1 plays a key role in adult crest-crest interactions between CM and that appears to be a major determinant of the normal diastolic cardiac function. Therefore, it is tempting to conclude that this process contributes to HFpEF. However, in my opinion this conclusion could be strengthened by providing evidence, if available, for alteration of crest-crest interaction and/or ephrin B1 expression in well-established model of HFpEF.</p><p>5. Figure 7 E, cross section of heart barely illustrated the accumulation of fibrosis and seems to indicate some atrophy of ventricle compared to Wt in contraction with the rest of the study.</p><p>6. Given the presence in this crest region of subpopulations of ionic channels notably sodium ones (Eichel et al. Circ Res 2016), I wonder if there any modification of the ECG of KO mice?</p><p>7. The section of the discussion on empaglifozine (page 17) is not supported by results and appears as out of the scope of the study.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #4 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>As the main proof of the existence of p60 stage comes from the morphometric analysis of TEM images I recommend making an effort of explaining in minute details how the analysis has been done. How the randomization of images and fields of view has been achieved? How many cells were analysed, how many blocks containing tissues from different animals? How many random fields of view? What statistical methods were used to validate differences?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #5 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Cardiac maturation, which occurs in the neonatal stage, is the last phase of heart development that prepare the heart for stronger and more efficient pumping through postnatal life. This cardiac maturation process is characterized by many molecular, structural, and functional changes as the heart transitions from a fetal to an adult phenotype. In this study, Karsenty et al., characterized a late postnatal cardiac maturation event- the formation of a lateral membrane surface architecture with periodic crests – that occurs around p20-p60, a time window that the authors claim to be that for maturation of the diastolic function. Further study suggests that CM specific Efnb1 knockdown impairs the late maturation of surface crests and the diastolic function.</p><p>Specific comments:</p><p>1. The images in Figure 1A and supplementary Figure 1 don't show any obvious sarcomeres and mitochondria. Although cardiac maturation features myofibril expansion during neonatal stages, sarcomere formation is initiated during fetal developmental stages and should be visible at P1 (see examples in Gong et al., PMID: 26785495).</p><p>2. the transcriptomic study and GO analysis don't provide any direct evidence supporting p20-p60 stage dedicated to the development of the surface crests and diastolic function. The upregulated GO terms are mostly associated with the process of immune defense, angiogenesis, positive regulation of cell death, which are irrelevant to surface crests and diastolic function. Even the GO term muscle cell differentiation is too general to provide any specific information. Diastolic stiffness of the LV is in large part dependent on the N2BA:N2B isoform ratio. How does the N2BA:N2B ratio change during postnatal cardiac maturation, and does the change correlate with the maturation of diastolic function?</p><p>3. The authors claim in the manuscript that &quot;this maturation step of the crests is ephrin-B1-dependent and specifically regulates the diastolic function of the adult heart&quot;. Yet, although crest maturation of maturation of diastolic function coincides temporally, there is direct evidence that maturation step of the crests regulates cardiac diastolic function.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.80904.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>1.

Thus, these data clearly demonstrate that Ephrine-B1 is a specific determinant of the crest architecture at the CM surface and of the diastolic function at the adult stage.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>1. Concerning the maturation of crest at P20 and P60 which might be related, at least partly, to changes in myocardial working conditions, I wonder if this ultrastructural organization changes between cardiac areas such as septum, apex, out-put track, left and right ventricle?</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer is completely right. Last year, we have started exploring the maturation of the different heart compartments between P20 and P60 (left/right atria, left/right ventricles, infundibulum, septum, apex, cardiac area close to the valves). This work is still under process and will be the topic of a new article, but the first results indicated major differences in unexpected compartments like the apex.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. Is the maturation of the diastolic function between P20 and P60 associated with changes in the expression in gene encoding for proteins of the EC coupling notably SERCA and phsopholamban (volcano plot)?</p></disp-quote><p>We didn’t notice any modifications of genes of the EC coupling in our transcriptomic data between P20 and P60. Which doesn’t mean that the related proteins are well localized within the CM, as it is for claudin-5 or Ephrin-B1, but we didn’t explore it. We have just explored the maturation of the T-Tubules in this paper.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. Could you comment, igure 3 B, is the increase in blood pressure caused by an increased cardiac output while peripheral resistance are unchanged?</p></disp-quote><p>We think that it is due to both. Cardiac afterload is increasing since arterial pressure increased between P20 and P60 probably due to an increase in peripheral resistance (known in human but not proven in murine model). Cardiac output is also increasing during physiological development (<italic>doi: 10.1152/ajpheart.2000.278.2.H652</italic>.) but finally cardiac index remains stable. To go further, we don’t know if inotropy is increasing, but cardiac PV loop experiments could help answering this question, although technically challenging in murine models.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. A major finding of the study is that the protein ephrin-B1 plays a key role in adult crest-crest interactions between CM and that appears to be a major determinant of the normal diastolic cardiac function. Therefore, it is tempting to conclude that this process contributes to HFpEF. However, in my opinion this conclusion could be strengthened by providing evidence, if available, for alteration of crest-crest interaction and/or ephrin B1 expression in well-established model of HFpEF.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer is completely right.

This will be the take-home message of a next story focusing of the pathophysiology of HFpEF (currently under process). We do think that this manuscript already includes a lot of data (late postnatal maturation of the heart and the role of the crest maturation in the diastolic function) and are afraid that introducing the pathophysiological aspect will further increase the complexity and dilute the take-home message.</p><p>However, in the current version of our manuscript, we cannot completely exclude that the phenotype of the constitutive Efnb1 CM-KO mice we described at the adult stage is directly related to specific alteration of CM surface crest/diastolic function at the adult stage or more likely related to other earlier developmental defects (secondary mechanisms). Also, to discriminate between these two possibilities, we have now used a tamoxifen-inducible conditional-knockout (Mer-Cre-Mer) of <italic>Efnb1</italic> in the CM (aMHC promotor).

Thus, these data clearly demonstrate that ephrin-B1 is a specific determinant of the crest architecture at the CM surface and of the diastolic function at the adult stage. These new results showing the direct link between Crests/ephrin-b1 maturity and the diastolic function clearly support the following step, i.e. to explore in the future the crest phenotype in the pathophysiology of HFpEF.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5.

Given the presence in this crest region of subpopulations of ionic channels notably sodium ones (Eichel et al.

We have currently a rhythmology paper under process that has fully explored the ECG in adult <italic>Efnb1</italic> KO and WT mice (basal and triggered arrhythmia). This study indicates that only the PR interval was significantly decreased in 2-month old KO versus WT mice (KO=35,9 ±3,3 vs WT=39,3± 3,3; n=48 mice/group). This shorter PR interval reminisces the physiological PR interval of children (shorter PR interval than adults) and thus completely agree with our current paper showing that the adult <italic>Efnb1</italic>-CM spe KO mice harbor some pediatric features due to late developmental defects, i.e. the lack of P20-P60 maturation of the lateral membrane.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7.

However, to better clarify the “P20 n=6, P60 n=6”, we have now specified “P20 or P60 n=6 rats”. This have been now specified in the figure legends for all statistical analysis (highlighted in yellow in the revised manuscript).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #5 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>Cardiac maturation, which occurs in the neonatal stage, is the last phase of heart development that prepare the heart for stronger and more efficient pumping through postnatal life. This cardiac maturation process is characterized by many molecular, structural, and functional changes as the heart transitions from a fetal to an adult phenotype. In this study, Karsenty et al., characterized a late postnatal cardiac maturation event- the formation of a lateral membrane surface architecture with periodic crests – that occurs around p20-p60, a time window that the authors claim to be that for maturation of the diastolic function. Further study suggests that CM specific Efnb1 knockdown impairs the late maturation of surface crests and the diastolic function.</p><p>Specific comments:</p><p>1. The images in Figure 1A and supplementary Figure 1 don't show any obvious sarcomeres and mitochondria. Although cardiac maturation features myofibril expansion during neonatal stages, sarcomere formation is initiated during fetal developmental stages and should be visible at P1 (see examples in Gong et al., PMID: 26785495).</p></disp-quote><p>Both Figure 1A and Figure 1—figure supplement 1 show both sarcomere (especially the Z lines since sarcomere are not at all completely established) and mitochondria. However, because the initial images were a bit too dark, we have changed the contrast/luminosity for better appreciation of the cellular details.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. The transcriptomic study and GO analysis don't provide any direct evidence supporting p20-p60 stage dedicated to the development of the surface crests and diastolic function. The upregulated GO terms are mostly associated with the process of immune defense, angiogenesis, positive regulation of cell death, which are irrelevant to surface crests and diastolic function. Even the GO term muscle cell differentiation is too general to provide any specific information. Diastolic stiffness of the LV is in large part dependent on the N2BA:N2B isoform ratio. How does the N2BA:N2B ratio change during postnatal cardiac maturation, and does the change correlate with the maturation of diastolic function?</p></disp-quote><p>We totally agree with the reviewer regarding transcriptomic study and GO analysis don't provide any direct evidence supporting p20-p60 stage dedicated to the development of the surface crests and diastolic function. This experimental part was not at all on this purpose but to provide evidence for a global transcriptomic change of the whole heart between P20 and P60 since most of the papers in the postnatal field assume that the postnatal developmental stage of the heart is completed at P20 due to the presence of the mature rod-shape of the CM. These results thus indicate that a new development stage occurs between P20 and P60.</p><p>Now, we don’t agree with the reviewer with its statement that surface crest or diastolic function cannot be related to GO pathways like immune defense, angiogenesis, positive regulation of cell death. Nobody knows at the moment the molecular determinants involved on the control of the diastole. In diastolic defects associated with HFpEF this is even more complex given the pluridimensional origin of this pathology. Defects in the microcirculation have been described in HFpEF which could be related to the angiogenesis pathways for instance. We can just say that it is impossible from the GO analysis to extract an intuitive pathway associated with the crest/diastole but again this was not the objective of this analysis. In this context of multiple specific defects reported in diastolic dysfunction models, we thus do think that examining the N2BA:N2B isoform ratio will not bring a better link between crest and the diastolic function.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. The authors claim in the manuscript that &quot;this maturation step of the crests is ephrin-B1-dependent and specifically regulates the diastolic function of the adult heart&quot;. Yet, although crest maturation of maturation of diastolic function coincides temporally, there is direct evidence that maturation step of the crests regulates cardiac diastolic function.</p></disp-quote><p>In our manuscript, we started with comparison of the cardiac tissue between P20 an P60 and showing several concomitant events including ephrin-B1/Claudin-5 trafficking at the CM lateral surface, CM crest maturation and maturation of the diastolic function. Thus, at this experimental stage, these events are just correlated and obviously not a criterion of any relationship between these two events.</p><p>To better gain insight into a role for the CM surface crests in the maturity of the diastolic function, we have next deleted another potential molecular determinant of the crests (claudin-5 partner), <italic>i.e</italic>, Ephrin-B1, through the use of the embryonic <italic>Efnb1-</italic>CM specific-KO model. We showed that lack of ephrin-B1 in the CM led to a lack in crest maturation and diastolic defect, thus indicating that at least ephrin-B1 is specifically involved, directly or indirectly we don’t know, in the maturation process of the crests in the CM.</p><p>Now, we completely agree with the reviewer that we cannot completely exclude that the crest/diastole phenotype of the constitutive <italic>Efnb1</italic>-CM spe KO mice we have described at the adult stage in the initial version of the paper is indeed the consequence of another earlier developmental defect and not specific to the CM crest defects at the adult stage.</p><p>Also, to discriminate between these two possibilities, we have now used in the revision process a tamoxifen-inducible conditional-knockout (Mer-Cre-Mer) of <italic>Efnb1</italic> specifically in the CM (aMHC promotor).
