knocked out adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL, <italic>Pnpla2</italic> gene). BMAd-<italic>Pnpla2</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice have impaired BMAd lipolysis, and increased size and number of BMAds at baseline. Although energy from BMAd lipid stores is largely dispensable when mice are fed ad libitum, BMAd lipolysis is necessary to maintain myelopoiesis and bone mass under caloric restriction. BMAd-specific <italic>Pnpla2</italic> deficiency compounds the effects of caloric restriction on loss of trabecular bone in male mice, likely due to impaired osteoblast expression of collagen genes and reduced osteoid synthesis. RNA sequencing analysis of bone marrow adipose tissue reveals that caloric restriction induces dramatic elevations in extracellular matrix organization and skeletal development genes, and energy from BMAd is required for these adaptations. BMAd-derived energy supply is also required for bone regeneration upon injury, and maintenance of bone mass with cold exposure.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>bone

sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Adipocytes are found throughout the body, and can be classified generally into white, brown, beige/BRITE and bone marrow adipose tissues (BMAT); however, many other niche depots exist, and adipocyte subpopulations within specific depots have recently been identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bagchi et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Emont et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Sárvári et al., 2021</xref>). In an adult human, 50–70% of the bone marrow cavity is filled with BMAT, which contributes ~10% of the total body fat mass (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cawthorn et al., 2014</xref>). BMAT was identified in the 19th century, and has been assumed to play significant roles in local bone homeostasis and hematopoiesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Li et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Li and MacDougald, 2021</xref>). Clinical associations generally demonstrate inverse relationships between BMAT and bone mass (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Shen et al., 2007</xref>), or BMAT and circulating immune cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Polineni et al., 2020</xref>), which may be due to the interactions between cells within the bone marrow niche. In addition to bone marrow adipocytes (BMAds), the bone marrow niche contains osteoblasts, osteoclasts, hematopoietic cells, stromal/mesenchymal cells, blood vessels, and nerves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Vogler and Murphy, 1988</xref>). The relationships between BMAds, bone cells, and hematopoietic cells are influenced by their shared location within bone, an anatomically restricted system, such that expansion of one cell type is by necessity at the expense of others. For example, elevated BMAT is inversely correlated with low bone mass of aging and diabetes, whereas expansion of BMAT is associated with multiple hematopoietic disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Li and MacDougald, 2021</xref>). Mechanistic links underlying these associations have proven challenging to investigate because these often involve complex intercellular, endocrine, and/or central mechanisms.</p><p>In addition to serving as an energy source, BMAds potentially influence the marrow niche through cell-to-cell contact, release of extracellular vesicles, and secretion of adipokines (e.g. adiponectin and leptin) and cytokines (e.g. adipsin, RANK ligand, and stem cell factor; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aaron et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Li et al., 2018</xref>). Removal of these stimuli in mouse models of lipodystrophy, which lack BMAT, results in increased bone mass (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Corsa et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Zou et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Zou et al., 2019</xref>). However, use of these models to investigate direct effects of BMAT depletion is confounded by concurrent loss of white and brown adipose depots, which also regulate bone mass through myriad mechanisms, including secretion of adipokines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Riddle and Clemens, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Zou et al., 2019</xref>). Although loss of BMAT in lipodystrophic mice was integral to the original finding that BMAT is a negative regulator of hematopoiesis, positive effects of BMAT on hematopoiesis have also been observed; these differences are attributed to use of distinct animal models and analysis of different skeletal sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Ambrosi et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Naveiras et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Zhou et al., 2017</xref>). In rodents, there are two readily identifiable BMAd populations: constitutive BMAT (cBMAT) and regulated BMAT (rBMAT) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Scheller et al., 2015</xref>). cBMAT typically exists in distal tibia and caudal vertebrae, appears early in life, and has the histological appearance of white adipose tissue. rBMAT is found in proximal tibia and distal femur, and is comprised of single or clustered BMAds interspersed with hematopoietic cells. Although cBMAT generally resists change in response to altered physiological states, rBMAT expands with aging, obesity, diabetes, caloric restriction (CR), irradiation, and estrogen deficiency, and is reduced by cold exposure, β3-agonist, exercise, and vertical sleeve gastrectomy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Li et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Li et al., 2019</xref>). These treatments also cause alterations to the skeleton and/or formation of blood cells, some of which may be secondary to effects on BMAds.</p><p>In contrast, BMAds have also been thought to fuel maintenance of bone and hematopoietic cellularity because of their shared physical location in the marrow niche. Indeed, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Steele, 1884</xref> wrote that fat in marrow 'nourishes the skeleton'; however, that conjecture has not been formally tested because current methods to target BMAds lack penetrance or cause recombination in other cell types, such as white adipocytes, osteoblasts, or bone marrow stromal cells, complicating the interpretation of interactions between BMAds and cells of the marrow niche. To circumvent this problem, we created a BMAd-specific Cre mouse model based on expression patterns of endogenous <italic>Osterix</italic> and <italic>Adipoq</italic>, and investigated the role of BMAds as a local energy source by deleting ATGL/<italic>Pnpla2</italic>, the rate-limiting enzyme of lipolysis. Consistent with <italic>Pnpla2</italic> deficiency in white and brown adipocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ahmadian et al., 2011</xref>), BMAd-<italic>Pnpla2</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice have impaired BMAd lipolysis, resulting in hypertrophy and hyperplasia of BMAT. Despite significant increases in bone marrow adiposity, hematopoietic abnormalities of BMAd-<italic>Pnpla2</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice are negligible under basal conditions. However, the recovery of bone marrow myeloid lineages following sublethal irradiation is impaired with CR, and is further reduced by BMAd-<italic>Pnpla2</italic> deficiency. Similarly, the proliferative capacity of myeloid progenitors is also decreased with CR, and further inhibited in mice lacking BMAd-<italic>Pnpla2</italic>. Whereas alterations in bone parameters were not observed in ad libitum fed BMAd-<italic>Pnpla2</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice, bone loss occurred under conditions of elevated energy needs such as bone regeneration or cold exposure, or reduced energy availability such as CR. Reduction of bone mass in CR BMAd-<italic>Pnpla2</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice is likely due to impaired osteoblast functions such as expression of extracellular matrix genes and creation of osteoid. Gene profiling reveals that <italic>Pnpla2</italic> deletion largely blocks CR-induced genes within pathways of extracellular matrix organization and skeletal development, indicating that BMAd-derived energy contributes to skeletal homeostasis under conditions of negative energy balance.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Generation of a BMAd-specific Cre mouse model (BMAd-Cre)</title><p>Based on previous studies showing that <italic>Osterix</italic> traces to osteoblasts and BMAds, but not to white adipocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chen and Long, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Mizoguchi et al., 2014</xref>), we used CRISPR/Cas9 to create <italic>Osterix-FLPo</italic> mice with an in-frame fusion of <italic>Osterix</italic> and optimized <italic>FLPo</italic>, separated by a <italic>P2A</italic> self-cleaving sequence to allow independent functioning of the two proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).

To investigate the cell type specificity of Cre activity, we next bred BMAd<italic>-Cre</italic> mice to mT/mG reporter mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Muzumdar et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>), in which all tissues and cells express red fluorescence (membrane-targeted tdTomato; mT) at baseline, and will express membrane-targeted EGFP in the presence of cell-specific Cre. We observed loss of tdTomato and gain of EGFP in BMAT depots of caudal vertebrae (tail) and tibiae, but not in brown or white adipose depots, or other tissues/organs such as liver, pancreas, muscle and spleen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1F</xref>).

Indeed, Cre efficiency was ~80% in both male and female mice over 16 weeks of age with one <italic>Cre</italic> allele, and over 90% at 12 weeks of age in mice with two <italic>Cre</italic> alleles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1I</xref>).</p><p>Previous studies found that a randomly inserted <italic>Adipoq-Cre</italic> bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) causes recombination in osteoblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bozec et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Eguchi et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Mukohira et al., 2019</xref>); thus, we tested whether this observation is true in BMAd<italic>-Cre</italic> mice, which rely on endogenous <italic>Adipoq</italic> expression that is further restricted by <italic>Osterix</italic>. When BMAd<italic>-Cre</italic> mice were bred to mT/mG reporter mice, only tdTomato-positive cells were detectable on trabecular bone surfaces (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>), suggesting that osteoblasts were not targeted. However, labeling of a small subset of stromal/dendritic cells was consistently observed, likely due to expression of <italic>Adipoq</italic> within this cell population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Mukohira et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Although insertion of the FLPo-activated <italic>Cre</italic> cassette into the 3’-UTR of endogenous <italic>Adipoq</italic> overcomes potential problems that arise from random genomic integration, we considered the possibility that placement of the <italic>IRES-Cre</italic> cassette within the 3’-UTR might alter the expression and/or secretion of endogenous adiponectin. We found that insertion of the <italic>IRES-Cre</italic> cassette caused a small, non-significant decrease in <italic>Adipoq</italic> mRNA expression in whole caudal vertebrae or distal tibiae, whereas adiponectin mRNA in white adipose tissue was elevated by more than threefold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref>). Thus, the cassette itself did not limit expression of mRNA. Instead, it appeared that the 2 kb <italic>IRES-Cre</italic> cassette within the 3'-UTR impairs translatability of the mRNA since expression of adiponectin protein in WAT and BMAT was decreased by ~50% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B and C</xref>). Circulating adiponectin concentrations were decreased even further (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2D–F</xref>), suggesting that flux of translated adiponectin protein was impaired through the secretion pathway. Of note, hypoadiponectinemia is associated with insulin resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cook and Semple, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Li et al., 2021</xref>), with discrepant effects reported on osteogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lewis et al., 2021</xref>). Thus, we evaluated systemic metabolism in BMAd-Cre mice and found that body weight, glucose tolerance, WAT depot weights, and tibial trabecular and cortical bone variables were unaffected by this degree of hypoadiponectinemia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2G–P</xref>). To minimize variability between treatments, all mice used in the following studies were positive for both <italic>Osterix-FLPo</italic> (predominantly two alleles) and FAC (mostly two alleles).

To determine whether male BMAd-<italic>Pnpla2</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice have impaired bone homeostasis when dietary energy is limited, we next challenged mice with a 30% CR for 6 weeks. BMAd-<italic>Pnpla2</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice did not have altered body weight, glucose tolerance, or tissue weights comparing with their controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1J-N</xref>), suggesting that BMAds were not a critical source of circulating energy under these conditions. Although <italic>Pnpla2</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice fed ad libitum had increased rBMAT compared to controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1F and G</xref>), CR stimulated rBMAT expansion in control mice such that BMAT volume and BMAd size were comparable between genotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1O-S</xref>). Despite having a similar amount of rBMAT, BMAd-<italic>Pnpla2</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice fed CR diet had reduced trabecular bone volume fraction, connective density, and bone mineral density when compared to controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D and E</xref>). This reduction in bone mass is due to decreased trabecular bone number and increased trabecular spacing, without effects on trabecular thickness (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). BMAds are a source of NEFA for vicinal osteoblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Maridas et al., 2019</xref>); thus, the reduction in trabecular bone in CR BMAd-<italic>Pnpla2</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice likely resulted from impaired osteoblast function due to insufficient energy available in the bone marrow niche. Consistent with this notion, we observed a trend (p=0.07) towards reduced NEFA concentrations in bone marrow supernatant of CR BMAd-<italic>Pnpla2</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice, whilst circulating glycerol and NEFA concentrations were not different between genotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1T and U</xref>). Although FAC mice have hypoadiponectinemia at baseline, circulating adiponectin was still increased dramatically in response to CR. Comparable adiponectin concentrations between BMAd-<italic>Pnpla2</italic><sup>+/+</sup> and BMAd-<italic>Pnpla2</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1V</xref>) excludes the possibility that differences in circulating adiponectin may confound the bone phenotype in BMAd-<italic>Pnpla2</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice. Finally, changes in cortical bone area and thickness were not observed in BMAd-<italic>Pnpla2</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice with either ad libitum or CR diet (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2A-D</xref>), perhaps because cortical bone surfaces are less active.</p><p>To investigate mechanisms underlying trabecular bone loss in CR BMAd-<italic>Pnpla2</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice, we next measured circulating markers of bone cell activity and performed histomorphometry. Osteoblast and osteoclast numbers and osteoclast surface were not changed by BMAd-<italic>Pnpla2</italic> deficiency under ad libitum conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2E and F</xref>). Although circulating markers of bone formation (P1NP) and osteoclast activation (RANK Ligand) were not altered in BMAd-<italic>Pnpla2</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice, markers for bone resorption (CTX-1) and osteoclast activation (TRACP5b) were decreased or showed a strong trend towards reduction, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2G-J</xref>). Although with CR, osteoblast numbers were not altered by a deficiency of BMAT lipolysis, the bone formation marker P1NP was decreased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G and I</xref>), suggesting that osteoblast functions were impaired. Osteoclast numbers were increased in CR BMAd-<italic>Pnpla2</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice, but the osteoclast surface per bone surface (Oc.S/BS) was not changed and the osteoclast activation marker, TRACP5b, was decreased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H and J</xref>), suggesting osteoclast function was inhibited. No differences were observed in RANK Ligand and CTX-1 with CR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2K and L</xref>). We then visualized and quantified osteoid thickness with Goldner’s trichrome staining and observed a trend towards thinner osteoid layers without affecting osteoid surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3K</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2M</xref>), which could be secondary to impaired secretion of collagen matrix by osteoblasts or to enhanced bone mineralization. Further, we injected mice with calcein to label those bone surfaces undergoing active mineralization. Dynamic histomorphometry data suggests that BMAd-<italic>Pnpla2</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice had less bone-forming surface, as indicated by reduced single-labelled surface (sLS) and mineral surface (MS) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3L</xref>).

Thus, we ovariectomized control and BMAd-<italic>Pnpla2</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice 2 weeks prior to initiation of CR. Following initiation of CR, both control and knockout mice demonstrated rapid reduction in body weight for 2 weeks, then gradually stabilized during the following ten weeks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4A</xref>). We did not observe significant differences in glucose tolerance or bone length with CR or <italic>Pnpla2</italic> deletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4B and C</xref>). Although CR caused reduction in WAT and spleen weights, these variables were generally not different between genotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4D</xref>). Interestingly, despite the dramatic increases of BMAT with CR or BMAd-<italic>Pnpla2</italic> deficiency, OVX-associated trabecular bone loss was partially eliminated by CR treatment, which was evidenced by a relative increase in bone volume fraction (Tb. BV/TV) and trabecular number (Tb. N) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4E and F</xref>). These data suggest that the metabolic benefits of CR diet may combat detrimental effects of estrogen deficiency and/or aging. Although not observed in intact mice, with OVX <italic>Pnpla2</italic>-deficient mice, the loss of BMAd ATGL caused a slight reduction in trabecular bone mineral density (Tb. BMD) and thickness (Tb.

During the recovery phase, three-way ANOVA analyses revealed that differences in time (days) and diet (AL vs CR) were observed for total white blood cells, lymphocytes, and red blood cells, while significant interactions between genotype (BMAd-<italic>Pnpla2</italic><sup>+/+</sup> vs BMAd-<italic>Pnpla2</italic><sup>-/-</sup>) and time were observed for neutrophils, eosinophils and basophils, suggesting BMAd-<italic>Pnpla2</italic> deficiency specifically influenced myeloid lineage cells.

Two-way ANOVA also revealed inhibitory effects of CR on monocytes and neutrophils, without changes to lymphocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B–E</xref>). In BMAd-<italic>Pnpla2<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice, HSPCs were not altered by CR except for PreMegE cells, which were suppressed. Bone marrow cellularity, monocytes, and neutrophils were also decreased in CR BMAd-<italic>Pnpla2<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice. The recovery of neutrophils, preneutrophils, immature and mature neutrophils following irradiation was impaired by CR, and <italic>Pnpla2</italic>-deficiency further reduced ability of neutrophils and mature neutrophils to regenerate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E–H</xref>).

Pathway analyses of cluster 1 with Metascape (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://metascape.org">https://metascape.org</ext-link>) revealed that regulated genes were associated with vasculature development and cellular response to growth factor stimulus, which likely reflects adaptation mechanisms to compensate for energy insufficiency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1C</xref>).

Cluster 2 includes genes that were mildly upregulated by CR in control mice and were further increased with <italic>Pnpla2</italic>-deficiency.

Of these genes, 66% did not meet our criteria for regulated expression by CR in BMAd-<italic>Pnpla2</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice (blue dots). Pathway analyses on the 34% of genes regulated by CR regardless of <italic>Pnpla2</italic> deficiency revealed association with ribonuclease activity, response to hormones and other transmembrane signaling pathways (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2A</xref>). Pathway analyses of genes for which <italic>Pnpla2</italic> is required for response to CR identified vasculature development and cellular response to growth factor stimulus, similar to cluster 1, followed closely by skeletal system development, adipogenesis genes, and extracellular matrix organization pathways (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). A heatmap showed that the adipogenic genes, including <italic>Adipoq, Fabp4, Cebpa, Lipe, Lpl, Ppara, Pparg, Scd1, Plin1, Cd36, Fasn,</italic> and <italic>Acaca</italic>, were upregulated by CR in control mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>), a subset of which were confirmed by qPCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2B</xref>). These changes may help to explain molecular mechanisms underlying BMAT expansion following CR. It is important to note that whereas CR BMAd-<italic>Pnpla2</italic><sup>+/+</sup> and BMAd-<italic>Pnpla2</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice had comparable amounts of BMAT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1O and P</xref>), adipocyte gene expression was greatly suppressed in mice with BMAT lacking <italic>Pnpla2</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). This observation is consistent with prior work showing that adipocyte-specific deletion of <italic>Pnpla2</italic> results in decreased expression of genes associated with lipid uptake, synthesis, and adipogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Schoiswohl et al., 2015</xref>), perhaps because NEFA and associated metabolites act as PPAR ligands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Mottillo et al., 2012</xref>). In addition, genes related to endogenous fatty acid biosynthesis were also increased by CR in BMAd-<italic>Pnpla2</italic><sup>+/+</sup> mice, but not in mice lacking <italic>Pnpla2</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2C</xref>). Interestingly, myeloid leukocyte differentiation genes followed a similar pattern (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2D</xref>), which may contribute to the reduced neutrophil production and impaired myeloid cell proliferation of CR BMAd-<italic>Pnpla2</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>).</p><p>We previously observed increased bone loss in BMAd-<italic>Pnpla2</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice challenged with CR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). To investigate potential mechanisms underlying this bone loss, we analyzed pathways from Cluster 1 related to bone metabolism, skeletal system development and extracellular matrix organization. Interestingly, osteoblast-derived alkaline phosphatase (<italic>Alpl</italic>)<italic>, Col1a1</italic> and <italic>Col1a2</italic>, and bone marrow Fgf/Fgfr and Wnt signaling-related molecules were highly induced by CR in control mice but not in <italic>Pnpla2</italic>-deficient mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>); many of these genes are also found in the ossification pathway. Multiple collagen genes, <italic>Lox</italic>, and <italic>Adamts</italic> (A Disintegrin and Metalloproteinase with Thrombospondin motifs) family members, which are multidomain extracellular protease enzymes and play key roles in extracellular matrix remodeling, were also upregulated by CR in control mice, with effects largely eliminated by <italic>Pnpla2</italic> deficiency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>). These findings may partially explain why osteoid thickness tended to be thinner in BMAd-<italic>Pnpla2<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3K</xref>). In this regard, 20 collagen genes were significantly up-regulated in control mice following CR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2E</xref>), whereas only four collagen genes were elevated in CR BMAd-<italic>Pnpla2</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice. Taken together, these data suggest that under conditions of limited dietary energy, BMAds provide energy to maintain osteoblast functions, including the secretion of collagen matrix for osteoid synthesis.</p><p>As mentioned above, loss of <italic>Pnpla2</italic> in CR mice altered expression of 1060 genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B</xref>; right), which were clustered into three groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3A</xref>). Cluster 1 included genes that were induced only in CR BMAd-<italic>Pnpla2<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice. Although not localized to specific pathways, these genes were involved in diverse metabolic and cellular processes (e.g. <italic>Perm1</italic>, <italic>mt-Nd6</italic>, and <italic>B3gat2</italic>), and were generally expressed at low levels at baseline. In contrast, cluster 2 contained genes that were suppressed in CR BMAd-<italic>Pnpla2<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice, including pathways related to mitochondrial functions, hematopoietic progenitor cell differentiation, positive regulation of osteoblast differentiation and fatty acid biosynthetic process (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3B and C</xref>), which sheds further light on the impaired HSPC proliferative capacity and osteoblast functions. Genes in cluster 3 were upregulated by CR, but not by CR in the absence of BMAd-<italic>Pnpla2</italic>. Pathway analyses highlighted the regulation of lipid catabolic process, triacylglyceride synthesis and leukocyte migration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3D and E</xref>), consistent with the impaired lipid metabolism and leukocyte production observed in BMAd-<italic>Pnpla2</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>BMAd lipolysis is required for trabecular and cortical bone regeneration</title><p>To test whether BMAds are a critical source of local energy under conditions where energy needs are elevated, we investigated the impact of CR and BMAd <italic>Pnpla2</italic> deficiency on bone regeneration. To do this, we created a 0.7 mm hole in the proximal tibia, approximately 1–2 mm distal from the growth plate, and evaluated the newly formed woven bone in both the trabecular (endocortical) and cortical compartments nine days later (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). As expected, CR impaired formation of bone in the trabecular (endocortical) region of interest (ROI), resulting in decreased bone volume fraction, mineral density, and mineral content (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). Importantly, these effects of CR were mimicked by BMAd-specific <italic>Pnpla2</italic> deletion; however, gene deletion did not compound effects of CR on impaired bone regeneration, perhaps because newly-formed bone volume was already low with either CR or <italic>Pnpla2</italic> deficiency alone. We then visualized newly formed bone in the cortical bone compartment with Safranin O/ Fast Green (SO/FG) staining of paraffin-embedded proximal tibia sections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). Of note, both bone marrow stromal and periosteal cells contribute to the cortical bone regeneration and are derived from common mesenchymal progenitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Duchamp de Lageneste et al., 2018</xref>). Although deficiency of BMAd-lipolysis is unlikely to affect periosteal cell functions when the cortical bone is intact, it may interact with this cell population during bone regeneration. CR also impaired formation of new woven bone in the cortical compartment by decreasing bone volume fraction, mineral density, and mineral content. As with bone formation in the trabecular compartment, effects of CR on the cortical compartment are mimicked by BMAd-specific depletion of <italic>Pnpla2</italic>, and effects of impaired BMAd lipolysis did not exacerbate CR-induced impaired bone regeneration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>).

In contrast, rBMAd size was increased at baseline in BMAd-<italic>Pnpla2</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice, with no reduction observed with cold exposure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E and G</xref>). These data indicate that intact BMAd lipolysis was required for reduction of BMAd size with cold exposure.

These results suggest that lipolysis from vicinal BMAds is important for maintenance of bone when energy needs are high or when energy supply is limited.

Previously, the role of BMAds in the marrow niche was deduced through indirect inferences from associations of skeletal and hematopoietic phenotypes with bone marrow adipose tissue volume. This has been exemplified by a number of BMAT depletion models which showed high bone mass, including A-ZIP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Naveiras et al., 2009</xref>), <italic>Adipoq</italic>-driven DTA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Zou et al., 2019</xref>), and <italic>Adipoq</italic>-driven loss of <italic>Pparg</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Wang et al., 2013</xref>), <italic>Lmna</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Corsa et al., 2021</xref>), or <italic>Bscl2</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Mcilroy et al., 2018</xref>); however these lipodystrophic mice also lacked white and brown adipose depots and thus exhibit global metabolic dysfunction, including fatty liver, hyperlipidemia and insulin resistance. Moreover, <italic>Adipoq</italic>-driven Cre used in those studies also causes recombination in bone marrow stromal cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Mukohira et al., 2019</xref>). Similarly, mouse models or treatments that result in BMAT expansion, such as <italic>Prx1</italic>-driven <italic>Pth1r</italic> knockout mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fan et al., 2017</xref>), CR, thiazolidinedione administration, estrogen-deficiency, and irradiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Li and MacDougald, 2021</xref>), also caused bone loss, but again, effects on bone may be secondary to lack of promoter specificity or confounding systemic effects. Lineage tracing studies have previously been performed to determine cell-specific markers for BMAds. For example, both <italic>Prx1</italic> and <italic>Osterix</italic> are restricted to bone and trace to 100% of BMAds, but are also expressed in mesenchymal cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Logan et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Mizoguchi et al., 2014</xref>). <italic>Nestin</italic> and leptin receptor (<italic>Lepr</italic>) label over 90% of BMAds, but also trace to stromal cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Zhou et al., 2017</xref>). Whereas Pdgf-receptor α (<italic>Pdgfrα</italic>)-driven Cre expression causes recombination in all white adipocytes, only 50–70% of BMAds are traced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Horowitz et al., 2017</xref>). Thus, our successful strategy for targeting BMAds using dual expression of <italic>Osterix</italic> and <italic>Adipoq</italic>, as reported in this work, improves the interpretability of experiments on the distinct roles of BMAds in the marrow niche and will be a useful tool for future investigations.</p><p>After generating this novel BMAd-specific Cre mouse model, we successfully ablated <italic>Pnpla2</italic> in BMAds, and demonstrated the necessity of ATGL in BMAd lipolysis. Our studies directly demonstrate for the first time the importance of BMAd lipolysis in myelopoiesis and bone homeostasis under conditions of energetic stress, including CR, irradiation, bone regeneration and cold exposure. With the loss of peripheral WAT in CR mice, there is a dramatic increase in BMAT throughout the tibia, and this is accompanied by increased expression of adipocyte genes, including those involved in lipid uptake, de novo lipogenesis, and lipolysis. BMAT expansion with CR has been observed in both rodents and humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cawthorn et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Devlin et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fazeli et al., 2021</xref>), and mechanisms underlying this observation are still not fully understood. We speculate that CR promotes lipolysis in peripheral adipose tissues, and the released non-esterified fatty acids have increased flux to bone marrow, where they are used either directly to maintain hematopoiesis and bone homeostasis, or used indirectly after having been stored and released from BMAT. The RNAseq data also suggests that BMAds have elevated rates of lipid uptake, lipogenesis and lipolysis with CR in control mice. However, when BMAd lipolysis is impaired, this dynamic cycle is halted, which is reflected by the blunted induction of adipocyte genes in response to CR. This BMAd quiescence causes a shortfall in local energy supply and contributes to hematopoietic cell and osteoblast dysfunction. In this regard, two major collagens secreted by osteoblasts, <italic>Col1a1</italic> and <italic>Col1a2</italic>, and <italic>Alpl</italic> were increased by CR in control BMAd-<italic>Pnpla2<sup>+/+</sup></italic> mice, but not in calorie-restricted BMAd-<italic>Pnpla2<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice. These data are consistent with the trend for thinner osteoid observed in CR BMAd-<italic>Pnpla2</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice and reduced circulating concentrations of the bone formation marker P1NP. Although bone mineralization is not impaired, new bone forming surface is reduced in CR mice that lack BMAd lipolysis. In addition, the number of osteoclasts on trabecular bone surface is higher in CR BMAd-<italic>Pnpla2</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice; however, osteoclast surface per bone surface and a circulating marker of bone turnover (CTX-1) are not increased. A serum marker for osteoclast activity, TRACP5b, is decreased in BMAd-<italic>Pnpla2</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice either fed ad libitum or a CR diet. Taken together, our studies suggest that bone mass reduction in CR BMAd-<italic>Pnpla2</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice is less likely due to degradation of bone by osteoclasts, and more likely due to impaired osteoblast function, including collagen secretion and osteoid production.</p><p>Interestingly, the contributions of BMAd lipolysis to bone homeostasis appear to be more important in male mice compared to females. Although we considered that a stronger phenotype might be revealed in female mice following estrogen depletion, the low bone mass observed with ovariectomy or CR may represent a critical threshold that is strongly defended through mechanisms independent of BMAd lipolysis. Alternatively, it is possible that androgens increase energy requirements of bone such that male mice are more dependent on BMAd lipolysis under stressful conditions. Consistent with this tenet, in both mouse and human studies of calorie restriction, males tend to have greater induction of BMAds than females (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fazeli et al., 2021</xref>). Importantly, we observed that bone volume fraction and trabecular number were increased by 12 weeks of CR in OVX mice of both genotypes, suggesting that the metabolic and anti-aging benefits of CR somehow block the bone loss associated with estrogen deficiency as mice aged to 40 weeks.</p><p>Surprisingly, despite expansion of BMAT in ad libitum-fed BMAd-<italic>Pnpla2<sup>-/-</sup></italic> male and female mice, we did not observe differences in skeletal parameters, indicating that expansion of BMAT is not sufficient to cause bone loss, and that the correlation between elevated fracture risk and expansion of BMAT under a variety of clinical situations is not necessarily a causal relationship. The critical role of BMAd lipolysis in fueling osteoblasts was observed in BMAd-<italic>Pnpla2<sup>-/-</sup></italic> male mice only when energy needs were high, or when the availability of dietary energy was low. Of note, cellular protein synthesis typically uses 25–30% of the oxygen consumption coupled to ATP synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Rolfe and Brown, 1997</xref>), and this percentage may be higher in osteoblasts since protein synthesis and translation are integral to osteoblast function. Additionally, fatty acids contribute substantially to the energy demands of bone tissue and cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Adamek et al., 1987</xref>), and in the absence of BMAd lipolysis, these energy needs must be met from circulating lipids, glucose, lactate, and amino acids. Uptake of fatty acids by osteoblasts is likely mediated by the CD36 fatty acid translocase, which is required in mice to maintain osteoblast numbers and activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kevorkova et al., 2013</xref>). Further, impairment of fatty acid oxidation in osteoblasts and osteocytes led to reduced postnatal bone acquisition in female, but not male mice. Interestingly, significant increases in the osteoid thickness, osteoid volume per bone volume, and the osteoid maturation time suggest that a mineralization defect occurs in mice unable to oxidize fatty acids obtained not only from BMAds, but also from circulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kim et al., 2017</xref>). Although we have largely interpreted effects of Pnpla2 deficiency as causing a local energy shortfall, <italic>Pnpla2</italic> deficiency may also alter downstream signaling activities. For example, ATGL deficiency prevents cAMP-dependent degradation of TXNIP and thus reduces glucose uptake and lactate secretion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Beg et al., 2021</xref>). ATGL-catalyzed lipolysis also provides essential mediators to increase activity of PGC-1α/PPARα and PPARδpathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Haemmerle et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Khan et al., 2015</xref>). Thus, it is conceivable that ATGL deficiency may alter the BMAd transcriptome and secretome to influence the marrow niche independent of its role as a fuel source.</p><p>Given the extensive literature describing interactions between BMAds and hematopoietic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lee et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Valet et al., 2020</xref>), we were surprised at the lack of substantial changes in hematopoietic progenitors, white blood cells, and red blood cells in BMAd-<italic>Pnpla2</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice under basal and CR conditions. One possibility is that skeletal sites containing low BMAd numbers, including vertebrae, sternum, ribs and pelvis, may allow compensatory formation of circulating mature blood cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kricun, 1985</xref>). In addition, hematopoietic progenitors and mature blood cell populations were not substantially altered in bone marrow of long bones, with the exception of myeloid differentiation into neutrophils, suggesting that hematopoietic cellularity is generally maintained despite expansion of BMAT volume. Although hematopoietic progenitors and mature cells can use lipids for energy, glucose serves as the major source of energy for glycolysis and oxidative metabolism in these cell populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Jeon et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Roy et al., 2018</xref>). It is perhaps unsurprising, given the importance of blood cell production in maintaining life, that there is a great deal of metabolic flexibility when it comes to fuel sources for hematopoiesis. While HSPC numbers are unaltered in our BMAd-<italic>Pnpla2<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice, myeloid lineage cell recovery is significantly blunted by CR and deficiency of BMAd-lipolysis following sublethal irradiation and in in vitro myeloid CFU assays. Myeloid progenitors from CR BMAd-<italic>Pnpla2</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice had an impaired capacity to expand, suggesting that progenitors were reprogrammed in response to energy deficiency in the bone marrow niche. We did not profile the metabolic changes of HSPCs in CR BMAd-<italic>Pnpla2</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice, but it has been reported that fatty acid oxidation is required for HSC asymmetric division to retain the stem cell properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Ito et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>In summary, we have developed a novel mouse model to specifically evaluate the importance of BMAds in adult life and during times of nutritional, hormonal, environmental and mechanical stress. We report that BMAds are a local energy source that support myeloid cell lineage regeneration following irradiation, and maintain progenitor differentiation capacity when systemic energy is limiting. In addition, we find that BMAT serves a highly specialized function to maintain bone mass and osteoblast function in times of elevated local energy needs such as with bone regeneration, increased whole body energy needs from cold exposure, or when dietary energy is limited due to CR. Thus, Steele’s instincts in 1884 when he wrote that fat from marrow 'nourishes the skeleton' are largely borne out by modern experimentation.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Limitations of study</title><p>There are some limitations to the BMAd-<italic>Cre</italic> mice that should be noted. For instance, expression of <italic>Cre</italic> from the IRES within the 3'-UTR of <italic>Adipoq</italic> is relatively low, and thus rates of recombination are less frequent in young mice than optimal. Mice that are older than 16 weeks are suggested for future usage of this <italic>Cre</italic> mouse model. However, bone formation and turnover rates decrease with age both in mice and humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fatayerji and Eastell, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Ferguson et al., 2003</xref>), which may provide challenges for mechanistic studies. The IRES-<italic>Cre</italic> cassette also causes hypoadiponectinemia so experimental design must include appropriate controls with BMAd-<italic>Cre</italic> positive mice with or without floxed genes. Although a total absence of adiponectin reduces bone mass (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Naot et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Yang et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Zhu et al., 2020</xref>), mice with hypoadiponectinemia described here did not exhibit metabolic or bone phenotypes. In retrospect, a better approach might have been to accept loss of one <italic>Adipoq</italic> allele and insert the FAC cassette at the start site of the adiponectin coding region to promote high levels of <italic>Cre</italic> expression. This strategy might also have allowed inducible knockout of BMAd genes with tamoxifen through expression of CreERT2, which we found to be too inefficient to be functional when inserted into the 3'-UTR of <italic>Adipoq</italic>, with only 5–8% BMAds labeled in tamoxifen-treated adult mice. Of note, all mice used in these studies were on a mixed SJL and C57BL/6 J background, and mouse strain influences bone mass, and responsiveness of bone to stressors. Although we have not provided direct evidence of BMAd-derived fatty acids fueling osteoblasts or hematopoietic cells, this line of investigation will require technical advances to distinguish BMAd-derived NEFA from those in circulation. It should be noted that our RNAseq data was obtained from cBMAT of distal tibiae. It is likely that the fundamental interactions between BMAT and other cells within the marrow niche are similar between regions; however, we do not exclude the possibility that there may be unique interactions between rBMAT and osteoblast/hematopoietic cells.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Resource availability</title><sec id="s4-1-1"><title>Lead contact</title><p>Further information and requests for resources and reagents should be directed to and will be fulﬁlled by the Lead Contact, Ormond A.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by me. The following individual involved in the review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: William P Cawthorn (Reviewer #3).</p><p>In view of our discussions as a consultative review group, I have drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Overall, the work is of high quality. The development of the new mouse model is a major strength that could be transformative for mechanistic studies of BMAd formation and function.</p><p>1. A main requirement is to measure circulating adiponectin in experimental mice. If the KO CR mice have lower adiponectin than the WT CR mice then this might be confounding the phenotypes observed. This will need discussion.</p><p>2. Many of the current figures and data analysis should also be updated to address limitations mentioned in the reviewer comments (below).</p><p>3. Update the statistical analysis so that the authors are not missing genotype*diet interactions, and present the AL and CR data side by side in all relevant figures (e.g. Figure 3, Figure 3 —figure supplement 1, Figure 3 —figure supplement 2). This should be easy to do, though the updated analyses might lead to updated conclusions.</p><p>4. Further analyze transcriptomic data for potential clues about the mechanisms underlying the hematological phenotypes (as they've done currently for the bone phenotype). Also highlight the limitation that the transcriptomic data are from distal tibia, whereas the bone analyses and hematological analyses are largely from other regions of the skeleton.</p><p>5. Update the OVX analyses to compare the OVX mice with ovary-intact females (as done for uterus masses in Figure 3 —figure supplement 4D). This would partially address the limitation, highlighted by Reviewer 2, that the authors haven't included appropriate sham or estrogen-replete controls for OVX mice. This limitation should be mentioned in the Discussion. Alternatively, the OVX experiment could be removed from the paper, as it is not particularly adding much.</p><p>6. Need a proper description and discussion of the bone injury healing experiment.</p><p>7. Specific comments under Recommendations to Authors need to be addressed in a point-to-point rebuttal.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Overall this is a good manuscript and no major revisions are recommended. However, there are several grammatical errors (e.g. line 521) that would require a careful proofreading to improve. Moreover, given the general readership of <italic>eLife</italic>, expansion of the introduction to include more background on topics that as written are fairly field-specific would certainly enhance the overall appeal to a wider audience.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1) Consider the mechanism by which ATGL deficiency induces lipogenesis with respect to the following. There is a substantial accumulation of marrow fat in Pnpla2 -/- females under CR conditions which supersedes an amount of fat in control mice in the same conditions. This indicates massive lipogenesis rather than BMAd acting as a sink to circulating FA, as the authors propose.</p><p>2) To assess whether estrogen protects female Pnpla2 -/- mice from negative effects of CR, mice were OVX. Surprisingly, OVX control and Pnpla2 -/- females &quot;gained&quot; bone when exposed to CR. There is no plausible explanation for this effect, which is in striking contrast to the CR effect in males. In addition, Sham-operated control is not provided in this experiment which poses the question of whether it is a bone gain or protection from bone loss. The conclusion that &quot;metabolic benefits of CR diet combat detrimental effects of estrogen deficiency and/or aging&quot; is overstated and applies only to females. This is an intriguing observation but needs more insight. What is its relevance to humans? Is there any evidence that malnourished postmenopausal women are gaining bone?</p><p>3) Pnpla2 -/- male but not female mice have mildly affected myelopoiesis which is exacerbated in CR conditions. CR also affected hematopoietic marrow regeneration after irradiation which correlated with decreased number of hematopoietic stem cells. There is no evidence that these alterations are due to fuel deficiency in the marrow environment. The possibility that there are changes in the signaling milieu should be tested experimentally or considered based on transcriptomic data.</p><p>4) In regard to the bone regeneration model there is some misunderstanding. What the authors consider as trabecular bone is actually woven bone that is removed during the final stages of healing which occur at week 4 after injury. Referring to it as trabecular bone is not correct because the woven bone has a different origin and structure. In this model, day 9 after injury correlates with initiation of mineralization which robustness depends on previously formed hematoma and callus, and penetration of new vessels. It is possible that Pnpla2 deficiency affects early stages of bone healing not necessarily osteoblast bone-forming activity. Again, the transcriptomic data may give some clue, although they are done on marrow fat isolated from the distal tibia which is considered metabolically different than marrow fat in the proximal tibia where the bone defect was created.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>General points:</p><p>a. Adiponectin deficiency in the Pnpla2 WT vs KO mice:</p><p>Please analyse circulating adiponectin in the Pnpla2 WT vs KO mice. This is important because you show that the BMAd-Cre mice have lower adiponectin and that the KO CR mice do not increase BMAT adiponectin expression to the same extent as the WT CR mice (i.e. Figure 5D and Figure 5 supplemental figure 2B) Notably, adiponectin KO mice have been shown to resist bone loss and BMAT expansion during CR (Zhu et al., 2020). Therefore, if the KO CR mice do have lower adiponectin than the WT CR mice then this might be influencing their bone phenotype. It would also be helpful to know if the BMAd-Cre mice do increase circulating adiponectin during CR, despite having lower adiponectin expression than the non-Cre mice.</p><p>Because the hypoadiponectinaemia may be confounding, it would be helpful to compare the BMAd-Pnpla2+/+ and BMAd-Pnpla2-/- mice with Cre-negative Pnpla2-fl/fl mice, both under AL and CR conditions.</p><p>Related to these considerations, in lines 576-578 you mention a few previous studies of adiponectin and bone, but the Zhu 2020 paper about adiponectin KO and CR is not cited. Please update this part of the discussion to mention this very relevant paper.</p><p>b. Analysis of diet and diet-genotype effects:</p><p>i. In Figure 3 and its supplemental figures 1 and 2 please can the data from ad libitum (AL) mice be analysed together with the data from the calorie-restricted (CR) mice? Currently the two diets are assessed separately and therefore it's not possible to detect effects of CR or if the BMAd Pnpla2 KO significantly alters these diet effects. Knowing this would be extremely informative as it may be that, while the KO alone has no effect within each diet, it might alter the CR effects. For some readouts this may also increase statistical power to detect significant effects of diet or genotype alone.</p><p>ii. Related to this, in Figure 3 (supplemental figures 3 and 4), Figure 4 (and its two supplemental figures), Figure 5 (supplemental figure 2B) and Figure 6 the four genotype-diet groups are analysed side-by-side, but they are compared using 1-way ANOVA. For these figures using a 2-way (or sometimes 3-way) ANOVA is more appropriate and, as above, is required if you are to detect diet effects and genotype-diet interactions. For example, the time course data in Figure 4 supplemental figure 1C-E should be assessed by 3-way ANOVA with genotype, diet and time as the independent variables, while the data in Figure 4 and panels F-G of the supplemental figure should be assessed by 2-way ANOVA with genotype and diet as the independent variables. As above, this is important because you can then test for interactions between the variables, which might reveal KO effects that cannot be detected by 1-way ANOVA. In some cases, the 2-way ANOVA is also required to support existing statements in the results. For example, Line 303 (&quot;…mature neutrophils are affected only by CR (Figure 4H)&quot;) and Lines 307-308 (&quot;fewer granulocyte progenitor colonies (CFU-G) from CR BMAd-Pnpla2-/- mice (Figure 4I)&quot;) are not supported by any statistical analysis.</p><p>c. In the Results section the findings frequently are described in the present tense. Convention is to report the results in the past tense (i.e. what was found) and then, in the Discussion, to interpret these data in the present tense (i.e. what the results show/reveal etc). Please can this be updated throughout the Results section?</p><p>d. Genotypes of BMAd-Cre mice:</p><p>i. In Supplemental Figure 2, you distinguish homozygous vs heterozygous BMAd-Cre mice. I think it would help the reader to clarify that this relates to the FAC transgene, but it's not clear if these mice have one or two alleles of the Osterix-FLPo transgene. Please can you clarify in the text of the results</p><p>ii. Lines 174-175: You state that mice used for the Pnpla2 KO studies were positive for both Osterix-FLPo and FAC; were they homozygous for both transgenes or was one of the heterozygous (etc)? This needs to be clarified in the text.</p><p>Specific points:</p><p>e. Figure 1 —figure supplement 1:</p><p>i. For 1C I'm confused by the genotype labelling for the Osterix mouse above the blot: does the '+' refer to the presence of FLPo? It's confusing as usually '+' would refer to the WT allele; please clarify in the figure and the legend.</p><p>ii. In the main text (lines 126-128) you state, &quot;Cre in the correct orientation… is only observed in caudal vertebral DNA of mice positive for at least one copy each of Osterix (Mut band) and FAC (Ori band)&quot;. This is shown in Supp Figure 1F so please refer to this figure after making this statement in the text. Also, it is logical to move Supp Figure 1F to Supp Figure 1D, as it follows immediately from 1C.</p><p>f. Lines 144-145, &quot;Indeed, Cre efficiency is ~80% in both male and female mice over 16 weeks of age with one Cre allele, and over 90% at 12 weeks of age in mice with two Cre alleles&quot;. Please explain how you calculated these percentages of efficiency; no quantification is shown in the figures.</p><p>g. Lines 160-161: Please can you reword this text for clarity, e.g. &quot;We found that insertion of the IRES-Cre cassette caused a small, non-significant decrease in Adipoq mRNA expression in whole caudal vertebrae or distal tibiae (Figure Supp 2A), whereas Adipoq mRNA in WAT…&quot;</p><p>h. Line 166: The greater decrease in circulating adiponectin is clear from the data. Therefore, please revise the wording to &quot;Circulating adiponectin concentrations were decreased even further…&quot;.</p><p>i. Figure 1 —figure supplement 2F: please can you refer to this in the figure legend, e.g. &quot;(F) High, medium and low molecular weight forms of adiponectin were quantified by Image J.&quot;</p><p>j. Figure 2</p><p>i. 2B: There is still some ATGL fluorescence in the proximal tibia of the KO mice. Where is this coming from? Perhaps ATGL is expressed earlier than adiponectin in BMAd development, so some differentiating BMAds may still have intact ATGL expression?</p><p>ii. 2D-F: The differences look greatest in the proximal tibial diaphysis, above the tibia-fibula junction. Is there a reason that this region was not quantified by osmium?</p><p>k. Lines 220-222, &quot;These data also indicate that expansion of BMAT is not sufficient to cause bone loss and that the correlation between elevated fracture risk and expansion of BMAT under a variety of clinical situations is not necessarily a causal relationship.&quot; This is an interesting and important point but is better suited to the Discussion section.</p><p>l. Figure 3 (main figure and Supplemental figures):</p><p>i. Figure 3 Supp 1B vs 1K: Was glucose tolerance improved by CR? Fasting and peak glucose in the CR mice (1K) look similar to in the ad libitum mice (1B). It would be informative to calculate the AUC for the GTTs and to then plot this for all four groups on the same axis, comparing by 2-way ANOVA.</p><p>ii. In Figure 3 Supp 1O you show nicely that total BMAT volume is similar between KO and control during CR. Is BMAd size the same? i.e. do the KO mice still have larger BMAds than control mice during CR?</p><p>iii. Lines 243-244: You state &quot;we observed a trend (P = 0.07) towards reduced NEFA concentrations in bone marrow supernatant of CR BMAd-Pnpla2-/- mice&quot;. However, the same trend seems to occur for the AL mice (Supplemental 3I). Please can you add P values to Figure 3 Supp 1I so that the AL data can be compared more directly with glycerol and NEFA during CR (Figure 3 Supp 1R)? Better still would be to have all four groups compared on a single axis (as suggested above in General Point b), as this may give you sufficient power to detect a significant genotype effect on NEFA in the BM supernatant.</p><p>iv. In line 255 you state that TRACP5b is decreased but from the figure this isn't significant, so please temper this statement in the main text. Alternatively, if you were to analyse the AL and CR mice together by 2-way ANOVA you might then have enough power to detect a significant decrease in the KO mice, irrespective of diet.</p><p>m. Was DAPI used for live/dead staining in your flow cytometry? This is not absolutely essential but should be stated in the Methods section if this was or was not done.</p><p>n. Table 2: Please confirm that these P values are adjusted for multiple comparisons and update the Table legend to state how statistical significance was determined.</p><p>o. Figure 3 —figure supplement 3:</p><p>i. BM adiposity is shown histologically in panel C but this is not quantified, so it's not clear to what extent this is altered by genotype and/or diet. Please can you quantify BM adiposity from these images? Even better would be to use osmium staining so that the female data could be compared with the male data in Figure 3 supplement 1.</p><p>p. In Figure 5B-C and the related supplemental figures, what's the rationale for comparing CR KO mice to AL WT mice? I think this comparison is invalid because it is being made across two independent variables. For example, if the target gene expression is similar in CR WT vs CR KO, but (e.g.) lower in AL WT vs AL KO, then the fold change vs AL WT will be similar for CR WT and CR KO, but the fold change for CR KO vs AL KO will be greater. To my mind, this would mean that the KO is altering the effect of CR, but your approach would not detect this. So, if the goal is to identify genes regulated by CR irrespective of Pnpla2 deficiency then this should be done by comparing the effects of CR within each genotype.</p><p>q. The finding of impaired bone regeneration with CR and Pnpla2 KO is consistent with your conclusion, i.e. that BMAd lipolysis is important for bone regeneration. However, another interpretation relates to the findings of Ambrosi 2017, who show that BMAds impair fracture healing (Ambrosi et al., 2017). Their data suggest that BMAds can secrete DPP4 and that this impairs bone healing. Therefore, another possibility for your observation is that increased BMAT in the Pnpla2 KO mice results in increased production of DPP4 in the bone marrow, which impairs bone regeneration. Please can you measure DPP4 expression within the BM and/or discuss this possibility in the Discussion section?</p><p>r. Line 453: Please correct 'Figure 4I' to 'Figure 4H'. Also, you can't really state that BMD declines when this effect is not statistically significant; can you test this further (e.g. use 2-way ANOVA and/or in a second cohort of mice), or at least temper the language used to describe this effect?</p><p>s. You show that myelopoiesis is impaired by BMAd-specific Pnpla2 deficiency, but do not go into the mechanism about why only the myeloid system, and not the CLP or HSC (which are also in the bone marrow), is dependent on energy supply from BMAds under CR. Please can you speculate on this in the Discussion?</p><p>References</p><p>Ambrosi, T.H., Scialdone, A., Graja, A., Gohlke, S., Jank, A.M., Bocian, C., Woelk, L., Fan, H., Logan, D.W., Schurmann, A., et al.

First, as shown in Figure 5 —figure supplement 2D, we observed that a gene cluster related to “Myeloid leukocyte differentiation” was largely upregulated in CR BMAd-Pnpla2<sup>+/+</sup> mice; however, these increases were largely eliminated in CR BMAd-Pnpla2<sup>-/-</sup> mice. Second, secretory protein analyses revealed that genes related to &quot;hematopoietic stem cell proliferation&quot; followed a similar pattern that was upregulated by CR in control mice, but not in CR BMAd-Pnpla2-deficient mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref>) . Third, by comparing gene expression in BMAd-Pnpla2<sup>+/+</sup> and BMAd-Pnpla2<sup>-/-</sup> mice under AL and CR conditions, we found that the “hematopoietic progenitor cell differentiation pathway” was suppressed only in CR BMAd-Pnpla2<sup>-/-</sup> mice, whereas expression of “leukocyte migration pathway” genes was increased in CR BMAd-Pnpla2<sup>+/+</sup> mice, but not in CR BMAd-Pnpla2<sup>-/-</sup> mice (New Figure 5 —figure supplement 3).</p><fig id="sa2fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>BMAd-Pnpla2 deficiency causes alterations in secretory protein gene expression.</title><p>A.

Update the OVX analyses to compare the OVX mice with ovary-intact females (as done for uterus masses in Figure 3 —figure supplement 4D).

Thank you for suggesting we add background for a broader audience. We have now provided an overview to adipocytes and bone marrow adipose tissue (BMAT) at the beginning of the introduction, as well as historical context underlying our current investigation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>1) Consider the mechanism by which ATGL deficiency induces lipogenesis with respect to the following. There is a substantial accumulation of marrow fat in Pnpla2 -/- females under CR conditions which supersedes an amount of fat in control mice in the same conditions. This indicates massive lipogenesis rather than BMAd acting as a sink to circulating FA, as the authors propose.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now quantified the female data and included it in Figure 3 —figure supplement 3C. Male control mice have elevated BMAT that closely matches that in AL and CR BMAd-Pnpla2<sup>-/-</sup> mice. However, as noted by the reviewer, the female CR BMAd-Pnpla2<sup>-/-</sup> mice have more rBMAT than CR control mice, and more than AL BMAd-Pnpla2<sup>-/-</sup> mice. Thus, BMAT increases with CR and/or pnpla2-deficiency in female mice. These observations highlight an underlying theme within this paper – that male and female mice differ in the physiology of the marrow niche. The basis for expansion of BMAT under these conditions is under active investigation within the field, including our lab. For increased number of BMAds, the mechanisms include increased adipogenesis and reduced dedifferentiation. For expanded size of adipocytes, the possibilities include increased de novo lipogenesis, increased uptake and storage of lipid, and impaired lipolysis. Although we did not profile gene expression in female mice, based on the RNAseq data from male mice, the adipogenesis/lipogenesis genes were dramatically increased in Pnpla2<sup>+/+</sup> mice under CR conditions, whereas this effect was largely blocked in Pnpla2<sup>-/-</sup> mice. Thus, it seems unlikely that the elevated number/size of adipocytes in CR BMAd-Pnpla2<sup>-/-</sup> mice is due to increased storage of fat, but is instead due to an impairment of turnover. Dr. Philipp Scherer has shown quite convincingly that adipocytes of mammary gland and skin have a cycle of differentiation/dedifferentiation and as suggested in the original manuscript (Wang et al., 2018), this phenomenon may be also occurring in bone marrow given how the adipocytes ‘disappear’ with pregnancy and lactation (Honda et al., 2000), with GCSF administration (Li et al., 2019), and with hemolytic anemia (Weiss, 1965). However, lineage tracing of BMAds is challenging because of the high signal in stromal cells observed with inducible Adiponectin-based Cre or rtTA systems. Although these approaches label essentially 100% of adipocytes in white and brown depots, they are not completely penetrant to bone marrow adipose tissue, even with tamoxifen treatments over a long time (30 days). Thus, we will need to make technical breakthroughs before we can really understand the mechanism for expansion of BMAds under these conditions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) To assess whether estrogen protects female Pnpla2 -/- mice from negative effects of CR, mice were OVX. Surprisingly, OVX control and Pnpla2 -/- females &quot;gained&quot; bone when exposed to CR. There is no plausible explanation for this effect, which is in striking contrast to the CR effect in males. In addition, Sham-operated control is not provided in this experiment which poses the question of whether it is a bone gain or protection from bone loss. The conclusion that &quot;metabolic benefits of CR diet combat detrimental effects of estrogen deficiency and/or aging&quot; is overstated and applies only to females. This is an intriguing observation but needs more insight. What is its relevance to humans? Is there any evidence that malnourished postmenopausal women are gaining bone?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for raising this question and its translational significance. We initially were puzzled by our finding of increased trabecular bone during calorie restriction. But a closer look at the transcriptomics and a recent paper by one of our co-authors provides support for this novel observation. First, we noted that by pathway analysis skeletal system development was one of the top 3 gene networks up-regulated in the BMAd-Pnpla2<sup>+/+</sup> mice but not the BMAd-Pnpla2<sup>-/-</sup> mice undergoing 30% calorie restriction. Similarly extracellular matrix organization was also another up-regulated pathway. These responses were somewhat surprising since adipogenesis was the predominant cellular phenotype in the marrow. However, a closer look revealed that regulation of the cellular response to growth factor stimulus was another highly up-regulated network, implying there is an overall recruitment of progenitor cell populations in the niche, including pre-osteoblasts (Figure 5). In support of that tenet, unpublished studies from the Dr. Clifford Rosen’s laboratory have shown that marrow stromal cells from 30% calorie-deficient B6 male and female mice in vitro have enhanced numbers of CFU-Fs, and greater staining of alkaline phosphatase compared to ad libitum MSCs. This was further reinforced by our finding in males that markers of that population, Pth1r, Fgf2, Alpl and Cola1 were all up regulated with 30% CR in the BMAd-Pnpla2<sup>+/+</sup> but not the BMAd-Pnpla2<sup>-/-</sup> mice (Figure 5D-5F).</p><p>Our female study in Figure 3 —figure supplement 4 is complicated by the three variables we evaluated (OVX, diet and genotype). As suggested by reviewer 3, we went back and evaluated our data using two-way ANOVA, and in Figure 3 —figure supplement 3D, we observe that CR also increases bone volume fraction and decreases trabecular bone separation in ovary-intact female mice. Note that CR was for 12 weeks and was initiated when female mice were 16 weeks of age. We have reviewed previously the variable response to CR depending on mouse age and sex (Li and MacDougald, 2021).</p><p>In terms of the sham control groups, as mentioned above in the response to the editor: Since there were already four groups in this OVX cohort, it was challenging to add the ovary-intact females, which would have doubled the number of transgenic mice within the experiment. However, we had evaluated a sex- and age-matched female cohort and to provide context to our OVX data, we have now included these data as a control group in Figure 3 —figure supplement 4. Although these data are included as a reference, they are not included in the statistical analyses because they are from an independent cohort.</p><p>In respect to the translational significance of this work, recent findings from Fazeli et al. and Bredella et al. by our co-author Rosen (Bredella et al., 2022; Fazeli et al., 2021), demonstrated similar results to our mouse work. In that study of 23 human volunteers (mean age 33) who underwent first a high calorie diet (HCD) for ten days, and then after a two-week interval, 10 days of fasting, the increase in marrow adiposity was much more marked with fasting than with overnutrition, and male volunteers exhibited a much more consistent increase in BMAT than females. Moreover, when bone micro-architecture was measured by microCT at both the distal radius and tibia, trabecular bone volume fraction, trabecular thickness and trabecular plate thickness were all significantly increased with fasting compared to baseline measures (p&lt;0.009). In contrast, no significant changes were noted with over-nutrition.</p><p>In response to the particular reviewer query, there is no evidence clinically that malnourished post-menopausal women gain bone with calorie restriction; indeed, over a longer period of time, it is likely that they could lose bone. For example, in the CALERIE study of human volunteers 25% calorie restriction over two years led to bone loss at three skeletal sites in both males and females (Villareal et al., 2016). Furthermore, Beavers et al. have shown in older women in the absence of estrogen that dietary restriction also causes bone loss (Wherry et al., 2021). Taken together our data suggest that short term calorie restriction in adult female mice increases trabecular bone mass due to an increase in recruitment of osteoblast progenitors that can make collagen. However, we postulate that longer term loss of energy (comparable to a human 10 day fast), as shown in the above noted human studies, would ultimately lead to bone loss, particularly in states of estrogen deficiency. The translational importance of our findings relates to the skeletal complications of long-term dietary manipulations. For example, intermittent fasting is now touted as a major weight-loss strategy, yet we know little about its impact on the skeleton, particularly in postmenopausal women. In fact, skeletal responses to intermittent fasting is the subject of a recently submitted R01 since it is clear that a better understanding of the molecular cellular and hormonal response in the marrow to dietary changes is needed.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Pnpla2 -/- male but not female mice have mildly affected myelopoiesis which is exacerbated in CR conditions. CR also affected hematopoietic marrow regeneration after irradiation which correlated with decreased number of hematopoietic stem cells. There is no evidence that these alterations are due to fuel deficiency in the marrow environment. The possibility that there are changes in the signaling milieu should be tested experimentally or considered based on transcriptomic data.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for raising this important caveat. We have added the following section to the discussion. “Although we have largely interpreted effects of Pnpla2 deficiency as causing a local energy shortfall, Pnpla2 deficiency may also alter downstream signaling activities. For example, ATGL deficiency prevents cAMP-dependent degradation of TXNIP and thus reduces glucose uptake and lactate secretion (Beg et al., 2021). ATGL-catalyzed lipolysis also provides essential mediators to increase activity of PGC-1α/PPARα and PPARd pathways (Haemmerle et al., 2011; Khan et al., 2015). Thus, it is conceivable that ATGL deficiency may alter the BMAd transcriptome and secretome to influence the marrow niche independent of its direct role as a fuel source.” Further we have added this sentence to the limitations section: “Although we have not provided direct evidence of BMAd-derived fatty acids fueling osteoblasts or hematopoietic cells, this line of investigation will require technical advances to distinguish BMAd-derived NEFA from those in circulation.”</p><p>We also appreciate your suggestion to analyze our RNAseq data to reveal possible mechanisms of impaired myelopoiesis. First, as shown in Figure 5 —figure supplement 2D, we found that gene expression related to “Myeloid leukocyte differentiation” was upregulated in CR BMAd-Pnpla2<sup>+/+</sup> mice; however, these increases were largely eliminated in BMAd-Pnpla2<sup>-/-</sup> mice. Second, interactions between BMAds and osteoblast/hematopoietic cells may be paracrine in nature; thus, we further mapped the RNAseq data with two independent secretome databases: MetaZSecKB (Meinken et al., 2015) and VerSaDa (Cortazar et al., 2017). Among the 1026 genes that were upregulated by CR in BMAd-Pnpla2<sup>+/+</sup> mice, 88 were identified as highly likely secreted proteins in the MetaZSecKB database, whereas 69 genes encoding secreted proteins were identified by the VerSaDa database (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1A</xref>) . Furthermore, we aligned the secretory proteins from these two independent databases and found 45 genes were shared, which were used for pathway analyses. Again, “extracellular matrix (ECM) organization” and “ECM-receptor interaction” were ranked as the top two pathways (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1B</xref>). Interestingly, “hematopoietic stem cell proliferation pathway” was enriched for a number of genes, including Sfrp2, which was reported as an important factor for maintaining the HSC pool (Ruf et al., 2016); Thpo, which influences hematopoietic recovery after myeloablative stress (Gao et al., 2021); and Prg4, which is required for stimulating effects of parathyroid hormone on HSPCs (Novince et al., 2011). Z-Scores showed that Sfrp2, Thpo and Prg4 were upregulated in CR BMAd-Pnpla2<sup>+/+</sup> mice, effects of which were largely eliminated by the deficiency of Pnpla2 in BMAd (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1C</xref>). Third, further analyses of the differentially-regulated genes between CR BMAd-Pnpla2<sup>+/+</sup> and CR BMAd-Pnpla2<sup>-/-</sup> mice revealed that “hematopoietic progenitor cell differentiation pathway” was suppressed only in CR BMAd-Pnpla2<sup>-/-</sup> mice, whereas “leukocyte migration pathway” was activated in CR BMAd-Pnpla2<sup>+/+</sup> mice, but inhibited in CR BMAd-Pnpla2<sup>-/-</sup> mice (New Figure 5 —figure supplement 3).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) In regard to the bone regeneration model there is some misunderstanding. What the authors consider as trabecular bone is actually woven bone that is removed during the final stages of healing which occur at week 4 after injury. Referring to it as trabecular bone is not correct because the woven bone has a different origin and structure. In this model, day 9 after injury correlates with initiation of mineralization which robustness depends on previously formed hematoma and callus, and penetration of new vessels. It is possible that Pnpla2 deficiency affects early stages of bone healing not necessarily osteoblast bone-forming activity. Again, the transcriptomic data may give some clue, although they are done on marrow fat isolated from the distal tibia which is considered metabolically different than marrow fat in the proximal tibia where the bone defect was created.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate your professional insights and apologize for mis-characterizing the injury response. We have corrected the description of bone regeneration with the help from Dr. Kurt Hankenson, who is an expert in bone healing field. As shown in Figure 5C, genes in vasculature development, skeletal system development, extracellular matrix organization and ossification pathways are upregulated by CR in in BMAd-Pnpla2<sup>+/+</sup> mice, but these pathways are inhibited in in CR BMAd-Pnpla2<sup>-/-</sup> mice. The limitation of site-specific effects has been highlighted, although larger transgenic animals will be required to collect enough proximal tibial regulated BMAT to reveal the possible site-specific effects.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>General points:</p><p>a. Adiponectin deficiency in the Pnpla2 WT vs KO mice:</p><p>Please analyse circulating adiponectin in the Pnpla2 WT vs KO mice. This is important because you show that the BMAd-Cre mice have lower adiponectin and that the KO CR mice do not increase BMAT adiponectin expression to the same extent as the WT CR mice (i.e. Figure 5D and Figure 5 supplemental figure 2B) Notably, adiponectin KO mice have been shown to resist bone loss and BMAT expansion during CR (Zhu et al., 2020). Therefore, if the KO CR mice do have lower adiponectin than the WT CR mice then this might be influencing their bone phenotype. It would also be helpful to know if the BMAd-Cre mice do increase circulating adiponectin during CR, despite having lower adiponectin expression than the non-Cre mice.</p><p>Because the hypoadiponectinaemia may be confounding, it would be helpful to compare the BMAd-Pnpla2+/+ and BMAd-Pnpla2-/- mice with Cre-negative Pnpla2-fl/fl mice, both under AL and CR conditions.</p></disp-quote><p>We have measured circulating adiponectin concentrations and reported the data in Figure 3 —figure supplement 1V. Although BMAd-Cre mice have hypoadiponectinemia, they still respond to caloric restriction by increasing circulating adiponectin concentrations. Circulating concentrations of adiponectin at baseline and with CR are similar in BMAd-Pnpla2<sup>+/+</sup> and BMAd-Pnpla2<sup>-/-</sup> mice. Because we noticed the BMAd-Cre, per se, caused hypoadiponectinemia, all animal used for experiments were BMAd-Cre positive mice, therefore unfortunately, we don’t have any non-Cre mice with CR treatment.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Related to these considerations, in lines 576-578 you mention a few previous studies of adiponectin and bone, but the Zhu 2020 paper about adiponectin KO and CR is not cited.

It is cited in our manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>b. Analysis of diet and diet-genotype effects:</p><p>i. In Figure 3 and its supplemental figures 1 and 2 please can the data from ad libitum (AL) mice be analysed together with the data from the calorie-restricted (CR) mice? Currently the two diets are assessed separately and therefore it's not possible to detect effects of CR or if the BMAd Pnpla2 KO significantly alters these diet effects. Knowing this would be extremely informative as it may be that, while the KO alone has no effect within each diet, it might alter the CR effects. For some readouts this may also increase statistical power to detect significant effects of diet or genotype alone.</p></disp-quote><p>Our AL and CR cohorts were performed independently; we are cautious to directly combine them to present in the paper. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig2">Author response image 2</xref>, with the two-way ANOVA analysis after combining AL and CR cohorts together, the conclusions are not changed.

Related to this, in Figure 3 (supplemental figures 3 and 4), Figure 4 (and its two supplemental figures), Figure 5 (supplemental figure 2B) and Figure 6 the four genotype-diet groups are analysed side-by-side, but they are compared using 1-way ANOVA. For these figures using a 2-way (or sometimes 3-way) ANOVA is more appropriate and, as above, is required if you are to detect diet effects and genotype-diet interactions. For example, the time course data in Figure 4 supplemental figure 1C-E should be assessed by 3-way ANOVA with genotype, diet and time as the independent variables, while the data in Figure 4 and panels F-G of the supplemental figure should be assessed by 2-way ANOVA with genotype and diet as the independent variables. As above, this is important because you can then test for interactions between the variables, which might reveal KO effects that cannot be detected by 1-way ANOVA. In some cases, the 2-way ANOVA is also required to support existing statements in the results. For example, Line 303 (&quot;…mature neutrophils are affected only by CR (Figure 4H)&quot;) and Lines 307-308 (&quot;fewer granulocyte progenitor colonies (CFU-G) from CR BMAd-Pnpla2-/- mice (Figure 4I)&quot;) are not supported by any statistical analysis.</p></disp-quote><p>Original data of Figure 3 (and its supplemental figures 3 and 4), Figure 4 (and its supplemental figure 1), Figure 5 (and its supplemental figure 2B) and Figure 6 (and its supplemental figure 1), all the four genotype-diet groups have been analyzed with two-way or three-way ANOVA accordingly. Conclusions have been updated and the analytic data are included in the source data excel file. To address the two specific contexts you mention: we now have included the statement that “The recovery of neutrophils, preneutrophils, immature and mature neutrophils following irradiation was impaired by CR, and Pnpla2-deficiency further reduced ability of neutrophils and mature neutrophils to regenerate (Figure 4 E-4H).” For Figure 4I, no statistical differences were observed, thus we softened our statement for CR BMAd-Pnpla2 -/- mice to “a trend of fewer…”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>c.

In Figure 5B-C and the related supplemental figures, what's the rationale for comparing CR KO mice to AL WT mice? I think this comparison is invalid because it is being made across two independent variables. For example, if the target gene expression is similar in CR WT vs CR KO, but (e.g.) lower in AL WT vs AL KO, then the fold change vs AL WT will be similar for CR WT and CR KO, but the fold change for CR KO vs AL KO will be greater. To my mind, this would mean that the KO is altering the effect of CR, but your approach would not detect this. So, if the goal is to identify genes regulated by CR irrespective of Pnpla2 deficiency then this should be done by comparing the effects of CR within each genotype.</p></disp-quote><p>We tried to compare with the same control to make sure the baseline is the same.

The finding of impaired bone regeneration with CR and Pnpla2 KO is consistent with your conclusion, i.e. that BMAd lipolysis is important for bone regeneration. However, another interpretation relates to the findings of Ambrosi 2017, who show that BMAds impair fracture healing (Ambrosi et al., 2017). Their data suggest that BMAds can secrete DPP4 and that this impairs bone healing. Therefore, another possibility for your observation is that increased BMAT in the Pnpla2 KO mice results in increased production of DPP4 in the bone marrow, which impairs bone regeneration. Please can you measure DPP4 expression within the BM and/or discuss this possibility in the Discussion section?</p></disp-quote><p>This is an interesting point.
