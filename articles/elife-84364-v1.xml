This vascular barrier is tightly regulated and is defined by cell-cell contacts through adherens and tight junctions. To investigate the signaling that regulates vascular barrier strength, we focused on Rho GTPases, regulators of the actin cytoskeleton and known to control junction integrity. To manipulate Rho GTPase signaling in a temporal and spatial manner we applied optogenetics. Guanine-nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) domains from ITSN1, TIAM1, and p63RhoGEF, activating Cdc42, Rac, and Rho, respectively, were integrated into the optogenetic recruitment tool improved light-induced dimer (iLID). This tool allows for Rho GTPase activation at the subcellular level in a reversible and non-invasive manner by recruiting a GEF to a specific area at the plasma membrane, The membrane tag of iLID was optimized and a HaloTag was applied to gain more flexibility for multiplex imaging. The resulting optogenetically recruitable RhoGEFs (Opto-RhoGEFs) were tested in an endothelial cell monolayer and demonstrated precise temporal control of vascular barrier strength by a cell-cell overlap-dependent, VE-cadherin-independent, mechanism. Furthermore, Opto-RhoGEFs enabled precise optogenetic control in endothelial cells over morphological features such as cell size, cell roundness, local extension, and cell contraction. In conclusion, we have optimized and applied the optogenetic iLID GEF recruitment tool, that is Opto-RhoGEFs, to study the role of Rho GTPases in the vascular barrier of the endothelium and found that membrane protrusions at the junction region can rapidly increase barrier integrity independent of VE-cadherin.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>optogenetics</kwd><kwd>endothelium</kwd><kwd>VE-cadherin</kwd><kwd>Rho GTPase</kwd><kwd>vascular barrier</kwd><kwd>RhoGEF</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003246</institution-id><institution>Nederlandse Organisatie voor Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ALWOP.306</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>van Buul</surname><given-names>Jaap D</given-names></name><name><surname>Goedhart</surname><given-names>Joachim</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001826</institution-id><institution>ZonMw</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>VICI grant #91819632</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>van Buul</surname><given-names>Jaap D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Optogenetic activation of Rho GTPases provides spatiotemporal control over endothelial cell shape and enables control over endothelial barrier function by manipulating the cell-cell overlap with blue light.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The endothelium lines the inner layer of blood vessels and functions as a physical barrier between tissue and blood. However, this barrier is permeable for gases, nutrients, ions, water, and also leukocytes, with which every organ in the human body is maintained. Despite these transport processes and even transmigration of leukocytes, the endothelium keeps the vascular barrier intact. Therefore, barrier strength, controlled by cell-to-cell contacts, needs to be tightly regulated. The dysregulation of these processes is linked to pathologies such as edema, arthritis, chronic inflammation, chronic bowel disease, cancer, infections, and other conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Claesson-Welsh et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>Key elements defining the vascular barrier and permeability are the cell-cell junctions, the contact points between endothelial cells. Two types of junctions are especially important in the endothelium, namely adherens junctions, which are stable anchor points where cells attach to each other, and tight junctions, which seal off the two cell edges tightly. Regarding permeability, the transport of ions and small molecules below 800 Da happens via the tight junctions; transport of larger molecules and leukocytes across the endothelium is regulated by adherens junctions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Duong and Vestweber, 2020</xref>). Typically, linear adherens junctions show low leakage and are referred to as mature or stable adherens junctions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Angulo-Urarte et al., 2020</xref>). Homotypic VE-cadherin intercellular bonds are believed to mainly contribute to the vascular barrier strength (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Breviario et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gotsch et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">van Buul et al., 2002</xref>). VE-cadherins are the typical vascular cadherins that bind homotypically to the VE-cadherin of the neighboring cell. They exist in a protein complex, including p120, alpha, beta and gamma catenin and this complex eventually connects to the actin network via α-catenin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Angulo-Urarte et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dejana, 2004</xref>). The actin cytoskeleton does not only define the cell morphology but also influences the organization of junctions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Yamamoto et al., 2021</xref>). Increased permeability and thereby reduced vascular barrier strength is associated with altered junction organization and gap formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Claesson-Welsh et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>On a molecular level, permeability is regulated by phosphorylation of junction proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Claesson-Welsh et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Vestweber, 2021</xref>), which induce reorganization of the junctions. This phosphorylation is initiated by signaling molecules such as histamine, bradykinin, S1P, which are ligands for the GPCRs expressed in the endothelium. The GPCR-induced signaling cascades often involve Rho GTPases, which among others regulate the actin cytoskeleton and thereby junction organization as well. Other signaling modules involved are cAMP, NO, and SFK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Claesson-Welsh et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>Here, we will focus on Rho GTPases and how they can influence endothelial cell-cell junction integrity. Rho GTPases are molecular switches that are ‘ON’ when they are bound to GTP and ‘OFF’ when they are bound to GDP. In the ‘ON’ state they initiate their signaling cascade, which among other options leads to the remodeling of the actin cytoskeleton. Rho GTPases are in turn regulated by Rho guanine-nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs), which facilitate the exchange of GDP to GTP, thereby they turn the Rho GTPase on. In contrast, G-protein activating proteins enhance the intrinsic Rho GTPase hydrolysis function to hydrolyze GTP to GDP and they thereby switch off.</p><p>Active Rho GTPases are typically located at the plasma membrane, inactive once can be bound by GDP dissociation inhibitors and localize in the cytosol. Out of the 20 human Rho GTPases, RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc42 are studied most abundantly. Rho activity is associated with cell contraction and actin stress fiber formation localized at rear edge of a migrating cell and decreased vascular barrier strength, for example, induced by histamine and thrombin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Beckers et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hall, 1998</xref>). Rac1 activity is associated with lamellipodia formation and cell spreading, and Cdc42 activity with formation of filopodia both Rac1 and Cdc42 localizing at leading edge of a migrating cell and promote increased vascular barrier strength, for example, by the stimulation with S1P (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hall, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Reinhard et al., 2017</xref>). The polarization of the migrating cell shows that the activity of Rho GTPases is well defined in time and space (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Welch et al., 2011</xref>). To further illustrate there is local Rho activity present at the cleavage furrow of a dividing cell coordinating a ring of contracting actin, limited in time to the duration of cell division (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Mahlandt et al., 2021</xref>), local Rho activity was observed at the migration pore in the endothelium during leukocyte transmigration, probably restricting the pore size with an actin ring, limited in time to the duration of transmigration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Heemskerk et al., 2016</xref>), local Rac activity was observed in dorsal cell membrane ruffle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Arts et al., 2021</xref>). Additionally, Rho and Cdc42 waves were observed in <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocytes showing incredible local patterns that move quickly over time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Moe et al., 2021</xref>). However, Rho GTPase signaling can also occur in a global manner, for example during invagination in <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Izquierdo et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>It would be ideal to study the influence of Rho GTPase activity on the vascular barrier with a tool that activates Rho GTPases specifically, controllable on a global and subcellular level and in a precisely inducible and reversible manner. These requirements exclude some of the more traditionally performed experiments, such as overexpressing constitutively active or inactive mutants of different Rho proteins. With this method, cells can adapt to the increased level of Rho GTPase activity, it is inducible within hours and not reversible and no subcellular activation can be achieved. The famous experiment of microinjecting constitutively active Rho GTPases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hall, 1998</xref>) shows the immediate cellular reaction induced by active Rho proteins. It is induced immediately but also lacks the subcellular activation and it is not possible to globally activate an entire monolayer of cells. Furthermore, there are many inhibitors and stimulators available to regulate Rho GTPase signaling, for example histamine, thrombin both Rho activators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Mahlandt et al., 2021</xref>), sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P), a Rac, Rho and Cdc42 activator (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Reinhard et al., 2017</xref>), bradykinin, a Cdc42 activator (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Martinez Quiles et al., 2001</xref>). Most of these are ligands for GPCRs, meaning they may induce a branch of signaling cascades including the Rho GTPase but also other pathways. Some of these might be specific for one Rho GTPase but other may regulate multiple signaling pathways. They are usually added to the medium of cells and thereby act globally on all the cells, not allowing subcellular activation. They potentially need incubation time and are mostly irreversible unless an antagonist is available.</p><p>Another method is the rapamycin heterodimerization system. This system utilizes the GEF catalytic active DHPH domains, by recruiting them to the plasma membrane, the natural location of Rho GTPases, where GDP for GTP exchange takes place. This method requires two proteins that have low binding affinity in the absence of rapamycin and high binding affinity in its presence. One component called the FRB protein (<bold>F</bold>KB12 and <bold>R</bold>apamycin <bold>B</bold>inding domain) is targeted to the plasma membrane and functions as ‘bait’. Its FRB-binding partner, FKBP12 (<bold>FK</bold>506 <bold>B</bold>inding <bold>p</bold>rotein with a mass of <bold>12</bold> kDa), is called the ‘prey’ and is fused to the active domain of a GEF that is present in the cytosol. Once rapamycin is added, it instantly binds to FKBP12. The FKPB12-rapamycin complex has a high binding affinity for FRB and by binding, it is relocated from the cytosol to the plasma membrane, that is, the location of FRB. Hence, the prey binds the bait, resulting in GEF activity at the plasma membrane and local activation of the matching Rho GTPase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Rossman et al., 2005</xref>). However, it needs to be stressed that rapamycin is not without side effects in a human cell, but in fact is involved in the mTOR pathway and hence may affect this pathway as well, upon exogenous addition.</p><p>To circumvent these issues, an optogenetic heterodimerization tool can be used with the same principle. This tool allows reversible light-induced activation on a scale from a global to subcellular level. Optogenetics is the genetic modification with light sensitive proteins. A number of optogenetic tools with the ability to recruit to the plasma membrane are available: BcLOV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Glantz et al., 2018</xref>), Cry2+CIB1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kennedy et al., 2010</xref>), improved light-induced dimer (iLID) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Guntas et al., 2015</xref>), enhanced Magnets (eMags) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Benedetti et al., 2020</xref>), PhyB/PiF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Levskaya et al., 2009</xref>), and more can be found on the OptoBase website (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kolar et al., 2018</xref>). For iLID and PhyB/PiF, it has been shown that the optogenetic recruitment of TIAM-1 and ITSN can be used to trigger Rho GTPase activity and thereby induce cell extension (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Guntas et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Levskaya et al., 2009</xref>). Also BcLOV has been used to manipulate Rho GTPase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Berlew et al., 2022</xref>) as well as CRY2/CIB1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Izquierdo et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>For this study, iLID and enhanced Magnets (eMags)-based optogenetic tools were chosen because they can be activated locally and globally, are fast inducible and reversible, relatively small in size, which is of advantage for lentiviral packing, do not require co-factor addition to the cell medium, and can be targeted to a cellular structure of choice. Cry2+CIBN was excluded because of its clustering properties and its relatively limited local activation ability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Benedetti et al., 2018</xref>). Phytochrome-based heterodimerization tools were excluded because of the necessity to add a co-factor. LOV domain-based tools require the co-factor flavin mononucleotide (FMN) or flavin adenine dinucleotide, which are present in cell growth medium. BcLOV was excluded because it intrinsically targets the plasma membrane, so in a follow-up the bait location could not be changed.</p><p>We aimed to optimize and test an optogenetic tool to activate Rho GTPases, reversibly, globally, and on a subcellular level, in endothelial cell monolayers to study vascular barrier strength. Therefore, kinetics and recruitment efficiency of iLID and eMags were compared. Subsequently, iLID was chosen to create optogenetically recruitable RhoGEFs (Opto-RhoGEFs) namely, TIAM1(DHPH), ITSN1(DHPH), and RhoGEFp63(DH), respectively, activating the Rho GTPases Rac, Cdc42, and Rho. The membrane tag of the original iLID was changed to an optimized anchor. In addition, we modified the sequence of the domains to SspB, tag, GEF to simplify the exchange of GEF and genetically encoded tag. A set of plasmids with different fluorescent tags was created for more flexibility in co-imaging. Endothelial cell lines, stably expressing Opto-RhoGEFs, were generated and showed precisely activatable and reversible control over vascular barrier strength, measured in real time using ECIS (electrical cell-substrate impedance sensing) technology. The use of a VE-cadherin blocking antibody thereby functionally blocking VE-cadherin revealed that the Opto-RhoGEF TIAM1 and ITSN1 promoted endothelial barrier strength in a VE-cadherin-independent manner. Detailed imaging suggested that the increase in barrier is induced by an increase in cell-cell membrane overlap at junction regions. These data show the potential of Opto-RhoGEFs to change the cell morphology, that is contraction and extension, globally as well as locally.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Characterizing and optimizing an optogenetic RhoGEF recruitment tool</title><p>To study the role of Rho GTPases in an endothelial cell model in a time and space defined manner, mimicking the natural Rho GTPase activity, heterodimerization tools for guanine exchange factor recruitment were compared. Targeting of GEFs to the plasma membrane is an effective way of activating Rho GTPases. The targeting can be achieved by light or chemical induction of heterodimerization. Here, we compared optogenetic heterodimerization tools to the chemical heterodimerization system that uses rapamycin. The optogenetic heterodimerization tools ‘iLID’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Guntas et al., 2015</xref>) and ‘eMags’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Benedetti et al., 2020</xref>) were selected because of their fast on/off kinetics, size, potential to be targeted to other subcellular locations in the cell rather than the plasma membrane, using FMN as co-factor, which is naturally present in human cells, and potential for local activation. HeLa cells were used for the tool optimization because of easier handling and higher transfection rate in comparison to endothelial cells.</p><p>First, the on/off kinetics and the recruitment efficiency of the recruitment systems were compared in HeLa cells, expressing either the rapamycin system, Lck-FRB T2098L-mTurquoise-IRES-sYFP2xNES-FKBP1, or the iLID system, mVenus-iLID-CaaX and SspB-mScarlet-I, or the eMags system, eMagA-EGFP-CaaX and eMagB-TagRFP, stimulated either with 488 nm laser light or the chemical rapamycin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). The t<sub>½</sub> ON and OFF kinetics were obtained by fitting a mono-exponential model to the data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A and B</xref>). eMags showed the shortest t<sub>½</sub> ON kinetics with 3.97 s and the fastest t<sub>½</sub> OFF kinetics with 18.6 s. However, the mean efficiency of the recruitment measured by normalized membrane to cytosol intensity ratio was with 1.5 the lowest. The iLID system showed comparable t<sub>½</sub> ON kinetics of 5.14 s and t<sub>½</sub> OFF kinetics of 20.3 s and it had a higher mean recruitment efficiency. The rapamycin system showed a longer t<sub>½</sub> ON kinetics of 43.1 s, which may partly be explained by the different type of activation, as the rapamycin was added to the medium and needed to diffuse into the cell. The t <sub>½</sub> OFF kinetics was not determined as rapamycin-induced recruitment is irreversible at the time scales used. The rapamycin system showed the highest recruitment efficiency with a normalized membrane to cytosol intensity ratio above 3.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Optimization of an optogenetic recruitment tool.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Normalized membrane to cytosol intensity ratio for the rapamycin system (green) HeLa cells expressing Lck-FRB-T2098L-mTurquoise-IRES-sYFP2xNES-FKBP12, for the improved light-induced dimer (iLID) system (purple) expressing Venus-iLID-CaaX and SspB-mScarlet-I and for the enhanced Magnets (eMags) system (blue) expressing eMagA-EGFP-CaaX and eMagB-tagRFP stimulated with either 100 nM rapamycin (indicated by gray bar) or 488 nm laser light (indicated by cyan bar).

(<bold>E</bold>) Schematic of the light-induced heterodimerization of iLID. Upon photo-activation the Ja helix in the iLID unfolds, SsrA becomes available for binding by SspB which is recruited from the cytosol to the location of SsrA, which is localized at the plasma membrane. The guanine-nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) fused to the SspB activates the Rho GPTase at the plasma membrane, which is binding GTP and thereby activates its signaling cascade. That results in the remodeling of the actin cytoskeleton and change in cell morphology. The combination of fluorescent markers and GEFs fused to SspB in this study is indicated in the bottom.

The sensor consists of the pleckstrin homology (PH) domain of Akt1 and mCherry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kontos et al., 1998</xref>). It binds PI(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub> and thereby localizes to the plasma membrane, which can be measured as an intensity change. The intensity change of Akt-PH at the plasma membrane upon iSH2 recruitment was compared for the iLID, eMags, and the rapamycin system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B and C</xref>). The rapamycin system showed the highest sensor localization at the plasma membrane with a median of 14% change in the membrane to cytosol intensity ratio and iLID showed a median change of 6.4%. Unexpectedly, activation of eMags showed no change in the intensity of the PI(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub> biosensor. This finding may be explained by the low recruitment efficiency observed for eMags (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). This low recruitment efficiency in turn influences the biosensor response, since there appeared to be a correlation between high recruitment efficiency of the iSH domain and relocation of the biosensor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>).</p><p>At this point the iLID system was chosen, because the recruitment efficiency was robust and higher than for eMags and kinetics, even though slightly slower, were in the same range as for the eMags. Although the rapamycin system showed the highest recruitment efficiency and thereby the larger biological response of the biosensor, it lacks the reversibility and subcellular activation of an optogenetics system. However, should these properties not be required in an experiment, then the rapamycin is a robust and efficient heterodimerization tool.</p><p>Next, the membrane tag of iLID was tested to improve recruitment efficiency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). As suggested in a previous study, an N-terminal membrane tag is more beneficial than a C-terminal tag (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Natwick and Collins, 2021</xref>). The conventional C-terminal CaaX tag was compared to the N-terminal Lck tag. iLID tagged to the plasma membrane with Lck showed at higher median change in cytosolic intensity with 36.7%. The mean change in cytosolic intensity for the CaaX-tagged iLID was 25.5%; also its variance was larger compared to the Lck tag. Thus, iLID tagged with Lck showed improved recruitment efficiency, when compared with the CaaX box. Therefore, Lck-mTurquoise2-iLID was used as a bait in the remainder of the work.</p><p>To create a set of Opto-RhoGEFs with flexibility in the spectral window, we tagged SspB, serving as a ‘prey’, with the HaloTag, mCherry, or iRFP670. Three GEFs were selected, ITSN1, TIAM1, and RhoGEFp63, which are known to specifically activate respectively Cdc42, Rac, and Rho and their isoforms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Their catalytic active DHPH domains were used for ITSN1 and TIAM1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Reinhard, 2019</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Reinhard et al., 2021</xref>). In case of p63 only the DH domain was used, because the PH domain of p63 inhibits the GEF activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">van Unen et al., 2015</xref>; ). Throughout the following text, the co-expression of Lck-mTurquoise2-iLID with either SspB-fluorescent tag-ITSN1(DHPH), SspB-fluorescent tag-TIAM1(DHPH), or SspB-fluorescent tag-RhoGEFp63(DH) will be referred to as OptoITSN, OptoTIAM, and OptoP63.</p><p>To test the specific activation of the Rho GTPases by Opto-RhoGEFs, single-color relocation sensors were applied, as they are compatible with the blue/green light absorption spectrum occupied by the LOV domain. The Rho sensor HaloTag-3xrGBD showed a clear relocation to the plasma membrane upon photo-activation of OptoP63, measured by fluorescent intensity decrease in the cytosol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). The recruitment of OptoP63 is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E</xref>. The Cdc42 sensor dimericTomato-wGBD showed relocation to the plasma membrane upon photo-activation of OptoITSN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). The recruitment of OptoITSN to the plasma membrane and consequently reduced presence in the cytosol is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1F</xref>. No Rac1 sensor was available with a read-out that is compatible with optogenetics and with a dynamic range sensitive enough to measure the Rac1 activation upon OptoTIAM recruitment. TIAM1 has been identified as a specific Rac GEF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Müller et al., 2020</xref>) and we observed for Rac activity expected cell spreading (Figure 4). The location-based sensors indicated that upon photo-activation OptoP63 triggered Rho activation at the plasma membrane, whereas OptoITSN triggered Cdc42 activity at the plasma membrane.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Influence of Opto-RhoGEFs on permeability and barrier strength in endothelial cell monolayers</title><p>Endothelial cells line blood vessels and form the barrier between blood and tissue, but this barrier is semi-permeable, for example, for nutrients, oxygen, and leukocytes. The barrier function can be studied in a cell culture model, where endothelial cells grow in a monolayer. This model was used to test the effect of Opto-RhoGEFs on the vascular barrier, using several functional read-outs. To study the endothelial monolayer barrier function, endothelial cell lines, stably expressing Opto-RhoGEFs, were generated. Therefore, cord blood outgrowth endothelial cells (cBOECs) were treated with lentivirus to stably express Lck-mTurquiose2-iLID and either SspB-HaloTag-TIAM1(DHPH), SspB-HaloTag-ITSN1(DHPH), or SspB-HaloTag-p63RhoGEF(DH).</p><p>These experiments required photo-activation of large fields of endothelial monolayers, which could not be achieved at the microscope, as only a limited field of view can be illuminated. Therefore, a commercially available LED strip was used. The blue light setting on the LED strip had an emission peak ranging from 450 nm to 500 nm wavelength (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>). The light power density for the blue LED in its brightest setting was 9.4×10<sup>–2</sup> W/m<sup>2</sup>, in comparison to the 442 nm laser at 1% intensity it was 8.58×10<sup>6</sup> W/m<sup>2</sup> and to the 488 nm laser, at 20% laser power, 1% intensity, it was 1.7×10<sup>7</sup> W/m<sup>2</sup>. These values are not directly comparable to the photo-activation, as the LEDs illuminated the whole field of view continuously and the lasers scanned the area unidirectional at 400 Hz at the set frame interval. To test if the blue LED could be used for photo-activation, the same set of HeLa cells expressing Lck-mTurquoise2-iLID and SspB-mScarlet-I was exposed to either the blue LED light or laser light (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>). The photo-activation with blue LED light was sufficient to induce the heterodimerization of the iLID system. However, the photo-activation with laser light resulted in a more complete heterodimerization. Subsequently, LEDs were set to the brightest setting and used for photo-activation of full endothelial monolayers in incubators.</p><p>A permeability assay was performed, to study if the photo-activation of OptoTIAM changed the endothelial monolayer permeability. Therefore, BOECs stably expressing Lck-mTurquoise2-iLID and SspB-HaloTag-TIAM1(DHPH) or control cells expressing only Lck-mTurquoise2-iLID were grown into a monolayer in a Transwell dish on a polycarbonate membrane. This membrane, with the monolayer of endothelial cells on it, separated the top and the bottom compartment. To measure permeability of the endothelial cell monolayer, fluorescent dye, namely FITC, coupled to dextran of different kDa sizes was added to the top compartment and the fluorescence intensity is measured in the bottom compartment. Here, the permeability was measured after 10 min of incubation with FITC dextran either in the presence of blue light or in the dark. For three different particle sizes, namely 0.3 kDa, 10 kDa, 70 kDa, 10 min blue light-activated OptoTIAM endothelial cell monolayers showed the lowest permeability in comparison to OptoTIAM-expressing endothelial cell monolayers that were kept in the dark or photo-activated control monolayers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>).

Therefore, BOECs stably expressing Lck-mTurquoise2-iLID and either SspB-HaloTag-TIAM(DHPH), SspB-HaloTag-ITSN(DHPH), or SspB-HaloTag-p63(DH) were grown as monolayers on ECIS electrode arrays. BOECs, only expressing Lck-mTurquoise2-iLID, were used as control. Cells were stimulated in the ECIS incubator with the blue LED light, as described above. OptoTIAM-expressing cells showed an increase in resistance after 1 min of activation with blue light, which is fully reversible within seconds. When activating for 10 min, the increase in resistance reached a maximum level. To study fatigue a sequential activation of 15 min was performed three times. Interestingly, during this period, the cellular system did not show any fatigue. Even when the endothelial cells were activated for 2 hr, the maximum resistance level did not show any drop, but as soon as photo-activation was stopped, the resistance decreased drastically within seconds. The control cells, only expressing the iLID part of the system, did not respond to the blue light with a change in resistance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4A</xref>). The resistance of the OptoITSN-expressing endothelial cells showed a similar pattern in comparison to the OptoTIAM cells but with a smaller amplitude, indicating that Cdc42 activation did not increase endothelial resistance to the same extent as Rac did. However, this monolayer reached maximum resistance at approximately 5 min. When OptoITSN cells were photo-activated for longer than 10 min the resistance started to decrease slightly but did not return to baseline. During the sequential three times 15 min photo-activation, the resistance increase was slightly smaller with each activation for the OptoITSN cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4A</xref>).</p><p>OptoP63 cells showed a dip in resistance when activated for 1 min. The resistance of the monolayer returned to baseline within minutes. When activated for longer than 10 min, the resistance started to recover to baseline, even so the cells were still photo-activated. When the OptoP63 cells are activated for 2 hr, the initial drop in resistance recovers to a value above the baseline level before the activation. In addition to that, after the photo-activation period, the resistance did increase even further (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4A</xref>).</p><p>When studying the entire resistance curve, OptoITSN and OptoTIAM cells run at a higher resistance than the control cells in the first 12 hr of the experiment. After the 12 hr time point, control and OptoTIAM cells run at the same median resistance where OptoITSN cells continue to run above the control cell resistance. OptoP63 cells seem to run below the resistance of control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4A</xref>). This might be indicating that there is a basal activity of the GEFs being overexpressed in the cytosol. However, the cells can clearly still be activated by recruitment of these GEFs to the plasma membrane. Furthermore, the cells can still be photo-activated after 40 hr of seeding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4B</xref>).</p><p>To put the resistance changes in context, it was compared to a strong activator of the barrier function, S1P. The amplitude of resistance increase induced by OptoTIAM and OptoITSN is in a similar range as the S1P-induced resistance increase.

For OptoTIAM cells it appeared that there was a slight decrease in dynamics during the activation, in comparison to the pre-activation frames, but there appeared to be an increase in dynamics in the period right after activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>). In this recovery phase after photo-activation, there was also a dip in the resistance measurement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>), which may be explained with the remodeling of the monolayer after photo-activation, including the movement of the junctions. For OptoITSN cells there is no clear change in junction dynamics upon photo-activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Looking at OptoP63 cells there is a clear increase in junction dynamics upon photo-activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>). It appears that higher junction dynamics occurred when resistance measurements are lower. Therefore, higher junction dynamics might explain the dip in resistance after photo-activation for OptoTIAM cells and the dip in resistance upon photo-activation for OptoP63 cells. However, there is no clear decrease in junction dynamics upon photo-activation for OptoTIAM and OptoITSN cells to explain the observed resistance increase.</p><p>It was attempted to quantify more junction properties with the ‘Junction Mapper’ software (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Brezovjakova et al., 2019</xref>). However, the intensity changes over time in the time-lapse acquired in this study, with directly labeling antibody present in the medium throughout the experiment, made intensity-based measurements incomparable for different time points. Therefore, these measurements were not informative and not presented here.</p><p>To further explore which role the junctions play in the vascular barrier strength increase triggered by GEFs, it was investigated how the monolayer responded to Opto-RhoGEF activation in the absence of VE-cadherin junctions. Therefore, a VE-cadherin blocking antibody was used. Opto-RhoGEFs and control cells were grown into a monolayer on an ECIS array and treated with VE-cadherin blocking antibody. The VE-cadherin blocking antibody caused the homodimeric bonds to break between the VE-cadherins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video7">Animation 7</xref><xref ref-type="video" rid="video7">Animation 7</xref>). Previous work has shown the specific blocking effect of this antibody in comparison to the VE-cadherin (55-7H1) labeling antibody (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kroon et al., 2014</xref>). The VE-cadherin blocking antibody lowered the resistance in all conditions, which dropped to a stable level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2A</xref>). Subsequently, the cells were photo-activated and for OptoTIAM and OptoITSN, an increase in resistance was measured comparable to the control conditions without the VE-cadherin blocking antibody. The amplitude of resistance appeared to be the same. OptoP63 showed a decrease in resistance, but the drop is not more severe in the presence of VE-cadherin blocking antibody. The VE-cadherin blocking antibody was washed out and the resistance returned to baseline matching the control condition. Subsequently, both conditions were photo-activated and showed a response that was similar between the two conditions. This suggests that the entire system is reversible with respect to the antibody treatment and optogenetic manipulation. In parallel to the ECIS experiment, cells were seeded for microscopy at the same density and treated with the VE-cadherin blocking antibody. The junctions looked more diffuse in the treated conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video8">Animation 8</xref>—<xref ref-type="video" rid="video15">15</xref><xref ref-type="video" rid="video8">Animation 8</xref>—<xref ref-type="video" rid="video15">15</xref>).

Therefore, these cells appeared rounder. This was quantified by calculating the form factor (form factor 1 is a perfect circle), which confirmed the observation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1C</xref>). In contrast, OptoP63 cells contracted and were less round (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1C</xref>).</p><p>Following the cell area over time during photo-activation showed that OptoTIAM and OptoITSN increased the cell area (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). Cells expressing OptoTIAM increased about 15% in size and reached the maximum at 10 min photo-activation. In comparison, OptoITSN expressing cells reached the cell area maximum of 10% after roughly 3 min and after that the cell area slightly decreased during the photo-activation. After photo-activation both OptoTIAM and OptoITSN expressing cells decreased rapidly in cell area below the baseline (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). The opposite effect was observed for OptoP63 expressing cells, they started decreasing in cell area after about 1 min of photo-activation and reached a minimum of roughly 40% cell area decrease at 7 min. After this time point the OptoP63 expressing cells already recovered and increased in size, even though they were still photo-activated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). Following the cell area of control cells over time showed fluctuation in cell area but on average they stayed the same size (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). A larger pool of cells was analyzed for three time points, confirming the findings of the cell size over time measurements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>). In conclusion, photo-activation of Opto-RhoGEFs controls cell size to a certain extent. A study using the rapamycin system to recruit the DHPH domain of TIAM1 and the DH domain of p63RhoGEF in endothelial cells found similar changes in cell area, about 15% increase for TIAM1 recruitment and about 25% decrease for p63RhoGEF recruitment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Reinhard et al., 2017</xref>). Even though the rapamycin showed a higher recruitment efficiency the iLID system seems able to induce the maximal cellular response.</p><p>Actin fibers define the morphology of the cell and actin polymerization is the driving force of cellular movement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Noda et al., 2010</xref>), therefore the Opto-RhoGEF cells were stained for F-actin to study changes in actin structures upon photo-activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video16">Animation 16</xref>—<xref ref-type="video" rid="video19">19</xref><xref ref-type="video" rid="video16">Animation 16</xref>—<xref ref-type="video" rid="video19">19</xref>). For the control, actin fibers are visible at the cell edge, in an orientation parallel to the edge. In the OptoTIAM cells, the actin fibers parallel to the cell edge seemed to disassemble during activation and areas of cell expansions showed no thick actin fibers. Areas with actin fibers perpendicular to the cell edge rather showed slight contraction instead of cell spreading. Also, OptoITSN cells showed less dense actin structures in the extending areas of the activated cell. OptoP63 cells showed actin fibers clustering together during cell contraction upon photo-activation. During recovery, the new cell edges also showed very little actin staining. It needs to be noted that we used SiR-actin to stain the actin cytoskeleton. SiR-actin supposedly stains more mature actin structures, which might underrepresent the newly polymerized actin structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Simao et al., 2021</xref>).</p><media mimetype="video" mime-subtype="gif" id="video16" xlink:href="elife-84364-animation16-v1.gif"><label>Animation 16.</label><caption><title>Confocal microscopy time-lapse of a blood outgrowth endothelial cell (BOEC) stably expressing Lck-mTurquoise2-iLID (not shown), solely as control.</title><p>Additionally, stained for F-actin with SiR-actin.

To this end, the cell area change of subconfluent cells, upon activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>), and the vascular barrier strength upon activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>) were compared and showed a correlation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2A and B</xref>). This supports the idea that the increased endothelial membrane overlaps at junction regions by itself resulted in increased resistance, assuming that cell spreading in a monolayer increases overlap.</p><p>To further investigate this, OptoTIAM cells in a monolayer were stained with PECAM1, an endothelial cell-specific adhesion molecule that has been observed in overlapping protrusions. We indeed observed PECAM1 prominently present at endothelial membrane overlaps. Upon activation, the PECAM1-positive area increased and colocalized with the areas with increased intensity in the OptoTIAM channel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2C</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video20">Animation 20</xref><xref ref-type="video" rid="video20">Animation 20</xref>). Thus, the OptoTIAM channel could also be used to make an estimate of overlap, as the PECAM1 intensity increased where two cells overlap. However, this only works if the cells have roughly the same intensity. The intensity range was too heterogeneous in this dataset to analyze the entire monolayer in the field of view, but example images are shown. Within the first 2 min of activation, the time it takes for the barrier strength to increase at least the halftime point, the OptoTIAM cells showed increased overlap but no clear change in VE-cadherin staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2D, E, and F</xref>; <xref ref-type="video" rid="video4">Animation 4</xref>). Studying the subconfluent monolayer, the activation of OptoTIAM increased the area covered by the cells, through the closure of gaps in the monolayer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2G</xref>). The cells covered the gaps first with membrane, there was a clear cell extension after 2 min but no new junctions are formed yet (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2H</xref>).

The vascular barrier integrity is challenged on a subcellular level by, for example, transmigration of leukocytes but also on a global level, for example during chronic inflammation. Here, we apply an optogenetic tool with the unique ability to reversibly induce spatially and temporally defined Rho GTPase activity to explore its potential in studying vascular barrier strength and morphology of endothelial cells. The iLID optogenetic heterodimerization tool was chosen to recruit catalytic active domains of GEFs, the activators of Rho GTPases, to the plasma membrane, where they induce activity of specific Rho GTPases. Endothelial cells lines were generated expressing Lck-mTurquoise2-iLID and either SspB-HaloTag-TIAM1(DHPH), -ITSN1(DHPH), or -p63RhoGEF(DH) to activate Rac, Cdc42, and Rho respectively. Resistance measurements in monolayers revealed precisely inducible and reversible increase in vascular barrier strength for Rac and Cdc42 activation and a decrease in Rho activation, illustrating the temporal control of the optogenetics tool. To the best of our knowledge this is the first time optogenetic control over vascular barrier strength is being reported. To further study the Rho GTPase, induced cellular processes resulting in changed vascular barrier strength, microscopy, and a VE-cadherin blocking antibody experiment were performed. Surprisingly, while the main protein of adherens junction, that is VE-cadherin homotypic interactions, was blocked, the vascular barrier strength could still be changed by the optogenetic recruitment of GEFs. Additionally, the microscopy experiments suggested a contribution of cell-cell membrane overlap to the vascular barrier strength, while no clear changes in junction appearance were observed on the same time scale. Furthermore, we demonstrate whole cell and subcellular control over endothelial cell morphology, showcasing the spatial control of the optogenetic tool.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Optogenetic tool setup</title><p>During the setup of the optogenetically recruitable GEFs we made a number of noteworthy observations. When comparing the two optogenetic heterodimerization tools iLID and eMags we found that iLID had a higher recruitment efficiency. Another study finds recruitment efficiency values in the same range but with a slightly higher recruitment efficiency for magnets, the progenitor of eMags, in comparison to iLID (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Benedetti et al., 2018</xref>). In our study the recruitment efficiency of eMags was hampered when the iSH domain was fused to its C-terminus, consequently eMags did not induce the signaling pathway efficiently. However, another study did create a functional C-terminal fusion proteins with eMags, and magnets have been successfully applied in recruiting the iSH domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Benedetti et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kawano et al., 2015</xref>). Hence, the approach appears feasible but requires some optimization, potentially the linkers. Furthermore, a correlation between recruitment efficiency and the biological response was observed, therefore the tool should be optimized for recruitment efficiency. The chemically induced rapamycin heterodimerization tool had by far the highest recruitment efficiency, however it lacks the fast reversibility and the subcellular inducibility, but it can be applied when global signaling induction is required. Another option is the BcLOV system that intrinsically gets recruited to the plasma membrane when activated by light and a tool box for GEF recruitment has been optimized recently (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Berlew et al., 2022</xref>). However, this elegant one-component system is temperature-dependent and therefore does not allow sustained activation at 37°C and does not allow the choice of other targets, other than the plasma membrane for follow-up studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Benman et al., 2022</xref>). We continued to work with the iLID tool and could improve its recruitment efficiency by using the Lck membrane tag instead of the CaaX box as a previous study suggested (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Natwick and Collins, 2021</xref>). Furthermore, we introduced the HaloTag to the system and labeled the mobile prey component with it. The HaloTag can be stained in living cells prior to imaging, which allows flexibility in the choice of a fluorophore and the far dyes are magnitudes brighter than far red fluorescent proteins, improving the image quality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Grimm et al., 2015</xref>). We also found single-color location-based biosensors for Rho GTPase activity valuable to verify the Rho GTPase activation, as the common CFP-YFP FRET pair, which most biosensors utilize, is not compatible with the iLID tool, which is activated in the same excitation spectrum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Mahlandt et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>Previous studies have used optogenetically recruitable GEFs for Rho GTPase activity as a proof of principle experiment in single cells to show local cell morphology changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Berlew et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Guntas et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Levskaya et al., 2009</xref>). In a cell collective optogenetic recruitment of GEFs to induce Rho activity has been applied in the epithelium of <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Herrera-Perez et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Izquierdo et al., 2018</xref>) but the potential of optogentic GEF recruitment has not been explored in the endothelium yet. Here, we demonstrate the impact of optogentic GEF recruitment in an entire monolayer and its influence on vascular barrier strength. The observed increase and decrease in vascular barrier strength induced by Opto-RhoGEFs is in line with previous research. OptoTIAM and OptoITSN activation increased barrier strength, as expected for Rac and Cdc42 activation previously shown by S1P induction, and also for photo-activated Rac1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Klems et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Reinhard et al., 2017</xref>). On the cell morphology level OptoTIAM induced protrusions and increased cell area, as expected for Rac activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hall, 1998</xref>). However, Cdc42 activation through OptoITSN did not induce the formation of filopodia as could be expected from previous research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hall, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Ridley, 2015</xref>) but we observed cell spreading and ruffling and the same was observed for rapamycin-induced ITSN1(DHPH) recruitment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Reinhard, 2019</xref>). Potentially, other signals than solely Cdc42 activity are required in endothelial cells to induce filopodia, which could be mediated by other domains of the GEF or a complex, as we apply only on the DHPH domain. Rho activation through OptoP63 decreases the vascular barrier strength as has been observed before for thrombin-induced Rho activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Birukova et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Reinhard et al., 2016</xref>). OptoP63-induced Rho activation caused stress fiber formation and cell contraction as reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hall, 1998</xref>). Previous studies lack the reversibility of the Opto-RhoGEF activation. We could observe the effect of the immediate stop of the induction of Rho GTPase activity, and noticed an immediate change in resistance after photo-activation independent of the activation length. This fast reversibility is unique to optogenetic tools and gives the opportunity to study the regulation of Rho GTPase activity in time.</p><p>Additionally, the fast reversibility might enable the study of the balance between activity of different Rho GTPases. Here, we observed the resistance dropping below baseline after photo-activation for OptoTIAM-expressing monolayers. Potentially, it is the balance between Rac and Rho signaling that is disturbed during the abrupt stop of Rac activation causing cell contraction because the balance is tilting toward Rho activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Burridge and Wennerberg, 2004</xref>). However, the cells adapt quickly, likely restoring the Rac/Rho activity balance and thereby the vascular barrier strength returns to baseline levels. Interestingly, during photo-activation the resistance did plateau at a level above baseline and was not get downregulated by the reestablishment of the Rac/Rho balance. Also, the OptoP63-induced resistance decrease was counteracted, the endothelial monolayer restored the vascular barrier strength during photo-activation, suggesting the cells could restore the Rac/Rho balance. Similar observations were made for the induced changes in cell area. For example, OptoP63 induced a dramatic cell size decrease but cells start to recover already during the activation. This shows the ability of a cell to adjust to a stimulus, and make a clear case for rapidly inducible systems like Opto-RhoGEFs to study effects in real time. On one hand, we were able to globally activate the entire monolayers on a centimeter scale in the ECIS and permeability assay with LEDs, while minimally disturbing the cells. This minimized the chance of introducing an artifact during the activation. On the other hand, we induced lamellipodia on a subcellular level with the FRAP unit at the confocal microscope on a micrometer scale. No other technique but optogenetics combines the fast reversibility, the local to global activatibility, and non-invasive activation with light. In combination with Rho GTPase activity biosensors the reversibility of the Opto-RhoGEFs provides the opportunity to study the balance between the activity of different Rho GTPases. The simultaneous application of different GEFs, individually activatable, would enable researchers to mimic the orchestra of Rho GTPase signaling better.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Vascular barrier strength</title><p>To understand vascular barrier strength most studies focus on the junctions. However, multiple factors contribute to the vascular barrier strength, namely adherens junctions, tight junctions, focal adhesions, and potentially also cell-cell overlap. Vascular barrier studies often use knockdowns or overexpression, which the cells can adapt to, and stimuli that need to be added to the medium, causing disturbance in the ECIS resistance curve (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Birukova et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Birukova et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Tian et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Applying Opto-RhoGEFs in endothelial monolayers we found clues that the Rho GTPase-mediated cell-cell overlap plays a bigger role in vascular barrier strength than previously anticipated. Vascular barrier strength research is presenting VE-cadherin as the central player (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Corada et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Radeva and Waschke, 2018</xref>). We showed that Opto-RhoGEF-induced Rho GTPase activity alters vascular barrier strength while VE-cadherin homotypic interactions are blocked with a blocking antibody. This effect is reversible within minutes and we observed cell-cell overlap and cell area change on that time scale in our time-lapse movies. Ideally, we would have quantified cell-cell overlap in the monolayer over time but the contrast in the images did not allow for reliable segmentation. This could be solved by mosaic expression of two different fluorophores in the monolayer. We could also not find a reliable way to measure junction properties, except for the linearity factor. Changing fluorescent intensity during the time-lapse movie and too low resolution made it challenging to measure junction properties in a quantitative manner. Junction Mapper is a good initiative to standardize junction analysis but it is not feasible for high throughput and relies on intensity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Brezovjakova et al., 2019</xref>). To further investigate the role of VE-cadherin, biosensors could be applied for example to monitor the phosphorylation state, as the phenotype imaged by a simple VE-cadherin stain might not reveal all the changes that influence the barrier strength.</p><p>The application of the VE-cadherin blocking antibody showed clearly that the VE-cadherin plays a role in vascular barrier strength, however the activation of Opto-RhoGEFs still altered the barrier strength in these conditions. We found that cell-cell overlap changes on the same time scale as the vascular barrier strength suggesting it is the cell-cell overlap that mediated the vascular barrier strength increase. The VE-cadherin state seems to influence the baseline of vascular barrier strength but not the amplitude by which it can be increased by the Opto-RhoGEFs. Another study has found that S1P treatment increased the vascular barrier strength while VE-cadherin heterodimerization was hampered with either EGTA, blocking antibody or siRNA and it was suggested that lamellipodia increase the vascular barrier strength (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Xu et al., 2007</xref>). Moreover, not only S1P promotes endothelial barrier independent from VE-cadherin, also Tie-2 can increase barrier resistance in the absence of VE-cadherin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Frye et al., 2015</xref>). Additionally, lamellipodia have been recognized to increase vascular barrier strength and the localization of TIAM1 to the plasma membrane is associated with actin dynamics that seal intercellular gaps (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Birukova et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Breslin et al., 2015</xref>). However, S1P is also known to activate Rac and Cc42 signaling, stabilizing VE-cadherin complexes and thereby promoting barrier function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lee et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Reinhard et al., 2017</xref>). It has been found that VE-cadherin increasingly localizes at junctions after 10 min of S1P treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Xu et al., 2007</xref>). This increase would not explain the rapid increase in barrier strength within minutes that we observed. Nevertheless, S1P also increases cell size potentially leading to cell-cell overlap in a monolayer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Endo et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Reinhard et al., 2017</xref>). It has been hypothesized that lamellipodia-induced cell-cell overlap proceeds the adherens junction assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Jaffe and Hall, 2005</xref>). Moreover, junction-associated intermittent lamellipodia have been observed at locations of jagged unstable VE-cadherin junctions, facilitating the maturation of adherens junctions, thereby maintaining the vascular barrier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abu Taha et al., 2014</xref>). This suggests that the relatively stable VE-cadherin junctions are complemented by dynamic lamellipodia to establish and maintain barrier integrity. Our data supports the idea that cell-cell overlap is required and already increases the barrier strength and in combination with intact VE-cadherin junctions it results in an even higher barrier strength. It would be interesting to closely examine the contribution of cell-cell overlap to the vascular barrier strength. Rac activity has been directly related to lamellipodia formation, hence increasing the cell-cell overlap. Cdc42 activity, however, has been associated with filopodia formation, which does not contribute much to the cell-cell overlap (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hall, 1998</xref>). Nevertheless, we observed a vascular barrier strength increase upon Cdc42 activation, if this increase was cell-cell overlap-mediated it could be explained by recently described lamellipodia-like structures induced by Cdc42 in the absence of the WAVE regulation complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kage et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p>In conclusion, junctions do play a role in vascular barrier strength. This was shown by the blocking antibody decreasing the barrier strength. However, another cell property is still able to increase this barrier strength. This may be the cell-cell overlap, as the cell size change correlates well with the barrier strength increase and the overlap appears within the time frame of barrier strength increase. Nevertheless, there are other factors that have not been studied here, for example focal adhesions influence ECIS measurements as well, or tight junctions, or other adherens junction proteins.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Limitations and perspectives</title><p>The following paragraphs will discuss limitations of the Opto-RhoGEFs. Regarding the timing, the recruitment of Opto-RhoGEFs and the subsequent activation of Rho GTPases seems fast enough to manipulate Rho GTPase activity on a physiological time scale. We measured t<sub>½</sub> ON kinetics for iLID of 5.14 s in that time range the imaging speed at a confocal microscope rather becomes the limiting factors than the recruitment kinetics. Nocodazol induced Rho activity pulses last for minutes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Graessl et al., 2017</xref>) as well as S1P induced Rho GTPase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Reinhard et al., 2017</xref>). Regarding the spatial aspect, by design eMags photo-activation is better locally confined than iLID (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Benedetti et al., 2018</xref>). However, our experiments showed local morphology changes, which were indeed not restricted to the photo-activation area but still near that area. It was possible to give cells a migration direction, hence the local activation is at least sufficient to polarize the cell into leading and rear edge. A disadvantage of the iLID system is that it occupies the blue part of the light spectrum, not allowing the use of CFP and GFP without the activation of the tool. That also excludes the use of biosensors using the CFP-YFP FRET pair but recently a optogentic compatible sYFP2-mScarlet-I FRET pair has been described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Van Geel et al., 2020a</xref>) and single-color location-based sensors can be applied (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Mahlandt et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>The Rho GTPase specificity of the Opto-RhoGEFs is defined by the utilized GEF. Biosensors could be applied to confirm the specificity. ITSN1 has been shown to be specific for Cdc42 and not activating Rac1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Reinhard, 2019</xref>). TIAM1 and p63RhoGEF have been classified specific for Rac and Rho respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Müller et al., 2020</xref>). Opto-RhoGEFs for other Rho GTPases can be engineered by the same design strategies as in this study, as long as a specific GEF is available. However, it cannot be excluded that Rho GTPases activate each other by crosstalk as Cdc42 is able to activate Rac1 via Pak (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Obermeier et al., 1998</xref>), which might mean that the OptoITSN-induced cell spreading is Rac mediated which got activated by Cdc42 crosstalk. An alternative is the design of a photo-activatable Rho GTPase, which has been achieved for Rac1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Wu et al., 2009</xref>). This approach is Rho GTPase specific, however, we observed basal activity of the inactive PA-Rac1, expressing cells were larger, suggesting Rac activity. The design of these proteins is more complex than the design of Opto-RhoGEFs. Another concern is the basal activity, because the GEFs are essentially overexpressed in the cytosol. This is not the location where they activate Rho GTPases but they can freely diffuse to the plasma membrane. We attempted to assess basal activity by measurements of the cell area, because active Rho GTPases are known to alter cell size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Klems et al., 2020</xref>). We could not measure a change in cell size, however the different cell lines run at different resistance levels in the ECIS experiment, OptoITSN and OptoTIAM higher than the control and OptoP63 lower, matching the expected effect of the targeted Rho GTPases. Also, in the permeability assay OptoTIAM cells kept in the dark show a somewhat lower permeability than control cells, suggesting basal activity. One reason for basal activity could be the photo-activation by daylight. However, cells were kept in the dark throughout the experiment and the iLID recruitment is reversible within 20 s. To further prevent basal activity a tool could be designed where the components are inactive and only get activated when stimulated with blue light. One approach could be to split the DH and the PH domain, assuming they are both inactive when separated, and fuse the PH domain to iLID and the DH domain to SspB. This way the domains only become a catalytically active GEF domain once the SspB is recruited toward the iLID. Other researchers have designed a two-component system where they combined the rapamycin tool and the optogenetic heterodimerization tool TULIP to recruit dynein to Rab11 vesicles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">van Bergeijk et al., 2015</xref>). Another approach would be to cage the catalytically active GEF domain or immobilize it at location of the cell, where it is not signaling, to be first released and recruited upon activation.</p><p>Further research could engineer Opto-RhoGEFs with other GEF specific for less well-studied Rho GTPases, as the design is rather straightforward. This will contribute to the molecular toolbox available to manipulate Rho GTPases. Furthermore, it would be of interest to separately recruit different Opto-RhoGEFs in one cell to investigate the interplay between Rho GTPases. Additionally, biosensor could be used to study the crosstalk between Rho GTPases and, if these are activated on a subcellular level, one could study how polarity during cell migration is established. The Opto-RhoGEFs could also be used to steer migration of a stem cell or a cancer cell, as we showed the potential to let a cell migrate in a directed manner. This has been done for immune cells and epithelial cell in <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Izquierdo et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">O’Neill et al., 2016</xref>). In the long run one could imagine light-based therapy where the patient would be treated by light to control vascular barrier strength in a defined location for example to allow for more leukocyte transmigration to eliminate a tumor, or strengthen vascular barrier integrity in chronic inflammation.</p><p>The Opto-RhoGEFs have great potential to manipulate Rho GTPase signaling on a subcellular to global level in a reversible manner to study the role of Rho GTPases in the endothelium in novel ways.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Plasmids and cloning</title><sec id="s4-1-1"><title>Rapamycin system</title><p>C1-Lck-FRB-mTurquoise described before (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">van Unen et al., 2015</xref>) and backbone C1-sYFP1-2xNES-FKBP12, FKBP12 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Goedhart et al., 2013</xref>) and NES (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kremers et al., 2006</xref>) were described previously, were digested with BsrGI and NdeI, and ligated.

Area and form factor were measured and exported to an Excel spread sheet for these edited, secondary objects (entire cell). This method was used to measure the initial cell area in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>. To track the cell area and form factor change per cell shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B and C</xref> ,the frames 1, 48, and 88, that is 0 s, 705 s, and 1305 s, were analyzed, and ‘TrackObjects’ was added to the pipeline for the secondary object based on overlap. To track the cell area in every frame (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>), cells were selected, that did not touch the edge or neighboring cells, to use fully automated segmentation, so ‘EditObjectManually’ could be removed from the pipeline.</p><p>To measure the activation area covered by cells, photo-activated locally, FIJI was used. The first frame of activation was compared to the last frame of a 10 min photo-activation. Images were background-corrected. The image was cropped for the photo-activation area and the Gaussian blur filter, with a sigma of 1, was applied to the Opto-RhoGEF JF552 nm channel. To identify the area covered by cell, the Huang dark threshold was applied, and if necessary adjusted by hand, to create a ROI. The area of this ROI was measured and plotted as a percentage of photo-activation area covered by the cell, pre- and post-activation. ROIs are included in the deposited data.</p><p>To measure the junction linearity index the FIJI plugin ‘Tissue Analyzer’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aigouy et al., 2010</xref>) was used. To segment the junctions, the watershed algorithm was used with the default parameters and strong blur set between 18 and 22, weak blur set to 1.5. When necessary the segmented junctions were corrected by hand. Based on the junction segmentation, ROIs were created. The polygon tool was used to draw a polygon per cell corner, matching points with three cell junctions, representing the minimum distance between the corners. The perimeter was measured for the junction ROI and the minimum distance polygon. The linearity index was calculated by junction perimeter divided by polygon perimeter.</p><p>To represent junctional movement, the FIJI function ‘Temporal-Color-Code’ was used on the same amount of frames for pre-, post-, during photo-activation images of the VE-cadherin staining. The look up table ‘fire’ was applied to the resulting image and inverted. Light colors represent earlier junction positions and darker colors represent later junction positions. Color code is displayed in the figure.</p><p>To measure cell-cell overlap area, binary images were created by applying the filter Gaussian blue (sigma 2) and a threshold (Huang). The resulting 8-bit binary images for the CFP channel were subtracted by 254 and the RFP image by 254. Subsequently, the two images were added up and the areas with the value 3 were used as ROIs to measure the overlap area. The data was normalized by division through the initial value for the overlap area.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Plots and statistics</title><p>Dot plots were generated with the R-based web tool ‘PlotsofData’ and ‘SuperPlotsofData’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Goedhart and Pollard, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Postma and Goedhart, 2019</xref>).

The authors establish the role of Rho-family GTPases in controlling the cytoskeletal-plasma membrane interface as it relates to endothelial barrier integrity and function, and adequately motivate the need for optogenetic tools for global and local signaling manipulation to study endothelial barriers.</p><p>Throughout the work, the optogenetic assays are conceptualized, described, and executed with exceptional attention to detail, particularly as it relates to potential confounding factors in data analysis and interpretation. Comparison across experimental setups in optogenetics is notoriously fraught, and the authors' control experiments and measurements to ensure equal light delivery and pathway activation levels across applications is very thorough. In demonstrating how these new opto-GEFs can be used to alter vascular barrier strength, the authors cleverly use fluorescent-labeled dextran polymers of different sizes and ECIS experiments to demonstrate the physiological relevance of BOEC monolayers to in vivo blood vessels. Of particular note, the resiliency of the system to multiple stimulation cycles and longer time course experiments is promising for use in vascular leakage studies.</p><p>Given that dozens of Rho GTPase-activating GEFs exist, expanded rationale for the selection of p63, ITSN1, and TIAM1 in the form of discussion and literature citations would be helpful to motivate their selection as protein effectors in the engineered tools. Extensive tool engineering studies demonstrate the superiority of iLID over optogenetic eMags or rapamycin-based chemogenetic tools for these purposes. However, as the utility of iLID and eMags has been demonstrated for manipulation of a variety of signaling pathways, the iSH-Akt demonstration does not seem necessary for these systems.</p><p>The demonstration of orthogonality in GTPase- and VE-cadherin-blocking antibody-mediated barrier function decreases and is compelling, even without full elucidation of the role of cell size or overlap in barrier strength. The discussion section presents a mature and thoughtful description of the limitations, remaining questions, and potential opportunities for the tools and technology developed in this work. Importantly, this manuscript demonstrates a commitment to scientific transparency in the ways in which the data are visualized, the methods descriptions, and the reagent and code sharing it presents, allowing others to utilize these tools to their full potential.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="referee-report" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.84364.3.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><anonymous/><role specific-use="referee">Reviewer</role></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>This manuscript reports on the use of Optogenetics to influence endothelial barrier integrity by light. Light-induced membrane recruitment of GTPase GEFs is known to stimulate GTPases and modulate cell shape, and here this principle is used to modulate endothelial barrier function. It shows that Rac and CDc42 activating constructs enhance barrier function and do this even when a major junctional adhesion molecule, VE-cadherin, is blocked. Activation of Rac and Cdc42 enhanced lamellipodia formation and cellular overlaps, which could be the basis for the increase in barrier integrity.</p><p>The authors aimed at developing a light driven technique with which endothelial barrier integrity can be modulated on the basis of activating certain GTPases. They succeeded in using optogenetic tools that recruit GEF exchange domains to membranes upon light induction in endothelial cell monolayers. Similar tools were in principle known before to modulate cell shape/morphology upon light induction, but were used here for the first time as regulators of endothelial barrier integrity. In this way it was shown that the activation of Cdc42 and Rac can increase barrier integrity even if VE-cadherin, a major adhesion molecule of endothelial junctions, is blocked. Although it was shown before that stimulation of S1P1 receptor or of Tie-2 can enhance endothelial barrier integrity in dependence of Cdc42 or Rac1 and can do this independent of VE-cadherin, the current study shows this with tools directly targeting these GTPases.</p><p>Furthermore, this study presents very valuable tools. The immediate and repeatable responses of barrier integrity changes upon light-on and light-off switches are fascinating and impressive. It will be interesting to use these tools in the future in the context of analyzing other mechanisms which also affect endothelial barrier function and modulate the formation of endothelial adherens junctions.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="referee-report" id="sa3"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.84364.3.sa3</article-id><title-group><article-title>Reviewer #3 (Public Review):</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><anonymous/><role specific-use="referee">Reviewer</role></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>Mahlandt et al. report the design and proof of concept of Opto-RhoGEF, a new set of molecular tools to control the activation by light of the three best known members of the Rho GTPase family, RhoA, Rac1 and Cdc42.</p><p>The study is based on the optogenetically-controlled activation of chimeric proteins that target to the plasma membrane guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) domains, which are natural activators specific for each of these three Rho GTPases. Membrane-targeted GEFs encounter and activate endogenous Rho proteins. Further investigation on the effect of these tools on RhoGTPase signaling would have strengthened the report.</p><p>These three Opto-RhoGEFs are reversible and enable the precise spatio-temporal control of Rho-regulated processes, such as endothelial barrier function, cell contraction and plasma membrane extension. Hence, these molecular tools will be of broad interest for cell biologists interested in this family of GTPases.</p><p>Mahlandt et al. design and characterize three new optogenetic tools to artificially control the activation of the RhoA, Rac1 and Cdc42 by light. These three Rho GTPases are master regulators of the actin cytoskeleton, thereby regulating cell-cell contact stability or actin-mediated contraction and membrane protrusions.</p><p>The main strength of this new experimental resource lies in the fact that, to date, few tools controlling Rho activation by reversibly targeting Rho GEFs to the plasma membrane are available. In addition, a comparative analysis of the three Opto-RhoGEFs adds value and further strengthens the results, given the fact that each Opto-GEF produces different (and somehow expected) effects, which suggest specific GTPase activation. The design of the tools is correct, although the membrane targeting could be improved, since the Lck N-terminus used to construct the recombinant proteins contains myristoylation and palmitoylation sites, which has the potential to target the chimeric protein to lipid rafts. As a consequence, this may not evenly translocate these Rho-activating domains.</p><p>An additional technical feature that must be highlighted is an elegant method to activate Opto-RhoGEFs in cultured cells, independent of laser and microscopes, by using led strips, which notably expands the possibilities of this resource, potentially allowing biochemical analyses in large numbers of cells.</p><p>The experimental evidence clearly indicates that authors have achieved their aim and designed very useful tools. However, they should have taken more advantage of this remarkable technical advance and investigate in further detail the spatiotemporal dynamics of Rho-mediated signaling. Although the manuscript is a &quot;tool and resource&quot;, readers may have better grasped the potential benefits of tuning GTPase activity with this tool by learning about some original and quantitative insights of RhoA, Rac1 and Cdc42 function.</p><p>One of such insights may have come from the set of data regarding the contribution of adherens junctions. The effect of other endothelial cell-cell junctions, such as tight junctions, may also contribute to barrier function, as well as junctional independent, cell-substratum adhesion. These optogenetic tools will undoubtedly impact on these future studies and help decipher whether these other adhesion events that are important for endothelial barrier integrity are also under control of these three GTPases. Overall, the manuscript is sound and presents new and convincing experimental strategies to apply optogenetics to the field of Rho GTPases.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="author-comment" id="sa4"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.84364.3.sa4</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author Response:</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Mahlandt</surname><given-names>Eike K</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>SILS/UvA</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Amsterdam</named-content></addr-line><country>Netherlands</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Palacios Martínez</surname><given-names>Sebastián</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Swammerdam Institute for Life Sciences, Section of Molecular Cytology, van Leeuwenhoek Centre for Advanced Microscopy, University of Amsterdam</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Amsterdam</named-content></addr-line><country>Netherlands</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Arts</surname><given-names>Janine JG</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Sanquin Research and Landsteiner Laboratory</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Amsterdam</named-content></addr-line><country>Netherlands</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Tol</surname><given-names>Simon</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Sanquin Research and Landsteiner Laboratory</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Amsterdam</named-content></addr-line><country>Netherlands</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>van Buul</surname><given-names>Jaap D</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Sanquin Research and Landsteiner Laboratory</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Amsterdam</named-content></addr-line><country>Netherlands</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Goedhart</surname><given-names>Joachim</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>SILS/UvA</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Amsterdam</named-content></addr-line><country>Netherlands</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>The following is the authors' response to the original reviews.</p><p>We were pleased with the overall enthusiastic comments of the reviewers:</p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Reviewer #1: “This manuscript by Mahlandt, et al. presents a significant advance in the manipulation of endothelial barriers with spatiotemporal precision”</p></list-item><list-item><p>Reviewer #2: “The immediate and repeatable responses of barrier integrity changes upon light-on and light-off switches are fascinating and impressive.”</p></list-item><list-item><p>Reviewer #3: “, these molecular tools will be of broad interest to cell biologists interested in this family of GTPases.”</p></list-item></list><p>We thank the reviewers for their fair and constructive comments that helped us to improve the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>1. This paper is likely to attract a diverse audience. However, the order of data presented in this manuscript can be confusing or challenging to follow for the naive reader. This is because the tool characterization is split into two parts: before the barrier strength assay (selection of optogenetic platform and tool expression) and after (characterization of cell morphology with global and local optogenetic stimulation). Reorganizing the results such that the barrier strength results follows from an understanding of individual cell responses to stimulation may improve the ability of this readership to understand the factors at play in the changes in barrier strength observed when opto-RhoGEFs are activated.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate this idea, and we initially structured the paper in the proposed order and then decided, that we wanted to put more focus on the barrier strength results by already presenting them in the second figure. Therefore, we prefer to keep this order of figures.</p><p>1. While the description of the selection of iLID as the study's optogenetic platform is clear, a better job could be done motivating the need for engineering new optogenetic tools for the control of GEF recruitment. Given that iLID-based tools for GEFs of RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc42 already exist, some of which are cited in the introduction, more information on why these tools were not used would be helpful-were these tools tested in endothelial cells and found lacking.</p><p>The original system has the domain structure DHPH-tagRFP-SspB. But we wanted to work with a SspB-FP-GEF construct, which would allow easy exchange of the FP and the DHPH domain. This modular approach allowed us to generate and compare the mCherry, iRFP647 and HaloTag version. We don’t want to claim that we engineered an entirely new optogenetic tool but rather optimized an existing one with different tags. To make this more clear we added : ‘<italic>The membrane tag of the original iLID was changed to an optimized anchor. In addition, we modified the sequence of the domains to SspB, tag, GEF to simplify the exchange of GEF and genetically encoded tag. A set of plasmids with different fluorescent tags was created for more flexibility in co-imaging</italic>.’</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1.

We will add reference and the following to the text: ‘<italic>Their catalytic active DHPH domains were used for ITSN1 and TIAM1 (Reinhard et al., 2019).

It should be tried to show these effects at a cell density where these light-induced effects increase electrical resistance. Lifeact with different chromophores in adjacent cells might be useful.</p></disp-quote><p>We had attempted to measure the overlap in a monolayer by taking advantage of the Halotag and the variety of dyes available by staining one pool of cells red with JF 552 nm and the other far red with the JF 635 nm dye. However, the cells need at least 24 h to form a monolayer and by then they had exchanged the dye and red and far red pool could not be distinguished any longer.</p><p>Therefore, we used the Lck-mTq2-iLID construct, which already marks the plasma membrane of the cells. We created a mosaic monolayer of cells expressing mScarlet-CaaX and cells expressing Lck-mTq2-iLID + SspB-HaloTag-TIAM(DHPH). We observed and increase in the overlap between cells under this condition. The results have been added to figure 4 - figure supplement 2I&amp;J.

The introduction is very long and would benefit from a more concise emphasis on the information required to put the work and results in context and understand their importance.</p></disp-quote><p>Comment: we appreciate the comment of the reviewer. However, we wish to introduce the topic and the tools thoroughly and therefore we chose to keep the introduction as it is.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. The N-terminal membrane-binding domain does not homogeneously translocate to the plasma membrane, since lck is a raft-associated kinase. Please comment on this.</p></disp-quote><p>In our hands, the Lck is among the most selective and efficient tags for plasma membrane localization (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1101/160374">https://doi.org/10.1101/160374</ext-link>). We do observe homogeneous translocation, but our resolution is limited to ~200 nm and so we cannot exclude that the Lck concentrates in structures smaller than 200 nm. Given the robust performance of the lck-based iLID anchor in the optogenetics experiments, we think that the Lck anchor is a good choice.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. Figure 1D is not very clear. What does 25 or 36% change mean? If iLID tg is conjugated to these sequences, its cytosolic localization should be reduced versus iLID alone. Is this what the graph wants to express? If so, please, label properly the ordinate axis in the graph (% of non-tagged iLID values?)</p></disp-quote><p>The graph is representing the recruitment efficiency of SspB to the plasma membrane for the two different membrane tags, targeting iLID to the plasma membrane. The recruitment efficiency was measured by the depletion of SspB-mScarlet intensity in the cytosol, up on light activation, and represented as a change in percentage.</p><p>We added the following to the title of the graph_: SspB recruitment efficiency for Plasma Membrane tagged iLID._</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. Supplemental figures in the main text. Fig S1D in the text refers to data in Fig S1E and Fig S1E is supposed to be Fig S1F? (page 11).</p></disp-quote><p>That is correct. The mistakes have been corrected (and this is now renamed to figure 1 - figure supplement 1E and 1F).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. Figure 3. Contribution of VE-cadherin. Other junctional complexes, such as tight junctions may also intervene. However, these results would also suggest that cell-substrate adhesion rather than cell-cell junctions may modulate the barrier properties, as it has been previously demonstrated for example by imatinib-mediated activation of Rac1 (Aman et al. Circulation 2012). The ECIS system used to measure TEER in the quantitative barrier function assays can modulate these measurements and discriminate between paracellular permeability (Rb) and cell-substrate adhesion (alpha). Please, provide whether the optogenetic modulation of these GTPases does indeed regulate Rb or alpha.</p></disp-quote><p>The measured impedance is made up of two components: capacitance and resistance. At relatively high AC frequencies (&gt; 32,000 Hz) more current capacitively couples directly through the plasma membranes. At relatively low frequencies (≤ 4000 Hz), the current flows in the solution channels under and between adjacent endothelial cells’ (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.biophysics.com/whatIsECIS.php">https://www.biophysics.com/whatIsECIS.php</ext-link>).</p><p>Therefore, the high frequency impedance is representing cell-substrate adhesion whereas the low frequency responds more strongly to changes in cell-cell junction connections.</p><p>We only measured at 4000 Hz, representing the paracellular permeability.
