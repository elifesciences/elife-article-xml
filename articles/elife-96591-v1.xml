Primordial germ cells (PGCs) are the bipotential precursors of mature gametes that commit to an oogenic or spermatogenic fate in response to sex-determining cues from the fetal gonad. The critical processes required for PGCs to integrate and respond to signals from the somatic environment in gonads are not well understood. In this study, we developed the first single-nucleus multiomics map of chromatin accessibility and gene expression during murine PGC development in both XX and XY embryos. Profiling of cell-type-specific transcriptomes and regions of open chromatin from the same cell captured the molecular signatures and gene networks underlying PGC sex determination. Joint RNA and ATAC data for single PGCs resolved previously unreported PGC subpopulations and cataloged a multimodal reference atlas of differentiating PGC clusters. We discovered that regulatory element accessibility precedes gene expression during PGC development, suggesting that changes in chromatin accessibility may prime PGC lineage commitment prior to differentiation. Similarly, we found that sexual dimorphism in chromatin accessibility and gene expression increased temporally in PGCs. Combining single-nucleus sequencing data, we computationally mapped the cohort of transcription factors that regulate the expression of sexually dimorphic genes in PGCs. For example, the gene regulatory networks of XX PGCs are enriched for the transcription factors, TFAP2c, TCFL5, GATA2, MGA, NR6A1, TBX4, and ZFX. Sex-specific enrichment of the forkhead-box and POU6 families of transcription factors was also observed in XY PGCs. Finally, we determined the temporal expression patterns of WNT, BMP, and RA signaling during PGC sex determination, and our discovery analyses identified potentially new cell communication pathways between supporting cells and PGCs. Our results illustrate the diversity of factors involved in programming PGCs toward a sex-specific fate.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>primordial germ cells</kwd><kwd>germ cell</kwd><kwd>sex differentiation</kwd><kwd>testis</kwd><kwd>ovary</kwd><kwd>gonad</kwd><kwd>single cell sequencing</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000066</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ZIAES102965</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yao</surname><given-names>Humphrey HC</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Single-cell multiomic analyses reveal known and new genes and pathways involved in the development of germ cells and provide a discovery platform for the scientific community.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Proper formation of germ cells during embryonic development is crucial for ensuring the production of functional gametes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">McLaren, 2003</xref>). The embryonic precursors to mature gametes, primordial germ cells (PGCs), are the bipotential stem cells of the germline that give rise to eggs and sperm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">McLaren, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hancock et al., 2021</xref>). During embryonic development in mice, PGCs commit to the oogenic or spermatogenic lineage in response to sex-determining cues from the gonadal environment in a process termed PGC sex determination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Spiller and Bowles, 2015</xref>). During sex determination, XX PGCs in the fetal ovary commit to oogenesis by entering meiosis immediately after pre-granulosa cell specification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Borum, 1961</xref>). By contrast, XY PGCs in the fetal testis initiate the spermatogenic program and arrest mitotically in response to signals from Sertoli cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Spiller and Bowles, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bowles and Koopman, 2010</xref>). Defects in germ cell differentiation, particularly during fetal life, often lead to reproductive diseases, such as infertility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Czukiewska and Chuva de Sousa Lopes, 2022</xref>) and the formation of germ cell tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Oosterhuis and Looijenga, 2019</xref>). Thus, it is necessary to enhance our understanding of germ cell development so we can better identify the etiologies of reproductive dysfunction in humans.</p><p>PGC sex determination is induced by the sex-specific activation of transcription factors (TFs) and downstream gene networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Spiller and Bowles, 2022</xref>). In XX PGCs, the retinoic acid (RA)-responsive TFs STRA8 and MEIOSIN and the bone morphogenetic protein (BMP)-responsive TF ZGLP1 are required for entry into meiosis and oogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Spiller and Bowles, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Ishiguro et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Nagaoka et al., 2020</xref>). These TFs also initiate the expression of genes related to meiotic processes, including <italic>Rec8</italic> and <italic>Sycp1-3</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Spiller and Bowles, 2022</xref>). In contrast, XY PGCs require the expression of cell cycle inhibitors, such as <italic>Bnc2</italic> and <italic>Cdkn2b</italic>, and the male-specific genes, <italic>Nanos2</italic> and <italic>Dnd1</italic>, to enter mitotic arrest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Vanhoutteghem et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Spiller et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Saba et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Cook et al., 2011</xref>). During the transition from PGC to oogonium or gonocyte, both XX and XY PGCs must also lose their bipotential state by downregulating the pluripotency-related genes, <italic>Pou5f1, Nanog,</italic> and <italic>Sox2</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Spiller and Bowles, 2022</xref>). Consequently, there are multiple layers of gene regulation required for sex determination of PGCs.</p><p>Beyond the patterns of gene expression in PGCs, relatively little is known about how signals from the gonadal environment activate the expression of sexually dimorphic TFs and genes in PGCs. First, the gene regulatory networks, <italic>i.e</italic>., TFs and their predicted target genes, specific to XX and XY PGCs are not well defined. Second, it remains unclear how the chromatin environment is temporally regulated during PGC sex determination. Finally, additional data are needed on the patterns of ligand-receptor expression in gonadal supporting cells and PGCs. Previous reports have used bulk gene regulation and expression genomics assays to investigate the transcriptional programs underlying PGC development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Houmard et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Jameson et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Lesch et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Rolland et al., 2011</xref>). However, these assays may not have the resolution or sensitivity required to detect the transient changes in gene regulation among PGC subpopulations that are essential to sex determination.</p><p>In the present study, we employed the integrative genomics method, combined single-nucleus transcriptome and chromatin accessibility sequencing from the same cell, to decipher various layers of gene regulation during PGC sex determination in mice. We comprehensively profiled 3,054 XX and XY PGCs at embryonic days (E) E11.5, E12.5, and E13.5, which covers the developmental time frame from bipotential to sexually differentiated PGCs. Single-nucleus sequencing enabled the detection of sex-enriched regulatory loci, TFs, and gonadal cues that may be responsible for initiating gene expression in individual PGCs. We first systematically examined the molecular signatures of PGC subpopulations to identify the genes and accessible chromatin regions underpinning the sex-specific fates of PGCs. By combining our epigenomic and transcriptomic data, we predicted <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory elements and sex-enriched TFs to construct the gene regulatory networks unique to XX and XY PGCs. Lastly, we probed the cell-cell communication pathways between supporting cells and PGCs to nominate potentially new ligand-receptor pairs involved in PGC development. Our results provide insights into the cell fate decisions underlying gametogenesis and sex determination of PGCs.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Combined multiome analysis of single-nucleus gene expression and chromatin accessibility of mouse PGCs</title><p>To understand how intrinsic transcription networks inside PGCs and external cues from the gonadal environment control PGC sex determination, we performed combined snRNA-seq and snATAC-seq (10x Genomics Multiome) for all cell populations in mouse fetal gonads. This approach allowed us to obtain paired gene expression and chromatin status from the same cell for all cell populations from female (XX) and male (XY) gonads. Whole gonads from Nr5a1-cre x Rosa-tdTomato9 embryos were collected at embryonic days (E) E11.5, E12.5, and E13.5, which encompass the developmental time frame of sex determination: initiated (E11.5), sexually differentiating (E12.5), and morphologically dimorphic (E13.5) gonads. Sequencing libraries of gonads for each sex and embryonic day were generated from two independent technical replicates for an average of 8,687 nuclei/sample with a sequencing depth of ~75,544 reads/nucleus and ~5755 UMIs/nucleus.

We clustered single PGC nuclei in low-dimensional space based on their snRNA-seq (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1bâd</xref>) or snATAC-seq (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1eâg</xref>) data using Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) for dimensional reduction. This graph-based clustering algorithm unbiasedly separated and clustered individual cells with similar transcriptomic profiles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Becht et al., 2019</xref>). Such analyses revealed that the transcriptomes of E11.5 XX and XY PGCs overlap extensively, whereas E12.5 and E13.5 PGCs principally separated according to their sex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>). In addition, we uncovered eight broader clusters of PGCs at a resolution that captured PGC subpopulations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>). We determined the cell-type composition of the snRNA-seq transcriptome-based clusters by plotting the percentage of PGCs at each embryonic stage and sex (<italic>x</italic>-axis) in each of the eight transcriptome-based clusters (<italic>y</italic>-axis) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>). First, E11.5 and E12.5 XX PGCs primarily consisted of clusters 0, 1, and 4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c and d</xref>). At E13.5, XX PGCs separated into three main clusters, 4, 5, and 6, and had significantly higher expression of the synaptonemal complex component and meiotic marker <italic>Sycp1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Gray and Cohen, 2016</xref>) and the chromatin modifier <italic>Hdac9</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib118">Yang et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c and d</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig2">Appendix 1âfigure 2</xref>). In XY gonads, PGCs at E11.5 grouped together into three clusters, 0, 1, and 7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>). At E12.5-E13.5, XY PGCs converged onto a single distinct population (cluster 7), indicating less transcriptional diversity among E12.5-E13.5 XY PGCs when compared to E12.5-E13.5 XX PGCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>). Furthermore, we found that E12.5-E13.5 XY PGCs clustered separately from other PGC populations due to elevated expression of <italic>Bnc2</italic>, which is required for mitotic arrest in PGCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Vanhoutteghem et al., 2014</xref>), and the forkhead-box TF <italic>Foxp1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Herman et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig2">Appendix 1âfigure 2</xref>). Finally, a small proportion of all PGC populations (E11.5-E13.5 XX and XY PGCs) were detected in clusters 2 and 3, and displayed enriched expression of ribosome biogenesis genes and genes with reported roles in reproduction, such as the mitochondrial leucyl-tRNA synthetase <italic>Lars2</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Pierce et al., 2013</xref>) and the DNA repair protein <italic>Mgmt</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">da S Martinelli et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig2">Appendix 1âfigure 2</xref>). Together, these data indicate that the transcriptomic profiles of PGCs are largely homogenous within each sex at E11.5. Subsequently, XX PGCs maintain their transcriptional heterogeneity at E12.5-E13.5, whereas XY PGCs transcriptionally converge onto a single identity beginning at E12.5.</p><p>The snRNA-seq clustering revealed transcriptomic characteristics of PGCs. Next, we performed unbiased clustering of PGCs according to their aggregate profiles of snATAC-seq peaks (210,666 total peaks) to detect the patterns of chromatin accessibility associated with PGC development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1e and f</xref>). The snATAC-seq-based clustering of PGCs showed that the chromatin status of E11.5 XX and XY PGCs was highly similar (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1e</xref>). By contrast, E12.5-E13.5 XX and XY PGCs formed distinct groupings at opposite poles of the UMAP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1e</xref>). Unbiased graph-based clustering of PGCs uncovered nine clusters of PGCs with unique stage- and sex-specific snATAC-seq peak profiles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1f</xref>). First, E11.5-E12.5 XX and XY PGCs together predominantly consisted of accessibility-based clusters 0, 1, and 2, indicating that these germ cells share a highly similar chromatin profile prior to differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1f and g</xref>). Second, E13.5 XX PGCs were separated into clusters 3, 4, and 5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1f and g</xref>), which may be due to differences in meiotic entry or progression within these populations of germ cells. Third, E12.5-E13.5 XY PGCs comprised of snATAC-seq clusters 6 and 7, suggesting that XY PGCs may adopt a sex-specific chromatin status beginning at E12.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1f and g</xref>). Finally, cluster 8, which contained PGCs from both sexes at each stage, was separated from all other accessibility-based clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1f and g</xref>). Taken together, our findings indicate that the chromatin accessibility profiles of E11.5 PGCs and several E12.5 PGC subpopulations do not show a sex bias, whereas E13.5 XX and XY PGCs clustered by sex.</p><p>The multiome datasets provided us the opportunity to define PGC identities based on a more biologically relevant status at the combined transcriptomic and chromatin accessibility levels. Specifically, we integrated gene expression and chromatin accessibility data within a single PGC to obtain a joint, or multimodal, definition of PGC identity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1h and i</xref>). Computational integration methods allowed us to co-visualize the variation in both the snRNA-seq and snATAC-seq profiles of PGCs on a single UMAP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Stuart et al., 2019</xref>). Simultaneously, profiling cell-type-specific transcriptomes and regions of open chromatin for single PGCs resolved the sex-specific trajectories of PGCs with much greater resolution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1h and i</xref>). In fact, we observed a strong demarcation between XX and XY PGCs beginning at E12.5 with very little to no overlap between XX and XY PGCs at E13.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1hâj</xref>). Given that we detected the clearest separation of PGCs when clustering with multimodal data, we analyzed the trajectory of transcriptomic changes (also known as pseudotime analysis in Monocle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cao et al., 2019</xref>]) among PGCs overlaid on the joint UMAP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1h</xref>). With E11.5 XX and XY PGCs chosen as the starting point (0) of the trajectory analysis, we observed a distinct branching or âdecisionâ point (1) between XX and XY PGCs at E12.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1h</xref>). Additionally, our unbiased analysis identified two terminal states (2) of PGCs at the E13.5 XX PGC cluster and E13.5 XY PGC cluster, providing additional confirmation that our data accurately reflect the status of PGC sex determination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1h</xref>). We also observed a closed, or circular, branch of the trajectory path among E12.5 XX PGCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1h</xref>), which may arise from the heterogeneous transcriptomes of female PGCs entering meiosis in an asynchronous manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Soygur et al., 2021</xref>). These data demonstrate that our approaches enable us to not only visualize the developmental trajectories of PGCs that are clustered with multimodal data, but also empirically trace their sex-specific fates based on changes in gene regulation.</p><p>Clustering of PGCs using combined snRNA- and snATAC-seq data identified 11 distinct groups of PGCs and yielded enhanced cluster resolution of PGC subpopulations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1i</xref>). This analysis resulted in clusters of PGCs that were predominantly sex-specific and enabled the detection of subpopulations of each PGC type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1i</xref>). To better understand the population structure of individual clusters, we plotted the percentage of each PGC type (<italic>x</italic>-axis) for each cluster identified in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1i</xref> (<italic>y</italic>-axis) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1j</xref>). First, E11.5 XX PGCs clustered into one main population, cluster 1, and later diverged into six subpopulations, clusters 0 through 5 at E12.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1i and j</xref>). Clusters 0â2 were more similar to E11.5 PGCs, whereas clusters 3â5 were composed of E12.5 XX PGCs that were developmentally closer to E13.5 XX PGCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1i and j</xref>). Finally, we found that E13.5 XX PGCs converged onto either one of two developmental fates in clusters 6 and 7, with cluster 7 exhibiting a large spread along the UMAP2 axis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1i and j</xref>). These findings indicate that E12.5-E13.5 XX PGCs may require extensive chromatin remodeling and transcriptional reprogramming to adopt the oogenic fate. By comparison, XY PGCs grouped into clusters 0 and 1 at E11.5 and appeared to converge on a single developmental fate at later stages, with E12.5 XY PGCs comprising clusters 8 and 9 and E13.5 XY PGCs belonging to cluster 10 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1i and j</xref>). Given that neither expression- nor accessibility-based clustering alone resolved the granularity of PGC populations to the level described here, these data underscore the empirical power of simultaneously measuring multiple modalities from the same cell to define the developmental fate of PGCs.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Molecular characterization of genes known for their roles in XY PGC differentiation</title><p>We next asked whether our multiomics approaches could gain insight into the regulatory status of genes that are known to be essential for PGC sex determination.

We first linked snATAC-seq peaks to XY PGC functional genes (listed previously), hereafter termed peak-to-gene linkages, in XY PGCs. Peak-to-gene linkages were determined using Signac functionalities and were derived from the correlation between peak accessibility and the intensity of gene expression. Next, we performed a TF motif enrichment analysis on significant peak-to-gene linkages to identify potential TFs. Finally, we compared the expression levels of potential TFs between XX and XY PGCs to identify TFs with XY-enriched gene expression. This strategy uncovered the KrÃ¼ppel-like zinc finger family member ZKSCAN5 (zinc finger with KRAB and SCAN domains 5) as a potential regulator of XY PGC functional genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>). <italic>Zkscan5</italic> showed XY biased expression (<italic>e.g</italic>., there is a 1.5-fold increase in the expression of <italic>Zkscan5</italic> between XY and XX PGCs at E13.5), and the level of <italic>Zkscan5</italic> expression increased from E11.5 to E13.5 in XY PGCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>). In addition, the ZKSCAN5 motif was not enriched in XX PGCs. ZKSCAN5 is not only highly expressed in the adult testis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Dreyer et al., 1999</xref>) but is also proposed to regulate cellular proliferation and growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Li et al., 2022</xref>). Thus, although little is known about the function of ZKSCAN5, we hypothesize ZKSCAN5 may possess a regulatory role during male germ cell development. These data highlight the strength of single-nucleus multiomics in discovering candidate factors that may regulate the expression of a cohort of developmental genes and, consequently, direct cell fate decisions.</p><p>Among the functionally important PGC genes, <italic>Bnc2</italic> expression was most strongly enriched in XY PGCs. We therefore investigated the regulation of <italic>Bnc2</italic> at the chromatin level as an example to demonstrate the utility of combined multiome datasets. The chromatin accessibility of the <italic>Bnc2</italic> promoter was highest in XY PGCs and increased temporally from E11.5 to E13.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>). Furthermore, the level of chromatin accessibility at the <italic>Bnc2</italic> locus was positively correlated with <italic>Bnc2</italic> expression in XY PGCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b and c</xref>). We then applied the Cistrome Data Browser (Cistrome DB) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Mei et al., 2017</xref>) to identify putative regulators of <italic>Bnc2</italic> expression based on TF binding motifs detected within 10 kb of the <italic>Bnc2</italic> promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d</xref>). The top candidate regulators of the <italic>Bnc2</italic> locus were determined according to a regulatory potential score derived from a combination of TF binding motif information and previously published genomics data (<italic>i.e</italic>., ChIP-seq, DNase-seq, and ATAC-seq) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d</xref>).

Previous studies have demonstrated that RA from the mesonephros induces meiosis in the fetal ovary whereas in the fetal testis, RA is degraded by the enzyme CYP26B1, therefore preventing PGC entry into meiosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bowles et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bowles et al., 2006</xref>). However, this model was challenged by the findings that meiosis, and consequently oogenesis, still occurs in XX gonads of mice lacking the RA-synthesizing enzyme, ALDH1, or all RA receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Vernet et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chassot et al., 2020</xref>).

We therefore investigated the expression and in silico chromatin binding patterns of members of the RA signaling pathway (<italic>i.e., Rara, Rarb, Rarg, Rxra, Rxrb, Rxrg, Crabp1,</italic> and <italic>Crabp2</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Napoli and Yoo, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig4">Appendix 1âfigure 4a and b</xref>).

By contrast, the expression of <italic>Rara, Rarg,</italic> and <italic>Rxrb</italic> was enriched in XY PGCs, and <italic>Rxrg</italic> was lowly expressed in both XX and XY PGCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig4">Appendix 1âfigure 4a and b</xref>). We also observed significant enrichment of the âmotif activity scoreâ, an in silico measurement of the contribution of a specific motif to gene regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Schep et al., 2017</xref>), of all RA receptors in E13.5 XX PGCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig4">Appendix 1âfigure 4c and d</xref>). These data indicate that the RA receptors display strong evidence of in silico chromatin binding in E13.5 XX PGCs but not E13.5 XY PGCs.

These data indicate that the binding motifs for the RA receptors are predominantly enriched in both distal and proximal regulatory elements in E13.5 XX PGCs. The RA receptor motifs were also statistically linked to genes involved in âresponse to RAâ, ânegative regulation of cell cycleâ, and âmeiotic cell cycleâ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig4">Appendix 1âfigure 4f</xref>; motifs for RARB and RXRA provided as examples).

To determine peak-gene associations, we correlated snATAC-seq peak accessibility with the expression of nearby genes, with the goal to identify sex- and stage-specific chromatin peaks positively correlated with mRNA expression (p-value&lt;0.05; z-score&gt;0). This analysis detected putative gene regulatory interactions based on correlations between chromatin peak accessibility and gene expression levels for all peaks and genes within 500 kb of each other (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Ma et al., 2020b</xref>). Given the notable increase in DAPs between XX and XY PGCs at E13.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b</xref>), we first identified the predicted target genes of all sex-specific DAPs at this stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig6">Appendix 1âfigure 6a</xref>). For E13.5 XX PGCs, we observed positive DAP-gene correlations for genes enriched for biological functions such as âWNT signaling pathwayâ, âchromosome segregationâ, âchromatin organizationâ, âmeiotic cell cycleâ, and âRNA stabilizationâ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig6">Appendix 1âfigure 6a</xref>). A similar analysis of E13.5 XY PGCs revealed positive DAP-gene correlations for genes involved in âncRNA metabolic processâ, âmitotic cell cycleâ, âDNA repairâ, âregulation of translationâ, and âRNA localizationâ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig6">Appendix 1âfigure 6b</xref>). These findings demonstrate that we can use chromatin accessibility information to identify the regulatory elements linked to sex-specific genes in PGCs.</p><p>We next investigated the associations of differentially accessible (DA) chromatin peaks with DEG expression for each PGC type. At E11.5, we found that DA peak-to-gene linkages were associated with ~20% of DEGs in XX PGCs and ~1% of DEGs in XY PGCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig6">Appendix 1âfigure 6c</xref>). The overlap of DA peak-to-gene linkages with DEGs increased steadily at E12.5 and E13.5, with ~35% and~60% of DA peaks in E13.5 XX and XY PGCs, respectively, positively correlated with DEG expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig6">Appendix 1âfigure 6c</xref>).

For example, in E11.5 XX PGCs, RREB1 is a differentially expressed TF showing high gene expression, but negative levels of in silico chromatin binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig7">Appendix 1âfigure 7a</xref>). This finding indicates that although RREB1 is a highly expressed TF in E11.5 XX PGCs, RREB1 does not likely promote increased chromatin accessibility either because it does not bind to chromatin or a critical cofactor is unavailable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig7">Appendix 1âfigure 7a</xref>). Following this analytical framework, we focused our analysis on TFs that showed high levels of gene expression, were differentially expressed in XX PGCs, and displayed a positive in silico chromatin binding score (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig7">Appendix 1âfigure 7aâc</xref>). The TFs meeting these criteria were KLF12, NR6A1, and ZFX in E11.5 XX PGCs; TFAP2c in E12.5 XX PGCs; and BACH2, CREM, GATA2, GLI3, MGA, NFKB1, PLAGL1, TBX4, TCFL5, TFAP2c, ZBTB7c, and ZFX in E13.5 XX PGCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig7">Appendix 1âfigure 7aâc</xref>). Of these 16 TF candidates with PGC-enriched transcript expression, only 7 (<italic>Gata2, Mga, Nr6a1, Tbx4, Tcfl5, Tfap2c,</italic> and <italic>Zfx</italic>) showed enriched expression in germ cells when compared to the somatic compartment of the gonad and, thus, met our requirements for further <italic>in silico</italic> investigation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig8">Appendix 1âfigure 8a</xref>). These candidate TFs have reported roles in cell fate determination, growth and fertility regulation, and meiotic progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">GalÃ¡n-MartÃ­nez et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Kojima et al., 2021</xref>), all of which are in line with the cellular events that occur as PGCs commit to the female pathway. Nonetheless, the chromatin binding and gene expression of GATA2, MGA, TBX4, TCFL5, and TFAP2c showed the clearest patterns of sexual dimorphism in E13.5 PGCs and represented the most compelling TF candidates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5b and c</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig8">Appendix 1âfigure 8bâf</xref>).</p><p>The binding motif for TFAP2c (also known as <italic>AP2Î³</italic>) showed prominent TF-associated accessibility, especially when compared to all other significantly enriched TF binding motifs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig7">Appendix 1âfigure 7b and c</xref>). Immunofluorescence staining of TFAP2c also showed enrichment of TFAP2c in E13.5 XX PGCs when compared to the somatic compartment and E13.5 XY PGCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig9">Appendix 1âfigure 9a</xref>). Compared to XY PGCs, XX PGCs had enriched <italic>Tfap2c</italic> expression (p-value&lt;0.05; log<sub>2</sub>FC &gt;0.25) and enriched accessibility of the TFAP2c motif at E12.5-E13.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5b</xref>). The TFAP2c motif was close to genes related to glycogen metabolism, carbohydrate metabolism, and chromatin modification (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5d</xref>). The predicted target genes of TFAP2c accounted for 75% (372/494) of all DEGs with peak-to-gene linkages in XX PGCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5e</xref>), suggesting that TFAP2c is likely a high-level regulator of female PGC sex determination.</p><p>In addition to TFAP2c, we also investigated the regulatory potential of TCFL5 (Transcription Factor Like 5) in greater detail. TCFL5 was the most differentially expressed in E13.5 XX PGCs (p-value&lt;0.05; log<sub>2</sub>FC&gt;0.25) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5c</xref>). Accessibility of the TCFL5 motif was also enriched in E13.5 XX PGCs, indicating that chromatin binding of TCFL5 is likely strongest at this stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5c</xref>). The predicted target genes of TCFL5 totaled 74% (367/494) of all DEGs with peak-to-gene linkages in XX PGCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5e</xref>). A large majority of the predicted target genes of TCFL5 were also predicted to be the target genes of the enriched TFs presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5e</xref>, <italic>e.g</italic>., the predicted target genes of these TFs overlapped with 4â100% of the predicted target genes of TCFL5. The TCFL5-associated genes were related to chromosome segregation, meiotic cell cycle, sister chromatid cohesion, histone modification, regulation of TF activity, and cell-cell signaling by WNT. Our findings are supported by a recent report on the role of TCFL5 in XX PGCs, which demonstrated the requirement of TCFL5 in meiotic progression and female fertility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib127">Zhang et al., 2023</xref>).</p><p>Given that the motifs for TFAP2c and TCFL5 were not detected at every XX-enriched DEG, we hypothesize that a network of TFs, such as those identified in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig8">Appendix 1âfigure 8a</xref>, could work in cooperativity to regulate XX PGC gene expression. For example, we found that the predicted target genes of ZFX, MGA, NR6A1, TBX4, and GATA2 accounted for 73% (359/454), 31% (152/494), 20% (100/494), and 6% (32/494), respectively, of all DEGs with peak-to-gene linkage in XX PGCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5e</xref>). We also found that TFAP2c, TCFL5, ZFX, MGA, and NR6A1 may regulate the expression of each other (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5f</xref>). For instance, the motif for ZFX was located in the enhancers or promoters for TFAP2c, TCFL5, MGA, and NR6A1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5f</xref>). Likewise, NR6A1 is predicted to control the expression of TFAP2C, TCFL5, and TBX4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5f</xref>). Furthermore, the motifs for the candidate TFs were statistically linked to genes involved in âmeiotic cell cycleâ and the âWNT signaling pathwayâ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5g and h</xref>). Meiosis-related genes such as <italic>Tex15, Sycp1, Dmc1,</italic> and <italic>Hormad1</italic> contained the motifs for at least three of the predicted TFs in their regulatory sequences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5g</xref>). A similar pattern was also found for genes related to WNT signaling, e.g., <italic>Pkd1, Notum, Porcn, Fzd3,</italic> and <italic>Eda</italic> were predicted to be regulated by the binding of at least two of the putative TFs in XX PGCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5h</xref>). These data indicate that there may be unknown and undefined TF regulatory networks underlying XX PGC identity and function.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>Identification of candidate TF regulators of XY PGC differentiation</title><p>To identify candidate TF regulators involved in XY PGC sex determination, we performed the same analysis as described for XX PGCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a</xref>). Our analysis focused strictly on differentially expressed TFs that show evidence of chromatin binding based on the empirical <italic>in silico</italic> chromatin binding score (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig10">Appendix 1âfigure 10aâc</xref>). In contrast to XX PGCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig7">Appendix 1âfigure 7</xref>), we did not identify any significantly enriched TF binding motifs (p-value&gt;0.05) meeting our criteria in E11.5 XY PGCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig10">Appendix 1âfigure 10a</xref>). Only three XY-enriched TFs, FOXP1, POU6F2, and TCF4, were differentially expressed between XY and XX PGCs at E12.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig10">Appendix 1âfigure 10b</xref>), and only TCF4 showed a positive in silico chromatin binding score in E12.5 XY PGCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig10">Appendix 1âfigure 10b</xref>). For E13.5 XY PGCs, we detected five significantly enriched motifs that bound differentially expressed TFs (p-value&lt;0.05): FOXK2, FOXO1, FOXP1, POU6F1, and TCF4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig8">Appendix 1âfigure 8c</xref>). Of these six XY-enriched TF candidates from E11.5 to E13.5, FOXO1, FOXK2, and POU6F1/2 emerged as the top candidates based on germline-enriched expression when compared to somatic cells, differential expression in XY PGCs, and positive <italic>in silico</italic> chromatin binding scores (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig11">Appendix 1âfigure 11a and b</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5i and j</xref>). Together, these data indicate that XY PGCs rely less on differentially expressed TF-mediated gene regulation when compared to XX PGCs.</p><p>At E13.5, when the most TFs and their motifs were found in XY PGCs, we observed significant enrichment of the FOX (forkhead-box) protein family of TFs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig10">Appendix 1âfigure 10c</xref>). FOX proteins contain pioneering transcripti properties that allow for binding to condensed chromatin and enabling competency of gene activity through histone remodeling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib125">Zaret, 2020</xref>). Given their role in opening condensed chromatin, FOX TFs play important roles in regulating the expression of genes involved in cellular differentiation, proliferation, plasticity, and growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Herman et al., 2021</xref>). In particular, we found that the expression of <italic>Foxo1</italic> and <italic>Foxk2</italic> were specific to XY PGCs when compared to XX germ cells and the XY somatic compartment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig10">Appendix 1âfigure 10c</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig11">Appendix 1âfigure 11a and b</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5i</xref>). From our dataset, we found the FOXK2 motif positively associated with genes related to cellular proliferation, cell cycle arrest, mitosis, and DNA damage checkpoint (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5k</xref>). In addition, the predicted target genes of FOXK2 totaled 26% (54/208) of all DEGs with peak-to-gene linkages in XY PGCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5l</xref>). This finding was consistent with the number of predicted target genes of FOXO1, which included 28% (58/208) of all DEGs with peak-to-gene linkages in XY PGCs and may be the result of motif redundancy among FOX proteins. Given the substantial increase in the number of DA peaks in E13.5 XY PGCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b</xref>), we hypothesize that the pioneering properties of the FOX family promotes chromatin remodeling as XY PGCs transition to gonocytes.</p><p>We also detected significant enrichment of the POU domain, class 6 (POU6) TF family in XY PGCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig10">Appendix 1âfigure 10b and c</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig11">Appendix 1âfigure 11a and c</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5j</xref>). The POU family plays important roles in regulating cellular differentiation and the timing of cellular events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib115">Xiao et al., 2022</xref>). We found XY-enriched expression of POU6F1 and POU6F2 in PGCs, however, only POU6F2 displayed germline enrichment when compared to the somatic cell populations of the gonad (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig11">Appendix 1âfigure 11a and c</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5j</xref>). Furthermore, we observed the strongest POU6F1 and POU6F2 in silico chromatin binding scores in XY PGCs at E13.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig11">Appendix 1âfigure 11c</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5j</xref>). The POU6F1/2 motif was associated with 19% (40/208) of all DEGs with peak-to-gene linkages in XY PGCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5l</xref>). POU6F1/2-associated genes were related to voltage-gated chloride channel activity (<italic>Ano6</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib123">Yu et al., 2015b</xref>), regulation of cell proliferation (<italic>Appl1</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib129">Zhao et al., 2010</xref>), regulation of actin filaments (<italic>Fmnl2</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Pan et al., 2020</xref>), Notch signaling (<italic>Maml3</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Oyama et al., 2011</xref>), lipid metabolism (<italic>Osbpl9</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Lehto and Olkkonen, 2003</xref>), and ubiquitin ligase activity (<italic>Usp7</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Turnbull et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5m</xref>). Thus, the POU6 TF family is a top candidate to coordinate gene expression activity in XY PGCs.</p><p>We next compared the number and identity of FOXO1-, FOXK2-, and POU6F1/2-associated genes in XY PGCs. First, we did not detect the FOXO1, FOXK2, or POU6F1/2 motifs in the promoters/enhancers for each of these TFs. These findings indicate that these TFs do not regulate the expression of each other, and other mechanisms or regulatory pathways are required to activate the expression of candidate TFs in XY PGCs. Furthermore, the predicted target genes of the FOX and POU6 TF families shared little overlap with each other (11/87) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5m</xref>). The genes that were shared between FOXO1, FOXK2, and POU6F1/2 had reported functions in maintaining survival after DNA damage (<italic>Alkbh8</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib130">Zheng et al., 2014</xref>), TGFÎ² signaling (<italic>Bmp7</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Jia and Meng, 2021</xref>), and initiation of mitosis (<italic>Nek7</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bachus et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5m</xref>).

Mitosis-related genes such as <italic>Cradd, Cdk6, Exoc6b,</italic> and <italic>Pml</italic> were potentially regulated by FOXO1 and FOXK2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5n</xref>).

Taken together, these data suggest that in XY PGCs, although FOXO1, FOXK2, and POU6F1/2 regulate genes with similar properties, the FOX and POU6 TF families are unlikely to collaboratively regulate gene expression.</p></sec><sec id="s2-8"><title>Sex-specific enrichment of ligand-receptor signals between gonadal support cells and PGCs</title><p>Sexual dimorphism of germ cell differentiation is thought to be controlled by a meiosis-inducing substance produced by the somatic cells of the fetal ovary and/or by a meiosis-preventing substance produced by the fetal testis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">McLaren and Southee, 1997</xref>). In experimentally generated XX/XY chimeras, both XX and XY PGCs can initiate meiosis when residing in the fetal ovary or enter mitotic arrest when colonizing the fetal testis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Evans et al., 1977</xref>).

At E11.5, XX and XY gonads shared the greatest overlap of supporting cell-derived ligands and PGC-expressing receptors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6d</xref>). The shared pathways between XX and XY gonads were largely related to adhesion by collagen/integrin, fibronectin, and cadherin. E11.5 XX gonads had enrichment of 19 ligand-receptor pairs related to, for example, BMP, ephrin, integrin, FGF, and WNT signaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6d</xref>).

Furthermore, we did not observe a sex bias for the mean expression of interacting pairs for the shared pathway DLK1:NOTCH3 between E11.5 XX and XY gonads (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6e</xref>). These data indicate that at E11.5, sexual dimorphism of signaling pathways, in terms of number and mean expression, is most prominent between XX supporting cells and XX PGCs.</p><p>In E12.5 and E13.5 gonads, we observed a stronger XX bias in ligand-receptor interactions between supporting cells and PGCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6fâi</xref>). At E12.5, we observed 49 and 24 significant interactions in XX and XY gonads, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6f</xref>). In E12.5 XX gonads, BMP, insulin-like growth factor (IGF), R-spondin, and WNT signaling were the most frequently observed pathways and displayed strong XX-enriched mean expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6f and g</xref>). In XY gonads, detection of new signaling pathways emerged from E11.5 to E12.5, including signaling by BMP6, chemokines, Matrix metalloproteinases (MMP), and Neuregulin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6f</xref>). Compared to E12.5, E13.5 XX gonads continued to have enrichment for the BMP, IGF, and WNT signaling pathways with additional pathways related to midkine (MDK), Calsyntenin (CLSTN), and SLIT and NTRK-like protein signaling detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6f and h</xref>). The BMP5:BMR1A:AVR2B and MDK:PTPRZ1 ligand-receptor interactors also showed XX-biased mean expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6i</xref>).

However, enrichment of signaling by Desert hedgehog, Notch, and WNT inhibition became significant in E13.5 XY gonads but not E12.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6f and h</xref>).

Errors in germ cell development and differentiation can result in a variety of reproductive diseases, such as infertility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Czukiewska and Chuva de Sousa Lopes, 2022</xref>). Disruption of gametogenesis during early embryonic development can even lead to the onset of disease later in life, a concept which is supported by the Developmental Origins of Health and Disease (DOHaD) theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Jazwiec and Sloboda, 2019</xref>). Thus, it is of critical importance to understand the molecular and epigenetic signatures of developing germ cells and particularly PGCs. Nonetheless, the heterogeneous nature and low cell numbers of PGC populations often hinder the identification of novel factors that influence PGC fate. To overcome this limitation, we generated the first single-nucleus atlas of gene expression and chromatin accessibility for murine PGCs during sex determination. We demonstrate that single-nucleus multiomics successfully captures PGC sex determination at high resolution, identifies putative TFs involved in PGC sex determination, and provides insight into the cellular communication pathways between PGCs and the supporting cells of the gonads.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Integrated RNA and ATAC data for individual PGCs identified significant heterogeneity in XX PGC populations compared to XY PGCs</title><p>We first identified the subgroupings of E11.5-E13.5 XX and XY PGCs and resolved the patterns of gene expression and chromatin accessibility underlying each PGC population. We observed that the combined analysis of integrated snRNA- and snATAC-seq data produced better clustering and separation of PGCs than either assay alone. For example, we found that at E11.5, XX and XY PGCs share highly similar transcriptomic and open chromatin profiles, indicating that PGCs at this stage are bipotential at the level of gene regulation and chromatin accessibility. This observation agrees with the study that showed the global overlap of transcriptomes between E11.5 PGCs from both sexes, in which they detected only 101 DEGs between XX and XY PGCs with functional annotations related to chaperonin complexes and proteasome formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">MayÃ¨re et al., 2021</xref>). At E12.5, subpopulations of PGCs clustered separately within each sex, supporting the model that PGCs do not commit to a sex-specific fate in a synchronous manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Soygur et al., 2021</xref>). At E13.5, two subclusters of XX PGCs appear, consistent with the asynchronous entry of XX PGCs into meiosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Soygur et al., 2021</xref>). Others also reported substantial heterogeneity of human and mouse PGC populations, often arising from intrinsic variation in the epigenetic reprogramming required for sex differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chen et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Nguyen et al., 2019</xref>). These data underscore the discovery potential of simultaneously measuring multiple layers of gene regulation to define the developmental fate of PGCs.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Molecular signatures of differentiating PGCs revealed disease-related genes associated with PGC clusters</title><p>When examining genes that could be responsible for the expression-based clustering of PGCs, we found TFs, cell cycle regulators, chromatin modifiers, and ribosome biogenesis genes underlying the diverse transcriptional profiles of differentiating PGCs. Several of the expressed genes enriched in individual PGC clusters were involved in infertility or disease processes when nonfunctional. For example, mutations in <italic>Lars2</italic>, the mitochondrial leucyl-tRNA synthetase, is associated with premature ovarian failure in women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Pierce et al., 2013</xref>) and aberrant methylation at the promoter of <italic>Mgmt,</italic> a gene that is required for DNA repair and linked to the formation of testicular germ cell tumors in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">da S Martinelli et al., 2017</xref>). The dynamic and varied regulatory profiles of PGCs that we observed highlight the necessity of pairing chromatin accessibility information with gene expression data for elucidating the mechanisms underlying PGC sex determination.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Sexual dimorphism in chromatin accessibility increases temporally during PGC development</title><p>The chromatin landscape of PGCs is the most sexually dimorphic at E13.5 when compared to E11.5 and E12.5. The substantial increase in DAPs at E13.5 leads to several hypotheses that could account for the changes to PGC chromatin architecture during sex determination. First, it is possible that the chromatin of bipotential E11.5 PGCs is primed for activating either sex-specific differentiation pathway. Chromatin priming occurs when chromatin is maintained in an accessible state prior to gene expression and is evidenced in a number of developmental contexts, such as during specification of hematopoietic cells and lineage commitment of embryonic stem cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bonifer and Cockerill, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Tee and Reinberg, 2014</xref>). During development, chromatin priming fine-tunes gene activation by enabling a rapid response to external cues that induce cell differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bonifer and Cockerill, 2017</xref>). Second, we posit that E11.5 PGCs have fewer DA peaks because they are actively dividing. Mitotic chromosome condensation is known to induce a state of heterochromatin and the eviction of TFs from chromatin in actively dividing cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Raccaud and Suter, 2018</xref>). Third, the increased number of DA peaks at E13.5 may be the result of changes to chromatin structure as XX PGCs enter meiotic prophase I, an event that requires dramatic changes to meiotic chromosomes as they undergo DNA double-strand breaks, synapsis, and crossing over (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Gray and Cohen, 2016</xref>). Indeed, increased chromatin accessibility was found in mouse spermatocytes during prophase I of meiosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib112">Wiltshire et al., 1998</xref>). Finally, the upregulated expression of forkhead TFs in male PGCs at E12.5 and E13.5 may induce the <italic>de novo</italic> establishment of DA peaks through their pioneering activity. Nonetheless, our results are consistent with previous reports that demonstrate the global decrease in DNA methylation levels or increased chromatin accessibility, in mouse PGCs beginning at E9.5 and continuing through E13.5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Seisenberger et al., 2012</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Single-nucleus multiomics identifies evidence for chromatin priming during PGC lineage commitment</title><p>Moreover, not all sex- and stage-specific DA chromatin peaks account for changes in differential gene expression for PGCs. Chromatin accessibility and gene expression are often asynchronously correlated during cellular differentiation, such as during chromatin priming (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Ma et al., 2020b</xref>). For example, accessibility of regulatory loci involved in cell fate decisions may precede gene expression to prime cells toward one developmental lineage vs another (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Ma et al., 2020b</xref>). In the context of germ cell differentiation, PGCs must also undergo extensive chromatin remodeling events, including genome-wide DNA demethylation and a reduction in both repressive and activating histone modifications, prior to sex determination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Huang et al., 2021</xref>). Indeed, chromatin priming has been observed in PGCs from other species, such as macaques, pigs, and goats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chen et al., 2022</xref>). Thus, it is likely that the DA chromatin peaks observed for E11.5 and E12.5 PGCs in mice may either reflect global chromatin remodeling events associated with sex determination or foreshadow future cell fate decisions by remaining poised for TF binding. Nevertheless, a comprehensive profile of 3D chromatin structure and enhancer-promoter contacts in differentiating PGCs is needed to fully understand how changes to chromatin facilitate PGC sex determination.</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>The gene regulatory networks of XX PGCs are enriched for the TFs, TFAP2c, TCFL5, GATA2, MGA, NR6A1, TBX4, and ZFX</title><p>Our multiomics approach uncovered compelling TF candidates that may be involved in PGC development and differentiation.

They find that PGCs can be clustered into sub-populations at each time point, with higher heterogeneity among XX PGCs and more switch-like developmental transitions evident in XY PGCs. In addition, they identify several transcription factors that appear to regulate sex-specific pathways as well as cell-cell communication pathways that may be involved in regulating XX vs XY PGC fate transitions. The findings are important and overall rigorous. The study could be further improved by better connection to the biological system, including putting the transcriptional heterogeneity of XX PGCs in the context of findings that meiotic entry is spatially asynchronous in the fetal ovary and further addressing the role of retinoic acid signaling. Overall, this study represents and advance in germ cell regulatory biology and will be a highly used resource in the field of germ cell development.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>(1) The multi-omics data is mostly rigorously collected and carefully interpreted.</p><p>(2) The dataset is extremely valuable and helps to answer many long-standing questions in the field.</p><p>(3) In general, the conclusions are well anchored in the biology of the germ line in mammals.</p><p>Comments on revised version:</p><p>Most of my concerns have been addressed in the revised manuscript. I have one remaining concern but I believe this is important in order for the paper to be fully appreciated:</p><p>In Figures 2a, 2e, 3a, and 3e, the visualization scheme is very difficult to follow, and has not been updated or improved in the revised manuscript. It's very hard to see the colors corresponding to average expression for many genes because the circles are so small. The yellow color is hard to see and makes it hard to estimate the size of the circle. This issue is particularly egregious in Figure 2a for the data relating to ZKSCAN5, which is specifically highlighted in the text in lines 421-426. This data must be shown in a more convincing way in order to make the claims. An update to the visualization, including color scheme, is very strongly recommended; it is not difficult and would substantially improve the ability of these panels to communicate their message.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="referee-report" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.96591.3.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Reviewer #2 (Public review):</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><anonymous/><role specific-use="referee">Reviewer</role></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>Summary:</p><p>This manuscript by Alexander et al describes a careful and rigorous application of multiomics to mouse primordial germ cells (PGCs) and their surrounding gonadal cells during the period of sex differentiation.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>In thoughtfully designed figures, the authors identify both known and new candidate gene regulatory networks in differentiating XX and XY PGCs and sex-specific interactions of PGCs with supporting cells. In XY germ cells, novel findings include the predicted set of TFs regulating Bnc2, which is known to promote mitotic arrest, as well as the TFs POU6F1/2 and FOXK2 and their predicted targets that function in mitosis and signal transduction. In XX germ cells, the authors deconstruct the regulation of the premeiotic replication factor Stra8, which reveals TFs involved in meiosis, retinoic acid signaling, pluripotency and epigenetics among predictions; this finding, along with evidence supporting regulatory potential of retinoic acid receptors in meiotic gene expression is an important addition to the debate over the necessity of retinoic acid in XX meiotic initiation. In addition, a self-regulatory network of other TFs is hypothesized in XX differentiating PGCs, including TFAP2c, TCF5, ZFX, MGA and NR6A1, which is predicted to turn on meiotic and Wnt signaling targets. Finally, analysis of PGC-support cell interactions during sex differentiation reveals substantially more interactions in XX, via WNTs and BMPs, as well as some new signaling pathways that predominate in XY PGCs including ephrins, CADM1, Desert Hedgehog and matrix metalloproteases. This dataset will be an excellent resource for the community, motivating functional studies and serving as a discovery platform.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>While the authors performed all of their comparisons between XX versus XY datasets at each timepoint, a more systematic analysis of expression and accessibility changes across time for each sex would be valuable. It remains possible that common mechanisms of differentiation to XX and XY could be missing from this analysis that focused on sex-specific differences.</p><p>Specific Questions:</p><p>(1) Line 461: &quot;the population of E13.5 XX PGCs displaying the strongest Stra8 expression levels corresponded to the same population of XX PGCs with the highest module score of early meiotic prophase I genes (Fig. 3c; Supplementary Fig. 3a-b)&quot; however the Stra8+ XX PGCs that do not robustly express meiotic genes should be examined to understand more about their differentiation potential. The authors are well-poised to identify the likely trajectories available to cell subsets in their dataset, and not doing so is a missed opportunity.</p><p>(2) The authors state that &quot;we found that Stra8, Rec8, Rnf2, Sycp1, Sycp2, Ccnb3, and Zglp1 contain the RA receptor motifs in their regulatory sequences (Supplementary Figure 4g).&quot; What is the strength of the RA-&gt;meiosis pathway compared to other mechanisms regulating meiosis? Perhaps the authors could take this analysis further with the following questions: (1) ask whether meiotic genes more enriched in RA motifs compared to other expressed genes or other motifs (2) compare the strength of peak-gene correlations for all peaks containing RA receptor motifs vs. those with peaks for Zglp1, Rnf2, etc binding. The strengths of these correlations could provide clues to how much gene expression varies in response to RA exposure vs. modulation of these other factors and thus tell us something about how much RA is playing a role.</p><p>(3) In figure 4, the shift from promoters in E11.5 XX PGCs to distal intergenic regions is fascinating. What can we learn about epigenetic reprogramming/methylation changes across gene bodies?</p><p>(4) The overlap between gene targets of TCFL5 with other highly expressed TFs differentially upregulated in E13.5 XX PGCs over XY suggests ambiguity regarding its role as a central or high-level regulator of differentiation; as in vivo validation has not been performed, I suggest softening this conclusion.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="referee-report" id="sa3"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.96591.3.sa3</article-id><title-group><article-title>Reviewer #3 (Public review):</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><anonymous/><role specific-use="referee">Reviewer</role></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>Summary:</p><p>Alexander et al. reported the gene-regulatory networks underpinning sex determination of murine primordial germ cells (PGCs) through single-nucleus multiomics, offering a detailed chromatin accessibility and gene expression map across three embryonic stages in both male (XY) and female (XX) mice.

They find that PGCs can be clustered into sub-populations at each time point, with higher heterogeneity among XX PGCs and more switch-like developmental transitions evident in XY PGCs. In addition, they identify several transcription factors that appear to regulate sex-specific pathways as well as cell-cell communication pathways that may be involved in regulating XX vs XY PGC fate transitions. The findings are important and overall rigorous. The study could be further improved by a better connection to the biological system, including the addition of experiments to validate the 'omics-based findings in vivo and putting the transcriptional heterogeneity of XX PGCs in the context of findings that meiotic entry is spatially asynchronous in the fetal ovary. Overall, this study represents an advance in germ cell regulatory biology and will be a highly used resource in the field of germ cell development.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>(1) The multiomics data is mostly rigorously collected and carefully interpreted.</p><p>(2) The dataset is extremely valuable and helps to answer many long-standing questions in the field.</p><p>(3) In general, the conclusions are well anchored in the biology of the germ line in mammals.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>(1) The nature of replicates in the data and how they are used in the analysis are not clearly presented in the main text or methods. To interpret the results, it is important to know how replicates were designed and how they were used.

It has been known for a long time that XX PGCs initiate meiosis in an anterior-to-posterior wave in the fetal ovary starting around E13.5. Some heterogeneity in the XX PGC populations could be explained by spatial position in the ovary without having to invoke novel subpopulations.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for pointing out this important biological phenomenon. We also recognize that transcriptional heterogeneity among XX PGCs is likely due to the anterior-to-posterior wave of meiotic initiation in E13.5 ovaries and highlight this possibility in our manuscript. However, since our study utilizes single-nucleus RNA-sequencing and not spatial transcriptomics, we are not able to capture the spatial location of the XX PGCs analyzed in our dataset. As such, our analysis applied clustering tools to classify the populations of XX PGCs captured in our dataset.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) There is essentially no validation of any of the conclusions. Heterogeneity in the expression of a given marker could be assessed by immunofluorescence or RNAscope.</p></disp-quote><p>In our revised manuscript, we included immunofluorescence staining of potential candidate factors involved in PGC sex determination, such as PORCN and TFAP2C. Testing and optimizing antibodies for the targets identified in this study are ongoing efforts in our lab and we look forward to sharing our results with the research community.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) The paper sometimes suffers from a problem common to large resource papers, which is that the discussion of specific genes or pathways seems incomplete. An example here is from the analysis of the regulation of the Bnc2 locus, which seems superficial. Relatedly, although many genes and pathways are nominated for important PGC functions, there is no strong major conclusion from the paper overall.</p></disp-quote><p>In this manuscript, we set out to identify candidate factors, some already known and many others unknown, involved in the developmental pathways of PGC sex determination using computational tools. Our goal, as a research group and with future collaborators, is to screen these interesting candidates and discover their function in the primordial germ cell. Our research, presented in this study, represents a launching pad for which to identify future projects that will investigate these factors in further detail.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>This manuscript by Alexander et al describes a careful and rigorous application of multiomics to mouse primordial germ cells (PGCs) and their surrounding gonadal cells during the period of sex differentiation.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>In thoughtfully designed figures, the authors identify both known and new candidate gene regulatory networks in differentiating XX and XY PGCs and sex-specific interactions of PGCs with supporting cells. In XY germ cells, novel findings include the predicted set of TFs regulating Bnc2, which is known to promote mitotic arrest, as well as the TFs POU6F1/2 and FOXK2 and their predicted targets that function in mitosis and signal transduction. In XX germ cells, the authors deconstruct the regulation of the premeiotic replication regulator Stra8, which reveals TFs involved in meiosis, retinoic acid signaling, pluripotency, and epigenetics among predictions; this finding, along with evidence supporting the regulatory potential of retinoic acid receptors in meiotic gene expression is an important addition to the debate over the necessity of retinoic acid in XX meiotic initiation. In addition, a self-regulatory network of other TFs is hypothesized in XX differentiating PGCs, including TFAP2c, TCF5, ZFX, MGA, and NR6A1, which is predicted to turn on meiotic and Wnt signaling targets. Finally, analysis of PGC-support cell interactions during sex differentiation reveals more interactions in XX, via WNTs and BMPs, as well as some new signaling pathways that predominate in XY PGCs including ephrins, CADM1, Desert Hedgehog, and matrix metalloproteases. This dataset will be an excellent resource for the community, motivating functional studies and serving as a discovery platform.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>My one major concern is that the conclusion that PGC sex differentiation (as read out by transcription) involves chromatin priming is overstated. The evidence presented in the figures includes a select handful of genes including Porcn, Rimbp1, Stra8, and Bnc2 for which chromatin accessibility precedes expression. Given that the authors performed all of their comparisons between XX versus XY datasets at each timepoint, have they missed an important comparison that would be a more direct test of chromatin priming: between timepoints for each sex? Furthermore, it remains possible that common mechanisms of differentiation to XX and XY could be missing from this analysis that focused on sexspecific differences.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for their thoughtful assessment and suggestions, as stated here. We note that chromatin priming in PGCs prior to sex determination is a well-documented research finding (see references below), that is further supported by our single-nucleus multiomics data. To support these findings previously stated in the scientific literature, we included data demonstrating the asynchronous correlation between chromatin accessibility and gene expression during PGC sex determination. Specifically, we investigated the associations of differentially accessible chromatin peaks with differentially expressed gene expression for each PGC type (between sexes and across embryonic stages) using computational tools and methods that are well-established and applied by the research community. In our manuscript, we note that the patterns we identified support the potential role of chromatin priming in PGC sex determination. Nevertheless, we further highlight that a comprehensive profile of 3D chromatin structure and enhancer-promoter contacts in differentiating PGCs is needed to fully understand how changes to chromatin facilitate PGC sex determination.</p><p>References:</p><p>(1) Chen, M., et al.

However, we analyzed our snATAC-seq dataset with Signac, which performs term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) normalization. This is a process that normalizes across cells to correct for differences in cellular sequencing depth. Given that sequencing depth was taken into account in our normalization and clustering procedures, and that the unbiased clustering of PGCs also reflects the sex and embryonic stage of PGCs, we are confident that the clustering of the snATAC-seq datasets closely reflects the biological variability present in the PGCs collected.</p><p>References:</p><p>Signac Website: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://stuartlab.org/signac/articles/pbmc_vignette">https://stuartlab.org/signac/articles/pbmc_vignette</ext-link></p><p>Stuart, T., Srivastava, A., Madad, S., Lareau, C.

It's very hard to see the colors corresponding to average expression for many genes because the circles are so small.

In our description of these results, we propose several hypotheses leading to these increases in differentially accessible peaks. As such, it cannot be ruled out that the changes to chromatin structure that occur during meiotic prophase I contribute to the gain in differentially accessible peaks in XX PGCs at E13.5, and we included this statement in the manuscript accordingly.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>(1) The methods state at line 141 that nuclei with mitochondrial reads of more than 25% were removed, however our understanding from the Bioconductor manual and companion manuscript (Amezquita, R.A., Lun, A.T.L., Becht, E. et al.

It is thought that mitochondrial transcripts participating in nuclear import may remain hanging on to the nuclear envelope and get encapsulated into GEMs. If the mitochondrial read cutoff of 25% was used intentionally to keep this potentially contaminating signal, please justify why this was done for this dataset.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that the presence of mitochondrial transcripts may be potentially contaminating signal. In our preprocessing steps, we removed the mitochondrial genes and transcripts from our datasets so that they would not influence or affect our analyses.

We plan to investigate further in future research studies.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(7) Line 505: &quot;when we searched for the presence of RA receptor motifs in peaks linked to genes related to meiosis and female sex determination, we found that Stra8, Rec8, Rnf2, Sycp1, Sycp2, Ccnb3, and Zglp1 contain the RA receptor motifs in their regulatory sequences (Supplementary Figure 4g).&quot; My read of the text is that the authors are not taking a side on the RA and meiosis controversy, but rather trying to reveal what the data can tell us, and the answer is that there is a strong signature linking RA to meiotic genes, which supports this as a valid biological pathway. But what is the strength of the RA&gt;meiosis pathway compared to other mechanisms (which must be functioning in the triple receptor KO)? Perhaps the authors could take this analysis further with the following questions: (1) ask whether meiotic genes are more enriched in RA motifs compared to other expressed genes or other motifs (2) compare the strength of peak-gene correlations for all peaks containing RA receptor motifs vs. those with peaks for Zglp1, Rnf2, etc binding. The strengths of these correlations could provide clues to how much gene expression varies in response to RA exposure vs. modulation of these other factors and thus tell us something about how much RA is playing a role.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that this is a very interesting and important question. We also thank the reviewer for their thoughtful suggestions on the types of bioinformatics analyses that could answer this question. However, the section on RA signaling during PGC sex determination is only a small part of the manuscript and would be better analyzed in greater detail in a future research study or publication.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(8) The shift from promoters in E11.5 XX PGCs to distal intergenic regions is fascinating.

Not all readers will be familiar with the ligand-receptor signals between gonadal support cells and PGCs, and this text provides details on which signaling pathways are known to direct sex determination of PGCs.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(24) For UMAP plots in Figures 2c, 3c, S3b, and S4b, the text overlaid with the timepoints and sexes onto the UMAP plots is misleading, as it allows the reader to presume that the entire group of cells for a given sex/timepoint is located in the location of the text overlay. However, from the UMAP plots in Figure 1i-j, it is clear that the cells from a given sex/timepoint are actually spread across multiple identified clusters. Thus, the overlaid text obscures the important heterogeneity detected. To better represent the actual locations on the UMAP plot of cells from each sex/timepoint, it would be better to show inset density plots alongside these UMAP plots so the reader can locate the cells for themselves.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this comment. However, we chose this formatting to offer simplicity and ease of understanding to our UMAPs in addition to highlighting the general biological patterns of gene expression. If the reader is interested in discerning more of the heterogeneity of the UMAPs, they may refer back to Figure 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #3 (recommendations for the authors):</bold></p><p>There are some errors or places that need clarification or corrections:</p><p>(1) Figure 1f, according to the graph, it should be 8 clusters, not 9.</p></disp-quote><p>There are 9 clusters because the numbering for the clusters start at â0â.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) Why did cluster 8 have so many different states of cells from both sexes?</p></disp-quote><p>The identification of cluster 8 is likely an artifact of sequencing, and would require several different analyses to figure out why cluster 8 has many different states of cells from both sexes.
