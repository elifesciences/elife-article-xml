conservation and gas exchange in conjunction with migration from aquatic to terrestrial habitats. Epithelial Na<sup>+</sup> channel (ENaC) function is critical to systems responsible for extracellular fluid homeostasis and gas exchange. ENaC is activated by cleavage at multiple specific extracellular polybasic sites, releasing inhibitory tracts from the channel’s α and γ subunits. We found that proximal and distal polybasic tracts in ENaC subunits coevolved, consistent with the dual cleavage requirement for activation observed in mammals. Polybasic tract pairs evolved with the terrestrial migration and the appearance of lungs, coincident with the ENaC activator aldosterone, and appeared independently in the α and γ subunits. In summary, sites within ENaC for protease activation developed in vertebrates when renal Na<sup>+</sup> conservation and alveolar gas exchange were required for terrestrial survival.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd><italic>E. calabaricus</italic></kwd><kwd><italic>N. forsteri</italic></kwd><kwd>epithelial Na+ channel</kwd><kwd>proteolytic activation</kwd><kwd>furin</kwd><kwd>vertebrate land invasion</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Xenopus</kwd><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000062</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Grant R01 DK125439</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kashlan</surname><given-names>Ossama B</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection, and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Proteolytic activation of a sodium-permeable channel that aids in gas exchange and fluid homeostasis likely evolved at the water to land transition in vertebrates.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The migration of vertebrates to a terrestrial habitat began ~380 million years ago and was driven by competitive pressure and the relative availability of resources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Long and Gordon, 2004</xref>). Survival in a terrestrial environment required several adaptations, including those for respiration, extracellular fluid volume balance, and osmoregulation. Aldosterone signaling has a significant role in extracellular fluid homeostasis for tetrapods and depends on three proteins that appeared during the evolution of vertebrates: aldosterone synthase, the mineralocorticoid receptor (MR), and 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (11β-HSD2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Rossier et al., 2015</xref>). One of the major endpoints of aldosterone signaling through MR is increased activity of the epithelial Na<sup>+</sup> channel (ENaC) in the kidney, which results in enhanced Na<sup>+</sup> and fluid retention. Having originally evolved in a marine environment, these mechanisms to achieve electrolyte homeostasis may have required adaptive modifications as the ancestors of today’s terrestrial vertebrates moved to a relatively dry environment.</p><p>ENaCs are heterotrimers comprising α, β, and γ subunits that each have intracellular amino and carboxyl termini, two transmembrane domains, and a large extracellular region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A, B</xref>). An ENaC δ subunit can substitute for the α subunit in assembled channels, resulting in channels with distinct functional properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Giraldez et al., 2012</xref>). However, the δ subunit’s absence in mice and rats has led to fewer reports of its function and physiology, as most of this work has been performed in these model systems. ENaC subunits belong to the ENaC/Degenerin family of proteins that form trimeric cation-selective channels with similar extracellular folds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Jasti et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Noreng et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kashlan et al., 2011</xref>). Aldosterone regulation of ENaC activity and abundance depends on essential sequences in both the extracellular and intracellular domains. These include polybasic tracts in extracellular GRIP (gating release of inhibition by proteolysis) domains unique to ENaC subunits; however, the polybasic tracts of ENaC are not present in all vertebrate lineages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Noreng et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hughey et al., 2004a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bruns et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Noreng et al., 2020</xref>). Aldosterone promotes double cleavage of the α and γ subunits at polybasic tracts, which liberates embedded inhibitory tracts and converts dormant channels to constitutively open ones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kleyman et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Frindt and Palmer, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Frindt and Palmer, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Terker et al., 2016</xref>), thereby leading to increased fluid retention. ENaC subunits also feature PY motifs on their intracellular C-termini that are important for protein degradation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Snyder et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Schild et al., 1996</xref>). These motifs recruit WW-domain containing Nedd4-2, whose binding results in the ubiquitylation of ENaC subunit N-termini and enhanced endocytosis and degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Staub et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Rizzo and Staub, 2015</xref>). Nedd4-2-dependent reduction of ENaC abundance is inhibited by aldosterone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Rizzo and Staub, 2015</xref>). These complementary regulatory mechanisms help aldosterone minimize Na<sup>+</sup> wasting and fluid loss during volume contraction.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Sequence conservation in epithelial Na<sup>+</sup> channel (ENaC) subunits.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Space filling model of ENaC (pdb code: 6BQN) with plane indicating position of outer membrane border.

We consistently found both activating cleavage sites in the ENaC α and γ subunits of terrestrial vertebrates, while they appeared only sporadically in fishes. We confirmed that cleavage occurred at sites found in the γ subunit from Australian lungfish, leading to channel activation. Phylogenetic analysis and likelihood ratio tests showed a coevolutionary dependence of the polybasic tracts with each other. They also showed a coevolutionary dependence of tandem polybasic tracts with terrestrial status and with lungs. Analysis of ancestral reconstructions strongly suggests that the polybasic tracts appeared independently in the α and γ subunits. Similar analyses of the PY motif showed no coevolutionary pattern and that the PY motif first arose in an ancient ancestral ENaC subunit. Our data suggest that changes associated with adaptation to terrestrial life provided selective pressure for the development of ENaC activation by cleavage.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>ENaC subunit sequence conservation and evolution</title><p>The subphylum Vertebrata encompasses the vast majority of species in the phylum Chordata. We identified ENaC subunit sequences in each of the classes of Vertebrata, including all four ENaC subunits in each mammalian order. In order Rodentia, we found the δ subunit in Spalacidae (blind mole rats; accession XP_008850903), but in neither Muridae (mice and rats) nor Cricetidae (hamsters and voles), suggesting that the δ subunit was lost on the lineage to mice and rats after the divergence of Spalacidae ~34 million years ago (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Blanga-Kanfi et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Steppan, 2017</xref>). Notably, although we found ENaC subunits in Sarcopterygii (lobe-finned fishes) and the ray-finned Polypteriformes (ropefish), we did not find ENaC subunits in any other ray-finned fishes. Instead, BLAST searches using human ENaC subunits identified ENaC-related acid-sensing ion channels (ASICs) and uncharacterized ENaC-like proteins. This suggests ray-finned fishes lost all ENaC subunits after the early divergence of the Polypteriformes order and before the divergence of Chondrostei (sturgeons) and Neopterygii (gars and teleosts). Similarly, we only found ENaC-related proteins in nonvertebrate chordates (e.g., tunicates or cephalochordates).</p><p>To examine sequence conservation within ENaC sequences, we aligned ENaC subunit sequences found in each of the classes and top teleost and nonvertebrate chordate hits identified in a BLAST search using human ENaC subunits (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). Sequence conservation was highest in the transmembrane helices (TM1 and TM2) and defined extracellular secondary structures in the ENaC and ASIC1 structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata1">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Jasti et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Noreng et al., 2018</xref>). Sequence conservation was lowest in the intracellular N- and C-termini, extracellular loops, and the GRIP domain unique to ENaC subunits. Sequences associated with key functions demonstrated varied conservation. For example, G/S-X-S in TM2 contributing to ion selectivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kashlan and Kleyman, 2011</xref>) is well conserved within a conserved region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). The PY motif in the intracellular C-terminus is also well conserved, but in a poorly conserved region. The region in the GRIP domain containing the embedded inhibitory tracts and cleavage sites is poorly conserved.</p><p>To examine the evolution of ENaC subunits, we assessed the phylogenetic relationship of our 53 assembled sequences with maximum likelihood methods (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). In the resulting tree, we observed six clades: ENaC α, β, γ, and δ subunits, ASICs, and ENaC-like proteins. Each ENaC subunit clade largely recapitulated the expected phylogenetic relationships, with jawless fishes (lampreys) rooted closest to the base of the clade, followed by cartilaginous fishes (elephant shark), lobe-finned fishes (coelacanth and lungfishes), reptiles and birds, and mammals. Our evolutionary model suggests three gene duplication events for ENaC subunits, as previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Studer et al., 2011</xref>). The first duplication (node 1) gave ancestral β/γ subunits (node 2) and α/δ subunits (node 3). The second duplication (node 2) gave ancestral β and γ subunits. Both of these duplication events occurred in ancestors of jawless fishes at least 550 million years ago. The third duplication (node 4) leading to the divergence of α and δ subunits had more associated uncertainty. Given the presence of α and δ subunits in coelacanth, the duplication likely occurred before the divergence of the coelacanth and tetrapods.</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Phylogenetic tree of epithelial Na<sup>+</sup> channel (ENaC) subunits.</title><p>Maximum likelihood tree calculated from ENaC subunit sequences of marine species and select terrestrial vertebrates, and ENaC-related proteins.

In mammals, the GRIP domains of the α and γ subunits are each subject to double cleavage, leading to the release of embedded inhibitory tracts and channel activation. The β and δ subunits are not similarly processed. The proprotein convertase furin cleaves both the proximal and distal sites of the α subunit, and the proximal site of the γ subunit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hughey et al., 2004a</xref>). Cleavage distal to the γ subunit inhibitory tract can be catalyzed by several proteases at the cell surface, including prostasin at a polybasic tract (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Carattino et al., 2008a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Balchak et al., 2018</xref>). Similar results were reported for ENaC from <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Wichmann et al., 2018</xref>). We inspected our multiple sequence alignment for polybasic tracts that aligned closely with the tracts in mammalian and frog α and γ subunits (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata1">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>).

In coelacanth, we identified single polybasic tracts in the α, β, and γ subunits. The elephant shark’s γ subunit also had a single distal polybasic tract.

apparent cleavage sites are functional in a subunit rooted before the emergence of tetrapods, we examined the ENaC γ subunit from Australian lungfish (Aγ) in <italic>X. laevis</italic> oocytes. Aγ has two furin cleavage motifs predicted to lead to activation (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). To isolate functional effects to Aγ, we coexpressed an α subunit from mouse lacking residues excised by furin (mouse α∆206–231; mα<sup>Δ</sup>), rendering it incapable of proteolytic activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Carattino et al., 2008b</xref>). We also coexpressed a mouse β subunit truncated before the C-terminal PY motif (mouse βR564X; mβ<sup>T</sup>) to decrease channel turnover (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Shimkets et al., 1997</xref>). All γ subunits contained a C-terminal hemagglutinin (HA) epitope tag to facilitate detection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Oocytes expressing ENaC were conjugated with a membrane impermeant biotin reagent to label surface proteins. We then lysed the oocytes, isolated biotin-labeled proteins using NeutrAvidin beads, and analyzed whole cell and surface enriched samples by western blot using anti-HA antibodies. We detected full-length and cleaved forms of mγ and Aγ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). In both cases, the proportion of cleaved γ subunit was higher in the surface pool than the total pool (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>), consistent with trafficking-dependent processing reported for mammalian ENaC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hughey et al., 2004b</xref>). To confirm that cleavage occurred at the predicted sites, we mutated the terminal Arg in both sites to Ala (Aγ<sup>2A</sup>). When we expressed Aγ<sup>2A</sup> in oocytes, the higher molecular weight band remained readily apparent while the lower molecular weight band largely disappeared. Comparison of quantified band densities confirmed that mutation of predicted cleavage sites in Aγ greatly diminished apparent cleavage (p = 0.007).

The data in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref> suggest that sites 1 and 2 coevolved with each other. To test this idea, we calculated the probability that the sites coevolved with each other using nested likelihood models based on our model of ENaC evolution in BayesTraits (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Meade, 2022</xref> ; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Pagel et al., 2004</xref>).

The independent model contained two parameters: an appearance rate for both sites and a loss rate for both sites. The loss or gain of a site did not depend on the status of the other site, and therefore served as the null hypothesis. The dependent model added two free parameters by having separate gain and loss rates depending on the status of the other site. A likelihood ratio test between nested models showed a strong preference for the dependent model (p = 0.01). Fits to the dependent model suggest little selection pressure in the change from 0 sites to one site, with loss rates 11-fold higher than gain rates. In contrast, in the change from one site to two sites, gain rates were sevenfold higher than loss rates. This is congruent with the requirement for two cleavage sites within a single subunit’s GRIP domain for channel activation, and supports the notion that selection pressure derives from the functional consequence of double cleavage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bruns et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Sheng et al., 2006</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>GRIP domain double cleavage coevolved with the terrestrial migration and with Lungs</title><p>The data in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref> also suggest that the terrestrial migration or the development of lungs may have provided the selection pressure for channel activation by cleavage. ENaC function is also important in aldosterone-insensitive tissues, including the airway, where control of airway surface liquids is essential for lung function. We first calculated the likelihood of site 1, site 2, or both sites coevolving with the terrestrial transition using nested likelihood models. Each sequence was assigned the traits of the presence or absence of ‘site 1’, ‘site 2’, or ‘tandem sites’, and ‘terrestrial’ or ‘marine’ states, as indicated in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>. The independent model contained three parameters: a site appearance and loss rate, and a rate for transition from marine to terrestrial status (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). The independent model does not allow a relationship between rates of site gain or loss with respect to marine or terrestrial state, and therefore served as the null hypothesis. The dependent model added two free parameters by having separate site gain and loss rates in the marine and terrestrial states. A likelihood ratio test between nested models showed a strong preference for the dependent model for site 1 (p = 0.0053) and for tandem sites (p = 0.0098), but not for site 2 (p = 0.26). Fits to the dependent model suggest that in the marine state, site appearance and disappearance were dynamic, with a disappearance rate being fivefold higher than the appearance rate. However, once in the terrestrial state, both rates dropped to 0, supporting the notion of selection pressure favoring the presence of cleavage sites in the terrestrial state. We then calculated the likelihood of site 1, site 2, or both sites coevolving with the development of lungs using analogous procedures. A likelihood ratio test between nested models showed a preference for the dependent model for site 1 (p = 0.031) and for tandem sites (p = 0.018), but not for site 2 (p = 0.94).</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>ENaC expression in fishes with lungs and amphibians</title><p>Lungs coevolved with the terrestrial migration of vertebrates (p = 0.0004 in our dataset), and may have driven the coevolution of GRIP domain polybasic tracts with lungs that we observed.

We observed clear bands for the transcripts of all three ENaC subunits in the gills and kidneys of the ropefish (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>), which are important organs for ion homeostasis. In the lung, we observed a clear band for the β subunit, a faint band for the α subunit, and a barely perceptible band for the γ subunit.

In contrast to humans where bands for the δ subunit were relatively faint for both kidneys and lungs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Waldmann et al., 1995</xref>), we observed a strong band for the δ subunit transcript in the kidney, and no band in the lung.

To test this idea, we performed ancestral reconstruction of nodes 1–4 in our phylogenetic tree (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) using BayesTraits and MCMC methods. In the unconstrained evolutionary model, each of these nodes was free to adopt any status for the site of interest. In the divergent evolutionary model, nodes 1–4 were constrained to contain the site of interest. In the convergent evolutionary model, node 1 was constrained to exclude the site of interest. Models were compared by converting marginal likelihoods resulting from MCMC runs of each model to log Bayes Factors, where values of &gt;2, 5–10, and &gt;10 support positive, strong, and very strong preferences for the better fitting model, respectively. Within the framework of sites 1 and 2 coevolving with each other, comparison of the unconstrained evolutionary model with the convergent evolutionary model resulted in log Bayes Factors of 0.38 for site 1 and 0.34 for site 2, supporting no preference between models. Comparison of the divergent evolutionary model to the convergent model for each of the sites resulted in log Bayes Factors of 6.5 in both cases, supporting a strong preference for the convergent evolutionary model for each of the cleavage sites. This suggests that, despite analogous molecular mechanisms in the α and γ subunits, the appearance of cleavage sites in the α and γ subunits were independent events. Neither the proximal nor the distal cleavage site arose from a common pre-α/γ ENaC subunit.</p></sec><sec id="s2-8"><title>ENaC PY motifs evolved through divergent evolution</title><p>Our data suggest that cleavage of the α and γ subunits evolved contemporaneously with aldosterone synthase.

Due to the apparent connection to aldosterone, we examined another ENaC target of aldosterone-dependent regulation, the PY motifs in the C-termini. The PY motifs facilitate enhanced channel turnover via Nedd4-2, which can be inhibited by aldosterone and other hormones through kinase signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Rotin and Staub, 2012</xref>). Mutation or deletion of the PY motifs increases ENaC function, leading to Liddle syndrome which is characterized by hypertension, hypokalemia, and low aldosterone levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cui et al., 2017</xref>). We found PY motifs in all α, β, and γ subunits where sequences of the C-termini were available (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata1">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>), suggesting a divergent evolutionary model that did not depend on terrestrial status. Interestingly, δ subunits apparently lost their PY motifs after their divergence from the α subunit in the coelacanth ancestor. We tested whether appearance of the PY motif depended on the terrestrial migration or the development of lungs using nested likelihood models, as above. A likelihood ratio test between the nested models showed no preference for the dependent model for either terrestrial status (p = 0.54) or lungs (p = 0.28), suggesting their evolution was affected by neither. To test whether the PY motifs evolved from a common ancestor, we tested models of PY motif evolution using ancestral reconstruction at nodes 1–4 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> and MCMC methods. The unrestricted model suggested probabilities of a PY motif present at 98.1%, 99.3%, 91.5%, and 75.9% for nodes 1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively. We then tested a series of restricted models to test competing evolutionary models. In the divergent evolutionary model, nodes 1–4 were restricted to contain PY motifs. Comparison of the unrestricted and divergent evolutionary models resulted in a log Bayes Factor of 0.19, suggesting these models were nearly equivalent. In convergent evolutionary models, one of the four early nodes was restricted to not contain a PY motif, resulting in four models. Comparison of the divergent model to each of the convergent models resulted in log Bayes Factors ranging from 4.7 to 8.9, suggesting a strong preference for the divergent model over each of the nondivergent models.

Lungs appeared in lobe-finned fishes on the lineage to tetrapods. Air-breathing organs (e.g., respiratory gas bladders and labyrinth organs) evolved independently in ray-finned fishes, including morphologically distinct lungs in Polypteriformes.

ENaC α subunit knockout mice die of asphyxiation shortly after birth due to an inability to clear fluid from the lung (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hummler et al., 1996</xref>), and ENaC polymorphisms have been associated with lung dysfunction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Rauh et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Schaedel et al., 1999</xref>). ENaC regulation by cleavage is relevant in primary airway epithelial cell cultures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Reihill et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Myerburg et al., 2010</xref>), where ENaC is regulated by glucocorticoids rather than by aldosterone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Stokes and Sigmund, 1998</xref>). However, transcripts of ENaC subunits with GRIP domain polybasic tracts were not detected in the lungs of lungfishes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Uchiyama et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Uchiyama et al., 2012</xref>) and were faint in the lungs of the ropefish (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). As lungs coevolved with the terrestrial migration of vertebrates, concurrent stresses may have provided selection pressure for ENaC activation by cleavage.</p><p>Emersion from an aquatic environment poses a risk of desiccation and a challenge to terrestrial life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Wright and Turko, 2016</xref>). Aldosterone signaling through MR regulates electrolyte balance and total body volume in tetrapods. Key molecules required for aldosterone signaling appeared at various points during the evolution of vertebrates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Rossier et al., 2015</xref>). Interestingly, aldosterone synthase is absent in cartilaginous and ray-finned fishes, but appears in lobe-finned fishes on the lineage to terrestrial vertebrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Joss et al., 1994</xref>). The appearance of aldosterone synthase coincided with the appearance of the ENaC δ subunit, and preceded the consistent appearance of tandem polybasic tracts in the ENaC α and γ subunits. In ray-finned fishes, osmoregulation and euryhaline adaptation primarily occur through glucocorticoid receptor signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Takahashi and Sakamoto, 2013</xref>). Teleost MR signaling is implicated in central nervous system functions that include sodium appetite, but plays a secondary role in ion transporter regulation in osmoregulatory organs, in contrast to MR signaling in terrestrial vertebrates. Notably, aldosterone promotes cleavage of the ENaC α and γ subunits in mammals through MR signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Frindt and Palmer, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Terker et al., 2016</xref>). Analysis of transcripts from ropefish and lobe-finned lungfishes show expression of ENaC α, β, and γ subunit transcripts in the gills and kidneys (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>), which are important sites of ion regulation in fishes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Uchiyama et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Uchiyama et al., 2012</xref>). Furthermore, ENaC α subunit mRNA levels were positively correlated with plasma aldosterone in the West African lungfish <italic>Protopterus annectins</italic>, suggesting an important role for aldosterone and ENaC in electrolyte homeostasis in lobe-finned fishes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Uchiyama et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Why do ENaC subunits have polybasic tracts? Integral membrane proteins including ENaC are further processed and sorted in the Golgi apparatus for transport to their destinations. Furin and other proprotein convertases are present in various parts of the Golgi complex and cleave after polybasic motifs where Arg is preferred in the last position (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Seidah and Prat, 2012</xref>). Selective double cleavage strongly increases ENaC currents, providing the functional change required for fitness-based selection. ENaC processing through the Golgi apparatus, where furin or other proprotein convertases are present, may have led to the emergence of polybasic tracts. Furin homologs are present in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, consistent with furin emerging well before ENaC subunits, and before the divergence of deuterostomes and protostomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Roebroek et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bertrand et al., 2006</xref>). Prostasin, also known as PRSS8, cleaves the distal site of the γ subunit in mammals. Prostasin may have emerged in amphibians (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bhagwandin et al., 2003</xref>) as the most prostasin-related proteins in nontetrapods are more closely related to other mammalian proteases (PRSS22 and PRSS27). Notably, the last residue of the γ subunit distal site switched from Arg in amphibians to Lys in other tetrapods (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>, γ – site 2). Furin has a requirement Arg in the last position (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Henrich et al., 2003</xref>) while prostasin requires either Arg or Lys in the last position (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Shipway et al., 2004</xref>). This Arg to Lys switch prevents furin cleavage in the <italic>trans</italic>-Golgi network, and allows aldosterone-inducible prostasin to cleave and activate the channel at the cell surface.</p><p>The evolution of ENaC GRIP domain cleavage sites contrasts with the divergent evolution of PY motifs in the C-termini, which appear in all extant α, β, and γ subunits, but was lost in δ subunits that first appeared in a coelacanth ancestor. The presence of both ENaC subunit PY motifs and Nedd4-like proteins in ancestors of jawless fishes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Harvey and Kumar, 1999</xref>) suggests that aldosterone signaling co-opted Nedd4-2-dependent regulation. Differences in physiologic roles may underlie loss of the PY motif in ENaC δ subunits. ENaC δ subunit tissue distribution aligns poorly with aldosterone sensitivity, and is different than for the other ENaC subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Giraldez et al., 2012</xref>). Despite the lack of PY motifs, δ subunits can be ubiquitylated by Nedd4-2, presumably through binding β or γ subunit PY motifs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kevin et al., 2013</xref>). This is possible where subunit expression overlaps (e.g., lung and esophagus), but there are neuronal and reproductive tissues where only the δ subunit has been detected.</p><p>In summary, we found that two forms of ENaC regulation modulated by aldosterone signaling emerged through distinct evolutionary patterns. Channel activation by double cleavage of the α and γ subunits coevolved with the terrestrial migration of vertebrates, closely paralleling that of aldosterone synthase and likely as a mechanism to enhance Na<sup>+</sup> conservation and fluid retention. Regulation of cell surface stability through PY-motif interactions with Nedd4-2 was likely present in Cambrian period ancestral ENaC subunits and preceded the development of aldosterone signaling.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Sequence retrieval, alignment, and phylogenetic tree calculation</title><p>Human ENaC subunit protein sequences were used as query sequences in BLAST searches of databases (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>).

MCMC runs for each model were performed for the default number of iterations (1,010,000), and generated model parameters with means similar to those from maximum likelihood runs, consistent with convergence. The stepping stone sampler (100 stones with 10,000 iterations) was used to calculate log marginal likelihood values from MCMC runs. Log marginal likelihood values were converted to log Bayes Factors {log Bayes Factors = 2 × (log marginal likelihood model 1 − log marginal likelihood model 2)} for model comparisons.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, including Lauren A O'Connell as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Senior Editor.

Based on these discussions and the individual reviews below, we regret to inform you that your work will not be considered further for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>The reviewers agreed that the findings presented in this manuscript present a great evolutionary story about ENaC channels in the water to land transition of vertebrates. While the manuscript presents many novel findings, these claims were not supported by functional evidence. We encourage the authors to either add functional evidence from the literature or from follow-up laboratory experiments. We felt the experiments required for functional validation were longer than an appropriate revision period during COVID-19.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>As someone who is not familiar with ENaC channels, I found the manuscript esoteric and difficult to read.

Specifically, it focuses on the evolution of the ENac channels that regulate sodium levels in the kidney and shows that α and γ ENac subunits gained two proteolytic cleavage sites concurrently with the evolution of lungs and transition to land and, importantly, with the evolution of an enzyme that makes aldosterone, a hormone that regulates the numbers of ENac channels. Additionally, in tracing the phylogeny of ENac channels in chordates, this paper shows that ENac channel genes were lost in Osteichthyes following the divergence of polypteriformes and the other Osteichthyes, most importantly, the teleosts. Although the authors do not discuss this, it would be interesting to know if the loss of these genes is related to the evolutionary origin of teleosts in fresh water.</p><p>This makes a tidy story. This is a well-written and clearly illustrated paper. I particularly like the summary figure (Figure 4).</p><p>The consensus sequence of the polybasic cleavage sites varies across tetrapods (Table 1). One concern I have is that it is assumed that all of these polybasic sequences support cleavage. What is known about the actual cleavage of these in vertebrates other than mammals? Have the ENac channels from frogs, say, been tested with mammalian (if not frog) enzymes to know that these polybasic sites are cleavable? It is concerning to read that &quot;The human d subunit sequence also exhibits a polybasic tract in this region, but experimental evidence shows that it is not cleaved.&quot; I would like to see some evidence from the literature or data from the authors demonstrating that the putative cleavage in non-mammalian proteins really occurs at these sites. It is possible they evolved for another reason initially and later became cleavage sites.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>Wang et al. investigate the development of a protease-dependent regulatory mechanism of ENaC function. They specifically look into the emergence of polybasic tracts in the α and γ subunits. Furthermore, they compare transcript levels of ENaC subunits between ropefish and African clawed frog where the former independently developed lungs from tetrapods and the latter evolved after transitioning to terrestrial habitat. As it currently stands, this manuscript is focused on one topic, essentially the emergence of polybasic tract in ENaC subunits and is not well suited for a broader readership that <italic>eLife</italic> supports. There are a few comments that authors can expand on and address to create a manuscript that is more wide-reaching in terms of reader interests.</p><p>1) As the authors surely know, there are other protease recognition sites that do not necessarily contain polybasic tracts. Why do ENaC subunits have polybasic tracts? Is it due to the protease furin? When did furin emerge?</p><p>2) Related to the first comment, are there other protease sites in any of the ENaC subunits that are not polybasic? When did they emerge?</p><p>3) The authors provide RT-PCR data of ENaC subunits in different tissues derived from ropefish and African clawed frog. Can the authors explain the result in Figure 3 as to why there is no considerable signal of α and γ subunits, only faint bands of δ and β from frog skin? There are numerous functional data – seminal studies of ENaC, in fact – collected from frog skin that suggest a large role of ENaC in regulating Na<sup>+</sup> flux. Does the subunit composition on frog skin ENaC lack α and γ subunits?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.75796.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>[Editors’ note: the authors resubmitted a revised version of the paper for consideration.

Searches restricted to ray finned fishes only returned ENaC subunits in early branching Polypteriformes. Other top hits were either ASIC subunits or proteins annotated as &quot;ENaC-like&quot;. Searches restricted to non-vertebrate chordates also returned proteins annotated as ENaC-like proteins. Our phylogenetic analysis revealed that the ENaC-like proteins from lancelets and ray finned fishes belong to a clade distinct from ENaC and ASIC subunits. To address a question raised by Reviewer 2, we revised our manuscript to briefly discuss the ENaC-like proteins (page 11, line 31).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors mention a ENaC knockout in mice, but has this also been done in <italic>Xenopus</italic>?

These data are consistent with activating cleavage at the predicted polybasic sites in the GRIP domain (Figure 3 and page 6, line 29).

This is a well-written and clearly illustrated paper. I particularly like the summary figure (Figure 4).</p><p>The consensus sequence of the polybasic cleavage sites varies across tetrapods (Table 1). One concern I have is that it is assumed that all of these polybasic sequences support cleavage. What is known about the actual cleavage of these in vertebrates other than mammals? Have the ENac channels from frogs, say, been tested with mammalian (if not frog) enzymes to know that these polybasic sites are cleavable? It is concerning to read that &quot;The human d subunit sequence also exhibits a polybasic tract in this region, but experimental evidence shows that it is not cleaved.&quot; I would like to see some evidence from the literature or data from the authors demonstrating that the putative cleavage in non-mammalian proteins really occurs at these sites. It is possible they evolved for another reason initially and later became cleavage sites.</p></disp-quote><p>Cleavage of ENaC α and γ subunits from a frog (<italic>Xenopus laevis</italic>) has been confirmed, and proved to be functional (29576549). We revised our manuscript to highlight this result in the context of GRIP domain cleavage (page 6, line 13). We also performed new experiments to examine the ENaC g subunit from Australian lungfish expressed in <italic>Xenopus oocytes</italic>. Our data show cleavage of Australian lungfish γ ENaC at the predicted sites, and associated channel activation. These data are presented in Figure 3, and a new results subsection titled, Australian lungfish ENaC g subunit is cleaved at GRIP domain polybasic tracts (page 6, line 29)<italic>.</italic></p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>Wang et al. investigate the development of a protease-dependent regulatory mechanism of ENaC function. They specifically look into the emergence of polybasic tracts in the α and γ subunits. Furthermore, they compare transcript levels of ENaC subunits between ropefish and African clawed frog where the former independently developed lungs from tetrapods and the latter evolved after transitioning to terrestrial habitat. As it currently stands, this manuscript is focused on one topic, essentially the emergence of polybasic tract in ENaC subunits and is not well suited for a broader readership that eLife supports. There are a few comments that authors can expand on and address to create a manuscript that is more wide-reaching in terms of reader interests.</p><p>1) As the authors surely know, there are other protease recognition sites that do not necessarily contain polybasic tracts. Why do ENaC subunits have polybasic tracts? Is it due to the protease furin? When did furin emerge?</p></disp-quote><p>We have revised the discussion our manuscript (page 13, line 3) to address this issue as follows:</p><p>“Why do ENaC subunits have polybasic tracts? Integral membrane proteins including ENaC are further processed and sorted in the Golgi apparatus for transport to their destinations. Furin and other proprotein convertases are present in various parts of the Golgi complex and cleave after polybasic motifs where Arg is preferred in the last position (22679642). Selective double cleavage strongly increases ENaC currents, providing the functional change required for fitness based selection. ENaC processing through the Golgi, where furin or other proprotein convertases are present, may have led to the emergence of polybasic tracts. Furin homologs are present in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, consistent with furin emerging well before ENaC subunits, and before the divergence of deuterostomes and protostomes (1915835; 16763672).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Related to the first comment, are there other protease sites in any of the ENaC subunits that are not polybasic? When did they emerge?</p></disp-quote><p>The human ENaC γ subunit has non-polybasic protease sites adjacent to the distal polybasic site. However, the low sequence specificity of these proteases (e.g., plasmin, neutrophil elastase, and pancreatic elastase) poses a significant hurdle in tracking sites within a multiple sequence alignment. For example, neutrophil elastase has a moderate preference for cleavage after V, I, A, or T (MEROPS database). Cleavage at non-polybasic sites in non-mammalian ENaCs has also not been investigated. For these reasons, we cannot speculate as to when such sites emerged.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The authors provide RT-PCR data of ENaC subunits in different tissues derived from ropefish and African clawed frog. Can the authors explain the result in Figure 3 as to why there is no considerable signal of α and γ subunits, only faint bands of δ and β from frog skin? There are numerous functional data – seminal studies of ENaC, in fact – collected from frog skin that suggest a large role of ENaC in regulating Na<sup>+</sup> flux. Does the subunit composition on frog skin ENaC lack α and γ subunits?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for raising this concern as it directed us to an error. RT-PCR results for <italic>Xenopus</italic> α and δ were previously published, and although our results were largely consistent, the results for a and d in skin were switched with respect to the previous work. For this reason and band quality issues raised by Reviewer 1, we repeated the experiment using newly harvested tissues. New data were consistent with published results for a and d (Figure 4B). We do not know the source of the original discrepancy. Nonetheless, we did not detect ENaC γ subunit transcripts by RT-PCR in any of our newer frog skin preparations. ENaC channels in frog skin may therefore lack γ subunits, or γ subunits may be present despite sub-detectable levels of transcript.</p></body></sub-article></article>
