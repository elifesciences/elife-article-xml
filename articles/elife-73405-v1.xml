However, the molecular and cell biological mechanisms for switching the direction of movement remain unclear. Here, we visualized type IV pilus-dependent cell movement in the rod-shaped thermophilic cyanobacterium <italic>Thermosynechococcus vulcanus</italic> using optical microscopy at physiological temperature and light conditions. Positive and negative phototaxis were controlled on a short time scale of 1 min. The cells smoothly moved over solid surfaces towards green light, but the direction was switched to backward movement when we applied additional blue light illumination. The switching was mediated by three photoreceptors, SesA, SesB, and SesC, which have cyanobacteriochrome photosensory domains and synthesis/degradation activity of the bacterial second messenger cyclic dimeric GMP (c-di-GMP). Our results suggest that the decision-making process for directional switching in phototaxis involves light-dependent changes in the cellular concentration of c-di-GMP. Direct visualization of type IV pilus filaments revealed that rod-shaped cells can move perpendicular to the light vector, indicating that the polarity can be controlled not only by pole-to-pole regulation but also within-a-pole regulation. This study provides insights into previously undescribed rapid bacterial polarity regulation via second messenger signalling with high spatial resolution.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Cyanobacteria, like plants, grow by capturing energy from sunlight. But they have an advantage over their leafy counterparts: they can explore their environment to find the type of light that best suits their needs. These movements rely on hook-like structures, called type IV pili, which allow the cells to pull themselves forward. The pili are usually located at the opposite poles of a rod-shaped cell, allowing the bacteria to move along their longer axis. Yet, the molecular mechanisms that allow cyanobacteria to react to the light are poorly understood.</p><p>To explore these processes in more detail, Nakane, Enomoto et al. started by shining coloured lights on the rod-shaped cyanobacteria <italic>Thermosynechococcus vulcanus</italic>. This revealed that the cells moved towards green light but reversed rapidly when blue light was added. The behaviour was disrupted when the genes for three light-sensing proteins were artificially switched off. These molecular players act by changing the levels of cyclic di-GMP, a signalling molecule that may interact with type IV pili.</p><p>The experiments also showed that <italic>T. vulcanus</italic> cells were not only moving along their longer axis, but also at a right-angle. This observation contrasts with how other rod-shaped bacteria can explore their environment. A closer look revealed that the cyanobacteria could perform these movements by making asymmetrical adjustment to the way that pili at each pole were working. Further research is now needed to more finely dissect the molecular mechanisms which control this remarkable type of motion.</p></abstract><kwd-group

sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Cyanobacteria are phototrophic microorganisms, and optimal light conditions are crucial for efficient photosynthesis. Therefore, several cyanobacterial strains are able to move either into their preferred light habitat or away from a harmful or stressful environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Wilde and Mullineaux, 2017</xref>). This decision-making process is based on sensing the light direction and light intensity and quality on a short time scale. Moderate red light is used as the preferred energy source for oxygenic photosynthesis, while strong light or UV light causes cell damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Latifi et al., 2009</xref>). However, how cyanobacterial cells rapidly switch the direction of movement remains unclear.</p><p>Cyanobacterial movement is usually driven by type IV pili (T4P) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Wilde and Mullineaux, 2017</xref>), a general bacterial molecular machine. This machine enables cellular movement by repeated cycles of extension and retraction of the pili (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chang et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Craig et al., 2019</xref>). T4P are often localized at the cell poles in rod-shaped bacteria, and their localization at a certain pole is dynamically controlled to achieve directional movement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Talà et al., 2019</xref>). Bacteria, such as <italic>Pseudomonas,</italic> exhibit chemotactic behaviour to activate T4P at the leading pole on a time scale of hours. Consequently, the longer axis of cells is roughly aligned in parallel along the chemical gradient (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Oliveira et al., 2016</xref>). Cyanobacterial cells make a decision of directional movement in a few minutes upon light sensing by dedicated photoreceptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Nakane and Nishizaka, 2017</xref>). Once the lateral light stimulus is applied to the cells, they detect the orientation of a light source using their own cell body as an optical lens. In the coccoid <italic>Synechocystis</italic> sp. PCC 6803 (<italic>Synechocystis</italic>), the light is focused at the cell envelope, thereby generating a light spot opposite to the light source. Such micro-optic effects have been described in cyanobacteria of different shapes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Nakane and Nishizaka, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Schuergers et al., 2016</xref>). Yang et al. suggested that the rod-shaped cyanobacterium <italic>Synechococcus elongatus</italic> UTEX 3055 also utilizes the micro-optics effect to sense directional light by the polarly localized photoreceptor PixJ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Yang et al., 2018</xref>). However, T4P-dependent cell behaviour has not been clarified at the single-cell level in rod-shaped cyanobacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Yang et al., 2018</xref>). Furthermore, since most of the knowledge of phototaxis is derived from coccoid-shaped <italic>Synechocystis</italic>, how the polarity of the cell structure is involved in phototaxis regulation is not clear.</p><p>The nucleotide second messenger molecule cyclic dimeric GMP (c-di-GMP) is the critical molecule governing bacterial motility as the master regulator of bacterial lifestyle transitions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hengge, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Jenal et al., 2017</xref>). The high intracellular concentration of c-di-GMP is universally implicated in the repression of motility and induction of sessile multicellular community development. A decrease in c-di-GMP levels is often required for optimum motile behaviour involving T4P or flagella (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Jenal et al., 2017</xref>). The diguanylate cyclase activity mediated by GGDEF domains is necessary to produce c-di-GMP, whereas EAL and HD-GYP domains harbour phosphodiesterase activities to degrade c-di-GMP. These domains are often combined to signal sensory domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Agostoni et al., 2013</xref>), enabling bacterial cells to integrate multiple environmental information into cellular c-di-GMP levels to orchestrate various cellular responses to accomplish complex lifestyle transitions.</p><p>In this study, we establish a microscopy setup to analyse the phototaxis of the rod-shaped thermophilic cyanobacterium <italic>Thermosynechococcus vulcanus</italic> using live cells at the single-cell level. We dissect the contributions of different light colours and evaluate the functions of each putative photoreceptor gene. We show that both positive and negative phototaxis in <italic>T. vulcanus</italic> were controlled by a specific green-to-blue light ratio. Furthermore, we provide evidence that the reversion of phototaxis is mediated by photoreceptors and their activity in the synthesis or degradation of c-di-GMP. The asymmetric distribution of T4P at both cell poles achieves directional movement with a random orientation of the cells along their optical axis. We suggest a within-a-pole regulation of polarity that governs the directional movement of <italic>T. vulcanus</italic> and requires signalling at high spatiotemporal resolution. The light dependency of the phototactic response is consistent with a proposed model of <italic>T. vulcanus</italic> behaviour in a mat, which is their natural habitat.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Control of positive and negative phototaxis</title><p><italic>T. vulcanus</italic> used in this study was originally derived from the strain at the culture collection of NIES-2134 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://mcc.nies.go.jp/">http://mcc.nies.go.jp/</ext-link>). Since the original strain exhibited a heterogeneous phenotype of phototaxis under optimal growth conditions, a clone showing clear positive phototaxis in moderate light was isolated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Enomoto et al., 2018</xref>), and its complete genome was sequenced (AP018202). This clone was used as wild type (WT) in the following experiments. The strain also showed negative phototaxis when we applied a strong light stimulus. This bidirectional phototaxis was visualized as colony migration on a BG11 agar p late in a long-term observation for 8 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), consistent with previous data based on a closely related strain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kondou et al., 2001</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Positive and negative phototaxis of <italic>T</italic>.</title><p><italic>vulcanus</italic>.

The position of the rod-shaped cell was visualized by near-infrared light through a bandpass filter with a centre wavelength of 850 nm and a full width at half maximum of 40 nm from a halogen lamp with a fluence rate of 1 μmol m<sup>−2</sup> s<sup>−1</sup>, which was confirmed to have no effect on motility (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D,E</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kondou et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Nakane and Nishizaka, 2017</xref>). When we applied a lateral white illumination of 20 μmol m<sup>−2</sup> s<sup>−1</sup>, the cells started to exhibit directional movement towards the light source in a few minutes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, <italic>top</italic>). On the other hand, the cells showed directional movement away from the light source upon strong white light illumination of 500 μmol m<sup>−2</sup> s<sup>−1</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, <italic>bottom</italic>). The rose plot, a round histogram that simultaneously presents the number of occurrences and direction, indicates that lateral light illumination induced both positive and negative phototaxis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>).

The cell displacement was increased from 20 to 70 μmol m<sup>−2</sup> s<sup>−1</sup> of green light and remained positive even at 700 μmol m<sup>−2</sup> s<sup>−1</sup>, which is roughly one-third of the intensity of direct sunshine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). Note that under nonphysiological conditions at room temperature (25°C), the cells showed negative phototaxis under lateral green light due to a so far unknown mechanism (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video3">Video 3</xref>). Therefore, we performed all further experiments at the normal growth temperature of <italic>T. vulcanus</italic> at 45°C using the special microscopy setup developed here (see Materials and methods).</p><media id="video3" mime-subtype="mp4" mimetype="video" xlink:href="elife-73405-video3.mp4"><label>Video 3.</label><caption><title>Phototaxis at low temperature.</title><p>Lateral illumination of green light was turned on at time 0 from the right side of the movie. Wild type (WT) cells at 25°C. Area 750 × 563 μm.</p></caption></media><p>Next, we observed cell movement with a combination of two LEDs of different wavelengths simultaneously. We found that the direction of the phototactic response was reversed after a combination of green and blue light (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video4">Video 4</xref>), whereas the cells retained positive movement when green was combined with teal or red light. No directional movement was observed without green light (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4</xref>). These data suggest that blue light is responsible for the directional switch of phototaxis. To study these effects in more detail, we applied constant green-light intensity at 70 μmol m<sup>−2</sup> s<sup>−1</sup> and combined it with different blue light intensities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5">Figure 2—figure supplement 5</xref>). Illumination with 20 μmol m<sup>−2</sup> s<sup>−1</sup> blue light in addition to green light led only to a decrease in cell displacement, whereas 200 μmol m<sup>−2</sup> s<sup>−1</sup> blue light induced negative phototaxis in all cells. At more than 700 μmol m<sup>−2</sup> s<sup>−1</sup> blue light, however, the directionality of negative phototaxis became decreased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5">Figure 2—figure supplement 5E</xref>). In contrast, microcolony formation was enhanced under these conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5">Figure 2—figure supplement 5A</xref>). Notably, negative phototaxis was induced even when we applied blue light from the opposite side of the lateral green-light source, suggesting that the reversal of the phototaxis from positive to negative does not depend on the direction of blue light illumination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s6">Figure 2—figure supplement 6</xref>). In the following experiments, we used green light at 70 μmol m<sup>−2</sup> s<sup>−1</sup> for positive phototaxis and the combination of green light at 70 μmol m<sup>−2</sup> s<sup>−1</sup> and blue light at 200 μmol m<sup>−2</sup> s<sup>−1</sup> for negative phototaxis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). Under these conditions, the kymographs representing the spatial position of the cells along the lateral light axis over time depict examples of both positive and negative phototaxis as tilted lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>).

Note that no red/far-red absorbing phytochrome photoreceptor gene has been identified in the complete genome of <italic>T. vulcanus</italic>. All mutants showed positive phototaxis towards green light (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, upper), suggesting that none of these photoreceptors is involved in the control of positive phototaxis. Next, we applied green and blue light to check negative phototaxis and measured the displacement of cell displacement along the light axis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, lower). Whereas WT cells showed negative phototaxis upon lateral illumination with green and blue light, the Δ<italic>sesA</italic> mutant maintained positive phototaxis. SesA harbours a GGDEF domain and synthesizes the second messenger c-di-GMP in response to blue light (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Enomoto et al., 2015</xref>). This suggests that the directional switch from positive to negative phototaxis may be triggered by SesA-dependent c-di-GMP synthesis. This assumption is supported by measurements of the intracellular c-di-GMP concentration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). The WT showed a more than three times higher c-di-GMP content under blue light than under the other tested light conditions, such as green, red, and white light.

Comparative genomic analysis revealed a frameshift mutation in the gene <italic>tll1859</italic>, which encodes a GGDEF/EAL domain-containing protein. The frameshift mutation was found in the sequence encoding the C-terminal region of the EAL domain resulting in removal of a large part of this domain.

SesB degrades c-di-GMP, and its activity is upregulated under teal light irradiation. SesC is a bifunctional protein with enhanced c-di-GMP-producing activity under blue light and enhanced c-di-GMP-degrading activity under green light.

In bacterial twitching motility, cellular movement is driven by repeated cycles of extension and retraction of T4P (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">8</xref> ). In rod-shaped bacteria, such as <italic>Myxococcus</italic>, the T4P machinery is localized at cell poles and generates a directional bias presumably by the force generated at the leading pole along the longer axis of the cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Mercier et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Potapova et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Sabass et al., 2017</xref>). Here, we show that rod-shaped <italic>T. vulcanus</italic> cells showed directional movement even if the cell orientation was perpendicular to the lateral light axis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). This behaviour can be explained by asymmetric activation of T4P for the long cell axis at the pole on one side of the rod (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figures 7</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">8</xref>). Such localization of pili was supported by our bead assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F–H</xref>), which showed localized retraction of beads on the cell side that did not face the light source in negative phototaxis, and by the direct visualization of PilA1 filaments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). Local activation of T4P along the shorter axis of the cell would require a specific signalling system with high spatial resolution compared to the well-known pole-to-pole regulation by <italic>Myxococcus</italic> and <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kühn et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Mercier et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Potapova et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Sabass et al., 2017</xref>). In these bacteria, a dynamic change in the localization of the motor protein PilB between both poles leads to a directional switch in motility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kühn et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Mercier et al., 2020</xref>). The localization of PilB also seems to govern the direction of movement in <italic>Synechocystis</italic> phototaxis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Schuergers et al., 2015</xref>). Cell polarity for the short axis of the <italic>T. vulcanus</italic> cells might result in localization of the PilB protein to the leading side of the cell, driving directional movement even if the cell is oriented lengthwise with respect to the light source.</p><p>It remains an open question what the photoreceptor for positive phototaxis is. We showed that the gene disruption mutants of all photoreceptors identified to date for blue-to-green light still exhibited positive phototaxis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>), suggesting that another unrecognized photoreceptor for positive phototaxis might remain to be identified in this species. In a wild isolate of <italic>S. elongatus</italic>, the cyanobacteriochrome PixJ was reported to be responsible for directional light sensing in phototaxis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Yang et al., 2018</xref>). A homologue of the PixJ protein was also shown to localize at cell poles in a closely related <italic>Thermosynechococcus</italic> species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kondou et al., 2002</xref>). However, the <italic>pixJ</italic> orthologue is deleted from the genome of our WT strain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cheng et al., 2020</xref>). Recent work reported that the GAF domain-containing photoreceptor PixJ is not responsible for the phototactic motility of the filament-forming cyanobacterium <italic>Nostoc punctiforme</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Harwood et al., 2021</xref>). The authors hypothesized that the localized proton motive force is the first input for directional light sensing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Harwood et al., 2021</xref>). Considering the micro-optic effects in rod-shaped cyanobacteria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s3">Figure 7—figure supplement 3</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Yang et al., 2018</xref>), the spatial difference in light intensity between cell poles or different sides of the cell may be a universal key feature of T4P-dependent phototaxis. The focused green light would excite yet unknown photosensory molecules to induce spatially localized signalling, whereas the position of the focused blue light is not crucial for directional switching. As we showed, the direction of blue light illumination did not influence directionality of movement, because cells do not move in random orientation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s6">Figure 2—figure supplement 6</xref>). Thus, blue light does not control the directional light-sensing capability, instead it provides the signal for the switch between positive and negative phototaxis. This is very similar to the situation in <italic>Synechocystis</italic> where the blue light receptor PixD controls the switch between negative and positive phototaxis independently of the position of the blue-light source (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Sugimoto et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>How could c-di-GMP regulate the motility direction of <italic>T. vulcanus</italic> phototaxis? The 30–60 s delay of the cellular response upon on/off illumination with blue light under background green light might result from the modulation of intracellular c-di-GMP levels or the activation of other downstream events. Considering the fast response of the directional switching of <italic>T. vulcanus</italic> motility in one minute, we assume that toggle regulation does not involve transcriptional regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Song et al., 2011</xref>). As additional blue illumination has the same effect on phototaxis irrespective of the position of the blue light source (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s6">Figure 2—figure supplement 6</xref>), we also assume that the increased global cellular pool of c-di-GMP under these conditions regulates the switch in movement.</p><p>In <italic>Synechocystis</italic>, multiple signalling networks seem to be integrated via PATAN-REC proteins, which interact with PilB1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Han et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Jakob et al., 2020</xref>). We have not yet assessed the localization of the PilB protein, but we observed that the active pilus filaments face the direction of cell movement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figures 7</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">8</xref>). Notably, the MshEN domain in cyanobacterial PilB proteins is a potential c-di-GMP binding domain despite the lack of experimental evidence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wang et al., 2016</xref>). The switching between negative and positive phototaxis could be mediated by the binding and unbinding of c-di-GMP to PilB, respectively. Since we did not observe a change in pilus dynamics under green and green/blue light illumination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2</xref>), the T4P regulation in <italic>T. vulcanus</italic> may not be explained simply by a specific activation of PilB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Floyd et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hendrick et al., 2017</xref>). Therefore, we hypothesize that c-di-GMP binding to PilB could modify the affinity of its binding to other interaction partner(s), leading to the different localization of PilB regarding the incident light vector. Blue light increases the intracellular c-di-GMP content and represses motility in <italic>Synechocystis</italic> on phototaxis plates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Savakis et al., 2012</xref>), although short-term effects have not yet been explored. Whether c-di-GMP could induce a similar directional switching in other cyanobacterial species remains to be clarified. Notably, <italic>Synechocystis</italic> also switches from positive to negative phototaxis on a relatively short time scale by a different mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Jakob et al., 2020</xref>). High-intensity blue light is sensed by the BLUF-domain PixD photoreceptor. Upon excitation, the binding of PixD to the specific PATAN-domain CheY-like response regulator (PixE) is inhibited, and free PixE binds to PilB1, inducing a switch from red light-dependent positive to negative phototaxis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Jakob et al., 2020</xref>). In <italic>T. vulcanus</italic>, the lack of PixD did not lead to directional switching (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Thus, we suppose that different cyanobacteria have evolved specific photoreceptors and response mechanisms to control the switch between negative and positive phototaxis, presumably depending on their natural habitat and the ecophysiological context.</p><p><italic>T. vulcanus</italic> was initially isolated from a mat in a hot spring in Japan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Katoh et al., 2001</xref>). We previously reported that in multicellular cyanobacterial communities, the ratio between blue- and green-light changes from surface (blue rich) to green rich within a culture due to pigment absorption. Thus, through the concerted action of the SesABC photoreceptor system, c-di-GMP production would be activated at the surface, whereas within a cyanobacterial community, low cellular c-di-GMP levels would predominate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Enomoto and Ikeuchi, 2020</xref>). The current study suggests that in a biofilm or a mat, cells move away from the blue light-rich surface area, whereas they move upwards under green-rich conditions within the community (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). Such behaviour would lead to a dynamic circulation of <italic>Thermosynechococcus</italic> species inside a microbial mat under solar irradiance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Conradi et al., 2020</xref>). The high light/short wavelength-induced downward migration and green-light-induced upward migration of cyanobacteria in microbial mats are well documented (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bebout and Garcia-Pichel, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kruschel and Castenholz, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lichtenberg et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Nadeau et al., 1999</xref>). Future work on spatiotemporal processes in phototrophic mats can provide insights into the yet unknown molecular mechanisms of photomovements in ecophysiologically relevant niches.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Strains and culture conditions</title><p>The motile strains (WT) of <italic>T. vulcanus</italic> and its mutants were grown in BG-11 medium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Stanier et al., 1971</xref>) containing 20 mM Tris(hydroxymethyl)methyl-2aminoethanesulfonic acid(TES) (pH 7.5) as a buffer in moderate light (20 μmol m<sup>−2</sup> s<sup>−1</sup>) at 45°C with shaking to an optical density of approximately 0.5–1.0 at 750 nm.

(ASD-1510T; JVI, Japan). The position of the cell was visualized by infrared light from a halogen lamp with a bandpass filter (FBH850/40; Thorlabs) at a fluence rate of 1 μmol m<sup>−2</sup> s<sup>−1</sup>. The heat-absorbing filter was removed from the optical axis of the halogen lamp to obtain a higher wavelength of light. The signal from lateral light illumination was removed by a bandpass filter (FBH850/40; Thorlabs) in a filter block turret. The microscope stage was heated at 45°C with a thermoplate (TP-110R-100; Tokai Hit, Japan). Projections of the images were captured as greyscale images with the camera under 1-s resolution and converted into a sequential TIF file without any compression. All data were analysed by ImageJ 1.48v (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/">rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/</ext-link>) and its plugins, TrackMate, particle tracker and multitracker.</p><p>For the bead assay, the cells and microbeads were visualized under an inverted microscope (IX83; Olympus) equipped with ×40 objective lenses (LUCPLFLN40 × PH, NA0.6; Olympus), a CMOS camera (Zyla 4.2; Andor, or DMK33U174; Imaging Source), and an optical table (ASD-1510T; JVI, Japan). The position of the cell and microbeads was visualized by a collimated blue-light LED (M450LP1; Thorlabs) through a dark-field condenser (U-DCD, NA0.8–0.92; Olympus) at a fluence rate of 200 μmol m<sup>−2</sup> s<sup>−1</sup>. The microscope stage was heated at 45°C with a thermoplate (TP-110R-100; Tokai Hit). Projection of the image was captured as greyscale images with the camera under 0.1-s resolution and converted into a sequential TIF file without any compression.</p><p>For the direct visualization of fluorescent-labelled T4P filaments, the sample was examined under an inverted microscope (IX83; Olympus) equipped with a ×40 objective lens (LUCPLFLN40 × PH, NA0.6; Olympus), a filter set (GFP-4050B, Semrock), a CMOS camera (Zyla 4.2; Andor), and an optical table (ASD-1510T; JVI, Japan). A blue laser beam (wavelength of 488 nm; OBIS488LS, Coherent) was introduced into the inverted microscope through a lens for epi-fluorescence microscopy. The blue laser beam was also introduced from the lateral side of the microscope stage through a prism for TIRF, and the cells were observed on the upper side of the chamber. The microscope stage was heated at 45°C with a thermoplate (TP-110R-100; Tokai Hit). Projection of the image was captured with the camera as a greyscale image with 0.1-s resolution and converted into a sequential TIF file without any compression.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Phototaxis on glass with lateral light from LEDs</title><p>All procedures were performed at 45°C on a microscope stage heated with a thermoplate (TP-110R-100; Tokai Hit, Japan). The cell culture was poured into a tunnel chamber assembled by taping a coverslip (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Nakane and Nishizaka, 2017</xref>), and both ends of the chamber were sealed with nail polish to keep from drying the sample. The position of the cell was visualized by infrared light from a halogen lamp with a bandpass filter (FBH850/40; Thorlabs) at a fluence rate of 1 μmol m<sup>−2</sup> s<sup>−1</sup>. The cells were subjected to lateral light stimulus by an LED from the right side of the microscope stage at an angle of 5°. White LEDs at 20 and 500 μmol m<sup>−2</sup> s<sup>−1</sup> were used as moderate and strong light stimuli for phototaxis, respectively. Blue, teal, green, orange, red, and far-red light were applied by a monochromatic LED, M450LP1, M490L4, M530L3, M625L3, and M730L4 (Thorlabs), respectively. The LED light was collimated by the condenser lens and combined by dichroic mirrors (FF470-Di01, FF509-FDi01, FF560-FDi01, FF685-Di02; Semrock) to apply multicoloured light simultaneously. The wavelength of the resultant light was measured by a spectrometer (BIM-6002A, BroLight, China). Light intensity was measured with a power metre (Q82017A; Advantest, Japan).</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Measurement of intracellular c-di-GMP concentration</title><p>Liquid cultures (1.5 ml each) of WT and ∆<italic>sesA</italic> strain of <italic>T. vulcanus</italic> were transferred to three prewarmed 2-ml tubes.

For nucleotide extraction, cell pellets were immediately resuspended in 200 µl extraction solution (acetonitrile/methanol/water 2:2:1 [vol/vol/vol]), vortexed for 5 s, and heated at 95°C for 10 min. Samples were snap-cooled on ice and incubated for 15 min. The samples were centrifuged at 21,000 × <italic>g</italic> at 4°C for 10 min, and the supernatant was collected. The above extraction was repeated twice with 200 µl extraction solution each, without heat treatment. The combined supernatants (~600 µl) were incubated at −20°C overnight to precipitate proteins in the samples. The samples were centrifuged at 21,000 × <italic>g</italic> at 4°C for 10 min, and the supernatant was vacuum dried using SpeedVac at 42°C. Quantification of c-di-GMP was performed by HPLC/MS/MS analysis, as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Burhenne and Kaever, 2013</xref>). For quantification of the total protein content, the pelleted cells were stored at −20°C. The de-frozen cells were suspended in 50 µl phosphate-buffered saline. A glass bead mix (0.1–0.11 and 0.25–0.5 mm) of ~0.7 volume was added. The tubes were vortexed vigorously for 60 s, snap-cooled at −80°C, and heated to 40°C for 10 min. The disruption was repeated once and incubated at RT until the beads were sedimented. Two microlitres of the supernatant was used for protein quantification using the Direct Detect system (Merck Millipore). The acquired concentrations of intracellular c-di-GMP were normalized to the total protein content.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Genome resequencing of the phototactic negative <italic>T. vulcanus</italic> substrain</title><p>Genomic DNA of WT_N strain was prepared from a 40-ml culture with an optical density of ~2.0 with a Genomic-tip 20/G kit (Qiagen). Preparation of the paired-end DNA libraries and sequencing on the Illumina MiSeq platform were performed as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hirose et al., 2021</xref>). Raw sequence reads were deposited in the DDBJ Sequence Read Archive under accession number DRA013349. The low-quality region of the sequences was trimmed using fastq_quality_trimmer command with -t 20 and -l 36 options using FASTX-Toolkit (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://hannonlab.cshl.edu/fastx_toolkit/">http://hannonlab.cshl.edu/fastx_toolkit/</ext-link>). Mapping of the trimmed reads on the WT <italic>T. vulcanus</italic> genome (GenBank accession AP018202.2) was performed using bwa ver. 0.7.15 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Li and Durbin, 2009</xref>) and samtools ver. 1.3.1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Li et al., 2009</xref>).

A coverslip was coated with 0.2% (vol/vol) collodion in isoamyl acetate and air-dried before use. The cell culture was poured into a tunnel chamber assembled by taping a coverslip. After incubation at 45°C for 2 min on the microscope stage, the cells were subjected to vertical illumination from blue-light LED through a dark-field condenser at a fluence rate of 200 μmol m<sup>−2</sup> s<sup>−1</sup>. After illumination for 2 min, fluorescent beads were added to the sample chamber, and their movement was visualized by blue light illumination at 0.1-s intervals. Lateral illumination from green-light LEDs was applied for 2 min before adding the beads if needed.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>PilA labelling for fluorescence microscopy</title><p>Pilus filaments of the PilA1<sup>S114C</sup> mutant were labelled using maleimide-conjugated fluorophores (DyLight488 maleimide 46602, Thermo Fisher).

Your article has been reviewed by 2 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Tâm Mignot as a Reviewing Editor and Gisela Storz as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Yuki Inclan (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1. While both reviewers agree that the work is potentially of broad significance, they insist that mechanistic links are currently missing to make the claim that the identified SesABC connect to Type-IV pili (TFP) activity via the increase intracellular cdiGMP. While it is understood that identifying a cdiGMP receptor for TFP function is probably beyond the scope of the present manuscript, a significant additional body of evidence linking cdiGMP levels to TFP activity in the context of phototaxis is deemed essential for acceptance of this manuscript.</p><p>2. The observation that the cells are able to steadily move along the light axis but perpendicular to their long axis is very interesting considering the T4P appear to be bipolarly localized. However, there is currently little proposed mechanism. It is possible that subpolar pili are activated but it also possible that consecutive activation of the pili at opposite poles lead to biased motions. Showing single cell videos and a more thorough analysis of T4P filament dynamics depending on positive/negative phototaxis and according to the angle of the cell would provide necessary additional insights.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The authors use a custom optical set up to visualize individual cells and microcolonies of T. vulcanus phototaxing towards teal/green light and away from blue-green light. This directed motility is dependent on T4P. They went on to identify the photoreceptors, SesA, SesB, and SesC which are required for negative phototaxis and these photoreceptors contain c-di-GMP synthesis and degradation domains. They showed that the concentration of the second messenger c-di-GMP correlates with the direction of phototaxis, with higher levels of c-di-GMP resulting in negative phototaxis. They also observed that the rod-shaped cells moving along the incident light axis can move consistently perpendicular to their long axis during phototaxis and suggest that this observation shows a polarity regulation coined &quot;within-a-pole&quot; polarity regulation of the polarly localized T4P.</p><p>The conclusions of this paper are mostly supported by the data. A major strength of this study is the careful microscopy and analysis. The experiments are clearly described in the text and the results are communicated well in the figures. The kymographs and videos are striking with the results of cells phototaxing towards green light and away from green light when blue light is present. The assays with the changing wavelengths and cell velocity responses are very clear. It is convincing that T4P are required for phototaxis of T. vulcanus.</p><p>The genetic link to phototaxis showing that SesA, SesB and SesC is convincing, but some details could strengthen the link. For example, the microcolony aggregation is an interesting but confounding factor. The conclusions would be strengthened if the authors could decouple the microcolony formation from phototaxis.</p><p>The observation that the cells are able to steadily move along the light axis but perpendicular to their long axis is very interesting considering the T4P appear to be bipolarly localized. There is some discussion on the micro-optic effect in single cells but it does not include the observation that the negative phototaxis to green light occurs no matter where the direction of blue light comes from or the micro-optic effect in a microcolony.</p><p>This work nicely illustrates how observing single cells can inform macroscopic phenotypes in the lab or in natural habitats.</p><p>This is wonderful work and I only have a few comments and questions about the work and potential experiments:</p><p>It appears that the higher the fluence of blue light, the higher the velocity of the cells and the more microcolonies are formed. Is there a dependence on the microcolony size to the velocity, or the pili numbers/density? Do the cells move faster with more pili and do those cells also have more c-di-GMP? Is anything known about the transcriptional regulation of the T4P in T. vulcanus?</p><p>In that same vein, for Figure 6-supplement 2, Is there a dependence on the velocity of the pili extension/retraction with increasing fluence? Or, why does the velocity of the cells increase with increasing fluence as shown in Figure 2 —figure supplement 5.</p><p>The link between SesA, SesB and SesC and negative phototaxis could be strengthened if the authors can decouple microcolony formation and negative phototaxis. The reference Enomoto, PNAS 2015 describes a PilZ protein T110007 involved in aggregation. Can the authors use a mutant to abolish the cell aggregation phenotype and only look at single cells? In addition, if a DGC is expressed from a heterologous expression system in a ∆sesA mutant, will that non-specific increase in c-di-GMP rescue the negative phototaxis phenotype? And conversely if a PDE is expressed in wt, will negative phototaxis still occur in the presence of blue light?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>In this manuscript Nakane et al., investigate the phototaxis of the rod shaped bacteria Thermosynechococcus vulcanus. This is important because most our knowledge on phototaxis bacteria originates from study on round shaped cell. More precisely, the author's firstly convincingly demonstrate a positive and a negative phototaxis in T. vulcanus, regulated by a green to blue light ratio. Secondly, the author's show the implication of SesABC proteins in the negative phototaxis regulation, via a potential modulation of the C-di-GMP level in the cell. Finally, the author's characterised the T4P-dependant motility as the output for phototactic behaviours in T. vulcanus. The authors further investigated the T4P dynamics during negative phototaxis using fluorescent beads.</p><p>Overall the work present in the manuscript is well carry out and conclusions drawn from experiments are largely correct. Nevertheless, my general impression is that the proposed manuscript is at this stage premature. The present work needs further experiments to strength the actual conclusions but also to get more molecular details. Ultimately, a final working model would be beneficial to summarise the proposed molecular links from SesABC to T4P regulation.</p><p>I – The author's attribute the defect of negative phototaxis observed in the SesA mutant to the level of C-di-GMP in the cell, mainly because a SesA mutant shows a two fold decrease in C-di-GMP concentration upon blue light treatment. However, this measurement has been realised in a batch culture and normalised to dry cell mass. At the opposite, the negative phototaxis observed at single cell level occurs in a range of less than a minute (Figure 2). It would be therefore important for the authors to strength the implication of C-di-GMP in the phototaxis regulation. For example, the authors could ectopically modulate the level of C-di-GMP in the cell, via the expression of ectopic a diguanylate cyclase or phosphodiesterase enzymes, and observe its effect on phototaxis.</p><p>II – The author's used fluorescent beads to visualize T4P dynamics. As it was previously described, the author's show that it is specific of the T4P activity and it also can reveal T4P retraction. Then, the author's used this method to convincingly show that cells that move perpendicular of the light source have only active pili at one half of the both cell poles (Fig6). It is an interesting observation but again it gets short of details.</p><p>– The manuscript would definitively benefit from more general analysis of T4P dynamics during phototaxis. For example, during the switch from positive to negative phototaxis. What are the behaviours (T4P pole activation) of cells parallel to the light source?</p><p>– Besides, as suggested by the authors in the discussion, having the intracellular localisation of the Atpase PilB would definitively be a plus.</p><p>– Moreover, in the Discussion section the author proposed the existence of &quot;a specific signalling system with high special resolution&quot; to explain the asymmetric polar T4P activation. Why could it not be a molecular mechanism similar to the one observed in round cell such as Synechocystis, where the light receptor PixD regulates T4P function at some part of the cell according to the direction of the light.</p><p>III – The links between the C-di-GMP concentration and T4P dynamics during the switch from positive to negative phototaxis is absent. The author's proposed in the discussion a potential binding of C-di-GMP to PilB as previously shown for some T4P. Could it be tested here by the author's since they seem to be able to handle C-di-GMP?</p><p>1 – What is the motility phenotype on plate of the different ses mutants as in Figure 1A?</p><p>2 – It would be interesting for the reader to have a sup video a pil mutant during phototaxis.</p><p>3 – Line 228. The authors conclude that T. vulacanus has a bipolar localisation of T4P. At this stage in the manuscript, I don't see how the authors can conclude this, since only one pole is presented.</p><p>4 – Line 255. The data showing that in a pilB mutant beads do not accumulate is not referenced in the text.</p><p>5 – As a general idea, since T. vulcanus is genetically tractable, could it be feasible to realise a Tn-seq combined with a batch motility selection upon light similar to Figure 1A to uncover other phototaxis regulators?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.73405.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1.

We were able to isolate a spontaneous mutant that showed constitutive negative phototaxis under white light. Genome sequencing identified a frameshift mutation in the <italic>tll1859</italic> gene, which encodes a GGDEF/EAL domain protein (Figure 4AB). Introducing the same mutation in our original wild type confirmed that this frameshift mutation is responsible for negative phototaxis even under green light irradiation (Figure 4C-G). Further, we have measured a higher c-di-GMP concentration in both mutant strains in comparison to the wild type, suggesting that Tll1859 has phosphodiesterase activity. This additional experimental evidence independently supports our idea that increased c-di-GMP levels switch the direction of T4P-dependent phototaxis from positive to negative in <italic>Thermosynechococcus</italic>.

Most importantly, we succeeded in direct visualization of T4P filaments in living cells of a PilA1–cysteine knock-in mutant using a maleimide-conjugated dye. This method was recently established for T4P of several heterotrophic bacteria. Our new experiments clearly show that the <italic>Thermosynechococcus</italic> T4P filaments are bipolarly localized and assemble and retract at both cell poles simultaneously (Figure 8). When the cells move perpendicular to their long axis, the T4P filaments at both poles show a biased distribution in the direction of cellular movement (Figure 8EF). These results support our idea that the T4P are indeed asymmetrically activated within a single cell pole. We have added a chapter in the Results part for these experiments and also modified the text to explain our ideas more clearly.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>[…]</p><p>The observation that the cells are able to steadily move along the light axis but perpendicular to their long axis is very interesting considering the T4P appear to be bipolarly localized.

As we showed, the direction of blue light illumination did not influence directionality of movement, because cells do not move in random orientation (Figure 2 —figure supplement 6). Thus, blue light does not control the directional light-sensing capability, instead it provides the signal for the switch between positive and negative phototaxis. This is very similar to the situation in Synechocystis where the blue light receptor PixD controls the switch between negative and positive phototaxis independently of the position of the blue-light source (Sugimoto et al., 2017).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>This work nicely illustrates how observing single cells can inform macroscopic phenotypes in the lab or in natural habitats.</p><p>This is wonderful work and I only have a few comments and questions about the work and potential experiments:</p><p>It appears that the higher the fluence of blue light, the higher the velocity of the cells and the more microcolonies are formed. Is there a dependence on the microcolony size to the velocity, or the pili numbers/density? Do the cells move faster with more pili and do those cells also have more c-di-GMP? Is anything known about the transcriptional regulation of the T4P in T. vulcanus?</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate your interesting comments. At the moment, it would be too early to conclude about direct correlations between light intensity, velocity, pili numbers, and microcolony size. The cells show directional switching from positive to negative phototaxis when the ratio of blue light to green light was increased (Figure 2 —figure supplement 5E). The effect of a higher blue-to-green light ratio is not consistent. The negative phototaxis response was fast and directional at a ratio of 200/70 μmol m<sup>−2</sup> s<sup>−1</sup> blue/green light and this ratio also led to the formation of microcolonies. However, the directionality of phototaxis was decreased when the blue-light portion was increased by a factor of 10 (Figure 2 —figure supplement 5E). In contrast, microcolony formation was enhanced under these conditions (Figure 2 —figure supplement 5A). We have added the following sentence:</p><p>“At more than 700 μmol m<sup>−2</sup> s<sup>−1</sup> blue light, however, the directionality of negative phototaxis became decreased (Figure 2 —figure supplement 5E). In contrast, microcolony formation was enhanced under these conditions (Figure 2 —figure supplement 5A).”</p><p>In general, we think that we have created some confusion by the term “velocity,” which we have used to describe the distance which cells traveled between point A and point B along the light axis. This “velocity” depends on the speed of the cells as well as on how direct the cells move from A to B. Therefore, we have changed “velocity” to the term “displacement” which we think describes now more clearly this characteristic. In addition, there seems to be no direct correlation between displacement and c-di-GMP concentration. In our new experiment using mutants with an overall higher c-di-GMP content (Figure 4), there was no effect on the mean displacement of cells. Therefore, we think that c-di-GMP seems to be a signal for the directional switch, but not for velocity. Whether cells would move faster with more pili, we cannot say at the moment. Most probably, there is a trade-off between velocity, directionality, number (but also length) of pili, and microcolony formation. In addition, the production of more pili requires more motor ATPases and more coordination to ensure efficient extension and retraction dynamics of the pili. The pilus labeling methods we have established in the revised version of this manuscript might be the key to answer all these questions in the future.</p><p>In other cyanobacteria, various signaling inputs are transduced to the transcriptional regulation of type IV pili components, including circadian rhythm (Taton et al., Nat Commun, 2020) and cAMP (Yoshimura et al., Plant Cell Physiol, 2002). Notably, c-di-GMP also controls the transcription of several minor pilins in Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 (Wallner et al., Photochem. Photobiol. Sci., 2020). These previous reports suggested that minor components of the pili filaments may govern cellular behavior, such as motility and biofilm formation. However, we have no data on transcriptional regulation of T4P genes in Thermosynechococcus and the role of minor pilins in this organism. Therefore, in the future, we plan to reveal the molecular events of c-di-GMP-induced directional switching, including the composition of the Thermosynechococcus type IV pili filaments, in more detail.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In that same vein, for Figure 6-supplement 2, Is there a dependence on the velocity of the pili extension/retraction with increasing fluence? Or, why does the velocity of the cells increase with increasing fluence as shown in Figure 2 —figure supplement 5.</p></disp-quote><p>Actually, we do not show that velocity (displacement) increases with blue light intensity. In Figure 2 – supplement 5E, cells switch between positive and negative phototaxis, but the mean displacement is more or less the same (+30 versus −30). It even decreases from −30 to around −20 when the intensity of the blue light increases (from 200 to 2,000 μmol m<sup>−2</sup> s<sup>−1</sup>)<italic>.</italic> It would be very challenging for us to assess the dependency of the velocity of the pili dynamics on the light intensity. We are not able to detect the movement of the beads without the application of strong light illumination in our experimental setup. However, to address this question, we have performed additional experiments to measure the displacement of single cells, which are summarized in the new Figure 8 and Videos 17-20. The cells show the asymmetric distribution of T4P filaments within a cell pole during directional movement. This increased asymmetry of pilus activation at both poles might cause an overall increase of cell displacement during phototaxis. We have added a chapter in the Results part for these experiments.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The link between SesA, SesB and SesC and negative phototaxis could be strengthened if the authors can decouple microcolony formation and negative phototaxis. The reference Enomoto, PNAS 2015 describes a PilZ protein T110007 involved in aggregation. Can the authors use a mutant to abolish the cell aggregation phenotype and only look at single cells? In addition, if a DGC is expressed from a heterologous expression system in a ∆sesA mutant, will that non-specific increase in c-di-GMP rescue the negative phototaxis phenotype? And conversely if a PDE is expressed in wt, will negative phototaxis still occur in the presence of blue light?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for these interesting ideas. However, we were not able to decouple microcolony formation and negative phototaxis so far. Note that the short-term microcolony formation under the microscope and the long-term cell aggregation seem to be two independent phenomena. We previously showed that the ∆<italic>sesA</italic> mutant cannot form macroscopic cell aggregation (Enomoto et al., PNAS, 2015), but it showed microcolony formation under microscopy even in the absence of negative phototaxis. This result suggests that blue light-induced microcolony formation seems to be independent of the c-di-GMP signaling network. It is a future challenge to address what molecular events govern the microcolony/biofilm formation of this cyanobacterium.</p><p>Utilizing heterologous expressions in <italic>T. vulcanus</italic> is challenging for yet unknown reasons. In addition, the functionality of heterologously expressed proteins is sometimes impaired, possibly due to the high-temperature cultivation at 45°C. However, we have got another independent experimental evidence for the role of c-di-GMP as a regulator of phototaxis direction. By comparative genomics, we identified a frameshift mutation in a putative phosphodiesterase gene that confers an increase of the intracellular c-di-GMP concentration (see our answer to the editor’s comment 1). These mutants showed negative phototaxis under conditions where WT cells showed positive phototaxis (Figure 4). We have added a paragraph in the Results part for these experiments.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>In this manuscript Nakane et al., investigate the phototaxis of the rod shaped bacteria Thermosynechococcus vulcanus. This is important because most our knowledge on phototaxis bacteria originates from study on round shaped cell. More precisely, the authors firstly convincingly demonstrate a positive and a negative phototaxis in T. vulcanus, regulated by a green to blue light ratio. Secondly, the author's show the implication of SesABC proteins in the negative phototaxis regulation, via a potential modulation of the C-di-GMP level in the cell. Finally, the author's characterised the T4P-dependant motility as the output for phototactic behaviours in T. vulcanus. The authors further investigated the T4P dynamics during negative phototaxis using fluorescent beads.</p><p>Overall the work present in the manuscript is well carry out and conclusions drawn from experiments are largely correct. Nevertheless, my general impression is that the proposed manuscript is at this stage premature. The present work needs further experiments to strength the actual conclusions but also to get more molecular details. Ultimately, a final working model would be beneficial to summarise the proposed molecular links from SesABC to T4P regulation.</p><p>I – The author's attribute the defect of negative phototaxis observed in the SesA mutant to the level of C-di-GMP in the cell, mainly because a SesA mutant shows a two fold decrease in C-di-GMP concentration upon blue light treatment. However, this measurement has been realised in a batch culture and normalised to dry cell mass. At the opposite, the negative phototaxis observed at single cell level occurs in a range of less than a minute (Figure 2). It would be therefore important for the authors to strength the implication of C-di-GMP in the phototaxis regulation. For example, the authors could ectopically modulate the level of C-di-GMP in the cell, via the expression of ectopic a diguanylate cyclase or phosphodiesterase enzymes, and observe its effect on phototaxis.</p></disp-quote><p>We highly appreciate your evaluation and comments. As we pointed out in our response to reviewer 2, utilizing heterologous expression systems in <italic>T. vulcanus</italic> is challenging, maybe due to the cultivation of cells at of 45°C. However, we were lucky in isolating a spontaneous mutant (named WT_N) that shows constitutive negative phototaxis under lateral light illumination. By comparative genomics, we identified the frameshift mutation that confers an increase of the intracellular concentration of c-di-GMP and which was accompanied by negative phototaxis under the condition where the WT cells showed positive phototaxis (Figure 4). We have added a paragraph in the Results part for these experiments. See also our comments to the other reviewer and the editor concerning these new experiments, which support the role of c-di-GMP in directional switching. In addition, the figure formerly assigned as Figure 3 —figure supplement 1 was moved to the main manuscript as Figure 3C, because we think that the data of the intracellular concentration of c-di-GMP are very important to support our conclusions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>II – The author's used fluorescent beads to visualize T4P dynamics. As it was previously described, the author's show that it is specific of the T4P activity and it also can reveal T4P retraction. Then, the author's used this method to convincingly show that cells that move perpendicular of the light source have only active pili at one half of the both cell poles (Fig6). It is an interesting observation but again it gets short of details.</p><p>– The manuscript would definitively benefit from more general analysis of T4P dynamics during phototaxis. For example, during the switch from positive to negative phototaxis. What are the behaviours (T4P pole activation) of cells parallel to the light source?</p><p>– Beside, as suggested by the author's in the discussion, having the intracellular localisation of the Atpase PilB would definitively be a plus.</p><p>– Moreover, in the Discussion section the author proposed the existence of &quot;a specific signalling system with high special resolution&quot; to explain the asymmetric polar T4P activation. Why could it not be a molecular mechanism similar to the one observed in round cell such as Synechocystis, where the light receptor PixD regulates T4P function at some part of the cell according to the direction of the light.</p></disp-quote><p>In order to get more direct insights into T4P dynamics, we have performed additional experiments, which are summarized in Figure 8 and Videos 17-20. Importantly, we succeeded in visualizing T4P filaments by PilA1 labelling using live cells. The T4P filaments were bipolarly localized and showed dynamics of assembly and retraction at both cell poles. When the cells moved perpendicular to their long axis, the T4P filaments at both poles showed biased distribution towards the same direction of cellular movement. These results support our idea that T4P are asymmetrically activated within a single cell pole. This asymmetric activation can rely on the localization of PilB ATPase. We would like to address how a molecular machinery such as PilB governs directional switching events. However, GFP-tagging has not been established in thermophilic cyanobacteria so far. We have added a chapter in the Results part for these experiments. Please, also pay attention to our answers to similar comments of the other reviewer.</p><p>Our results suggest that the <italic>T. vulcanus</italic> cell can actuate the spatially resolved signaling even within a cell pole to activate the pilus activity at only one side of a cell pole to enable biased cellular movements. This finding means that the cell harnesses &quot;a specific signalling system with high special resolution&quot; compared to other rod-shaped bacteria showing pole-to-pole regulation of cell polarity. We do not exclude that a system which works similar to the PixD/PixE complex in <italic>Synechocystis</italic> contributes to the asymmetric localization of the pili in <italic>Thermosynechococcus</italic> motility. <italic>Thermosynechococcus</italic> encodes a PixD protein but no PixE homolog. For <italic>Synechocystis</italic>, it was shown very recently that PATAN domain response regulators (including PixE) bind PilB1 and PilC and can switch the direction of movement (Han et al., Mol. Microbiol. 2021). <italic>Thermosynechococcus</italic> encodes homologs of such PATAN-domain response regulators, but at the moment, we do not know whether they have a similar function in both cyanobacteria.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>III – The links between the C-di-GMP concentration and T4P dynamics during the switch from positive to negative phototaxis is absent. The author's proposed in the discussion a potential binding of C-di-GMP to PilB as previously shown for some T4P. Could it be tested here by the author's since they seem to be able to handle C-di-GMP?</p></disp-quote><p>The experimental verification of the binding of c-di-GMP to PilB is ongoing work, but it seems that direct binding of c-di-GMP to PilB is either very weak or does not happen in our setup. Thus, detailed molecular events of c-di-GMP signaling are out of the scope of the current study. However, we do show in the revised version of the manuscript that pilus extension and retraction dynamics are not different between positive and negative phototaxis (Figure 7 − figure supplement 2), suggesting that c-di-GMP most probably does not affect the activity of the PilB protein. Therefore, we have modified the sentence about the binding of c-di-GMP to PilB in the Discussion part as follows:</p><p>“Since we did not observe a change in pilus dynamics under green and green/blue light illumination (Figure 7 − figure supplement 2), the T4P regulation in T. vulcanus may not be explained simply by a specific activation of PilB (Floyd et al., 2020, Hendrick et al., 2017).”</p><p>In addition, we have performed experiments to show additional data that the c-di-GMP levels switch the direction of T4P-dependent phototaxis (new Figure 4). We also performed additional experiments to visualize T4P dynamics by PilA labeling (new Figure 8), which suggest asymmetric activation of pili and most probably of the motor ATPases as well.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1 – What is the motility phenotype on plate of the different ses mutants as in Figure 1A?</p></disp-quote><p>The ses mutants showed positive phototaxis on agar plates under lateral green light illumination. Generally, phototaxis assays on agar plates take at least several hours for observation. Since long time-scale responses are rather complicated to control, because of various changing parameters, such as media compositions and self-shading effects, we focused on the cell behavior in a short time scale in this work. Therefore, data on long time-scale responses are not discussed in this manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2 – It would be interesting for the reader to have a sup video a pil mutant during phototaxis.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added the video of Δ<italic>pilB</italic> mutant cells under green light illumination (Video 11).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3 – Line 228.
