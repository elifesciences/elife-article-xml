How metformin diminishes tumor growth is not fully understood. In this study, we report that in human cancer cells, metformin inhibits mitochondrial complex I (NADH dehydrogenase) activity and cellular respiration. Metformin inhibited cellular proliferation in the presence of glucose, but induced cell death upon glucose deprivation, indicating that cancer cells rely exclusively on glycolysis for survival in the presence of metformin. Metformin also reduced hypoxic activation of hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1). All of these effects of metformin were reversed when the metformin-resistant <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> NADH dehydrogenase NDI1 was overexpressed. In vivo, the administration of metformin to mice inhibited the growth of control human cancer cells but not those expressing NDI1. Thus, we have demonstrated that metformin's inhibitory effects on cancer progression are cancer cell autonomous and depend on its ability to inhibit mitochondrial complex I.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.02242.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.02242.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.02242.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Metformin is widely used to reduce the high blood sugar levels caused by diabetes. Recently, several studies have suggested that patients taking metformin who also develop cancer have tumors that grow more slowly than average. As clinical trials have already started to investigate if metformin is an effective anti-cancer treatment, it is important to understand how it might restrict tumor growth.</p><p>Researchers have proposed two ways that metformin could affect tumors. First, insulin is known to prompt cancer cells to divide, so the slower rate of tumor growth could just be a side-effect of the metformin reducing the amount of insulin in the blood. Alternatively, metformin could target cancer cells more directly by cutting the energy supply produced by their mitochondria. Metformin has been shown to disrupt complex I of the electron transport chain that is used by cells to generate energy. However, it is not known if disrupting complex I would actually stop cells dividing because they can generate energy in other ways.</p><p>Wheaton, Weinberg et al. have now demonstrated that metformin does target complex I in cancer cells, and that its effects depend on the amount of glucose available for cells to convert, without involving mitochondria, into energy. When there is plenty of glucose, metformin slows down the rate at which cancer cells divide, which slows down tumor growth. When the cells are deprived of glucose, metformin kills the cells instead.</p><p>Metformin also inhibits the pathways that regulate hypoxia inducible factors (HIFs), which are part of a system that helps cells to survive low-oxygen conditions, a prominent feature of many tumors. This means that metformin may combat cancer more effectively if used alongside other treatments that reduce the availability of both oxygen and glucose inside cells. Metformin could also potentially treat conditions that are linked to overactive HIFs, such as pulmonary hypertension.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.02242.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.02242.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>metformin</kwd><kwd>cancer</kwd><kwd>mitochondria</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RO1 CA123067</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chandel</surname><given-names>Navdeep S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>T32GM08061</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sullivan</surname><given-names>Lucas B</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>T32HL076139</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Weinberg</surname><given-names>Samuel E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The anti-diabetic drug metformin, currently in clinical trials as a potential anti-cancer agent, reduces tumor growth by inhibiting mitochondrial complex I of human cancer cells.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Metformin is widely used to treat patients with type II diabetes mellitus who have high levels of circulating insulin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Nathan et al., 2009</xref>). Metformin suppresses liver gluconeogenesis thereby reducing glucose release from the liver (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Inzucchi et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Viollet et al., 2012</xref>). In several recent retrospective studies, investigators have observed an association between metformin use and diminished tumor progression in patients suffering from different types of cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Evans et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bowker et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dowling et al., 2012</xref>). These data have prompted several prospective clinical trials to determine the efficacy of metformin as an anti-cancer agent. However, the underlying mechanism by which metformin diminishes tumor growth is not fully understood.</p><p>There are two postulated mechanisms by which metformin reduces tumor growth. Metformin may act at the organismal level, reducing levels of circulating insulin, a known mitogen for cancer cells. Alternatively, metformin may act in a cancer cell autonomous manner. Metformin is known to inhibit mitochondrial complex I in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Ota et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">El-Mir et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Owen et al., 2000</xref>) and it is thus possible that this targeting of the electron transport chain could inhibit tumor cell growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Birsoy et al., 2012</xref>). This latter hypothesis has been questioned as cancer cells have the ability to survive on ATP produced exclusively by glycolysis. Furthermore, cancer cells have been shown to conduct glutamine-dependent reductive carboxylation to generate the TCA cycle intermediates required for cell proliferation when the electron transport chain is inhibited (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Mullen et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fendt et al., 2013</xref>). Thus, it is not clear whether inhibition of complex I by metformin would result in decreasing tumor growth. In the present study, we directly tested whether inhibition of cancer cell mitochondrial complex I by metformin was required to decrease cell proliferation in vitro and tumor progression in vivo<italic>.</italic></p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>Human HCT116 p53<sup>−/−</sup> colon cancer cells have previously shown to be sensitive to metformin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Buzzai et al., 2007</xref>).

NDI1 is a single-subunit NADH dehydrogenase, which oxidizes NADH in a process similar to the multi-subunit mammalian complex I; however without proton pumping or ROS generation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Seo et al., 1998</xref>). By contrast, mammalian complex I contains 45 subunits that pumps protons and generates ROS. NDI1-HCT 116 p53<sup>−/−</sup> cells demonstrated a slight, non-significant elevation in basal cellular oxygen consumption compared to control cells and were completely resistant to the effects of metformin on cellular oxygen consumption (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>).</p><p>To ensure that the inhibition of cellular oxygen consumption by metformin was a direct effect of metformin on complex I, we examined mitochondrial respiratory function in saponin-permeabilized cells. Saponin removes cholesterol from plasma membranes, allowing the entry of metabolic substrates directly to mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Jamur and Oliver, 2010</xref>). In the presence of ADP and the complex I substrates pyruvate and malate, metformin fully inhibited oxygen consumption in permeabilized Control-HCT 116 p53<sup>−/−</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). By contrast, metformin had no effect on pyruvate/malate-driven oxygen consumption in NDI1-HCT 116 p53<sup>−/−</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Metformin also had no effect on oxygen consumption in saponin-permeabilized cells respiring on the complex II substrate succinate in the presence of ADP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Interestingly, in saponin-permeabilized cells, metformin significantly inhibited complex I-dependent respiration at a much lower concentration than that required to inhibit oxygen consumption of intact cells, suggesting that transport across the plasma membrane is a barrier to metformin's inhibition of complex I. Metformin is known to slowly accumulate in cells in which its uptake is mediated by organic cation transporters (OCTs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Emami Riedmaier et al., 2013</xref>). To ensure that NDI1-HCT 116 p53<sup>−/−</sup> cells are not refractory to metformin because of a change in metformin uptake, we analyzed the expression of OCT 1 in both control and NDI1-HCT 116 p53<sup>−/−</sup> cells. Expression of OCT1 protein did not change with the presence of NDI1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>).</p><p>We next sought to determine if metformin-dependent inhibition of complex I resulted in changes in proliferation and survival of HCT116 p53<sup>−/−</sup> cells.

Metformin inhibited proliferation of wild-type Control-CCL16 hamster fibroblasts but not that of B2-CCL16 cells or of B2-CCL16 cells reconstituted with NDI1 (NDI1-CCL16). Metformin and phenformin inhibited cellular oxygen consumption in wild-type CCL16 but not in CCL16-NDI1 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1 fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 1 and 2</xref>). When these cells were cultured in galactose-substituted media, both metformin and phenformin induced cell death only in wild-type CCL16 cells. Survival of NDI1-CCL16 cells was not affected by metformin or phenformin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1 fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplements 1 and 2</xref>). The B2-CCL16 cells die in galactose in the absence of metformin or phenformin since they harbor a mutation in complex I. Taken together, these results confirm that the anti-proliferative effects of metformin and phenformin require mitochondrial complex I inhibition.</p><p>The positive charge of metformin has been proposed to account for it is accumulation within the matrix of mitochondria that exhibit a robust inner mitochondria membrane potential (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Owen et al., 2000</xref>). Alternatively, the non-polar hydrocarbon-side chain of the drug could promote binding to complexes within mitochondrial membranes. We tested whether the mitochondrial membrane potential is necessary for metformin-dependent inhibition of complex I. Saponin-permeabilized Control-HCT 116 p53<sup>−/−</sup> cells were induced to respire on pyruvate/malate in the presence of either ADP or CCCP. Although both ADP and CCCP induce mitochondrial respiration, only CCCP depolarizes mitochondrial inner membrane potential. Metformin inhibited ADP but not CCCP stimulated oxygen consumption indicating that the metformin-mediated inhibition of mitochondrial complex I required polarized mitochondria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A,B</xref>). Rotenone, an irreversible inhibitor of complex I, does not require polarized mitochondria to inhibit mitochondrial oxygen consumption (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C,D</xref>). Our results suggest that metformin would not be effective in suppressing complex I activity of intact cells if mitochondrial inner membrane potential was disrupted. Metformin-mediated inhibition of the electron transport chain diminishes proton pumping, which might depolarize the mitochondrial membrane, thus limiting accumulation of the drug. However, we did not observe a reduction in the mitochondrial inner membrane potential measured using TMRE fluorescent dye in Control and NDI1 HCT116 p53<sup>−/−</sup> cells after metformin treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E,F</xref>). When electron transport function is inhibited, the ATP synthase can function in reverse such that it uses ATP generated by glycolysis to pump protons across the inner mitochondrial membrane, maintaining membrane potential (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Appleby et al., 1999</xref>). The ATP synthase inhibitor, Oligomycin A, diminished TMRE fluorescence in Control-HCT 116 p53<sup>−/−</sup> cells treated with metformin suggesting that in the presence of metformin, intact cells maintain their mitochondrial membrane potential by reversal of the ATP synthase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>).<fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.02242.011</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Metformin inhibition of complex I requires an intact mitochondrial inner membrane potential.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Complex I (2 mM malate, 10 mM pyruvate)-driven oxygen consumption rate of saponin permeabilized Control-HCT 116 p53<sup>−/−</sup> cells over time.

NDI1-NDUFS3-A549 xenografts grew slower than control xenografts in untreated mice. An alternative explanation for the resistance of NDI1-NDUFS3-A549 cells to metformin could be that effects of metformin are blunted in slower-growing cells. However, based on our results from HCT116 cells in vivo and extensive analysis of A549 cells in vitro, we find that it is likely that NDI1 expressing A549 cells are also resistant to metformin in vivo due to rescue of complex I activity by the NDI1 protein.</p></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The mechanisms by which metformin inhibits cancer growth is not fully understood. Metformin has been previously shown to inhibit mitochondrial complex I, yet it is not known whether metformin exhibits its anti-tumor effects through inhibition of complex I. It is important to note that many commonly utilized drugs have been shown to inhibit mitochondrial function in vitro; however, for many of these drugs it is not clear whether the in vivo mechanism of action is through modulating mitochondrial metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gohil et al., 2010</xref>). In the present study, we genetically demonstrate that metformin acts as a complex I inhibitor in vitro and in vivo to inhibit tumorigenesis. Our current findings bolster our previous findings highlighting the importance of mitochondrial metabolism as essential for cancer proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Weinberg et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Sullivan et al., 2013</xref>). Our results are consistent with a recent report demonstrating another biguanide phenformin exerts its anti-tumor effects by inhibiting complex I (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Birsoy et al., 2014</xref>). However, unlike metformin, phenformin has been discontinued because of frequent occurrence of lactic acidosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bailey and Turner, 1996</xref>). While our study highlights the importance of mitochondrial complex I inhibition within cancer cells as a major mechanism by which metformin reduces tumor burden, it does not necessarily preclude any additional organismal effects of metformin that might reduce tumor progression in certain cancers. Specifically, cancer cells that express insulin receptors might be affected by metformin's inhibition on hepatic gluconeogenesis to reduce circulating insulin levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Goodwin et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>The levels of metformin within cells is regulated by a balance between uptake mechanisms, which are dependent on expression of organic cation transporters (OCT 1, 2, and 3), and expulsion mechanisms, which are dependent on expression on multidrug and toxin extrusion proteins (MATE1 and MATE 2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Emami Riedmaier et al., 2013</xref>). Cancer cells are likely to have a wide range in expression of uptake and extrusion proteins allowing for metformin accumulation. The uptake of metformin in mitochondria is also dependent on mitochondrial membrane potential. Metformin exists as a cation at physiological pH and thus its accumulation within mitochondria is predicted to increase as a function of the mitochondrial membrane potential. The inhibition of electron transport at complex I by metformin should reduce the mitochondrial membrane potential as proton pumping is linked to electron transport. However, we observed that metformin-treated cells maintain their mitochondrial membrane potential in part due to the reversal of the ATP synthase thus allowing accumulation of metformin in the mitochondrial matrix (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). It is well known that cells with compromised ETC can sustain mitochondrial membrane potential through this mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Appleby et al., 1999</xref>). Collectively, our results indicate that will inhibit mitochondrial complex I and decrease tumorigenesis in cancer cells that have transporters across the plasma membrane, as well as a robust inner mitochondrial membrane potential to allow metformin to reach the mitochondrial matrix. It will be of interest to observe whether metformin's efficacy as an anti-cancer agent is dependent on the tumor expression of OCTs.</p><p>Our study also reveals that metformin's inhibition on mitochondrial complex I is distinct from the classical complex I inhibitor rotenone. Metformin requires a robust mitochondrial membrane potential to accumulate in the mitochondrial matrix and reversibly inhibits complex I. By contrast, rotenone is an irreversible inhibitor of complex I that does not require mitochondrial membrane potential. Rotenone accumulation is not dependent on specific transporters expressed in the plasma membrane and readily accumulates in all cells and thus is highly toxic. Furthermore, metformin does not promote generation of ROS from complex I, while rotenone stimulates ROS production from complex I (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). The flavin site within Complex I produces ROS and previous studies indicate that rotenone inhibits complex I downstream of the flavin site, stimulating ROS generation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Pryde and Hirst, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">St-Pierre et al., 2002</xref>). It is likely that metformin acts upstream of this site, inhibiting complex I activity while also inhibiting ROS generation. Mitochondrial complex III also produces ROS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Muller et al., 2004</xref>). Therefore, metformin by inhibiting the complex I would limit electron flow to complex III thereby reducing ROS generation from complex III. A consequence of mitochondrial complex III ROS generation is the hypoxic activation of HIF-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bell et al., 2007</xref>). Indeed, we found that metformin reduced hypoxic stabilization of HIF-1α protein and HIF-dependent target genes. This result is consistent with our previous study in which we identified multiple mitochondrial inhibitors in a large-scale chemical screen for inhibitors of hypoxic activation of HIF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lin et al., 2008</xref>). Beyond cancer, metformin might be an effective treatment for diseases associated with hyperactivation of HIF such as pulmonary hypertension (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Shimoda and Semenza, 2011</xref>). The concentration of metformin we administered to mice in this report is predicted to achieve plasma concentrations of metformin similar to those in humans receiving metformin therapy. In our study, metformin was administered to drinking water at a concentration of 1.25 mg/ml, approximately 250 mg/kg. Conversion of doses from mice to human is achieved using a formula based on body surface area normalization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Reagan-Shaw et al., 2008</xref>). The human equivalent dose of 250 mg/kg metformin in mice is 20.27 mg/kg or 1418 mg for a 70 kg adult. Patients typically receive 500–2500 mg metformin per day (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Scarpello and Howlett, 2008</xref>). In these patients receiving metformin therapy, plasma levels range between 0.5–2 µg/ml; approximately 4 µM–15 µM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Graham et al., 2011</xref>). Previous studies have shown that mice receiving drinking water containing 1–5 mg/ml of metformin have a plasma steady-state metformin concentration of 0.45–1.7 µg/ml (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Memmott et al., 2010</xref>), indicating that our metformin dosage falls within a clinically relevant range.</p><p>Metformin concentrations (250–1000 µM) used for in vitro experiments in this report are in the range utilized by investigators in the diabetes field to examine the effects of metformin on primary murine and human hepatocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Foretz et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Stephenne et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Miller et al., 2013</xref>). A perplexing observation revealed in our study and previous studies is that the metformin concentrations required to induce biological effects in vitro are a magnitude of order higher than plasma level concentrations of metformin in vivo. A likely cause for this difference is the accumulation of metformin in liver or tumors to local concentrations that are much higher than in the circulating plasma. Indeed, the gut has been shown to accumulate metformin in the mM range (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bailey et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Proctor et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>In summary, our results indicate that metformin reversibly inhibits mitochondrial complex I within cancer cells to reduce tumorigenesis. Metformin inhibits tumorigenesis through multiple mechanisms including the induction of cancer cell death in conditions, when glucose is limited and through inhibition of mitochondrial ROS-dependent signaling pathways that promote tumorigenesis (i.e., HIF). These results indicate that metformin would be most effective in low glucose and oxygen conditions. It will be of interest to determine whether metformin treatment might provide a useful adjunct to therapies that limit glucose uptake (e.g., PI3K inhibitors) or drive tumors to low glucose and oxygen levels (e.g., anti-angiogenic inhibitors).</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Generation of cell lines and culture</title><p>NDI1 (+NDI1) and control pWPI vectors containing BFP (+BFP) were transfected into 293FT cells using lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) along with pMD2.G and psPAX2 packaging vectors to produce Control-BFP or NDI-BFP lentivirus.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by a Senior Editor and 3 reviewers, one of whom, Chi Van Dang, is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the other reviewers discussed their comments before reaching this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>In the manuscript by Wheaton et al. the authors report experiments that support the hypothesis that postulates that metformin's biological effect in cancer biology is through inhibition of the mitochondrial Complex I NADH dehydrogenase. Metformin inhibited cellular oxygen consumption, reduced proliferation and induced death in the absence of glucose by targeting complex I of the mitochondrial respiratory chain in cancer cells. In addition, hypoxic activation of HIF-1 was reduced in metformin treated cells and metformin reduced the growth of tumour xenografts in mice. The experiments are well conceived and provide novel information related to the effects of metformin on metabolic and tumor growth control. The authors used a number of conventional approaches to pinpoint Complex I as a site of action of metformin, whose exact molecular function had been controversial in the literature. The authors used a single cell line HCT116, which lacks p53 to perform their experiments. Hence, whether the conclusions are generalizable could be equivocal. Nonetheless, the authors used the yeast equivalent of Complex I, the NDI1 NADH dehydrogenase, which is resistant to metformin, and showed it could rescue metformin inhibition of HCT116 cells. The authors also linked metformin mediated inhibition of HIF1 activity under hypoxia and demonstrated that this could also be rescued by NDI1. Lastly, NDI1 was able to rescue the inhibition of HCT116 tumorigenesis by metformin in vivo.</p><p>Overall, the authors provide a series of compelling experiments that support the contention that the target of metformin is Complex I NADH dehydrogenase. Short of direct structural (crystallography) data of a complex between metformin and mitochondrial Complex I, the studies by Wheaton et al. provide insight into the role of metformin but it is functional and not structural. There are a number of substantive concerns that should be addressed in the revised manuscript.</p><p><italic>A</italic>. <italic>Characterization of ND1 Overexpression</italic></p><p>1) These studies could be strengthened by the use of phenformin to demonstrate that the effects of a different chemical entity with activities like metformin could be blocked by the yeast NDI1.

Does expression of NDI1 change oxygen consumption?</p><p>3) What is the effect of metformin on cells with complex I knockdown? A complex I knockdown is needed to rule out a possible gain-of-function of NDI1.</p><p>4) Expression of OCT1 (organic cation transporter 1), the transporter required for uptake of metformin, should be examined in HCT116 and A549 cells, with or without NDI1, as the sensitivity of cancer cells to metformin may depend on expression of this transporter.</p><p><italic>B</italic>. <italic>Effects of Metformin on HIF</italic></p><p>1) Are the observed effects of metformin on cells in vitro also true in vivo, such as reduced proliferation, increased apoptosis and reduced glycolysis?</p><p>2) In the Results, it is stated that “metformin reduced hypoxic stabilization of HIF-1 in Control-HCT116 p53<sup>-/-</sup> and Control-A549 cells but not in NDI1-HCT 116 p53<sup>-/-</sup> and NDI1-A549 cells”. However, the levels of HIF-1 changes in the Western blots shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref> are subtle to the eye. Additional Western blots and quantification of the images in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref> should be provided.</p><p>3) The levels of HIF-1 should be assessed in the metformin treated xenograft tumours from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>.</p><p>4) The amount of drinking water (with and without metformin) consumed during the tumour xenograft experiment depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> should be reported. This will allow for an accurate estimate of the amount of metformin being administered to each mouse.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.02242.019</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>A. Characterization of ND1 Overexpression</p><p><italic>1) These studies could be strengthened by the use of phenformin to demonstrate that the effects of a different chemical entity with activities like metformin could be blocked by the yeast NDI1. Extension beyond a single cell line would also strengthen the manuscript</italic>.</p><p>We have conducted experiments with phenformin and indeed the yeast NDI1 protein blocks phenformin-induced decrease in oxygen consumption and proliferation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Note that phenformin requires a log fold lower concentration than metformin to exert its effects. The revised paper includes 4 different cell lines where NDI1 is overexpressed. These include HCT116 p53<sup>+/+</sup>; HCT116 p53<sup>-/-</sup>; A549; CCL16-B2 cells. <italic>E</italic></p><p>We also performed in vivo experiments using A549 cells that express the NDI1 protein and an shRNA targeting complex I subunit NDUSF3. This experimental setup allowed us to bolster our findings in HCT116 cells and test the effect of NDI1 expression in a human cell line which lacked endogenous complex I activity. One caveat to this experiment is that the tumor growth of the NDUSF3 shRNA/ND1 A549 cells is slower than their controls. Nevertheless, metformin substantially reduced control cells tumor growth while it had no effect on the growth of NDI1 expressing/NDUSF3 shRNA cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s3">Figure 7–figure supplement 3</xref>). We realize that an alternative explanation could be that metformin is not as effective in NDI1/NDUSF3 A549 cells due to their slower growth. We acknowledge this explanation in the current manuscript. Based on HCT116 cells and extensive in vitro data, it is likely that NDI1 expressing A549 cells are also resistant to metformin in vivo due to rescue of complex I activity by the NDI1 protein.</p><p><italic>2) The property of NDI1 overexpression should be further characterized. Does expression of NDI1 change oxygen consumption</italic>?</p><p>We have conducted this experiment and demonstrated that NDI1 expression does not substantially change oxygen consumption (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1–figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p><italic>3) What is the effect of metformin on cells with complex I knockdown? A complex I knockdown is needed to rule out a possible gain-of-function of NDI1</italic>.</p><p>To address this question, we used CCL16-B2 cells, which are complex I-deficient Chinese hamster cell mutant [Seo, B. B. et al. Molecular remedy of complex I defects: rotenone-insensitive internal NADHquinone oxidoreductase of Saccharomyces cerevisiae mitochondria restores the NADH oxidase activity of complex I-deficient mammalian cells. PNAS 95, 9167-9171 (1998)]. We now show that these complex I deficient cells are refractory to metformin and phenformin compared to their wild-type control cells. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1 fig3s2">Figure 3–figure supplements 1 and 2</xref>). Furthermore, we performed in vivo experiments using A549 cells expressing an shRNA against the complex I structural protein NDUFS3. NDI1 expression in these cells did not contribute to a gain-of-function phenotype.</p><p><italic>4) Expression of OCT1 (organic cation transporter 1), the transporter required for uptake of metformin, should be examined in HCT116 and A549 cells, with or without NDI1, as the sensitivity of cancer cells to metformin may depend on expression of this transporter</italic>.</p><p>This is an important experiment suggested by the reviewer. We have examined OCT1 protein levels between the control and NDI1 cell lines and the levels of OCT1 protein do not change (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>).</p><p>B. Effects of Metformin on HIF</p><p><italic>1) Are the observed effects of metformin on cells in vitro also true in vivo, such as reduced proliferation, increased apoptosis and reduced glycolysis</italic>?</p><p>Measurement of tumor glycolysis would be challenging for our lab since it requires glucose flux analysis by carbon labeling. We are not currently equipped to conduct this analysis in our lab. Metformin does not induce cell death in vitro unless glucose is limiting and this is a necrotic death that is unobservable by common apoptotic markers. We primarily examined HIF target genes in vivo since we felt this is novel finding in the paper (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7 C and D</xref>).
