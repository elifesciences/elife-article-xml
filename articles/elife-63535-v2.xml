The intensity and directionality of force generated are dependent on spatiotemporal regulation of Myosin II activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Heisenberg and Bellaïche, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Rauzi et al., 2010</xref>). Myosin II activation by phosphorylation is achieved by Rho kinase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Amano et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kasza et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Levayer and Lecuit, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Vasquez et al., 2014</xref>). Rho-GTP, a member of the small GTPases belonging to the Ras superfamily, activates Rho kinase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Prudnikova et al., 2015</xref>). These molecular switches undergo cycling between GDP-bound-inactive and GTP-bound-active states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Agarwal and Zaidel-Bar, 2019</xref>). This Rho-GTP and Rho-GDP cycling is catalyzed by guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) and GTPases-activating proteins (GAPs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bos et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Van Aelst and D'Souza-Schorey, 1997</xref>). RhoGEFs lead to the production of Rho-GTP, whereas RhoGAPs promote hydrolysis of the GTP to generate Rho-GDP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Jacobs and Hall, 2005</xref>). The relative expression and spatiotemporal distribution of RhoGEFs and RhoGAPs are critical in fine-tuning the levels of Rho-GTP and extent of Myosin II activation in different cellular processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Agarwal and Zaidel-Bar, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chircop, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Mulinari and Häcker, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Wu and Priya, 2019</xref>).</p><p><italic>Drosophila</italic> embryogenesis is an excellent model system to study the molecular mechanisms regulating actomyosin-driven contraction in a spatiotemporal manner. The <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryo begins development as a syncytium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Foe et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Foe and Alberts, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Schejter and Wieschaus, 1993a</xref>). Transition from the syncytial to cellular blastoderm occurs at the embryo cortex in the interphase of cycle 14 by cleavage to separate each nucleus by plasma membrane boundaries in a process called cellularization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Mazumdar and Mazumdar, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Schejter and Wieschaus, 1993a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Sullivan and Theurkauf, 1995</xref>). The leading edge of the invaginating plasma membrane between adjacent nuclei occurs as an infolding termed as furrow canal. The actomyosin network assembles at the base of the furrow canal and forms a polygonal network in early cellularization. This transforms into a contractile ring in mid cellularization. Finally, ring constriction partially closes the base of the cell during late cellularization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kiehart, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Krueger et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Young et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Royou et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Schejter and Wieschaus, 1993a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Xue and Sokac, 2016</xref>). The actomyosin ring organization and constriction in cellularization are similar to conventional cytokinesis in somatic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Tram et al., 2002</xref>).</p><p>The GTPase exchange factor, RhoGEF2, localizes at the furrow tip in cellularization, and its depletion results in inhibition of ring constriction in cellularization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Padash Barmchi et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Grosshans et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Wenzl et al., 2010</xref>). Optogenetic activation of the catalytic domain of RhoGEF2 in the assembly phase of Myosin II leads to increased Myosin II recruitment, resulting in premature and enhanced constriction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Krueger et al., 2019</xref>). Moreover, overexpression of RhoGEF2 and activated Rho1 mutant Rho1V14 results in contracted S2 cell morphology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Rogers et al., 2004</xref>). On the other hand, microinjection of Rho1 inhibitor, C3 exoenzyme, and dominant negative N19Rho alters the actin cytoskeleton and disrupts cellularization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Crawford et al., 1998</xref>). Rho-GTP activates the kinases Drok and Drak that in turn activate Myosin II via phosphorylation. Further, Rok and Drak mutant embryos and addition of a pharmacological inhibitor of Rok, Y-27632, show impaired actomyosin contractility due to reduced Myosin II phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chougule et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Krajcovic and Minden, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Xue and Sokac, 2016</xref>). Phospho-deficient mutants of the light chain of Myosin II, Squash, also show loss of contractility during cellularization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Xue and Sokac, 2016</xref>).</p><p>In contrast to RhoGEF2 function, RhoGAP domain-containing proteins are likely to play a key role in inhibiting the activation of Myosin II. The function of RhoGAPs during tissue morphogenesis has been generally less studied as compared to RhoGEFs. Depletion of RhoGAPs, RGA3 and RGA4 in the <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> embryo leads to enhanced contractility of the anterior cortex due to increased recruitment of Myosin II (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Regev et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Schmutz et al., 2007</xref>). CGAP, a RhoGAP identified in <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryos, plays a role in inhibiting apical constriction in gastrulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Mason et al., 2016</xref>). CGAP mutant embryos also show increased constriction of actomyosin rings in cellularization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Mason et al., 2016</xref>). The hexagonal phase of actomyosin organization has been shown to be resilient to activation by Myosin II recruitment, and RhoGAPs may function at this stage to inhibit ring constriction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Krueger et al., 2019</xref>). However, analysis of RhoGAP function in a spatiotemporal manner in regulating actomyosin ring contractility has not been studied in cellularization. Here, we report the characterization of a RhoGAP called <bold>G</bold>TPase <bold>r</bold>egulator <bold>a</bold>ssociated with <bold>f</bold>ocal adhesion kinase (GRAF) in regulating contractile ring formation in cellularization in <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryogenesis.</p><p>GRAF is a multidomain protein containing a BAR, PH, RhoGAP and SH3 domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lundmark et al., 2008</xref>). GRAF was originally identified as a binding partner of the C-terminal domain of focal adhesion kinase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hildebrand et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Taylor et al., 1998</xref>). The BAR and PH domains are important for the recruitment of GRAF to the membrane, and RhoGAP domain specifically regulates the GTPase activity of RhoA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Doherty and Lundmark, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Doherty et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Eberth et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Holst et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lundmark et al., 2008</xref>). GRAF-deficient smooth muscle cells in mice and Xenopus embryo extracts have increased Rho-GTP levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bai et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Doherty et al., 2011</xref>). GRAF loss leads to depletion of epithelial markers and transition to mesenchymal markers, giving rise to enhanced migratory ability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Regev et al., 2017</xref>). We assessed the role of GRAF in contractile ring formation in <italic>Drosophila</italic> cellularization. We found that GRAF loss showed a distinct hyper constriction phenotype dependent upon its RhoGTPase activity during cellularization. GRAF was present at the furrow tip in early stages of cellularization during Myosin II assembly, enriched in mid cellularization and depleted from the ring in late stages. <italic>Graf</italic> depletion led to increased Myosin II recruitment at the contractile ring. Loss of RhoGEF2 and Myosin II activation suppressed the hyper constriction phenotype of GRAF. Our studies show a crucial role for GRAF in inhibiting actomyosin contractility in cellularization.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>GRAF depletion leads to premature constriction in early cellularization and hyper constriction in mid and late cellularization</title><p>The GRAF protein from <italic>Drosophila</italic> is a multidomain protein containing a BAR, PH, RhoGAP and SH3 domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) from the N terminus to the C terminus.

The polygonal architecture transitioned to a circular shape on constriction at the furrow tip in mid cellularization (furrow length 6–16 μm) and constricted further in late cellularization (furrow length 16–40 μm) (Figure 1B; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Xue and Sokac, 2016</xref>). <italic>Graf</italic><sup>i</sup> and <italic>Graf</italic><sup>2i</sup> expressing embryos did not show the polygonal F-actin organization in early stages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref>). In <italic>Graf</italic><sup>i</sup> embryos, the furrow tips contained wavy edges with a loss of contact between adjacent furrow tips (white arrowheads, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). There was enhanced constriction in mid and late stages of cellularization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). The nuclei had a bottleneck appearance in <italic>Graf</italic><sup>i</sup> embryos possibly due to premature constriction and squeezing of nuclei in mid cellularization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Quantification of the area of the contractile rings showed a significant decrease in <italic>Graf</italic><sup>i</sup> as compared to controls in early, mid and late cellularization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>).</p><p>In addition, loss-of-function mutants at the <italic>Graf</italic> locus were generated by the Crispr-Cas9 strategy. The transgenic fly stock containing a guide RNA (gRNA) against exon 1 (at 2751 residue from transcription start site) of <italic>Graf</italic> was crossed to maternally expressing Cas9 (<italic>nanos</italic>-Cas9) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Ren et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Zirin et al., 2020</xref>).

PCR amplification of exon 1 followed by DNA sequencing was carried out from homozygous flies from 18 lines, which gave reduced progeny, and 3 lines that were similar to controls. The 18 lines with reduced progeny numbers showed small insertions or deletions, leading to a frameshift, thereby causing a premature stop codon in the <italic>Graf</italic> exon 1 region. The three fly lines that served as healthy controls also showed small insertions or deletions but the coding frame was intact (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2C</xref>). The fly line CR57, named <italic>Graf</italic><sup>CR57</sup> henceforth, contained a stop codon at the 27th amino acid and was chosen for further analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). <italic>Graf</italic><sup>CR57</sup>/<italic>Graf</italic><sup>CR57</sup> homozygous adult females gave embryos with 71% lethality at 24 hr (n = 336).

The spatial pattern of GRAF recruitment varies with the dynamics of the actomyosin network. GRAF localizes precisely to the furrow tip in early cellularization, increases in mid cellularization and finally becomes cytoplasmic at late stages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9D</xref>). <italic>Graf</italic> null mutant embryos show premature constriction in early cellularization and hyper constriction in mid and late stages. Depletion of <italic>Graf</italic> increases contractility and Myosin II levels, thereby leading to detachment of adjacent contractile units (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9D</xref>). <italic>Graf</italic> loss leads to the tendency of the actomyosin network to attain a ring-like architecture prematurely and constriction is no longer restricted. The RhoGTPase domain deletion phenocopies the hyper constriction phenotype seen in <italic>Graf</italic> null mutant embryos. The spatial and temporal pattern of GRAF recruitment at the cleavage furrow along with its enzymatic activity make it a key protein in maintaining adhesion and inhibiting the contraction process in cellularization. Here, we discuss (1) the function of GRAF in spatiotemporal regulation of rate of constriction during cellularization, (2) coregulation of actomyosin assembly by actin remodeling or endocytic proteins along with GRAF and (3) redundancy of RhoGAPs in morphogenesis in cellularization and gastrulation.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Spatiotemporal recruitment of GRAF regulates the rate of constriction in cellularization</title><p>GRAF is present uniformly at the furrow tip when Myosin II is beginning to assemble in early stages of cellularization and a complete overlap between GRAF and Myosin II occurs during mid cellularization. Rho-GTP and Myosin II are present at the furrow tip in late cellularization, whereas GRAF is lost from the furrow tip in late stages. Constriction of the cleavage furrow in cellularization occurs in successive steps by the action of Myosin II and F-actin polymerization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Xue and Sokac, 2016</xref>). Myosin II assembles and forms a polygonal network in early cellularization. This polygonal network is resilient to constriction on activation of Myosin II, and RhoGTPase activities are predicted to be important at this step in restricting ring constriction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Krueger et al., 2019</xref>). Myosin II recruits during its assembly in phase I and initiates constriction at the ring in phase II in cellularization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Krueger et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Xue and Sokac, 2016</xref>). The F-actin-severing protein, Cofilin, F-actin crosslinker fimbrin and F-actin-stabilizing proteins Anillin and septin, Peanut, affect ring constriction to a greater extent as compared to Myosin II in late cellularization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Krueger et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Mavrakis et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Xue and Sokac, 2016</xref>). The spatial recruitment of GRAF in early and mid cellularization at the furrow allows for its RhoGTPase activity to control levels of Rho-GTP in these stages. Sustained Rho-GTP levels due to absence of Rho-GTP hydrolysis in <italic>Graf</italic> mutant embryos lead to increased Myosin II recruitment and, along with the F-actin remodeling activities of Anillin and Peanut, results in enhanced ring constriction in cellularization. Taken together, our study shows that spatiotemporal recruitment of GRAF to the contractile ring is required for fine-tuning of Rho activity for regulated constriction during cellularization.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Role of actin regulatory and endocytic proteins in restriction of contractility in cellularization</title><p>Whereas Anillin and Peanut lead to constriction of the contractile ring in cellularization, Cheerio and Bottleneck are actin crosslinkers that inhibit contractility similar to GRAF. Bottleneck and Cheerio organize a basal polygonal non-contractile actin network in mid cellularization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Krueger et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Reversi et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Schejter and Wieschaus, 1993b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Thomas and Wieschaus, 2004</xref>). GRAF localization to this network plays a crucial role in limiting actomyosin contractility via its RhoGTPase activity. This is consistent with the previously characterized localization of GRAF on actin stress fibers and focal adhesions in mammalian cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Taylor et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Taylor et al., 1998</xref>). It is possible that Bottleneck and Cheerio mutants regulate actin polymerization downstream of Rho activation in cellularization. Bottleneck has also been shown to bind preferentially to phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5 trisphosphate (PIP3). It is interesting to note that an increase in phosphatidylinositol 4,5 bisphosphate (PIP2) causes hyper constriction during cellularization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Reversi et al., 2014</xref>). The PH and BAR domains of GRAF interact strongly with PIP2-containing liposomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lundmark et al., 2008</xref>). It is therefore possible that GRAF depletion leads to stabilization of PIP2 and loss of Bottleneck at furrow tips. Future studies on the analysis of Rho-GTP levels in Bottleneck and Cheerio mutants along with recruitment of Bottleneck and Cheerio in <italic>Graf</italic> mutants will reveal their interaction during actomyosin network stabilization in cellularization.</p><p>GRAF functions in clathrin-independent endocytosis of the EGFR receptor in hematopoiesis in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kim et al., 2017</xref>).

Even though GRAF has been found to play a role in endocytosis in other systems, GRAF did not show vesicular staining during cellularization in our study. However, GRAF and ArfGEF may work either in similar or parallel pathways to regulate endocytosis at the cleavage furrow and in turn inhibit Rho1 activity during constriction.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>RhoGAP redundancy during cellularization and gastrulation</title><p>GRAF null mutant embryos give escaper adults during development. This suggests that there are other RhoGAPs that regulate Rho-GTP levels in the absence of GRAF in cellularization. RhoGAP92B is another uncharacterized BAR, RhoGAP and SH3 domain containing protein expressed in early embryogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Contrino et al., 2012</xref>). CGAP is required for Rho-GTP cycling to produce Myosin II pulses for apical constriction during gastrulation in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. CGAP mutant embryos also show premature and hyper constriction during cellularization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Mason et al., 2016</xref>). In addition, RhoGAP68F is also required for coordinated apical constriction during gastrulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Sanny et al., 2006</xref>). It is likely that GRAF, RhoGAP92B, CGAP and RhoGAP68F together regulate ring constriction during cellularization and apical constriction during gastrulation.

The area was plotted in groups of early (furrow length less than 6 μm), mid (furrow length 6–16 μm) and late (furrow length more than 16 μm) stages of cellularization based on furrow length to compare between control and mutant embryos.</p><p>Live movies from embryos expressing Sqh-mCherry of different genotypes were used to quantify contractile ring area in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B</xref>. Sqh-mCherry fluorescence images containing sum intensity were obtained across five optical sections at the base of the furrow with the brightest section in the middle. Five rings per embryo were marked manually using a polygon tool in these images, and the area inside the ring was computed in ImageJ. The mean ± s.d. for the area was computed and plotted with time using GraphPad Prism 5.0.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Quantification of furrow membrane length</title><p>Sqh-mCherry fluorescence was used to identify furrow tips during cellularization.

The displacement of edges measured before ablations was subtracted from all the time points after ablations. The displacement was calculated from five independent embryos. The mean displacement and s.d. with respect to time was plotted for control and <italic>Graf</italic><sup>CR57</sup> mutant embryos across the early and mid stages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B, F</xref>). The displacement at the last time point at approximately 70 s was used to plot maximum displacement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C, G</xref>).

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, including Derek Applewhite as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Anna Akhmanova as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Jordan Beach (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>As the editors have judged that your manuscript is of interest, but as described below that additional experiments are required before it is published, we would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). First, because many researchers have temporarily lost access to the labs, we will give authors as much time as they need to submit revised manuscripts. We are also offering, if you choose, to post the manuscript to bioRxiv (if it is not already there) along with this decision letter and a formal designation that the manuscript is &quot;in revision at <italic>eLife</italic>&quot;. Please let us know if you would like to pursue this option. (If your work is more suitable for medRxiv, you will need to post the preprint yourself, as the mechanisms for us to do so are still in development.)</p><p>Summary:</p><p>In this manuscript Sharma and Rikhy show that actomyosin contraction at invaginating furrows during <italic>Drosophila</italic> cellularization is modulated by the RhoGAP GRAF. The authors demonstrate that GRAF localizes at the tip of the invaginating furrows and that its depletion or over-expression causes changes in the dynamics of ring contraction. The authors then argue that GRAF affects myosin II localization and activity by balancing the levels of Rho-GTP at the contractile rings. This study carefully dissects the role of GRAF during cellularization and nicely shows its importance to achieve the correct levels of actomyosin contraction during this process. Due to the central role of actomyosin mechanics in several morphogenetic processes, as well as in disease, this work is potentially relevant for a wide audience. Furthermore, the authors have developed an arsenal of tools to explore the role of GRAF that should be useful to the fly community. However, I believe that some issues should be addressed before publication particularly regarding the quantification and interpretation of the data.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1. The authors provide a number of data points consistent with hypercontractility but never demonstrate that the ring is actually hypercontractile. Ideally laser ablations to analyze recoil, or experiments using tension sensors could be performed. However, RLC phosphorylation could suffice. Analysis of phosphorylated light chains with/without GRAF help support the model that the myosin being recruited is active/contractile.</p><p>2. Validation of KD lines. For some, I could be convinced that previous literature is sufficient (eg Rok KD), but for GRAF, which is central in this work, I would like to see in author's hands that they are seeing protein depletion, what the maternal contribution level is, etc. Similarly, the authors do an excellent job of presenting their CRISPR KO validation up to the point of showing loss of protein. I have seen examples where N-terminal targeted CRISPR KO lines were bypassed by unknown alternative starts. It would be nice to demonstrate that no shorter proteins are being produced in the KO, as far as the author's antibodies can determine.</p><p>3. The authors lean heavily on the area measurements as a readout for rescues (GFP-GRAF +/- GAP) and genetic interactions (ROCK, RhoGEF2, etc). More quantitative investigation of these rescues would be appropriate. The authors have the tools to do this. For example, the zipper (or RLC-P as suggested above) recruitment would be a nice downstream readout to confirm the area differences are myosin 2 dependent.</p><p>4. GRAF-OE (with or without Rho-GEF2) appears to have more lateral actin. Were the images in Figure 6 collected and presented identically? Acquisition and post-acquisition modifications were identical? The question regarding acquisition/post-acquisition modifications to the images applies throughout the paper. It is not clear to me if the reader can directly compare intensities between early/mid/late samples or if they were all adjusted independently for presentation. Please make this clear. In a number of the images, the noise appears to increase in Late, is this because there is more diffuse GRAF or because the laser/signal was adjusted to enhance the image for presentation?</p><p>5. In figure 3C the authors claim that in the GRAFdeltaRhoGAP-GFP embryos the phenotype is similar to that in GRAF<sup>CR57</sup>. However, I am not convinced of this based on the data. Is the initial area of the rings significantly different between control embryos and GRAFdeltaRhoGAP-GFP? In that case, are the dynamics of ring contraction over time different, or simply rings are contracting at similar rates and are smaller in GRAFdeltaRhoGAP-GFP because their original size was smaller? Initially, the dynamics of contraction in GRAF<sup>CR57</sup>embryos seems significantly faster than in GRAFdeltaRhoGAP-GFP, which could imply that the RhoGAP domain of GRAF is important at later stages of cellularization. Differences in dynamics would be more obvious if the curves were normalized to the initial size of the rings. The authors should look at the rate of contraction to be able to claim changes in contractility speed.</p><p>6. For your graphs measuring the change in ring area of over time (Figures 3C, 4E, 5B, 6C, 7C, 8B) an ANOVA analysis has been performed on each time point or the overall rate? The figure legend indicates these are statistically significant, but there is no indication in the figure. It is just hard to follow exactly what is statistically significant in these graphs.</p><p>7. The authors are looking at the mean fluorescence of different proteins like myosin and GRAF. Although this is a very informative metric, I think they should also look at the total levels of these molecules to see if they are increasing or not. For example, the authors say that the levels of GRAF and myosin increase from early to mid-cellularization. However, usually mean fluorescence is normalized to (divided by) the area of the structure under study. As the rings are decreasing in area during cellularization, the increase in mean fluorescence they are observing could simply be an increase in the density of myosin or GRAF as the rings become smaller. Therefore to talk about an increase in the recruitment of these molecules, the authors should look at total fluorescence levels (the product of mean fluorescence and area of the ring). This is particularly important when comparing the levels of molecules in phenotypes where the ring sizes differ at a given time point, like figure 5D.</p><p>8. Figure 8: The lower diagram in C shows Graf and ROK KD leads to &quot;Ring constriction similar to controls&quot;. This is not supported by the data. You've broken the chain below the GAP, and therefore the phenotype should mimic ROK-KD alone, which is what 8B shows. The blue line is more similar to the green than to the black. ROK isn't in the competitive cycle like RhoGEF2 is. It is downstream. Regardless of what happens upstream, ROK-KD should largely prevent myosin activation and constriction, which the authors data show. And &quot;Dephosphorylated myosin 2&quot; would not lead to &quot;Ring Constriction similar to controls&quot; as the model suggests, it would lead to the results presented in the data.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.63535.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1.

As suggested by the reviewers, we performed laser ablations at the ring for controls and mutants to test changes in contractility in early and mid cellularization. We found that the initial recoil velocity, rate of displacement and displacement at the final time point of the ring at the furrow base is increased at early and mid stages of cellularization in Graf<sup>CR57</sup> as compared to controls. This new experiment has been added as a part of revised Figure 3 and Video 3.</p><p>2.Since GRAF has a RhoGAP domain, we further tested the levels of Rho-GTP in mutant embryos. For this, we add new data of Rho-GTP distribution as visualized by AnillinRBD-GFP in <italic>Graf</italic><sup>CR57</sup> and controls. AnillinRBD-GFP is more spread in mid cellularization between adjacent rings in <italic>Graf</italic><sup>CR57</sup> as compared to controls. This allows a documentation of change in Rho-GTP levels in embryos in cellularization in <italic>Graf</italic><sup>CR57</sup>. This is included as a part of revised Figure 4.</p><p>3. We have measured the changes in Myosin II recruitment to the contractile ring by estimating the intensity of Zipper immunofluorescence in fixed embryos and Sqh-mCherry in live videos in controls and mutants. We find that Sqh-mCherry and Zipper levels are increased in <italic>Graf</italic><sup>CR57</sup> as compared to controls. This is included as a part of revised Figure 6.</p><p>4. As suggested by the reviewers, we also attempted an analysis of phosphorylated light chain with a phosphospecific antibody against Sqh obtained from Robert Ward. We add images here for reference of the reviewers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref>). We tried various fixation methods to confirm this antibody: heat fixation, PFA fixation followed by hand devitellinization and PFA fixation followed by methanol devitellinization. We did not get phospho-Sqh staining similar to controls published in (Zhang and Ward 2011). We saw some patchy staining on increasing the laser power in controls at the furrow but did not see a significant difference of this staining between the control and mutant embryos. It may be possible that the antibody stability has been affected during the transport contributing to the loss in specific staining.</p><fig id="sa2fig1"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Sqh1P expression pattern during mid cellularization in <italic>Graf</italic><sup>CR57</sup> mutant.</title><p>Sqh1P staining revealed patchy staining with cytoplasmic signal during mid cellularization.

We used a guide RNA to target exon1 of the Graf gene. This gave rise to the <italic>Graf</italic><sup>CR57</sup> mutant by a premature stop codon which gave rise to a truncated product of 27aa. The reason to target exon1 instead of targeting the deletion of the entire gene was because of the presence of another gene CG8260 in the opposite direction from the intronic region of Graf. Even though CG8260 does not show the presence of transcripts in the development as per the ModEncode data base, we did not want to affect its synthesis by deleting the entire genomic region. This information has been added to the revised text on creation of Crispr mutants of <italic>Graf</italic>.</p><p>2. The <italic>Graf</italic><sup>CR57</sup> mutant embryos show loss of GRAF antibody staining and the mutant phenotype of hypercontractility is rescued by the addition of full length GRAF-GFP in embryos. This rescue is not seen when a deletion construct missing the RhoGAP domain is combined with <italic>Graf</italic><sup>CR57</sup> mutant embryos. This rescue shows a specific requirement of the RhoGAP activity of GRAF in inhibiting contractility in cellularization.</p><p>3. The Crispr mutant of <italic>Graf</italic> is partially viable and escapers can be used to maintain these homozygous flies as a stock. It does not show any defects in development of other organ structures such as the wing, eye, thoracic bristles, etc. We performed RNAi expression against GRAF with maternal, wing and eye specific Gal4s. These experiments showed a specific defect in embryonic stages with maternal Gal4s and not with wing specific or eye specific Gal4s or even tubulin Gal4. These data together suggest that maternal deposition and/or synthesis of GRAF is present in early development and is essential for these developmental processes.</p><p>4. We also show that there is a depletion of GRAF antibody staining in Graf RNAi expressing embryos. We have added this data to revised Figure 2—figure supplement 1. GRAF levels are decreased to a greater extent in <italic>Graf</italic><sup>CR57</sup> embryos as compared to Graf RNAi expressing embryos. This also correlates with the stronger ring constriction phenotype seen in Graf <sup>CR57</sup> as compared to Graf RNAi. Both the RNAi and the Crispr mutant show the loss of function, hyper constriction phenotypes. It is very unlikely that other products produced in the GRAF Crispr mutant affect the phenotype.</p><p>5. We attempted western blot analysis to test whether smaller fragments are seen in the <italic>Graf</italic><sup>CR57</sup> embryos. We get multiple bands in the wild type extracts from adults and embryos with the antibody against GRAF and the control blots with anti-tubulin antibody show a specific single band. The western blot analysis from mutants shows loss of protein bands in mutants in a couple of blots but this is not reproducible. As per the data on ModEncode and Fly Proteome, the GRAF mRNA and protein are present in very small quantities. It is likely that for this reason and possibly due to less stability of the protein, we are unable to detect this on western blots with specificity and reproducibility. Our current and future studies involve attempts to standardise conditions to increase the stability of the protein for biochemistry experiments.</p><p>6. For embryos expressing RNAi against RhoGEF2 and ROK and with overexpression of RhoGEF2 we include new measurements of Sqh-mCherry at late cellularization in revised Figures 6, 7, 8 and 9.</p><p>Sqh-mCherry shows a patchy distribution in early stages of cellularization during Myosin II assembly the furrow tip. It shows localization at the ring in mid and late stages of cellularization. The intensity in mid stages is higher than late stages of cellularization in controls. Sqh-mCherry is more spread in the inter ring region in Graf mutants in mid cellularization. This has also been seen in actin remodelling protein Cheerio mutant embryos which show hyper constriction (Krueger et al. 2019). Sqh-mCherry increased in intensity at the contractile ring in <italic>Graf</italic><sup>CR57</sup> and decreased in intensity in the inter ring region in late cellularization. We therefore quantified the ring to inter ring region ratio for all the genotypes from live videos with Sqh-mCherry in cellularization. This analysis shows that Sqh-mCherry fluorescence is reduced at the ring in RhoGEF2 and ROK RNAi expression embryos and increased in <italic>Graf</italic><sup>CR57</sup>, <italic>Graf</italic><sup>CR57</sup>;GRAFΔRhoGAP-GFP and RhoGEF2-OE embryos.</p><p>We have also measured the Sqh-mCherry and Zipper intensity in syncytial embryos in prophase and metaphase in RhoGEF2 RNAi, RhoGEF2-OE and ROK RNAi in previous studies (Dey and Rikhy 2020). Sqh-mCherry is present in the cortical regions close to the membrane in control embryos in prophase and is cytoplasmic in metaphase. We find that Sqh-mCherry and Zipper are cytoplasmic in prophase in ROK RNAi and RhoGEF2 RNAi expressing embryos and are retained in the cortical regions in metaphase of RhoGEF2-OE embryos as compared to controls. The reagents for knockdown and overexpression of Rho and Myosin II have therefore been confirmed in several ways of shape analysis and Myosin II intensity estimation in cellularization in the revised manuscript and in syncytial stages of development previously. We have added the appropriate description from literature for each of these mutants in the Results section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. The authors lean heavily on the area measurements as a readout for rescues (GFP-GRAF +/- GAP) and genetic interactions (ROCK, RhoGEF2, etc). More quantitative investigation of these rescues would be appropriate. The authors have the tools to do this. For example, the zipper (or RLC-P as suggested above) recruitment would be a nice downstream readout to confirm the area differences are myosin 2 dependent.</p></disp-quote><p>As mentioned in response to point 1, we did not get a significant staining for p-Sqh at the ring in controls and Graf <sup>CR57</sup> mutants. Hence we could not use this method to document changes of p-Sqh levels in single or double mutant embryos.</p><p>We performed Zipper antibody stainings in <italic>Graf</italic><sup>CR57</sup> mutant embryos and found increased levels in early, mid and late cellularization. Sqh-mCherry is recruited to the ring in late stages and is not present in inter-ring regions in control embryos. We found that Sqh-mCherry levels remained high at the ring in <italic>Graf</italic><sup>CR57</sup> mutant embryos in late cellularization. We therefore estimated the levels of Sqh-mCherry in Graf <sup>CR57</sup> in late cellularization at the ring relative to the inter ring from videos. We found an increase in Sqh-mCherry relative to inter ring regions in <italic>Graf</italic><sup>CR57</sup>, <italic>Graf</italic><sup>CR57</sup>;GRAFΔRhoGAP-GFP when compared to controls and <italic>Graf</italic><sup>CR57</sup>; GRAF-GFP (Revised Figure 6).</p><p>We also estimated the levels of Sqh-mCherry as a ratio to the inter ring intensity in all the mutants used in the manuscript. This data is included as a part of revised Figures 7, 8 and 9. We found that there is an increase in Sqh-mCherry at the ring in RhoGEF2-OE and this was no longer seen in combinations of GRAF-OE; RhoGEF2-OE (Figure 7). We found that there is a decrease in Sqh-mCherry in RhoGEF2 RNAi expressing embryos and this was not seen in the combinations of <italic>Graf</italic><sup>CR57</sup>;RhoGEF2 RNAi (Figure 8). A decrease in Sqh-mCherry was seen in ROK RNAi mutant embryos and this decrease remained in <italic>Graf</italic><sup>CR57</sup>, ROK RNAi embryos thus confirming that hyper contractility in <italic>Graf</italic><sup>CR57</sup> embryos is dependent upon Myosin II activation via Rho-kinase (Figure 9).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. GRAF-OE (with or without Rho-GEF2) appears to have more lateral actin. Were the images in Figure 6 collected and presented identically? Acquisition and post-acquisition modifications were identical? The question regarding acquisition/post-acquisition modifications to the images applies throughout the paper. It is not clear to me if the reader can directly compare intensities between early/mid/late samples or if they were all adjusted independently for presentation. Please make this clear. In a number of the images, the noise appears to increase in Late, is this because there is more diffuse GRAF or because the laser/signal was adjusted to enhance the image for presentation?</p></disp-quote><p>The immunostainings for GRAF-OE are imaged at similar laser power settings to controls on the confocal microscope. There is an increase in GRAF all along the Z axis in GRAF-OE embryos (Figure 5). As noted by the reviewer, this also coincides with an increase in Phalloidin and therefore increase in F-actin in GRAF-OE embryos. It may be possible that an increase in GRAF gives rise to an increase in F-actin along the furrow.</p><p>We are currently investigating the change in recruitment of actin remodelling proteins in <italic>Graf</italic> mutant embryos and will be able to highlight the impact of GRAF on regulating actin remodelling in a future study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. In figure 3C the authors claim that in the GRAFdeltaRhoGAP-GFP embryos the phenotype is similar to that in GRAF <sup>CR57</sup>. However, I am not convinced of this based on the data. Is the initial area of the rings significantly different between control embryos and GRAFdeltaRhoGAP-GFP? In that case, are the dynamics of ring contraction over time different, or simply rings are contracting at similar rates and are smaller in GRAFdeltaRhoGAP-GFP because their original size was smaller? Initially, the dynamics of contraction in GRAF <sup>CR57</sup> embryos seems significantly faster than in GRAFdeltaRhoGAP-GFP, which could imply that the RhoGAP domain of GRAF is important at later stages of cellularization. Differences in dynamics would be more obvious if the curves were normalized to the initial size of the rings. The authors should look at the rate of contraction to be able to claim changes in contractility speed.</p></disp-quote><p>The quantification of area for <italic>Graf</italic><sup>CR57</sup>; GRAFΔRhoGAP-GFP and <italic>Graf</italic><sup>CR57</sup>; GRAF-GFP has now been redone using the Sqh-mCherry localization as a readout for making the ROI for estimating area. The earlier distribution was estimated using the GFP fluorescence of GRAF-GFP or GRAFΔRhoGAP-GFP, this tends to label the edges better than the vertices and often appears to be rounded. This gave an underestimate of the area especially in early cellularization. The revised Figure 4 shows that there is a decrease in area in <italic>Graf</italic><sup>CR57</sup>, GRAFΔRhoGAP-GFP similar to <italic>Graf</italic><sup>CR57</sup> when compared to both controls and in <italic>Graf</italic><sup>CR57</sup>, GRAF-GFP embryos throughout cellularization.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. For your graphs measuring the change in ring area of over time (Figures 3C, 4E, 5B, 6C, 7C, 8B) an ANOVA analysis has been performed on each time point or the overall rate? The figure legend indicates these are statistically significant, but there is no indication in the figure. It is just hard to follow exactly what is statistically significant in these graphs.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added a description of the curves that are statistically different in the figures and legends in the revised manuscript.

Although this is a very informative metric, I think they should also look at the total levels of these molecules to see if they are increasing or not. For example, the authors say that the levels of GRAF and myosin increase from early to mid-cellularization. However, usually mean fluorescence is normalized to (divided by) the area of the structure under study. As the rings are decreasing in area during cellularization, the increase in mean fluorescence they are observing could simply be an increase in the density of myosin or GRAF as the rings become smaller. Therefore to talk about an increase in the recruitment of these molecules, the authors should look at total fluorescence levels (the product of mean fluorescence and area of the ring). This is particularly important when comparing the levels of molecules in phenotypes where the ring sizes differ at a given time point, like figure 5D.</p></disp-quote><p>All the fluorescence intensities for the GRAF antibody, Zipper antibody, GRAF-GFP, AnillinRBD-GFP and Sqh-mCherry are represented as a mean per pixel at any given time point or cellularization stage in the previous and the revised manuscript.</p><p>We have shown line scans of the relative fluorescence intensity across a line with fixed thickness and length at the furrow tip for Sqh-mCherry, GRAF-GFP and AnillinRBD-GFP. We find that Sqh-mCherry and GRAF-GFP colocalize in early stages. GRAF-GFP increases at the furrow tip in mid stages and becomes cytoplasmic in late cellularization (revised Figure 2). Sqh-mCherry on the other hand increases in mid cellularization and is still present in the ring in late cellularization.</p><p>The mean fluorescence intensities per pixel for Sqh-mCherry are obtained from sum projections of 5 sections in revised Figure 6—figure supplement 1B. The mean fluorescence intensities per pixel are represented as a ratio to the maximum fluorescence per embryo. This shows that there is an increase in Sqh-mCherry and GRAF in every pixel in mid cellularization followed by a decrease in late cellularization. We have included this description in the revised Materials and methods.</p><p>The mean fluorescence intensities per pixel obtained from the sum intensity images relative to inter ring intensity per pixel in late stages are now added in Figures 6, 7, 8 and 9 to estimate the relative change in Myosin II recruitment in different mutant and rescue combinations. We have included this description in the revised material and methods.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8. Figure 8: The lower diagram in C shows Graf and ROK KD leads to &quot;Ring constriction similar to controls&quot;. This is not supported by the data. You've broken the chain below the GAP, and therefore the phenotype should mimic ROK-KD alone, which is what 8B shows. The blue line is more similar to the green than to the black. ROK isn't in the competitive cycle like RhoGEF2 is. It is downstream. Regardless of what happens upstream, ROK-KD should largely prevent myosin activation and constriction, which the authors data show. And &quot;Dephosphorylated myosin 2&quot; would not lead to &quot;Ring Constriction similar to controls&quot; as the model suggests, it would lead to the results presented in the data.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for pointing this out. Yes this was indeed a typographical error. We have made a new summary diagram in Figure 9 and corrected this to show that there is loss of constriction in ROK RNAi and this is maintained in the <italic>Graf</italic><sup>CR57</sup> ROK RNAi combinations. ROK depletion suppresses the hyper constriction phenotype of <italic>Graf</italic><sup>CR57</sup>.</p></body></sub-article></article>
