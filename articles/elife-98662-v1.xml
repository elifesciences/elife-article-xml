first responders. The degree to which these cells interact in response to CNS damage is poorly understood, and even less so, in the neural retina, which poses a challenge for high-resolution imaging in vivo. In this study, we deploy fluorescence adaptive optics scanning light ophthalmoscopy (AOSLO) to study microglia and neutrophils in mice. We simultaneously track immune cell dynamics using label-free phase-contrast AOSLO at micron-level resolution. Retinal lesions were induced with 488 nm light focused onto photoreceptor (PR) outer segments. These lesions focally ablated PRs, with minimal collateral damage to cells above and below the plane of focus. We used in vivo AOSLO, and optical coherence tomography (OCT) imaging to reveal the natural history of the microglial and neutrophil response from minutes to months after injury. While microglia showed dynamic and progressive immune response with cells migrating into the injury locus within 1 day after injury, neutrophils were not recruited despite close proximity to vessels carrying neutrophils only microns away. Post-mortem confocal microscopy confirmed in vivo findings. This work illustrates that microglial activation does not recruit neutrophils in response to acute, focal loss of PRs, a condition encountered in many retinal diseases.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>uveitis</kwd><kwd>age-related macular degeneration</kwd><kwd>scanning laser ophthalmoscopy</kwd><kwd>adaptive optics</kwd><kwd>adaptive optics scanning laser ophthalmoscope</kwd><kwd>leukocytes</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000053</institution-id><institution>National Eye Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>EY028293</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Schallek</surname><given-names>Jesse</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000053</institution-id><institution>National Eye Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P30 EY001319</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Schallek</surname><given-names>Jesse</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100001818</institution-id><institution>Research to Prevent Blindness</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Career Advancement Award</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Schallek</surname><given-names>Jesse</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100001818</institution-id><institution>Research to Prevent Blindness</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Department of Ophthalmology Unrestricted Grant</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Schallek</surname><given-names>Jesse</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100001068</institution-id><institution>Dana Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>David Mahoney Neuroimaging Award</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Schallek</surname><given-names>Jesse</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004328</institution-id><institution>Genentech, Inc.</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Collaborative Research Grant</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Elstrott</surname><given-names>Justin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Systemic neutrophils do not respond to laser-induced photoreceptor damage despite the robust response from resident microglia.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>In the mammalian retina, a rapid and coordinated immune response to infection or injury is important for maintaining tissue homeostasis. This is especially critical in the eye since mature retinal neurons do not typically regenerate, resulting in long-term functional losses for the host (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Stone et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">GarcÃ­a-Ayuso et al., 2019</xref>). The retina is considered immune-privileged and is equipped with a resident population of innate immune cells, including microglia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Boycott and Hopkins, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Silverman and Wong, 2018</xref>). In healthy retina, microglia are distributed primarily in the inner retina, residing within nerve fiber layer (NFL), inner plexiform layer (IPL), and outer plexiform layer (OPL) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Wang et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Zhang et al., 2018</xref>), generally avoiding the nuclear layers. Microglia tile the retina and, like their counterparts in the brain, exhibit long, thin processes that continually probe the neuro-glial microenvironment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Silverman and Wong, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Joseph et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Nimmerjahn et al., 2005</xref>).</p><p>In addition to phagocytosing debris (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Neumann et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Zabel et al., 2016</xref>), regulating synaptic maintenance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Tremblay and Majewska, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Sipe et al., 2016</xref>), and removing dead tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">MÃ¡rquez-Ropero et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Karlen et al., 2020</xref>), microglia can secrete chemokines to recruit other leukocytes to help fight infection and repair damaged tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Silverman and Wong, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Okunuki et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kremlev et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Babcock et al., 2003</xref>). For many injuries, one of the first systemic responders recruited and activated by microglia are neutrophils (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Boyce et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Zhou et al., 2006</xref>). Neutrophils comprise a large fraction (20â30%) of leukocytes in murine blood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Provencher et al., 2010</xref>). They assist in maintaining tissue homeostasis by neutralizing foreign agents, regulating the immune response, and phagocytosing dead tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Burn et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Peiseler and Kubes, 2019</xref>). Under inflammatory conditions, the spatiotemporal interplay between microglia and neutrophils is poorly understood. A missed window of interaction is highly problematic in histological study where a single time point reveals a snapshot of the temporally complex immune response, which changes dynamically over time. Here, we use in vivo imaging to overcome these constraints.</p><p>Documenting immune cell interactions in the retina over time has been challenged by insufficient resolution and contrast to visualize single cells in the living eye. The microscopic size of immune cells requires exceptional resolution for detection. Recently, advances in adaptive optics scanning light ophthalmoscopy (AOSLO) imaging have provided micron-level resolution and enhanced contrast for imaging individual immune cells in the retina without requiring extrinsic dyes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Joseph et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Joseph et al., 2020</xref>). AOSLO provides multimodal information from confocal reflectance, phase-contrast, and fluorescence modalities, which can reveal a variety of cell types simultaneously in the living eye. Here, we used confocal AOSLO to track changes in reflectance at cellular scale. Phase-contrast AOSLO provides detail on highly translucent retinal structures such as vascular wall, single blood cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Guevara-Torres et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Joseph et al., 2019a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Joseph et al., 2019b</xref>), photoreceptor (PR) somata (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Guevara-Torres et al., 2015</xref>), and is well-suited to image resident and systemic immune cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Joseph et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Joseph et al., 2020</xref>). Fluorescence AOSLO provides the ability to study fluorescently labeled cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Guevara-Torres et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Geng et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Schallek et al., 2013</xref>) and exogenous dyes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Guevara-Torres et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Pinhas et al., 2013</xref>) throughout the living retina. These modalities used in combination have recently provided detailed images of the retinal response to a model of human uveitis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Joseph et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chu et al., 2016</xref>). Together, these innovations now provide a platform to visualize, for the first time, the dynamic interplay between many immune cell types, each with a unique role in tissue inflammation. We combine these innovative modalities with conventional histology and commercial scanning light ophthalmoscopy (SLO)/optical coherence tomography (OCT) to reveal the progressive nature of the cellular response to acute retinal injury.</p><p>Here, we ask the question: âTo what extent do microglia/neutrophils respond to acute neural loss in the retina?â To begin unraveling the complexities in this response, we deploy a deep retinal laser ablation model.

The complex temporal dynamics between resident and systemic immune cells unfolds from seconds to months and has been poorly characterized due to lack of resolution, sufficient contrast, and a non-destructive imaging approach that can track changes over time. Here, we overcome these limitations by using phase-contrast and fluorescent imaging with adaptive optics to visualize the interaction of multiple cell types. With this advanced imaging technology, we reveal the absence of neutrophil involvement in response to an acute injury, despite progressive changes in microglial activity and morphology. Here we discuss the implications of such findings in the context of retinal damage and more broadly, retinal disease.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Focal retinal lesions for tracking the immune response</title><p>Seminal studies in the brain have used focal light exposure to induce targeted, acute microglial responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Nimmerjahn et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Davalos et al., 2005</xref>). Since then, it has been a popular damage model. Focal lesions in the retina have been conducted in a number of popular animal models including mouse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Shah et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Khan et al., 2023</xref>), macaque (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Strazzeri et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dhakal et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Schwarz et al., 2018</xref>), and cats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Calford et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dreher et al., 2001</xref>). Laser damage is also clinically relevant as it is experienced with accidental laser exposure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Vitellas et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Linton et al., 2019</xref>), as well as purposeful ablation used in photocoagulation and as a therapy for retinal ischemic disease, retinopathy of prematurity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">American Academy of Ophthalmology, 2014</xref>), and diabetic retinopathy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Reddy and Husain, 2018</xref>). Thus, our results shed light toward the immune response that may be imparted due to phototoxic damage.</p><p>Light damage offers a number of advantages for creating acute damage in the retina. It offers placement precision that is better controlled than other invasive methods, such as incision/poke injuries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Senut et al., 2004</xref>), retinal detachment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Maidana et al., 2021</xref>), and chemical injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Wan et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">RÃ¶sch et al., 2015</xref>). In the mouse, focal light dosage comes with greater axial confinement within the retina by nature of the high numerical aperture of the mouse eye (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Geng et al., 2012</xref>), which imposes minimal collateral damage to layers above or below the plane of focus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). The damage took on an elliptical form, likely due to (1) eye motion from respiration and heart rate which spreads the light over a larger integrative area (rather than line). (2) The impact of focal light scatter. (3) A micron-thin line imparting damage on cells that are many microns across manifesting as an ellipse. Most light exposures produced lesions of this elliptical shape. For the reasons described above, some exposures failed to produce a strong, focal damage phenotype. To improve lesion reproducibility, future experiments should better control for subtle eye motions affecting light distribution, especially for long exposures.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Titration of the 488 nm laser leads to mild retinal damage</title><p>While it is beyond the scope of this report to catalog the vast parameter space in which light may impose damage in the retina, it is noteworthy to discuss that the exposure intensity, subtended angle, and duration of the light source we used delivered an intentionally mild damage to the retina. Using dosages too high would run the risk of collateral damage to the bloodâretinal barrier or Bruchâs membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Haupert et al., 2003</xref>), which could cause a choroidal neovascularization phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Shah et al., 2015</xref>). This would be undesirable for studying the native/systemic immune response as it could confound the traditional extravasation pathways of the inflammatory system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Joseph et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Ley et al., 2007</xref>). Instead, we chose our laser exposure condition to impart a weak, but reproducible loss of PRs while minimizing damage to the cells above and below the plane of focus.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Progressive PR loss and morphology of the lesion tracked over time</title><p>The amount of light delivered did not immediately ablate PRs as peak cell loss was not observed until 3â7 days after laser exposure, suggesting a progressive damage phenotype of apoptosis or necroptotic death. Histology showed ~27% reduction in PR nuclei 7 days post-lesion. The total number of PR nuclei within the lesion location returned to values similar to baseline by 2 months, which was surprising given that PRs do not regenerate. Our interpretation is that adjacent PRs spill into the region of loss, similar to what others have described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Strazzeri et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Busch et al., 1999</xref>). Corroborating the histological finding of mild cell loss, OCT shows no evidence of local edema, cavitation, or excavation of the ONL after PR loss (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). The return of the appearance, thickness, and redistribution of cells within the ablated location indicates that retinal remodeling occurs within 2 months. The concurrence of microglia in these outer retinal bands (where they are normally absent; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lee et al., 2008</xref>) supports the hypothesis that microglia localized to this region facilitate a phagocytic injury response and may contribute toward synaptic remodeling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Tremblay and Majewska, 2011</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>CX3CR1-GFP mice exhibit fluorescence not only in microglia</title><p>We recognize that the CX3CR1-GFP model can also label systemic cells such as monocytes/macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Jung et al., 2000</xref>). While it is possible these cells could infiltrate the retina in response to the lesion, we find it unlikely since there was no indication of the leukocyte extravasation cascade (rolling/crawling/stalled cells) within the nearest retinal vasculature. In addition to microglia, retinal perivascular macrophages and hyalocytes also exhibit GFP fluorescence, and these cells may also contribute toward damage resolution.</p></sec><sec id="s3-6"><title>The hyperreflective phenotype does not arise from microglia or neutrophils</title><p>Light damage is known to create hyper-reflective bands in OCT imaging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dhakal et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Miller et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Wu et al., 2018</xref>). A common speculation is that the increased backscatter may arise from local inflammatory cells that activate or move into the damage location. In our data, confocal AOSLO and OCT revealed a hyperreflective band at the OPL/ONL after 488 nm light exposure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A and B</xref>). We found that the hyperreflective bands appeared within 30 minutes after the laser injury, preceding any detectable microglial migration toward the damage location (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6âfigure supplement 1</xref>). We thus conclude that the initial hyperreflective phenotype is not caused by microglial cell activity or aggregation.</p></sec><sec id="s3-7"><title>Direct activation of microglia from 488 nm light exposure was minimal</title><p>It is conceivable that 488 nm light used for either imaging (56 ÂµW) or imparting damage (785 ÂµW) might activate the GFP-containing microglia used here. However, several lines of evidence speak against this possibility. (1) We did not observe photobleaching of CX3CR1-positive cells in response to the damage, suggesting the light was insufficient to damage microglia. (2) For retinal injury, the focal plane was adjusted such that the dose was axially concentrated onto the outer retina. Thus, the light dosage received by microglia above was defocused and less than the targeted PR layer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). (3) Histology showed no evident necrotic/apoptotic microglial morphologies.</p></sec><sec id="s3-8"><title>488 nm laser lesion does not photocoagulate or alter retinal circulation</title><p>Despite imparting damage to the PRs, the damage regime used here did not alter the perfusion of the retinal circulation. We show three independent measures that blood flow is uninterrupted, despite PR loss and activation of microglia. (1) Fluorescein angiography (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, bottom) revealed an absence of vascular leakage. (2) AOSLO motion-contrast vascular maps (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Sulai et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Guevara-Torres et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Schallek et al., 2013</xref>) displayed persistent blood perfusion inside vessels near lesion sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>).

Altogether, these three lines of evidence indicate that the lesion did not compromise the bloodâretinal barrier or impart perfusion changes within the retinal vasculature.</p></sec><sec id="s3-9"><title>Resident microglia do not need systemic neutrophils for resolution of mild laser damage</title><p>The CNS and retina, unlike other peripheral tissues, cannot suffer from excess inflammation as there may be dire functional consequences. Therefore, it is possible that microglia protect against exorbitant inflammation by modulating the recruitment of systemic inflammatory cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Silverman and Wong, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Okunuki et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kremlev et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Babcock et al., 2003</xref>). Of these, neutrophils are often one of the first systemic responders. Despite their helpful roles in other tissues, neutrophils can secrete neurotoxic compounds that could present a danger to the CNS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Allen et al., 2012</xref>). Given their conflicted role in the body, we ask the question: to what extent do neutrophils respond to acute neural loss in the retina? Retinal cells are lost with age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Panda-Jonas et al., 1995</xref>) and disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Margalit and Sadda, 2003</xref>) and yet, for the organism, visual perception must persist. There are limitations on how generalizable this mild damage is to other damage or disease phenotypes, but this acute damage model can provide clues about how immune cells interact in response to PR loss. In this laser lesion model, we ablate 27% of the PRs in a 50 Âµm region.</p><p>We find that microglia undergo a rapid and progressive response to this injury. We show evidence of PR phagocytosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s2">Figure 9âfigure supplement 2</xref>), interaction with neighboring microglia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s1">Figure 9âfigure supplement 1</xref>), and they are also axially positioned to facilitate retinal remodeling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). Furthermore, throughout the temporal evolution of the microglial response, we find no evidence of neutrophil recruitment despite the damage being within 10s of microns from retinal vessels that carry them. At the onset of the neutrophil extravasation cascade, endothelial cells in the vicinity of inflamed tissue typically elevate the expression of adhesion molecules, facilitating the adherence and extravasation of circulating neutrophils (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Sadik et al., 2011</xref>). Furthermore, neutrophils are dependent on priming events as prerequisite to further activation and engagement of their effector functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Worthen et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Linas et al., 1992</xref>). Based on our data, we suggest that although microglia show a strong and lasting activation, at no time point from seconds to months are the damage-associated molecular patterns or chemotactic gradients strong enough to recruit neutrophils in response to this damage. This is evidenced in our data from two key observations: (1) we saw no examples of systemic leukocytes rolling in vessels adjacent to injury locations (<xref ref-type="video" rid="fig8video1">Figure 8âvideo 1</xref>). (2) We did not observe adherent or extravasated neutrophils adjacent to imparted PR loss (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). This may suggest that the region of insult is too small, or that activated microglia are not sufficient for recruiting neutrophils with damage of this magnitude. Perhaps a minimum threshold of neural damage must be met before neutrophils will respond. It is possible that resident microglia facilitate the necessary phagocytic and retinal remodeling response despite release of cytokines from damaged retinal cells that would normally recruit systemic immune cells in peripheral tissues. Such a strategy would benefit the CNS.</p><p>Future work will explore whether there is a threshold magnitude of neuronal cell loss required for recruitment of systemic cells that is unique to the retina. Next studies will examine more severe or widespread injury regimes that provide stronger activating molecular signals and interact with a larger population of systemic cells.</p></sec><sec id="s3-10"><title>Microglia may inhibit neutrophil activation</title><p>Microglia may be involved in a system that protects the CNS from propagating a larger systemic response, potentially exacerbating disease pathologies that would compromise overall CNS function. In another damage model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Uderhardt et al., 2019</xref>), they report that tissue-resident macrophages may exhibit the capacity to cloak tissue micro-damage. This offers the possibility that resident immune cells, such as retinal microglia, can handle small insults without inducing a chemokine cascade that may invoke a larger systemic response that could further damage the precious retinal tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Pfeifer et al., 2023</xref>). Regardless of the mechanism, we find that despite a robust microglial activation that lasts for weeks, at no time point do they recruit neutrophils. The nuance of this interaction likely represents the fine balance that facilitates a helpful local response within the CNS that does not impart a widespread cytokine storm that may otherwise exacerbate retinal damage. Further work will explore whether microglia exhibit a cloaking response in the retina, inhibiting neutrophil or other immune cell extravasation/chemotaxis toward lesion sites. We expect such work to be pivotal in understanding the balance that is broken or left unchecked in conditions of autoimmune disease and the umbrella of diseases that comprise the uveitic response, a direct threat to lifelong vision (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Miserocchi et al., 2013</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-11"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Here, we have applied innovative in vivo imaging at the microscopic scale to reveal the cellular immune response to a retina in jeopardy. The dynamic environment of the retina includes a native population of resident microglia and systemic immune cells delivered through the vasculature. These two lines of defense work in concert in the mammalian body and are critical for maintaining retinal homeostasis. In this work, we directly study the interaction between microglia and neutrophils, two major classes of immune cells that are implicated in inflammatory initiation, escalation, propagation, and debris removal in response to acute geographical injury in the retina. Using cutting-edge retinal imaging modalities, we find that resident microglia become locally activated and regionally responsive to focal laser lesion. They migrate away from their stratified locations near plexiform layers of the retina and toward the site of damage within hours to weeks after injury. However, systemic neutrophils, which are typically regarded as first-line responders to tissue damage, are not recruited to this damage despite neutrophils flowing within 10s of microns away from the location of damage (<xref ref-type="video" rid="fig8video2">Figure 8âvideo 2</xref>). Beyond the context of this specific finding, we share this work with the excitement that AOSLO cellular-level imaging may reveal the interaction of multiple immune cell types in the living retina. By using fluorophores associated with specific immune cell populations, the complex dynamics that orchestrate the immune response may be examined in this specialized tissue. This work and future studies may reveal further insights to the interactions of single immune cells in the living body in a noninvasive way.</p></sec><sec id="s3-12"><title>Limitations and future directions</title><p>This work represents some of the earliest reports of single immune cell interactions in the living retina. To narrow the scope, we focus on one type of injury, a targeted elimination of photoreceptors. Thus, these findings are limited to one type of injury that may be experienced in the retina. We expect that these seminal demonstrations will serve as a platform for future studies that examine the large parameter space of retinal damage. These include (1) conditions of greater severity with increased power, duration, and extent of light damage. (2) Models of systemic and local infection.

C57BL/6J (#000664, Jackson Labs, Bar Harbor, ME) mice were used to track the retinal phenotype after laser exposure. Heterozygous CX3CR1-GFP (#005582, Jackson Labs) mice were used to track GFP-expressing microglia. Mice with heterozygous transgenic expression of tdTomato in neutrophils (âCatchupâ mice) were provided by the foundry lab of M. Gunzer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hasenberg et al., 2015</xref>). 18 mice (10 males, 8 females) in total were used for in vivo imaging. 10 additional mice (5 males, 5 females) were used for ex vivo histology. Ages for all mice used for this work were postnatal weeks 6â24.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Preparation for in vivo imaging</title><p>Mice were anesthetized with intraperitoneal injection of ketamine (100 mg/kg) and xylazine (10 mg/kg). The pupil was dilated with 1% tropicamide (Sandoz, Basel, Switzerland) and 2.5% phenylephrine (Akorn, Lake Forest, IL). A custom contact lens (1.5 mm base curve, 3.2 mm diameter,+10 diopter power, Advanced Vision Technologies, Lakewood, CO) was fitted to the eye. For a subset of experiments, 50 mg/kg fluorescein (AK-FLUOR, Akorn, Decatur, IL) was administered by intraperitoneal injection to confirm vascular integrity and perfusion status after injury. During AOSLO imaging, anesthesia was supplemented with 1% (v/v) isoflurane in oxygen and mice were maintained at 37Â°C via electric heat pad. Eye hydration was maintained throughout imaging with regular application of saline eye drops (Refresh tears, Allergan, Sydney, Australia) and lubricating eye gel (Genteal, Alcon Laboratories Inc, Fort Worth, TX). Mice were placed in a positioning frame with 6 degrees of freedom to allow for stable animal positioning and aid in retinal navigation.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>In vivo AOSLO imaging</title><p>Four light sources were used for AOSLO imaging. A 904 nm diode source (12 ÂµW, Qphotonics, Ann Arbor, MI) was used for wavefront sensing. A second 796 nm superluminescent diode (196 ÂµW, Superlum, Cork, Ireland) was used for reflectance imaging, including confocal and phase-contrast modes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Guevara-Torres et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Geng et al., 2012</xref>). A third 488 nm light source (56 ÂµW, Toptica Photonics, Farmington, NY) was used to visualize GFP-positive microglia in CX3CR1-GFP mice. A fourth 561 nm light source (95 ÂµW, Toptica Photonics) was used to visualize tdTomato-positive neutrophils in Catchup mice. All light sources were fiber-coupled and axially combined through the AOSLO system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Geng et al., 2012</xref>). Fast (15.4 kHz) and slow (25 Hz) scanners create a raster scan pattern, which is relayed through a series of afocal telescopes to and from the eye. A Shack-Hartmann wavefront sensor (consisting of a lenslet array and a Rolera XR camera, QImaging, Surrey, Canada) measures the aberrations of the eye and a deformable mirror (ALPAO, Montbonnot-Saint-Martin, France) provided the wavefront correction. Reflected 796 nm light was collected with a photomultiplier tube (H7422-50, Hamamatsu Photonics, Hamamatsu, Japan). All confocal reflectance images were captured with a 30 Âµm pinhole (1.3 Airy Disc Diameters, ADD). Phase contrast was achieved by displacing the pinhole relative to the principal axis of the detection plane as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Guevara-Torres et al., 2020</xref>). Fluorescence was captured with a photomultiplier tube (H7422-40, Hamamatsu) either coupled with a 520Î35 band-pass filter (FF01-520/35-25, Semrock, Rochester, NY) for GFP emission or a 630Î92 band-pass filter (FF01-630/92-25, Semrock) for tdTomato emission. All fluorescent images were captured with a confocal 50 Âµm pinhole (2.1 ADD). Image field sizes were either 4.98Â° Ã 3.95Â° or 2.39Â° Ã 1.94Â°. NIR and visible imaging channels were made coplanar, compensating for longitudinal chromatic aberration by independently focusing each light source onto the same axial structure in the retina. Through-focus stacks were acquired by sequentially changing the focus from NFL to the PR outer segments by using the defocus term on the custom adaptive optics control software.</p><p>As described previously, red blood cell (RBC) imaging was achieved by combining phase-contrast imaging with a strategy to arrest the slow galvanometer scanner and let the resonant scanner project a single âlineâ (0.71Â° scan angle) on the retina. This enabled RBC flux imaging by positioning this line orthogonal to the direction of flow for single capillaries. As blood cells moved through capillaries, they were âself-scannedâ producing images of RBCs in space/time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Guevara-Torres et al., 2016</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>PR laser damage model and post-injury time points for imaging</title><p>488 nm light (continuous wave laser diode, Â±4 nm bandwidth, Toptica Photonics) was used to create an acute laser injury. 785 ÂµW of 488 nm light was projected through the AOSLO and focused onto the PR outer segments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) for 3 minutes in a single line on the retina subtending 24 Ã 1 Âµm to concentrate the power to a small region. Laser injuries were placed between 5 and 15Â° from the optic disc. To avoid absorption confounds, we refrained from placing lesions beneath large retinal vessels. For experiments examining neutrophil involvement, lesions were placed &lt;100 Âµm away from retinal veins and within microns of capillaries to increase the chance of extravasation through these preferred pathways in the retina (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Crane and Liversidge, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Xu et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Xu et al., 2004</xref>). As many as four such lesions were placed per retina. This protocol produced a hyper-reflective phenotype in the &gt;40 locations across 28 mice. In rare cases, the exposure yielded no hyperreflective lesion and was often in mice with high retinal motion, where the light dosage was spread over a larger retinal area. These locations were not included in the in vivo or histological analysis.</p><p>Throughout this work, we assessed the effects of the laser injury for the following time points: baseline/control, 1 day (18â28 hours), 3 days, 7 days, and 2 months.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>In vivo SLO and OCT imaging</title><p>To confirm global ocular health and changes imparted by the laser damage, a commercial Heidelberg Spectralis system (Heidelberg, Germany) was used to acquire SLO and OCT images. 30Â° and 55Â° fields were used for SLO acquisitions. The 30Â° field was used for OCT acquisitions. For some experiments, fluorescein angiography was captured by imaging the retina within 10 minutes of fluorescein administration (details above). The fluorescence mode of the SLO also enabled wide-field images of GFP positive microglia.</p><p>OCT was used to provide detailed information regarding the axial nature of the laser damage. We used a coarse scan area to capture several damage locations in a single field (61 B-scans, 1.02 Ã 0.85 mm). A dense 3D data cube was also captured (49 B-scans, 513 Ã 171 Âµm). âFollow-upâ mode, which allows the HRA software to return to the same retinal location, was used whenever possible. To reveal the cross-sectional profile for each lesion, several adjacent B-scans were spatially averaged (~30 Âµm).</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Preparation for ex vivo imaging</title><p>Mice were euthanized by CO<sub>2</sub> asphyxiation followed by cervical dislocation. Within 5 minutes of asphyxiation, eyes were enucleated and placed in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA, diluted from: #15714S, Electron Microscopy Sciences, Hatfield, Pennsylvania) in 1Ã phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, #806552, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) for 1 hour at room temperature. Eyes were dissected to remove the cornea, lens, and vitreous. Each eye cup was placed in one well of a 24-well plate containing 0.5 ml of 0.8% PFA and left overnight at 4Â°C. The retina was separated from the retinal pigmented epithelium/choroid with attention to preserve inner retinal layers âupâ orientation. If not applying antibody, the tissue was directly flat mounted (see below). For antibody staining, the retina was placed in 1Ã BD perm/wash buffer (#554723, BD Biosciences, Franklin Lakes, NJ) with 5% donkey serum (#D9663, Sigma-Aldrich) diluted in PBS for overnight incubation at room temperature with gentle shaking. The following was performed in the dark. Ly-6G-647 antibody (1:200, #127610, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID:AB_1134159">AB_1134159</ext-link>, BioLegend, San Diego, CA) and DAPI (1:500 of 10 mg/ml stock, #4083, Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA) were diluted in 1Ã perm/wash buffer and retinas were incubated for 3 days at room temperature with gentle shaking. Retinas were washed with PBS three times over 3 hours. The retina was cut into four radially symmetrical petals, flat-mounted on a glass slide in Vectashield mounting buffer (H-1000-10, Vector Labs, Newark, CA) with a #1.5 cover slip (#260406, Ted Pella Inc, Redding, CA), sealed with nail polish, and stored at 4Â°C until imaged.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Ex vivo confocal imaging</title><p>Whole-mount retinas were imaged with a Nikon A1 confocal microscope (Melville, NY). DAPI (405 nm ex, 441Î66 nm em), CX3CR1-GFP (488 nm ex, 525Î50 nm em), and Catchup/anti-Ly-6G-647 (635 nm ex, 665Î50 nm em) were simultaneously imaged. Z-stacks (0.1 or 0.5 Âµm step size) at control or laser-damaged locations were acquired with a Ã60 oil objective, producing images that were 295 Ã 295 Âµm. Larger (796 Ã 796 Âµm) z-stacks were acquired by blending several 60Ã z-stack acquisitions (3 Ã 3, 15% overlap) using Nikon NIS Elements software. z-stacks were re-sliced (ImageJ FIJI; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Schindelin et al., 2012</xref>; X-Z dimension) to visualize fluorescence depth profiles.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Endotoxin-induced uveitis protocol</title><p>To serve as a positive control and show evidence of known neutrophil invasion, we adopted the EIU model to confirm that fluorescent Catchup neutrophils could be observed in vivo with AOSLO.

Briefly, we performed intravitreal injections of lipopolysaccharide (LPS, #L4391, Sigma-Aldrich). Mice were anesthetized with ketamine and xylazine. A 34-gauge Hamilton needle was used to deliver 1 Âµl (1 ng) of LPS diluted in PBS into the vitreous posterior to the limbus. 1 day post-LPS injection, mice were either imaged with AOSLO (Catchup mice) or collected for ex vivo histology (Ly-6G-647 stained C57BL/6J mice) to confirm fluorescent neutrophil presence in the neural parenchyma.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>AOSLO image processing</title><p>To correct residual motion from heart rate and respiration, AOSLO videos were registered with a custom cross-correlation-based frame registration software (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dubra and Harvey, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Yang et al., 2014</xref>). Motion correction was also applied to simultaneously collected fluorescence videos. After registration, confocal, phase-contrast, and fluorescence AOSLO videos were temporally averaged (250 frames, 10 seconds).

Data was centered at a lesion location 3 days post-laser exposure. ImageJ was used to manually measure the en-face diameter of nuclei in their short and long axis. We averaged the two measurements and assumed spherical shape for analysis. These measurements aided in the differentiation of PRs, invading microglia and PR phagosomes.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Quantification of RBC flux in capillaries</title><p>Using the capillary line-scan approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Guevara-Torres et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Joseph et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dholakia et al., 2020</xref>), we quantified RBC flux within an epoch of 1 second.

Why the same was not observed here in this article remains an open question. One could hypothesize that neutrophil recruitment might indeed occur under conditions that are more in line with the more extreme damage models, for example, with a stronger and global ablation (substantially more photoreceptor loss over a larger area). This parameter space is unwieldy and sufficiently large to address the question conclusively in the current article, i.e. how much photoreceptor loss leads to neutrophil recruitment? By the same token, the strong and general conclusion in the title - Photoreceptor loss does not recruit neutrophils - cannot be made until an exhaustive exploration be made of the same parameter space. A scaling back may help here, to reflect the specific, mild form of laser damage explored here, for instance - Mild photoreceptor loss does not recruit neutrophils despite...</p></disp-quote><p>We are striving for clarity and accuracy in our title without adding too many qualifiers. At present, we feel that the title as submitted is consistent and aligned with the central finding of our manuscript. The nuance that the reviewer points to is elaborated in the body of the manuscript and we hope the general readership appreciates the same level of detail as appreciated by reviewer #3.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>EIU model - The EIU model was used as a positive control for neutrophil extravasation. Prior work with flow cytometry has shown a substantial increase in neutrophil counts in the EIU model. Yet, in all, the entire article shows exactly 2 examples in vivo and 3 ex vivo (Figure 7) of extravasated neutrophils from the EIU model (n = 2 mice). The general conclusion made about neutrophil recruitment (or lack thereof) is built partly upon this positive control experiment. But these limited examples, especially in the case where literature reports a preponderance of extravasated neutrophils, raise a question on the paradigm(s) used to evaluate this effect in the mild laser damage model.</p></disp-quote><p>This is a helpful suggestion. We agree that readers should see more evidence of the positive control. Therefore we have now included two more supplementary files that show that there is a strong neutrophil response to EIU. In Figure 7 â supplementary figure 1, we show many Ly-6G-positive neutrophils in the retina seen with histology at the 24 hour time point. In Figure 7 â video 3, we show massive Catchup-positive neutrophil presence in vivo at 24hrs as well. This aligns with our positive control and also the literature.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Overall, the strengths outweigh the weaknesses, provided the conclusions/interpretations are reconsidered.</p></disp-quote><p>With the added clarification about the magnitude of the neutrophil response in EIU, we feel that the conclusions presented in the manuscript as-is are valid and appropriate.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Recommendations for the authors:</bold></p><p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p><p>The authors are applauded for embracing the reviewers' feedback and making substantial revisions. Some minor comments below:</p><p>The weakness noted in the public review encourages the authors to reconsider the interpretations drawn based on the results. One would have expected to see far more examples of extravasated neutrophils from the EIU model. That this was not seen weakens the neutrophil recruitment claim substantially. Even without this claim, the methods, laser damage model, time-course and spatial activation pattern of microglial activation are all striking and unprecedented. So, as stated in the public review, the strengths do indeed outweigh the weaknesses once the neutrophil claim is softened.</p></disp-quote><p>We address this in the response above. A strong neutrophil response was observed to EIU. This was confirmed with both histology and in vivo imaging.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>This was alluded to by Reviewer 1 in the prior review - at times, there is an overemphasis on imaging technology that distracts from the scientific questions. The imaging is undoubtedly cutting-edge but also documented in prior work by the authors. Any efforts to reduce or balance the emphasis would help with the general flow.</p></disp-quote><p>Given that these discoveries are made possible partly through new technology, we prefer to keep the details of the innovation in the current manuscript. Given the exceptionally large readership of eLife, we feel some description of the AOSLO imaging is warranted in the manuscript.</p></body></sub-article></article>
