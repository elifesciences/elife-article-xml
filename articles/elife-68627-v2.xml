cells. How actomyosin activity directs membrane extensions to engulf such diverse targets remains unclear. Here, we combine lattice light-sheet microscopy (LLSM) with microparticle traction force microscopy (MP-TFM) to quantify actin dynamics and subcellular forces during macrophage phagocytosis. We show that spatially localized forces leading to target constriction are prominent during phagocytosis of antibody-opsonized targets. This constriction is largely driven by Arp2/3-mediated assembly of discrete actin protrusions containing myosin 1e and 1f (‘teeth’) that appear to be interconnected in a ring-like organization. Contractile myosin-II activity contributes to late-stage phagocytic force generation and progression, supporting a specific role in phagocytic cup closure. Observations of partial target eating attempts and sudden target release via a popping mechanism suggest that constriction may be critical for resolving complex in vivo target encounters. Overall, our findings present a phagocytic cup shaping mechanism that is distinct from cytoskeletal remodeling in 2D cell motility and may contribute to mechanosensing and phagocytic plasticity.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>phagocytosis</kwd><kwd>cytoskeleton</kwd><kwd>actin</kwd><kwd>myosin</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000968</institution-id><institution>American Heart Association</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Predoctoral fellowship 18PRE34070066</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Barger</surname><given-names>Sarah R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000062</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01DK083345</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Krendel</surname><given-names>Mira</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100005010</institution-id><institution>Associazione Italiana per la Ricerca sul Cancro</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Investigator Grant 20716</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gauthier</surname><given-names>Nils C</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Theriot</surname><given-names>Julie A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000884</institution-id><institution>Cancer Research Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CRI Irvington fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Vorselen</surname><given-names>Daan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01GM138652</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Krendel</surname><given-names>Mira</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>During ingestion of antibody-coated targets, phagocytes probe and deform the target via Arp2/3-dependent protrusions and myosin-dependent constriction during cup closure.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Phagocytic uptake of microbial pathogens, apoptotic cells, and debris are essential processes for human health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Boada-Romero et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lim et al., 2017</xref>). Given the variety of phagocytic targets, ranging widely in shape, size, and mechanical stiffness, this process requires remarkable plasticity. Phagocytosis is initiated when phagocytic receptors recognize distinct molecular patterns coating the target (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Freeman and Grinstein, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Uribe-Querol and Rosales, 2020</xref>). Selective engagement and specific exclusion of phagocyte receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Freeman et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Freeman et al., 2016</xref>) enables downstream signaling to initiate the formation of membrane protrusions, which are guided around the target through sequential ligand engagement in a zipper-like fashion to form the phagocytic cup (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Griffin and Silverstein, 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Jaumouillé and Waterman, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Swanson and Hoppe, 2004</xref>). Mechanically, progression of the phagocytic cup is powered by F-actin polymerization that pushes the plasma membrane forward and culminates in the eventual closure of the cup and the formation of a membrane-enclosed phagosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Vorselen et al., 2020a</xref>).</p><p>Previously, F-actin within the phagocytic cup was generally considered to be homogenous and the membrane extensions around the target were frequently likened to lamellipodia at the leading edge of a migrating cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Blanchoin et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Davidson and Wood, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Jaumouillé and Waterman, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Small et al., 2002</xref>). Yet recent studies have identified dynamic adhesions or podosome-like structures within the phagocytic cup that appear to be sites of actin polymerization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Barger et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Ostrowski et al., 2019</xref>). This suggests a fundamentally different mechanism for cup shaping based on assembly of individual actin-based protrusions versus a uniform actin meshwork. Podosomes are specialized F-actin adhesive structures that are prominent in myeloid cells and capable of generating forces and degrading extracellular matrix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Linder, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">van den Dries et al., 2019a</xref>). Interestingly, podosomes are mechanosensitive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Labernadie et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">van den Dries et al., 2019b</xref>), generating greater forces in response to stiffer substrates, and thus podosome-like structures may contribute to the mechanosensitivity observed in phagocytosis<bold>,</bold> whereby phagocytes engulf stiffer targets more readily than softer ones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Beningo and Wang, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Jaumouillé et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Sosale et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Vorselen et al., 2020b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Vorselen et al., 2020a</xref>). The ‘core’ structure of podosomes is primarily composed of branched F-actin nucleated by the Arp2/3 complex. The Arp2/3 complex itself was initially considered to be critical for all modes of phagocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">May et al., 2000</xref>), although subsequent work using <italic>Arpc2<sup>-/-</sup></italic> macrophages has revealed that in Fc receptor (FcR)-mediated phagocytosis, a dendritic actin network is only critical for the ingestion of larger targets (&gt;6 μm) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Rotty et al., 2017</xref>). This inhibition of phagocytosis upon loss of the Arp2/3 complex activity may relate to the cell’s ability to form IgG-FcR microclusters at the earliest stages of FcR signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Jo et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>The mechanism of phagocytic cup closure and the involvement of specific myosin motor proteins therein has also remained elusive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Barger et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Jaumouillé and Waterman, 2020</xref>). The distinct localization of myosin-I at the rim of the phagocytic cup has led to a speculated role in cup closure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Barger et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Swanson et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Ikeda et al., 2017</xref>). Myosin-II has also been hypothesized to orchestrate a ‘purse-string’ contractility based on observations of phagocytes deforming red blood cells during internalization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Araki et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Barger et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Swanson et al., 1999</xref> ). However, the effect of myosin-II inhibition on phagocytic uptake efficiency is highly variable, with some studies showing no effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Jaumouillé et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Rotty et al., 2017</xref>) and others reporting a 40–80% reduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Olazabal et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Sosale et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Tsai and Discher, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Yamauchi et al., 2012</xref>). Myosin-II inhibition also has limited effect on traction forces tangential to the target surface in 2D spreading assays known as frustrated phagocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kovari et al., 2016</xref>). Together these studies show that the actin dynamics within the membrane extensions of the phagocytic cup must be finely tuned for successful engulfment, but the role of specific myosin motor proteins and any associated contractility in cup closure remains to be elucidated.</p><p>It is clear that phagocytosis is driven by mechanical forces, but examining these forces has been challenging due to the limitations of experimental approaches. Changes in cellular tension during phagocytosis measured by micropipette aspiration have been well studied (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Heinrich, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Herant et al., 2005</xref>), but this technique fails to capture cell-target forces and the spatial variation within the phagocytic cup. Recently, traction force microscopy (TFM) combined with frustrated phagocytosis assays has been used to measure cell-target forces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Barger et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Jaumouillé et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kovari et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Rougerie and Cox, 2020</xref>), however, this assay fails to capture the biologically relevant geometry of the phagocytic cup, which likely affects cytoskeletal dynamics and force generation. Moreover, in its most common application, TFM only measures forces tangential to the target surface, neglecting forces normal to the target surface, which may be critical. With the recent introduction of particle-based force sensing methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Mohagheghian et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Träber et al., 2019</xref>), particularly microparticle traction force microscopy (MP-TFM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Vorselen et al., 2020b</xref>), both normal and shear force components can now be studied throughout phagocytosis.</p><p>Here, we utilize live-cell imaging combining MP-TFM and lattice light-sheet microscopy (LLSM) to reveal how mechanical forces generated by actin polymerization and myosin contractility drive phagocytic engulfment mediated by FcR. We show that phagocytes assemble F-actin ‘teeth’ that mediate target constriction throughout phagocytosis. Analysis of forces shows a unique signature, in which target constriction, or squeezing, is balanced by pulling forces at the base of the phagocytic cup at early stages and target compression throughout the cup at later stages. Together, normal forces far exceed shear forces at the cell-target interface, pointing to a mechanism fundamentally distinct from lamellipodial spreading in cell motility. We find that target constriction is mediated by Arp2/3-mediated actin polymerization throughout phagocytosis. Moreover, based on both force analysis and precise quantitative measurement of cup progression, we establish a clear role for myosin-II purse string contractility, specifically in phagocytic cup closure. Finally, we present how this force signature might be critical for target selection and ingestion in more complex physiological settings.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>LLSM reveals sequence of target deformations induced during live phagocytic engulfment</title><p>Given the fast, 3D, and light-sensitive nature of phagocytosis, we used LLSM for high-speed volumetric imaging with minimal phototoxicity to investigate cytoskeletal dynamics and phagocytic forces. To monitor internalization in real time, RAW264.7 macrophages were transfected with mEmerald-Lifeact for labeling of filamentous actin and were fed deformable acrylamide-<italic>co</italic>-acrylic acid-microparticles (DAAMPs) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). To investigate FcR-mediated phagocytosis, DAAMPs were functionalized with BSA and anti-BSA IgG, as well as AF647-Cadaverine for visualization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Vorselen et al., 2020b</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>). RAW macrophages were fed DAAMPs with a diameter of 9 µm and a Young’s modulus of 1.4 or 6.5 kPa, which is in the same range as healthy tissue cells and physiological targets of macrophages like apoptotic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Cross et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Van der Meeren et al., 2020</xref>). RAW macrophages typically formed a chalice-shaped phagocytic cup and completed phagocytosis in a similar timeframe (~3 min) as previously reported for much stiffer (2–3 GPa) polystyrene particles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Horsthemke et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). 3D shape reconstructions of the DAAMPs enabled us to examine target deformations as a direct readout of phagocytic forces in real time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b–c</xref>). We observed target constriction defined by discrete spots of deformation that appeared around the circumference of the DAAMP at the rim of the phagocytic cup (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video2">Video 2</xref>). While these deformations were more apparent using the softer 1.4 kPa DAAMPs, qualitatively similar force patterns were observed using stiffer 6.5 kPa targets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video3">Video 3</xref>) and previously using 0.3 kPa targets with fixed J774 macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Vorselen et al., 2020b</xref>). Interestingly, these indentations traveled parallel to the direction of phagocytic cup elongation, along the length of the DAAM particle until cup closure and were associated with ~400 nm maximum target constriction for 1.4 kPa DAAMPs (<xref ref-type="video" rid="video2">Video 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). To determine whether this behavior was also present in primary macrophages, we also imaged bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) transfected with mEmerald-Lifeact and observed a similar mechanical progression, albeit with smaller deformations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). In addition to local deformations in RAW macrophages, we also observed bulk compressive stresses during phagocytic cup progression (~0.5 kPa) and after complete internalization of the DAAMPs (up to 1.5 kPa), leading to a dramatic reduction in DAAMP diameter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). The spherical appearance of targets and the gradual monotonic increase in compression after completion of engulfment suggests that this compression may relate to the recently observed shrinkage of internalized macropinosomes by osmotic pressure changes regulated by ion flux (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Freeman et al., 2020</xref>). However, we sometimes observed the appearance of an F-actin shell around the target, similar to previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Liebl and Griffiths, 2009</xref>), suggesting that cytoskeletal forces may also contribute to such compression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video4">Video 4</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Combined microparticle traction force microscopy (MP-TFM) and lattice light-sheet microscopy (LLSM) reveals phagocytic force-induced deformations in real time.</title><p>RAW macrophages transfected with mEmerald-Lifeact were fed soft deformable acrylamide-<italic>co</italic>-acrylic acid micro (DAAM)-particles (9 μm,1.4 kPa) functionalized with IgG and AF647-Cadaverineand imaged using LLSM.

Such artifacts result in large apparent particle deformations inside and outside the cell-target contact area, and can make it impossible to converge on a solution when solving the elasticity theory problem to infer tractions from target deformations.

The shear forces were consistent in magnitude with reported values using TFM during frustrated phagocytosis on planar gels of similar rigidity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Rougerie and Cox, 2020</xref>) and were ~7-fold lower than the observed normal forces, independent of the stage of phagocytic engulfment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d</xref>).

This analysis confirmed a clear accumulation of F-actin near the front of the phagocytic cup (~5-fold higher than at the cup base), which precisely colocalized with the site of maximal applied inward normal forces regardless of engulfment stage, as illustrated by quantifying the surface mean curvature (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2f</xref>). A similar distribution of F-actin and deformation was observed with stiffer 6.5 kPa targets, albeit with smaller target deformations, and interestingly, less F-actin accumulation in the cup rim (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p>To investigate how phagocytic forces change during phagocytic progression, we arranged cups in order by the fraction of their particle surface engulfed, which allowed us to reconstruct phagocytic engulfment over time from fixed cell images (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2g</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Since DAAMPs cause little optical distortion, measurable features of the phagocytic cups could be analyzed independent of cup orientation and engulfment stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Vorselen et al., 2020b</xref>). We found no marked accumulation of cups at any specific stage, suggesting no bottleneck or rate-limiting steps, which had been previously reported around 50% engulfment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">van Zon et al., 2009</xref>). However, we did observe a strong increase in global target deformation, measured as the inverse of target sphericity, with phagocytic progression (Spearman’s <italic>ρ</italic> = –0.62, p = 5.0 × 10<sup>–8</sup>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2h</xref>). This decrease in target sphericity was, at least partially, due to a 4% ± 1% (p = 1.9 × 10<sup>–7</sup>) average increase in DAAMP elongation along the phagocytic axis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2h</xref>), which is consistent with constriction orthogonal to the phagocytic axis. Direct analysis of target constriction and F-actin peak intensity for each phagocytic cup (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2i</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>) revealed an apparent contractile ring in almost all (~96%) cups. The location of this actin contractile ring along the phagocytic axis correlated extremely well with phagocytic progression (<italic>ρ</italic> = 0.93, p = 3.2 × 10<sup>–29</sup>) and led to target constriction increasing from ~80 nm in early-stage (fraction engulfed &lt;40%) to ~210 nm in late-stage cups (fraction engulfed &gt;70%). This is a direct effect of increasing normal forces at the cup rim (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2j</xref>). Strikingly, in early stages of phagocytosis, net pulling (or outward normal) forces were observed throughout the phagocytic cup and particularly at the base (~3 nN total force, &gt; 100 Pa tensile stresses) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2j</xref>), whereas in late-stage phagocytosis strong net compressive stresses were observed.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Arp2/3-mediated actin polymerization drives force generation throughout phagocytosis, whereas myosin-II powers cup closure</title><p>The striking observations of target constriction becoming more pronounced later in engulfment inspired us to consider distinct contributions of actin assembly and myosin-mediated contractility to force generation during phagocytosis. To separate the effects of these two actin-dependent processes, we inhibited Arp2/3-mediated and formin-mediated actin polymerization, as well as myosin-II activity using the small molecule inhibitors CK666, SMIFH2, and Blebbistatin, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplements 2</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s5">5</xref>). Although SMIFH2 was recently reported to exhibit off-target effects, most notably myosin-II inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Nishimura et al., 2021</xref>), we observed markedly different behaviors upon SMIFH2 treatment compared to direct myosin-II inhibition using Blebbistatin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s5">Figure 3—figure supplement 5</xref>). Target deformation analysis and force calculations revealed that target constriction was diminished upon inhibition of the Arp2/3 complex and myosin-II activity, while formin inhibition had a relatively modest effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c,d</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplements 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s5">5</xref>). The loss of target constriction coincided with a strong reduction (~40%) in F-actin accumulation at the rim of the cup, as well as a 50% broadening of the typical narrow (~2 μm) F-actin band observed in the DMSO control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3d,e</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplements 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s5">5</xref>). Of note, upon myosin-II inhibition alone, the loss of F-actin at the rim of the cup was complemented by a small, but significant (p = 0.04), increase in F-actin density at the base of the cup (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3d,f</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s5">Figure 3—figure supplement 5</xref>).

Specifically, in the Blebbistatin-treated cells, we found an &gt;6-fold enrichment of cups that were beyond 90% engulfment, but not yet closed (p = 1.9 × 10<sup>–4</sup>). This high prevalence of late-stage phagocytic cups suggests a specific role for myosin-II in cup closure. Throughout phagocytosis, general particle deformations, as measured by the decrease in target sphericity, were strongly reduced upon both CK666 and Blebbistatin treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3i</xref>). Inhibition of formins generally reduced target deformations, but also increased the cell-to-cell variability in particle deformation, suggesting that formins may play a role in fine-tuning phagocytic force production (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s5">Figure 3—figure supplement 5</xref>). Whereas overall target deformations were reduced in all stages of phagocytosis upon Arp2/3 inhibition, myosin-II inhibition only significantly affected phagocytic force generation at later stages, after 50% engulfment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3i</xref>). A similar effect was observed when quantifying target constriction and target elongation specifically (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3j</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). This analysis strongly suggests that there is a specific role for myosin-II in late-stage phagocytosis despite previous data that shows myosin-II is dispensable for phagocytosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3g</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Jaumouillé et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Olazabal et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Rotty et al., 2017</xref>).

According to these criteria, teeth were found in almost all phagocytic cups, with ~10 distinct teeth per cup (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4d</xref>). Typically ~1 μm in diameter, and protruding ~200 nm into the 1.4 kPa DAAMP targets, they resembled podosomes in size and protrusive nature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Labernadie et al., 2014</xref>). Cells treated with the Arp2/3 inhibitor CK666, and to a lesser extent cells treated with the formin inhibitor SMIFH2, exhibited a reduction in the number of actin teeth per cup (80% and 40% reduction, respectively) compared to control cells treated with DMSO (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4d</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s5">Figure 3—figure supplement 5</xref>). This result suggests that, like podosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">van den Dries et al., 2019b</xref>), target-deforming phagocytic teeth include both Arp2/3- and formin-nucleated actin filaments. Surprisingly, a strong decrease (~50%) in the number of actin teeth was also observed upon myosin-II inhibition. For all treatments, the reduced number of individual teeth that still formed were remarkably similar to those formed by control cells. Although tooth size and depth were reduced upon CK666 or Blebbistatin treatment, the effect size was small (&lt;15%), suggesting that ‘teeth’ are resilient structures that, once formed, have well-defined properties (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4d</xref>).</p><p>LLSM allowed us to track the dynamics of actin teeth during phagocytosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4e</xref>), which revealed clear forward movement over the target surface. A few teeth that we initially detected near the rim stayed in place, remaining where they had assembled during early-stage phagocytosis, suggesting that teeth located deeper within the phagocytic cup (as observed in the fixed cell images) may have originated earlier from the cup rim and been left behind as the cup progressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). More commonly, however, teeth moved forward with a speed of ~5.6 μm/min, similar to the previously reported values for podosome-like structures on very stiff substrates during frustrated phagocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Ostrowski et al., 2019</xref>). Strikingly, teeth within the same phagocytic cup appeared to move in a coordinated fashion, with similar speed and direction, and even with observed collective speed changes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4e</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). This suggests that phagocytic teeth, like podosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Meddens et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Proag et al., 2015</xref>), are mechanically interlinked at the mesoscale.</p><p>To test whether the actin teeth were mechanosensitive, we challenged RAW macrophages to ingest 9 μm DAAMPs of 1.4 or 6.5 kPa and fixed and stained cells to examine actin teeth formation. Of note, drug treatments had similar effects on uptake of the stiffer particles as the softer particles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). Because deformations induced on the stiffer targets were smaller, our systematic identification of teeth based on protrusive activity and actin intensity could not be utilized to faithfully compare tooth number or depth between targets of varying stiffness (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). However, by assessing actin distribution, RAW macrophages assembled actin teeth more frequently when fed softer targets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4i</xref>). This is consistent with our findings that there is less overall F-actin accumulation in the cup rim on stiffer targets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>) and suggests that phagocytic teeth may play a role in the overall mechanosensitivity of phagocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Beningo and Wang, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Jaumouillé et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Sosale et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Vorselen et al., 2020b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Vorselen et al., 2020a</xref>).</p><p>Given the ring-like organization of phagocytic teeth in the cup rim, combined with their individual protrusive activity, we questioned whether they were sufficient to explain our observations of target constriction orthogonal to the phagocytic axis, or if a separate contractile mechanism is required. We first distinguished the teeth positioned at the rim of the cup (~70% of teeth), which likely contribute to target constriction, from those deeper in the cup, based on their distance from the cup rim (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4f</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). We then determined whether the properties of teeth near the rim correlated with the overall target constriction. Indeed, the number of teeth per cup and tooth size correlated with overall constriction in DMSO-treated cells and between groups treated with actomyosin activity inhibitors CK666, SMIFH2, and Blebbistatin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4g</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). We further examined whether changes in the teeth could be related to increasing target constriction with phagocytic cup progression. Teeth numbers increased only slightly with phagocytic progression, which suggests that they are formed quickly early on in phagocytosis and are then typically maintained at constant numbers throughout engulfment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4h</xref>). Teeth size and depth increased significantly but modestly during phagocytic progression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4h</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). Elasticity theory simulations of teeth-like indentations of a spherical target allowed us to test whether teeth protrusive activity is sufficient to explain the extent of overall target constriction in different stages of phagocytosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>). Remarkably, this revealed that teeth activity is indeed sufficient to account for total target constriction in early-stage phagocytosis (&lt;50% engulfment), but insufficient to explain the greater degree of target constriction later in the process (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4j</xref>). This is consistent with additional myosin-II-based contractile forces in late-stage phagocytosis, as suggested by our observations using Blebbistatin.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Regulators of branched actin assembly (Arp2/3 and WASP) and myosin-I isoforms localize to actin teeth while myosin-II forms contractile rings within the phagocytic cup</title><p>Due to the resemblance of the phagocytic actin teeth to podosomes in size, protrusive activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4d</xref>), and dynamics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4e</xref>), we naturally questioned whether these structures were similar in protein composition as well. Given technical challenges with immunohistochemical staining and MP-TFM (see Materials and methods), we transfected the RAW macrophages with fluorescently tagged proteins to assess localization relative to the actin teeth using 3D reconstructions of the DAAMPs. Consistent with our earlier results showing a decrease in the number of teeth after treating cells with the Arp2/3 inhibitor, we found that the Arp2/3 complex and its activator, WASP, colocalized with the actin teeth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a and b</xref>). Moreover, cortactin and cofilin, actin-binding proteins that are frequently found in association with densely branched actin networks, also localized to the phagocytic teeth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). In contrast, myosin-II often appeared distinctly behind the actin teeth in an anti-correlated fashion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5b</xref>).

Altogether, these studies support a model whereby actin teeth are composed of branched actin filaments guided by myosin-I motor proteins. The localization of myosin-II and paxillin/vinculin behind the teeth suggests that these proteins may play a role in the potential interconnection of the teeth, similar to podosomes on 2D surfaces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Meddens et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">van den Dries et al., 2019b</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>Contractile activity may enable resolution of phagocytic conflicts via partial target eating (‘nibbling’) or forfeit of uptake (‘popping’)</title><p>While we have found that target constriction is a signature mechanical feature of FcR-mediated phagocytic progression, it is unclear what functional role target constriction might play during phagocytosis, since actin-driven membrane advancement along the target surface should in principle be sufficient for internalization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Herant et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Tollis et al., 2010</xref>). In addition to the many successful internalization events we observed using LLSM, we also observed some strikingly different target encounters in which RAW macrophages assembled large amounts of F-actin, only to squeeze futilely at the base of the target without completing engulfment. In these cases, the contractile activity resulted in dramatic deformations and even dumbbell-like appearance of the target (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6a and b</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video5">Video 5</xref>). In addition to this kind of internalization failure by single cells, we also observed incidents where two macrophages engaged one DAAMP target. Similar to previous observations of red blood cells being squeezed into multilobed shapes when attacked by two macrophages simultaneously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Swanson et al., 1999</xref>), these conflicts were also observed using primary BMDMs challenged with DAAMPs (<xref ref-type="video" rid="video6">Video 6</xref>). Although the polymeric targets used in this study prohibit partial target eating because each particle is effectively one single crosslinked macromolecule that cannot easily be severed by cell-exerted forces, this behavior may be reminiscent of trogocytosis, the process which has been observed during immune cell attack of cancer cells whereby phagocytes ingest small bits of their target (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Matlung et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Morrissey et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Velmurugan et al., 2016</xref>). By imaging RAW macrophages transfected with GFP-tagged non-muscle myosin-IIa, we observed highly enriched rings of myosin-II signal at DAAMP deformations during attempts of partial target eating (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6c</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video7">Video 7</xref>). Target encounters involving extreme deformations of the DAAMP also revealed the existence of a ‘popping’ mechanism that could lead to a sudden release of the target (<xref ref-type="video" rid="video8">Video 8</xref>) or, conversely, a sudden completion of engulfment (<xref ref-type="video" rid="video9">Video 9</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>).

The rapid timescale of this process suggests that it is likely purely mechanical, representing an elastic recoil of the DAAMP. Importantly, these encounters were rather common, with the attempted partial eating attempts (~14%) and popping (~24%) making up almost 40% off all recorded events (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6e</xref>).

We have discovered that FcR-mediated phagocytosis occurs through a unique mechanism in which normal forces dominate over shear forces in the cell-target interaction. This is in contrast to the current view that the phagocytic cup is equivalent to the leading edge of a migrating cell, where shear forces typically predominate at the cell-substrate interface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Case and Waterman, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Legant et al., 2013</xref>). In addition, the fast forward movement of actin teeth, which underlie target constriction, concomitant with phagocytic cup progression across the target is in stark contrast to lamellipodial focal adhesion complexes, which are fixed relative to the substratum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Case and Waterman, 2015</xref>). The strong target constriction recently observed in complement-mediated phagocytosis by peritoneal macrophages in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Walbaum et al., 2021</xref>) and in phosphatidylserine-mediated phagocytosis by epithelial cells in zebrafish embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hoijman et al., 2021</xref>) suggests that strong normal forces and target constriction are likely a general feature of phagocytosis.</p><p>We show that these normal forces are primarily generated by protrusive phagocytic actin ‘teeth’ and myosin-II contractility, which make distinct contributions to target constriction. While actin-based puncta have been previously observed during phagocytosis of stiffer polystyrene beads (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Barger et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Ostrowski et al., 2019</xref>), their presence in multiple phagocytic cell types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4c</xref>) and during complement-mediated phagocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Ostrowski et al., 2019</xref>) suggests a common role in internalization. Structures with podosome-like features, albeit resistant to CK666 treatment, have also been reported on closed phagosomes containing IgG or serum-opsonized polystyrene targets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Tertrais et al., 2021</xref>). We find that phagocytic actin teeth are podosome-like in protein composition, consisting of mostly branched F-actin and actin regulatory proteins. A previous study showed that the Arp2/3 complex was not required for FcR-mediated ingestion of smaller phagocytic targets, while the uptake of particles comparable in size to those in our study (~10 μm) was Arp2/3-dependent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Rotty et al., 2017</xref>). This is consistent with our observations that inhibition of the Arp2/3 complex dramatically reduces actin tooth number and size, and ultimately target constriction and uptake efficiency.</p><p>Unexpectedly, myosin-II motor inhibition also reduced tooth number and size, albeit to a lesser extent than Arp2/3 inhibition, and also altered tooth spatial distribution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). Inhibition of myosin-II in studies on podosomes also caused a reduction in podosome stiffness and protrusive activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Labernadie et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Labernadie et al., 2010</xref>). In 2D podosomes, myosin-II filaments interconnect radial actin fibers of individual podosomes to create a coherent network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Labernadie et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Meddens et al., 2016</xref>). The localization of myosin-II behind and in between teeth, as well as the coordinated movement of teeth at the mesoscale, suggests that actin teeth in phagocytosis may be comparably interconnected by actomyosin structures, bearing similarity to the organization of podosome rosettes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Linder, 2007</xref>). We find that individual teeth grow larger and stronger with phagocytic progression, correlating with increasing myosin-II constriction observed in late-stage phagocytosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7a</xref>). These observations may relate to the force feedback mechanism observed in Arp2/3-mediated branched actin networks in vitro showing that mechanical resistance makes self-assembling actin networks stronger (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bieling et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Li et al., 2021</xref>). Thus, increased myosin-II contraction in late-stage phagocytosis may promote stronger actin teeth. This rapid structural reinforcement by myosin-II has not yet been described for actin cores of podosomes on 2D, and may be unique to phagocytosis.</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Model of the molecular players and force balance during phagocytosis.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Graphical model: Arp2/3-mediated actin teeth, guided by myosin-I motors, and organized in a ring drive phagocytic progression and inward target deformation. Teeth are potentially interconnected through myosin-II filaments located behind the actin teeth. (<bold>b</bold>) Ring-like target constriction by protrusive actin teeth and myosin-II activity (red arrows) can be decomposed in forces orthogonal to the phagocytic axis, which are balanced within the ring (yellow arrows) and along the phagocytic axis, which result in a net force exerted by the ring (purple arrows). The local target geometry at the protruding rim of the cup determines the direction of the net force. Before 50% engulfment, this force points outward and is balanced by pulling forces throughout the base of the phagocytic cup (push and lock). Inset, the pulling forces from the cell (dashed arrow) on the target and paired forces from the target on the cell (solid arrow) likely put the receptor-ligand interactions under tension. After 50% engulfment, the net ring force points inward, and is balanced by compressive forces (cyan arrows) throughout the phagocytic cup.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-68627-fig7-v2.tif"/></fig><p>Further potential differences between actin teeth and 2D podosomes should also be noted. Although actin teeth are podosome-like in protein composition, the typical ring-like organization of adhesion proteins surrounding the F-actin core of 2D podosomes is not apparent during phagocytosis. Instead, we, and others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Ostrowski et al., 2019</xref>), observe vinculin, for example, to appear more punctate behind actin teeth during phagocytosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). This could be due to the difficulty in visualizing the supramolecular architecture in the 3D context of phagocytosis involving curved targets, yet this could also point to differences in the molecular arrangement between actin teeth and 2D podosomes. In the future, higher resolution imaging will be necessary to better compare the architecture of actin teeth and podosomes, including the potential presence of a podosome ‘cap’ in actin teeth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Linder and Cervero, 2020</xref>), and may potentially expose changes in mechanosensitive protein localization in response to phagocytic targets of different rigidities. In support of differences between the molecular architecture of actin teeth and podosomes, the nature of force exertion at these structures also likely differs. In 2D podosomes, the protrusive force of the actin ‘core’ is counterbalanced by pulling forces from the surrounding adhesion complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bouissou et al., 2017</xref>). This force exertion profile was, at least partly, inferred from the observation of lower global deformation than expected by the protrusive activity of podosome cores alone. In contrast, we observe higher large-scale deformation than expected by the protrusive activity of teeth alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4j</xref>) and the deformations on the DAAMPs are not indicative of strong local tensile forces by adhesion complexes. Finally, we show that actin teeth are mechanosensitive, forming more frequently when cells are challenged with softer targets, contrary to the reported behavior of podosomes in 2D (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Labernadie et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">van den Dries et al., 2019a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">van den Dries et al., 2019b</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4j</xref>).</p><p>We further show that myosin-II plays an important role in phagocytic cup closure – a stage in phagocytosis that has been notoriously difficult to study experimentally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Marie-Anaïs et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7a</xref>). Generally, myosin-II is not deemed important for cup closure or phagocytic progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Jaumouillé and Waterman, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Swanson et al., 1999</xref>), yet we observe myosin-II enrichment at the rim of phagocytic cups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5c</xref>). Moreover, Blebbistatin treatment specifically affects late-stage contractile force generation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3h</xref>) causing cup closure to become a bottleneck step as evidenced by the accumulation of late-stage phagocytic cups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3g</xref>). Because these forces are exerted normal to the target surface, the contribution of myosin-II activity to phagocytic progression has likely gone unnoticed in previous studies using the most common implementation of TFM on a planar substrate, which only measures forces that are tangential to the surface (shear) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Barger et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Jaumouillé et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kovari et al., 2016</xref>). Seemingly contradictory to its apparent role in force generation at the later stages of cup closure, we do not find that myosin-II inhibition affects uptake efficiency measured as the ratio of fully closed to incompletely closed cups. One potential explanation is that when phagocytosis is stalled beyond 90% engulfment upon myosin-II inhibition, the incomplete closure of the cup may be clearly observed in high-resolution 3D imaging of individual cells, but such late-stage cups may be mistaken for fully internalized particles in the lower resolution 2D microscopy used for evaluating phagocytic efficiency in a large number of cells. Alternatively, a model in which myosin-II has opposing effects on phagocytic progression during early (beneficial) and late-stage (adverse) phagocytosis could also be consistent with our observations. It is also possible that while myosin II-mediated constriction is important for the architecture or normal progression of the phagocytic cup or for cup closure in more challenging environmental contexts, cup closure can still proceed in the absence of functional myosin-II through alternative pathways such as actin polymerization-driven extension of the cup rim. Similarly, in <italic>Dictyostelium</italic> cytokinesis, myosin-II is required for cortical tension generation in the cleavage furrow but cytokinesis can still be successfully completed on adhesive surfaces via alternative mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Zang et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Zhang and Robinson, 2005</xref>). Ultimately, our findings underscore the complexity of the myosin-II contributions to phagocytosis and highlight the power of new biophysical tools to identify its precise functioning.</p><p>We show that FcR-mediated phagocytosis is hallmarked by a unique force balance, where before 50% engulfment, target constriction results in an outward force balanced by pulling forces throughout the base of the phagocytic cup (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7b</xref>). Given the reduced presence of cytoskeletal components at the base of the cup (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Freeman and Grinstein, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Jaumouillé and Waterman, 2020</xref>), these pulling forces are most likely not due to actin polymerization forces or actomyosin contractility, but instead a result of the target being held in place through receptor-ligand bonds throughout the base of the cup. Hence, the forces acting on receptor-ligand bonds within the cup are likely dependent on the target physical properties and the local geometry at the rim of the cup (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7b</xref>). Since the lifetime of such bonds is tension-dependent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Nishi et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Zhu et al., 2019</xref>), this push-and-lock mechanism may enable sensing of physical target properties through a proofreading mechanism and thereby aid macrophages in target selection. Indeed, we observe that forfeit of uptake via popping, in which the outward-directed forces likely overcome the strength of the receptor-ligand interactions, depends on the local target geometry and target rigidity. In addition, for non-spherical targets (e.g. ellipsoidal), this force balance would result in a net torque aligning the target’s long axis along the phagocytic axis, which has been observed previously and is reported to lead to enhanced uptake efficiency of ellipsoidal targets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Champion and Mitragotri, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Schuerle et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Sosale et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>We observed that actin teeth formed more frequently when cells were challenged with softer targets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4i</xref>), yet we also associated softer targets with more instances of failed internalization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6f</xref>). This calls into question the effectiveness of actin teeth, and, more generally, target constriction, in driving phagocytic internalization. Aside from a role in cup closure, target constriction could be important for creating a tight apposition between the cell and target, which is essential for receptor engagement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bakalar et al., 2018</xref>). Surprisingly though, we noticed that overly strong target constriction leads to failure of attempted phagocytosis, expressed either as partial eating or a popping mechanism leading in forfeit of uptake. Although these mechanisms may lead to reduced uptake efficiency in isolated phagocyte-target interaction, we suspect they may be critical in more complex phagocytic encounters that occur in vivo, for example, when multiple macrophages approach a single target (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6g</xref>), or attempt to engulf adherent and hard-to-reach targets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Colucci-Guyon et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Davidson and Wood, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Vorselen et al., 2020a</xref>). Altogether, our findings show that actin polymerization-dependent protrusive forces and myosin-II-dependent contractile forces contribute to target deformation and phagocytic internalization, and likely both participate in the mechanosensation required for phagocytic plasticity.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Code availability</title><p>The MATLAB code for analysing confocal images and deriving particle shape is publicly available on <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://gitlab.com/dvorselen/DAAMparticle_Shape_Analysis">https://gitlab.com/dvorselen/DAAMparticle_Shape_Analysis</ext-link>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Vorselen, 2021</xref>.

Mass fraction of acrylic acid was 10% and crosslinker mass fraction was 0.65% or 2.3%, for 1.4 and 6.5 kPa particles, respectively. Prior to extrusion, the gel mixture was degassed for 15 min and then kept under nitrogen atmosphere until the extrusion process was complete. Tubular hydrophobic Shirasu porous glass (SPG) were sonicated under vacuum in <italic>n</italic>-heptane, mounted on an internal pressure micro kit extruder (SPG Technology Co) and immersed into the oil phase (~125 mL) consisting of hexanes (99%) and 3% (v/v) Span 80 (Fluka, 85548 or Sigma-Aldrich, S6760); 10 mL of gel mixture was extruded through SPG membranes under nitrogen pressure of ∼7 kPa, 15 kPa, for membranes with pore size 1.9 and 1.4 μm, respectively; 9 μm, 1.4 kPa particles were synthesized using 1.4 μm pore size membranes, whereas 9 μm, 6.5 kPa particles and 11 μm, 1.4 kPa particles were made using 1.9 μm pore size membranes. The oil phase was continuously stirred at 300 rpm and kept under nitrogen atmosphere. After completion of extrusion, the emulsion temperature was increased to 60°C and polymerization was induced by addition of ~225 mg 2,2’-azobisisobutyronitrile (1.5 mg/mL final concentration). The polymerization reaction was continued for 3 hr at 60°C and then at 40°C overnight. Polymerized particles were subsequently washed (5× in hexanes, 1× in ethanol), dried under nitrogen flow for ∼30 min, and resuspended in PBS (137 mM NaCl, 2.7 mM KCl, 8.0 mM Na<sub>2</sub>HPO<sub>4</sub>, 1.47 mM KH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, pH 7.4) and stored at 4°C.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Microparticle functionalization</title><p>DAAM-particles were functionalized as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Vorselen et al., 2020b</xref>).

Cells were incubated at 37°C to initiate phagocytosis for a period of 3–5 min. Media was then removed and cells were fixed with 4% PFA/PBS for 15 min. Any unbound DAAMPs were then washed away with 3× washes of PBS and samples were stained with goat anti-rabbit-Alexa Fluor-405 antibodies (Invitrogen, A31556, 1:400) for 30 min to visualize exposed DAAM area. Cells were then washed with PBS (3× for 5 min each) and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100/PBS for 3 min, then stained with Alexa Fluor-568 or -488 conjugated phalloidin (1:300). Coverslips were then mounted using VECTASHIELD Antifade Mounting Medium (Vector Laboratories, H-1000) and sealed with nail polish. For both live and fixed cell assays, cells were randomly selected for imaging, and all cells were considered, including those having already internalized a particle and those interacting with multiple particles. For drug treatments, cells were exposed to the indicated drug concentration for 30 min prior to the assay and DAAM particles were resuspended and exposed to cells in the same drugged media. For phagocytic efficiency assays, cells were incubated 15, 30, or 60 min before fixation. Similar staining of the exposed DAAM area (using Alexa Fluor-488-AffiniPure Fab Fragment Goat Anti-Rabbit IgG [Jackson Immunoresearch, 111-547-003, 1:1000]) was performed to differentiate fully internalized from adherent and partly internalized particles.

Briefly, images were thresholded to estimate the volume and centroid of individual microparticles. Cubic interpolation was then used to calculate the intensity values along lines originating from the particle centroid and crossing the particle edge. Edge coordinates were then directly localized with super-resolution accuracy by fitting a Gaussian to the discrete derivative of these line profiles. This is significantly faster than using pre-processing of the image stacks with the 3D Sobel operator as used previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Vorselen et al., 2020b</xref>). Particle properties, such as sphericity, relative elongation and surface curvature, as well as traction forces, are all sensitive to high-frequency noise, so before further calculations edge coordinates were smoothed. To this end, great circle distances (<italic>d</italic>) between edge coordinates with indices <italic>i</italic> and <italic>j</italic> were first calculated along a perfect sphere: <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf2"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>d</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mi>c</mml:mi><mml:mi>c</mml:mi><mml:mi>o</mml:mi><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:msub><mml:mi>θ</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:msub><mml:mi>θ</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>j</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mi>c</mml:mi><mml:mi>o</mml:mi><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:msub><mml:mi>θ</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mi>c</mml:mi><mml:mi>o</mml:mi><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:msub><mml:mi>θ</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>j</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mi>c</mml:mi><mml:mi>o</mml:mi><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>φ</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>φ</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>j</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mrow><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mi>R</mml:mi><mml:mo>,</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula> where <italic>R</italic> is the equivalent radius of a sphere to the particle. Smoothing was then performed by averaging the radial component of the edge coordinates within the given window size (1 μm<sup>2</sup>), which is similar to a 2D moving average, but adapted for a spherical surface. A triangulation between edge coordinates was then generated, and the particle surface area <italic>S</italic> and volume <italic>V</italic> calculated. Sphericity was calculated as Ψ = (6<italic>π</italic><sup>1/3</sup><italic>V</italic><sup>2/3</sup><italic>S</italic><sup>–1</sup>). For surface curvature calculations, first principal curvatures (<italic>k</italic><sub>1</sub> and <italic>k</italic><sub>2</sub>) of the triangulated mesh were determined as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Ben Shabat and Fischer, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Rusinkiewicz, 2004</xref>).

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, including Pekka Lappalainen as Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Suzanne Pfeffer as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Renaud Poincloux (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1. The data obtained by using pharmacological inhibitors (CK666, SMIFH2 and blebbistatin) are not particularly convincing. The authors should at minimum confirm that the compounds efficiently inhibited Arp2/3 and myosin II with the concentrations used here, as well as carry out phagocytosis tests to see the effects of these compounds for engulfment of particles. Ideally, the phagocytosis experiments would be done by using both soft and rigid particles to gain insight into possible different contributions of the 'teeth' and actomyosin ring in phagocytosis of particles of various stiffness. Finally, the SMIFH2 data should be removed (or moved to supplements), because recent studies demonstrated that this inhibitor is not specific for formins.</p><p>2. Because the authors almost exclusively use a single macrophage cell line (RAW cells), some key experiments should be repeated with macrophages derived from blood monocytes.</p><p>3. The authors should better discuss their results relative to published literature.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1. The authors state that the actin-based protrusive 'teeth' are mechanosensitive. However, they apparently only examined the numbers of phagocytic cups with 'teeth' when macrophages were challenged with DAAMPs of 1.4 kPa or 6.5 kPa (Figure 4i). To strengthen this conclusion, a much more thorough comparison of phagocytosis of soft vs. stiff (1.4 kPa vs. 6.5 kPa) microparticles would be informative. The authors should at minimum examine the intensities of F-actin, WASP and Arp2/3 in teeth on soft vs. stiff microparticles, and compare the compressive stresses (assuming that this is feasible also when using 6.5 kPa microparticles).</p><p>2. Many conclusions of the study are based on the use of Arp2/3, myosin II, and formin inhibitors. However, from the data presented, it remains unclear how efficient the inhibitor treatments were (i.e. did the inhibitors completely disrupt Arp2/3 and myosin II localizations in the treated cells). Moreover, the authors should be aware that SMIFH2 also inhibits myosins (Nishimura et al., 2021), and this should be taken into account when interpreting the results obtained by using this inhibitor.</p><p>3. From the data presented in the manuscript, the roles of Arp2/3 and myosin II for Fc receptor -mediated phagocytosis remain somewhat elusive. Thus, it would be informative to study the effects of Arp2/3 and myosin II inhibitions on the kinetics and efficiency of phagocytosis. Now the authors apparently only analyzed the effects of these inhibitors on the distribution of cup stages.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1. The first two figures describing the system and presenting the initial findings are outstanding.</p><p>2. Although the mechanical role of cargo has been studied a bit by earlier work, the carefulness of the preparation of the particles and their characterization is excellent.</p><p>3. I was a little disappointed that they elected to almost exclusively use a single macrophage cell line (RAW cells), when experiments with cells closer to primary macrophages are quite doable and would have been more convincing and relevant to physiological phagocytosis.</p><p>4. If the authors were to investigate the role of myo1e and 1F, I think that would improve the paper and make up for some of the deficiencies of the pharmacological treatments.</p><p>5. The meal sharing and pooping stuff is cute, but kind of phenomenological and disconnected from the rest of the paper.</p><p>As stated above, clean up the pharmacological stuff in Figure 3 and discuss the results relative to published literature in a more complete and nuanced way, I think this is a great paper.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The description of podosome-like structures in phagocytosis should also be discussed in more detail. Podosome-like structures have already been observed at phagocytic cups (Allen and Aderem A, 1996; Labrousse A. et al., 2011; Ostrowski et al., 2019). Recently they have also been observed on closed phagosomes containing IgG-coated beads but not on phagosomes containing naked beads (Tertrais M et al., 2021). Additionally, actin flashes have been described on of mature phagosomes in RAW 264.7 macrophages ingesting IgG-coated particles (Liebl and Griffiths G, 2009). In contrast, Poirier et al., 2020, proposed that actin flashes form at phagosomes only when phagocytosis is mediated by complement receptors but not by Fc receptors (Poirier et al., 2020). The function of Arp2/3 for the formation of actin flashes and podosome like structures has also been started to be documented in these articles. As the difference in phenotype might arise from differences in cell models (primary macrophages vs macrophage cell lines), I would suggest testing whether human macrophages derived from blood monocytes also form force-generating teeth on both phagocytic cups and closed phagosomes and examine whether they are also Arp2/3 dependent.</p><p>The introduction and Discussion sections could also be strengthened by introducing and commenting on the work of Sergio Grinstein (Freeman et al., Cell 2016 and 2018, in addition to Ostrowski et al., Dev Cell 2019, already cited).</p><p>Line 52. &quot;Podosomes are… capable of generating traction forces&quot;. The work from Labernadie et al., Nat. Commun. 2014, Proag et al., ACS Nano 2015 and Bouissou et al., ACS Nano 2017 argue that podosomes are capable of generating both traction and protrusion forces, and not only traction forces.</p><p>Lines 70-71. &quot;TFM only measures forces tangential to the target surface&quot;. There are many studies using TFM that also consider the normal forces applied to the surface.</p><p>Line 99. &quot;1.4 or 6.5 kPa&quot;. Why was this range of stiffness chosen? Is it comparable to the stiffness of more physiological particles (bacteria, apoptotic bodies)?</p><p>Line 103. &quot;Interestingly…&quot; This result is presented as a new result but similar observations were made in Vorselen et al., Nat. Commun. 2020. I suggest the authors to clarify the difference with their previous observations.</p><p>Line 109. &quot;…400 nm maximum target constriction&quot;. This is a large constriction, given the size of the particle. How was this value evaluated? And for such a deformation, is the method of evaluating the normal and shear stresses from the deformation of the particle still applicable? What is the constriction limit above which it is no longer applicable?</p><p>Lines 111-112. &quot;0.5 kPa&quot; and &quot;1.5kPa&quot;. I suggest mentioning that these are values of shear stresses, to avoid confusion with the Young's moduli of the particles.</p><p>Lines 129. &quot;The deformation patterns… were similar to those observed in living cells&quot;. I am surprised that chemical fixation and the difference in imaging do not alter the assessment of the forces. I suggest to specify how the resolution (LLSM vs confocal) impacts the force evaluation (near the equatorial plane and at the upper apex), and present side by side the distribution of the deformations observed in live and fixed samples.</p><p>Lines 136 and 138. &quot;Compressive forces&quot; and &quot;shear forces&quot;. The deduction of forces from the particle deformation involves a model and assumptions. In this case, it is not known precisely where the forces are applied, on which surface, in which direction… I therefore suggest the authors to detail and justify the assumptions that have been chosen for this assessment.</p><p>Lines 222-225. Are the forces of similar amplitude in these different cells?</p><p>Lines 231-236. The partial reduction of formation of &quot;teeth&quot; with CK666, SMIFH2 and Blebbistatin contrasts with the literature describing a complete inhibition of podosomes with CK666 and very slight effects on podosome formation by SMIFH2 and Blebbistatin. I suggest the author to discuss this interesting discrepancy. Still concerning these treatments, did the authors verify their effect on podosomes? And has their effect on the rate of phagocytosis quantified?</p><p>Lines 272-275. &quot;Elasticity theory simulations…&quot; Bouissou et al., argued that there is a local balance of forces at the podosome level (central protrusion and peripheral traction), and not only a protrusion force. Given the similarities of teeth to podosomes, it would be interesting to also consider a similar model of force application.</p><p>Lines 299-300. Formins are reputed difficult to localize. Were the authors able to observe expected localizations for these formins, e.g. at filopodia? This lack of localization may be inconsistent with the effect of SMIFH2. Could the authors comment?</p><p>Lines 302-304. The localizations of paxillin and vinculin are difficult to interpret and seem different from the vinculin localization observed by Ostrowsky et al., One difference may be the model (mouse macrophages vs human macrophages). Could the authors comment on this and/or try to localize these proteins in the phagocytic cup of human macrophages?</p><p>Lines 531-547. Were all cells considered or only those with a single phagocytosed particle?</p><p>Line 580. Please specify how much smoothing is done.</p><p>Lines 584-585. Why are the coordinates smoothed again? Is it for aesthetic reasons? And what is the impact on the evaluation of forces? Could the authors explain?</p><p>Figure 4. The authors claim that actin based teeth are interconnected, but it seems to me that this is not yet proven.</p><p>Figure 7. Given the similarities with podosomes, could local traction forces also be considered in this model?</p><p>Supp. Figure 1j. Could the authors determine an objective criterion to qualify an image quality appropriate or insufficient?</p><p>Supp.Figure 2-5. Would it be possible to average the three types of maps (deformation/actin/normalized stain), after classification, to perhaps allow easy and visual comparison of the effects of the treatments?</p><p>Supp. Figure 7-8 &quot;physical properties&quot; is imprecise. What do you mean exactly? F-actin intensity? Size? Please clarify.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.68627.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1.

We observe almost complete disruption of target deformation upon Arp2/3 treatment, and complete disruption of target constriction upon blebbistatin treatment (Figure 3 b-d,h,i). Moreover, we see additional effects of these drug treatments on actin localization (Figure 3 d-f, Figure 4 d).

There, we directly compared actin intensity and constriction magnitude, and discuss the forces involved in phagocytosis of soft vs. stiff beads (1.4 kPa vs. 6.5 kPa) beads.

Because the authors almost exclusively use a single macrophage cell line (RAW cells), some key experiments should be repeated with macrophages derived from blood monocytes.</p></disp-quote><p>We have performed additional experiments and analyzed additional data to include more details on uptake by primary bone marrow derived macrophages (BMDMs). We have chosen BMDM over human blood monocytes because we do not have the appropriate protocols to conduct experiments on human-derived macrophages, and we have previous experience working with primary murine macrophages derived from bone marrow.</p><p>Compared to RAW macrophages, transfecting and imaging the primary cells was non-trivial. Moreover, we observed that force exertion by primary BMDMs is lower than force exertion by RAW macrophages, as evidenced by significantly smaller target deformations. To observe meaningful deformations and derive cellular forces, we had to challenge BMDMs with targets of lower rigidity (0.3 kPa), which are taken up less efficiently (as we and others have reported, phagocytosis is a mechanosensitive process that is less efficient for lower rigidity targets). Nevertheless, we now show that uptake mediated by primary BMDMs largely follows the same mechanical progression, and that they also form teeth on such softer targets (Figure 1 – supplement 3).</p><p>In addition to these quantitative differences between RAW and primary macrophages, we also observe some qualitative differences that will require substantial additional work to elucidate (for example BMDMs appear to exert compressive forces at the base of the phagocytic cup, and target constriction doesn’t always appear right at the rim of the cup but can lag significantly behind the cup rim). We now have included a supplementary figure panel to show the typical progression of primary-macrophage mediated phagocytosis (Figure 1 – supplement 3), and briefly mention the similarities and differences in the main text:</p><p>“To determine whether this behavior was also present in primary macrophages, we also imaged bone marrow-derived macrophages transfected with mEmerald-Lifeact and observed a similar mechanical progression, albeit with smaller deformations (Figure 1 – supplement 3).”</p><p>We believe a more in-depth analysis of primary cells would be best presented in a subsequent manuscript given the already substantial amount of data and new analysis in the current submission.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3.

All changes compared to the original version have been emphasized in blue in the related manuscript file submitted along with the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>1.

We have now performed additional experiments to more thoroughly compare phagocytosis of targets varying in rigidity. We have included new figure panels that directly compare actin intensity and constriction magnitude, and discuss the forces involved in phagocytosis of soft vs. stiff beads (1.4 kPa vs. 6.5 kPa) beads. We have now fully devoted Figure 1 – supplement 2 to a more detailed analysis of uptake of stiffer targets, and refer to our findings and this figure in various places in the text. Overall, stiff (6.5 kPa) target uptake shows a qualitatively very similar signature as soft target (1.4 kPa) uptake. The target deformations are (expectedly) smaller for stiffer targets, but we also, interestingly, find less actin accumulation on stiffer targets.</p><p>We have also attempted a more systematic analysis of teeth on targets of varying rigidity. This, however, turns out to be a challenging task. We currently automatically detect teeth based on local protrusive activity (as measured by target curvature) and actin intensity (Figure 4 – supplement 1a). However, picking a comparable threshold for identification of teeth on particles of varying rigidities is non-trivial. A key difficulty here is that the stiffer targets deform much less (as now quantified in Figure 1 – supplement 2). This raises the possibility that teeth induce deformations that are below our detection limit, which would not only bias our estimate of tooth numbers, but also the indentation and force generation by the remaining detected teeth. We tested various thresholding strategies for detecting teeth on stiff targets, but this led to different overall conclusions about teeth numbers and protrusive activity. These difficulties in systematic identification and analysis of teeth also make it extremely hard for us to compare WASP and Arp2/3 intensity at teeth as requested by the reviewer. The significant cup-to-cup variation, and difference in transfection efficiency and hence stain intensity between cells, makes such measurements critically dependent on a systematic comparison between a larger number of cups and teeth. We believe that these are hurdles that we may be able to overcome but will require significant further work and therefore in our opinion best reserved for a future study. We have rewritten our paragraph on teeth mechanosensitivity to clarify this point (see pg. 10, line 299).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. Many conclusions of the study are based on the use of Arp2/3, myosin II, and formin inhibitors.

Both CK666 and Blebbistatin inhibit the <italic>activity</italic> of the Arp2/3 complex and myosin II respectively; this mode of action is not expected to ”completely disrupt” target protein <italic>localization</italic>. It is therefore more common to use inhibition of formation of certain structures or force exertion as an indicator of treatment efficacy. For example, the paper in which CK-666 was initially introduced (Nolen et al., 2009) used inhibition of actin structures (podosomes specifically) as a readout.</p><p>In our study, we see extremely clear effects on force production after use of CK666 and blebbistatin treatment, which gives a very quantitative readout of the efficacy of these treatments. We observe almost complete disruption of all target deformations upon Arp2/3 treatment, and complete disruption of target constriction upon blebbistatin treatment (Figure 3 b-d,h,i). Moreover, we see additional effects of these drug treatments on actin localization (Figure 3 d-f, Figure 4 d).

Thus, it would be informative to study the effects of Arp2/3 and myosin II inhibitions on the kinetics and efficiency of phagocytosis. Now the authors apparently only analyzed the effects of these inhibitors on the distribution of cup stages.</p></disp-quote><p>We would like to point out that in addition to the effect of CK666 and Blebbistatin on the distribution of cup stages, in our initial submission we also studied the effect of these inhibitors on (1) actin localization and spatial organization in the phagocytic cup (Figure 3d-f, 4d, Figure 3 – supplement 1b, Figure 4 – supplement 1e), (2) global deformations of phagocytic targets (Figure 4d,i,j Figure 3 – supplement 1b,e), (3) cellular forces generated during phagocytosis (Figure 3a,b), and (4) how all these depend on precise stage of phagocytic progression (Figure 3i,j, Figure 3 – supplement 1c,e, Figure 4 – supplement 1g).</p><p>For this revised submission, we have now also included data on the efficiency of phagocytic uptake using the DAAM particles under drug treatments at various timepoints. This data is presented in a new figure panel (3g), Figure 3 – supplement 1d (kinetics), and 2f (stiff particles). We see a very strong inhibition of phagocytic uptake after 15 minutes by the Arp2/3 inhibitor, and no pronounced effect after myosin II inhibition. These observations hold true at later timepoints, and are also very similar when using stiffer 6.5 kPa targets. We now also discuss these results in light of the previous literature in our Discussion section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>1.

I was a little disappointed that they elected to almost exclusively use a single macrophage cell line (RAW cells), when experiments with cells closer to primary macrophages are quite doable and would have been more convincing and relevant to physiological phagocytosis.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate this criticism and have now included more information on the phagocytic behavior of murine primary bone-marrow derived macrophages (BMDM) (see new Figure 1 – supplement 3). Compared to RAW macrophages, transfecting and imaging the primary cells was non-trivial. Moreover, as evidenced by significantly smaller target deformations, force exertion by primary BMDMs is lower than force exertion by RAW cells. This results in an additional complication, which is that to observe meaningful deformations and derive cellular forces, we had to use targets of lower rigidity (0.3 kPa), which are taken up less efficiently (since as we and others have reported, phagocytosis is a mechanosensitive process that is less efficient for softer targets). Nevertheless, we now show that uptake by primary BMDMs follows a qualitatively similar mechanical progression, including formation of protrusive actin-rich teeth and overall target constriction.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. If the authors were to investigate the role of myo1e and 1F, I think that would improve the paper and make up for some of the deficiencies of the pharmacological treatments.</p></disp-quote><p>Although we agree with the Reviewer that this would be very interesting, we believe that the manuscript, as is, provides sufficient new insights into the biophysics of phagocytosis, as well as the roles of specific actin structures and regulators on phagocytic progression. We worry that adding results on myosin 1e/f would be too ambitious, and feel like this would be more appropriate for a follow-up study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. The meal sharing and pooping stuff is cute, but kind of phenomenological and disconnected from the rest of the paper.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that these observations are necessarily less quantitative than most of the analysis in this paper. Since these observations aren’t particularly rare (up to 30% of soft particle uptake), we believe there is value in reporting this behavior. Moreover, the relation between phagocytic force exertion and uptake efficiency is currently poorly understood, and as the reviewer pointed out, the forces generated during phagocytosis by Arp2/3-branched actin polymerization and myosin-II motor proteins could be more important depending on the context in which phagocytosis is taking place. These observations of popping and meal-sharing are an indication of how force exertion may differently affect isolated cell-target interactions than more complex cell-target encounters.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>As stated above, clean up the pharmacological stuff in Figure 3 and discuss the results relative to published literature in a more complete and nuanced way, I think this is a great paper.</p><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>The description of podosome-like structures in phagocytosis should also be discussed in more detail. Podosome-like structures have already been observed at phagocytic cups (Allen and Aderem A, 1996; Labrousse A. et al., 2011; Ostrowski et al., 2019). Recently they have also been observed on closed phagosomes containing IgG-coated beads but not on phagosomes containing naked beads (Tertrais M et al., 2021). Additionally, actin flashes have been described on of mature phagosomes in RAW 264.7 macrophages ingesting IgG-coated particles (Liebl and Griffiths G, 2009). In contrast, Poirier et al., 2020, proposed that actin flashes form at phagosomes only when phagocytosis is mediated by complement receptors but not by Fc receptors (Poirier et al., 2020). The function of Arp2/3 for the formation of actin flashes and podosome like structures has also been started to be documented in these articles. As the difference in phenotype might arise from differences in cell models (primary macrophages vs macrophage cell lines), I would suggest testing whether human macrophages derived from blood monocytes also form force-generating teeth on both phagocytic cups and closed phagosomes and examine whether they are also Arp2/3 dependent.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the Reviewer for this interesting comment. The frequency or characteristics of actin teeth may well differ among phagocyte cell types, however we would like to point out that we already tested and observed their presence in human neutrophil-like cells and murine primary bone marrow derived macrophages as well as primary dendritic cells during phagocytosis. To address the reviewer’s comments, we have added more data on force generation, evaluated as target deformations, induced by actin teeth in primary murine bone marrow derived macrophages (BMDMs) during live cell lattice light sheet imaging (new figure 1 – supplement 3). Although there are quantitative differences between BMDM and RAW cell force exertion (BMDMs generally induce less target deformation than RAW cells), the qualitative signature, including overall target constriction and observation of distinct actin-rich puncta associated with local protrusive activity, appears very similar. The potential difference between human and murine primary phagocyte behavior is an interesting question, especially given the known differences among these cell types with respect to podosome formation. Because we do not have the approved protocols to conduct experiments with human blood-derived monocytes, potential comparisons will have to be addressed in a future study.</p><p>We now have also expanded our discussion of previous observations of podosome-like structures in phagocytosis, including the work by Tertrais et al., (2021). The idea to look at actin structures on closed phagosomes is very interesting. As the reviewer points out, actin flashes have been observed around phagocytic targets coated with different ligands, including bacteria like <italic>Listeria</italic>. These actin flashes may also be Arp2/3-mediated, and may, as the work by Tetrais et al., reports, contain podosome like structures. In addition, we have previously seen distinct deformations of targets after completion of engulfment (Vorselen et al., 2020). These deformations far exceeded the deformations caused by phagocytic teeth and originated from the site of cup closure. Together, to our knowledge there are still many unknowns around the regulation and dynamics of actin structures on closed phagosomes, and how this depends on target properties and engulfment mechanisms. Albeit very interesting, going into the actin dynamics associated with relocation and maturation of phagosomes and the potential role of teeth or podosome-like structures in that process, would, in our opinion, warrant an entire study by itself.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The introduction and Discussion sections could also be strengthened by introducing and commenting on the work of Sergio Grinstein (Freeman et al., Cell 2016 and 2018, in addition to Ostrowski et al., Dev Cell 2019, already cited).</p></disp-quote><p>We have now rewritten the introduction and Discussion sections to more fully comment on this past literature, including the suggested works.

We added the following to clarify this:</p><p>“RAW macrophages were fed DAAMPs with a diameter of 9 µm and a Young’s modulus of 1.4 or 6.5 kPa, which is in the same range as tissue cells and physiological targets of macrophages like apoptotic cells<sup>34,35</sup>. Raw macrophages typically formed a chalice-shaped phagocytic cup and completed phagocytosis in similar timeframe (~3 minutes) as previously reported for much stiffer (2-3 GPa) polystyrene particles<sup>36</sup> (Figure 1a, Video 1, Figure 1 – supplement 1e).”</p><p>In addition, there are also practical reasons to use relatively soft particles because deformations on much stiffer particles are not well observed and hence forces cannot be inferred.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 103. &quot;Interestingly…&quot; This result is presented as a new result but similar observations were made in Vorselen et al., Nat.

Indeed, a similar observation was made as those described here, but the previous measurements were of a single phagocytic cup on a fixed cell. While we believe that this current description as a common feature of phagocytosis is still novel, we have moved the word “Interestingly” to the more novel discovery of the teeth movement by live-cell imaging. We have also included the following note in this section: “While these deformations were more apparent using the softer 1.4 kPa DAAMPs, the same force pattern was observed using stiffer 6.5 kPa targets (Figure 1 – supplement 2a-b, Video 3) and previously using 0.3 kPa targets using J774 macrophages.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 109. &quot;…400 nm maximum target constriction&quot;. This is a large constriction, given the size of the particle. How was this value evaluated? And for such a deformation, is the method of evaluating the normal and shear stresses from the deformation of the particle still applicable? What is the constriction limit above which it is no longer applicable?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this comment and are aware of the limitations of our methodology, which assumes linear elastic particle behavior, for very large deformations, where this assumption is likely to fail.</p><p>Firstly, we added a clarification to figure 1 – supplement 1c, which contains the data on maximum target constriction, as to how this value was determined:</p><p>“. For each video, the single timepoint in which target constriction was maximal was identified, and the exact constriction value was determined as described in Figure 3 – supplement 1a.”</p><p>A typical rule of thumb is that linear elasticity can be assumed for strains of up to 0.1. In our case, a maximum constriction of 400 nm, would amount to a strain of 0.09: still within this range. In addition, this is the constriction in a single frame with maximal constriction selected from a video, and the vast majority of images captured in fixed cell data (which were exclusively used for force calculations) will hence have considerably lower deformation. The constriction values observed in fixed cell data are presented in Figure 2i, and typically ~200 nm (strains &lt; 0.05), which is well within the limits were particle behavior can be reasonably assumed to be linearly elastic. We added a clarification to our methods section regarding this assumption:</p><p>“Similar to most TFM methods, polyacrylamide gels were assumed to be linearly elastic in the small strain regime (ε ≲ 0.1) in which force measurements were made.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Lines 111-112. &quot;0.5 kPa&quot; and &quot;1.5kPa&quot;. I suggest mentioning that these are values of shear stresses, to avoid confusion with the Young's moduli of the particles.</p></disp-quote><p>The stresses mentioned on line 111 and 112 (now line 142 and 143) are not shear stresses but bulk compressive stresses. Our methodology allows tracking the overall change of particle volume and combined with measuring the bulk modulus of the particles (which was done previously, Vorselen et al., 2020) allows determining bulk compressive stresses. To clarify this point, we changed the wording of this sentence: “In addition, we observed bulk compressive stresses during phagocytic cup progression (~ 0.5 kPa) and after complete internalization of the DAAMPs (up to 1.5 kPa), leading to a dramatic reduction in DAAMP diameter (Figure 1 – supplement 1e-f).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Lines 129. &quot;The deformation patterns… were similar to those observed in living cells&quot;. I am surprised that chemical fixation and the difference in imaging do not alter the assessment of the forces. I suggest to specify how the resolution (LLSM vs confocal) impacts the force evaluation (near the equatorial plane and at the upper apex), and present side by side the distribution of the deformations observed in live and fixed samples.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this comment. We would like to note that the difference in particle reconstruction, and later force evaluation, is not only dependent on resolution, and instead relies on many factors, including signal-to-noise ratio (as detailed in Vorselen et al., 2020) and potential imaging artifacts, as observed in the majority of the lattice light sheet data presented here. Specifically imaging artifacts, which can result in large apparent target deformations outside the cell-target contact area, can make it impossible to converge to a solution when solving the elasticity theory problem, which is the reason we did not include any force calculations based on the LLSM data.</p><p>As illustrated in figure 2 – supplement 1b, there is also significant particle-to-particle variation, so a comparison between the live cell data and fixed cell data needs to be based on a systematic analysis. This is why we choose, next to qualitative comparison of the deformation patterns, to quantitatively compare target constriction at ~50% engulfment in both live and fixed cells (Figure 1 – supplement 1D). This is a relatively straight-forward deformation to measure quantitatively, and revealed 250 nm average target constriction in the live-cell data and a ~40% lower 180 nm average constriction in the fixed-cell data. We have updated the main text, and the supplemental figure to make this comparison clearer:</p><p>“The deformation patterns, although slightly lower in magnitude for the fixed samples (Figure 1 – supplement 1), were similar to those observed in living cells by the LLSM imaging (Figure 2b, Figure 1 – supplement 1).”</p><p>“d<bold>,</bold> Average target constriction at 50% engulfment. Average is 0.25 ± 0.04 μm (s.e.m., n = 23 cups), which is ~40% higher than observed with fixed cell data at similar stage at 0.18 ± 0.02 μm (s.e.m., n = 19) (main text figure 2i). This indicates partial relaxation of the particle to a more spherical shape during fixation, and suggests that the fixed cell force measurements are a slight underestimate of the real phagocytic forces.”</p><p>We also added in the caption of figure 1 – supplement 1h:</p><p>“Shape reconstruction in MP-TFM is critically dependent on particle edge localization detection, which shows clear irregularities (yellow arrows) because of the striping artifact. Such artifacts result in large apparent particle deformations inside and outside the cell-target contact area, and can make it impossible to converge on a solution when solving the elasticity theory problem to infer tractions from target deformations. Because of this, we only used the confocal image data for force analysis.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Lines 136 and 138. &quot;Compressive forces&quot; and &quot;shear forces&quot;. The deduction of forces from the particle deformation involves a model and assumptions. In this case, it is not known precisely where the forces are applied, on which surface, in which direction… I therefore suggest the authors to detail and justify the assumptions that have been chosen for this assessment.</p></disp-quote><p>To make our methodology and assumptions clearer, we have added a section in the methods (Force analysis) to give more detail on the methodology and assumptions that go into it. We also added a note on previous line 136, now line 164, (“<italic>see methods</italic>”). We do not make any explicit assumptions about the direction and location where the cell applies forces, other than that we restrict them to the cell-target contact area, which is determined from F-actin and exposed particle immunostaining (Figure 2 – supplement 1).</p><p>“Force calculations were performed using the spherical harmonics method within custom Python package ShElastic as described in detail previously<sup>21,66</sup>. Briefly, to derive forces, we solve the inverse problem of inferring the tractions in an iterative process to closely match the observed particle shapes and by limiting cellular force exertion to the cell-target contact area as obtained from fluorescent phalloidin and exposed particle immunostaining. In addition, the elastic energy is included in this minimization algorithm to penalize unphysical solutions where higher forces produce the same shape. Similar to most TFM methods, polyacrylamide gels were assumed to be linearly elastic in the small strain regime (ε ≲ 0.1) in which force measurements were made. Tractions were calculated with spherical harmonic coefficients up to l<sub>max</sub> = 20, and evaluated on a 21 × 41 grid. Chosen values for the weighing parameter a for residual traction outside of the cell-target contact area and b for anti-aliasing were both 1.”</p><p>For a more in-depth discussion of the methodology, we also refer to our previous work (Vorselen et al., 2020), in which the methodology is described in much more detail and its performance evaluated using test cases.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Lines 222-225. Are the forces of similar amplitude in these different cells?</p></disp-quote><p>The force analysis suggested by the reviewer would be very interesting. However, such an analysis would require larger data sets and careful analysis. As observed in the RAW cell data, we see significant cell-to-cell variation, and dependence on other factors, such as cup stage, of force exertion. Moreover, we currently do not know if there are differences in the mechanical progression of phagocytosis depending on the cell type, beyond tooth involvement. Given that such differences are likely to occur, and given that it is very challenging to decouple force exertion by various cytoskeletal structures (teeth and the contractile ring, for example), it is non-trivial to make direct comparisons between force exertion by teeth between these cell lines. We believe that a comparison of force exertion between different cell types requires an in-depth biophysical comparison between phagocytosis by these cell types, and is beyond the scope of the current manuscript, but would be extremely interesting for future studies.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Lines 231-236. The partial reduction of formation of &quot;teeth&quot; with CK666, SMIFH2 and Blebbistatin contrasts with the literature describing a complete inhibition of podosomes with CK666 and very slight effects on podosome formation by SMIFH2 and Blebbistatin. I suggest the author to discuss this interesting discrepancy. Still concerning these treatments, did the authors verify their effect on podosomes? And has their effect on the rate of phagocytosis quantified?</p></disp-quote><p>We have moved all SMIFH2 data to supplemental figures, given the recent report of off-target effects of SMIFH2 treatment, so in our response to this comment we focus on the effect of CK666 and Blebbistatin treatment. Firstly, we note that the reduction of tooth numbers in our experiments is larger for CK666 treatment than Blebbistatin treatment, with the number of teeth is close to 0 for CK666 treatment. Of note, the concentration of CK-666 used in this study inhibits all podosome-like actin structures on the ventral side of RAW macrophages (see earlier Figure).</p><p>Differences in findings between our tooth quantification and previous podosome quantification are likely at least partially based on the method of identification of teeth/podosomes. We use a combined metric based on both protrusive activity and F-actin intensity. This is necessary, because at the location of the teeth (the front of the phagocytic cup) actin itself is already strongly enriched. Given these different ways of identification of actin structures, but also potential other differences between these experiments, we are hesitant to make direct quantitative comparisons between these studies.</p><p>Nevertheless, we now address the effect of Blebbistatin treatment on podosomes and teeth in our Discussion section. Given that we use protrusive activity in tooth identification, we believe our results are consistent with previous reports on podosome activity, which we now note in the manuscript:</p><p>“Unexpectedly, myosin-II motor inhibition also reduces tooth number and size, albeit to a lesser extent than Arp2/3 inhibition, and also alters tooth spatial distribution (Figure 4 – supplement 1). Similarly, inhibition of myosin-II in studies on podosomes cause a reduction in podosome stiffness and protrusive activity<sup>18,58</sup>.”</p><p>In addition, actin teeth and podosomes may have significant differences, which we now also discuss more thoroughly in our Discussion sections paragraph starting at line 441, (page 15). Finally, we have performed additional experiments to investigate the effect of these inhibitors on phagocytic efficiency, and we present this data in new figure panels 3g and Figure 3 – supplement 1d. In these experiments we find that the CK-666 treatment has a much more dramatic effect on the phagocytic uptake than the Blebbistatin or SMIFH2 treatments.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Lines 272-275. &quot;Elasticity theory simulations…&quot; Bouissou et al., argued that there is a local balance of forces at the podosome level (central protrusion and peripheral traction), and not only a protrusion force. Given the similarities of teeth to podosomes, it would be interesting to also consider a similar model of force application.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the Reviewer for bringing up this very interesting point. In the work by Bouissou <italic>et al.</italic>, the argument for the local balance of forces at the podosome level is, at least in part, based on the observation that local bulges around each podosome, instead of a large-scale bulge, is only expected if the protrusive forces are locally balanced around each podosome. We believe that this points to an interesting difference with our observations in phagocytosis. As we show in Figure 4j, we see higher, not less, large-scale deformation than expected by the protrusive activity of teeth alone. This suggests that there may be significant differences in the force balance between podosomes and phagocytic teeth. We now discuss this interesting difference and its implications in the Discussion section (lines 454-459). We also expanded our discussion of the more general similarities and differences between podosomes and phagocytic teeth.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Lines 299-300. Formins are reputed difficult to localize. Were the authors able to observe expected localizations for these formins, e.g. at filopodia? This lack of localization may be inconsistent with the effect of SMIFH2. Could the authors comment?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the Reviewer on this point of inconsistency. We have no reason to believe that the formin constructs we used in this manuscript were unfit for localization studies. To note, mDia1, but not mDia2, has been observed to localize to the phagocytic cups during complement-mediated phagocytosis (Jaumouille et al., 2019). mDia2 and FHOD1 have been shown not to localize to the actin cores of macrophage podosomes. We believe formins such as INF2 or FMNL1, which have been described in macrophage podosomes, are likely to localize to the actin teeth and thus may play a role in actin nucleation. However, to avoid any confusion on this topic, we have removed the mDia2 and FHOD1 localization figures and moved all SMIFH2 data to the SI (Figure 3 – supplement 5).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Lines 302-304. The localizations of paxillin and vinculin are difficult to interpret and seem different from the vinculin localization observed by Ostrowsky et al., One difference may be the model (mouse macrophages vs human macrophages). Could the authors comment on this and/or try to localize these proteins in the phagocytic cup of human macrophages?</p></disp-quote><p>There may be many reasons for differences in localization observed between our experiments and those by Ostrowski <italic>et al.,</italic> including cell type (mouse vs. human), but also target rigidity (1.3 kPa DAAMP vs. &gt; 1 GPa polystyrene bead), as well as antibody choice and imaging modality (confocal vs. STED). Moreover, we note that the majority of the work done in the manuscript by Ostrowski was in frustrated phagocytosis assays, and the ring-like distribution of adhesion proteins around an actin-core typically associated with podosomes was much less clear in their assays with spherical targets, which could be due to either technical differences in imaging, or that the structures that are formed during frustrated phagocytosis assays are not identical to those formed during phagocytosis of a target with more physiological curvature. We believe that the results of their localization experiments on spherical targets are more in line with our results. To address this Reviewer’s concern, we have replaced the confocal image of vinculin recruitment in the SI with one that is hopefully clearer in illustrating this point (Figure 5 – Supplement 1c), and now comment on the comparison of the protein distributions we observe with those reported for podosomes and in phagocytosis previously in the Discussion section (lines 441-452).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Lines 531-547.

For the latter two, this is largely due to the fact that the equivalent of a derivative is used in these calculations, where taking a discrete derivative of noisy data is bound to amplifying the noise. In addition, for computational efficiency traction force calculations are done using spherical harmonic coefficients up to <italic>l</italic><sub>max</sub> = 20 on a 21 x 41 grid. This uses only ~900 points, which is fewer than the ~5000 vertices determined in the original particle shape, and smoothing helps to better reflect the somewhat larger scale deformations of the particle surface.</p><p>Smoothing also helps for accurate calculation of relative elongation. This metric (determined by taking the ratio of the length of the phagocytic axis to the average of the two orthogonal axes), is prone to individual outlying vertices. Sphericity is also highly affected by high frequency contributions as those strongly affect the surface area calculation but have minimal effect on the volume.</p><p>We believe that an in depth discussion of these factors goes beyond the scope of this paper, but we have added a short clarification (see the section above). In addition, we added the clarification that force calculations were done up using spherical harmonic coefficients up to <italic>l</italic><sub>max</sub> = 20 on a 21 x 41 grid.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 4. The authors claim that actin based teeth are interconnected, but it seems to me that this is not yet proven.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the Reviewer that we have not provided definitive evidence to conclude that teeth are interconnected. Therefore, we have now adapted the phrasing in Figure 4, the abstract, and our model to reflect that teeth are “likely interconnected”. However, we believe that our data tracking the teeth, and specifically that teeth within the same phagocytic cup appeared to move in a coordinated fashion, with similar speed and direction, and even with observed collective speed changes, supports a model where the teeth are functionally interconnected.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 7. Given the similarities with podosomes, could local traction forces also be considered in this model?</p></disp-quote><p>As alluded to in our response to the reviewer comment regarding line 272-275, we believe that there currently is not enough evidence to include local tensile forces in this model.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Supp. Figure 1j. Could the authors determine an objective criterion to qualify an image quality appropriate or insufficient?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this suggestion. In this case, because of the image artifacts present in the LLSM data were frequently observed, we were not able to use any of the lattice light sheet videos for force analysis. We therefore believe that our current criterium: to only use the confocal imaging data for force analysis, is a clear and justifiable choice. Coming up with an objective criterion is not trivial in the context of these artifacts that seem to be unique to lattice light sheet microscopy and their origin is not well understood. We changed the wording in the figure panel 1j, and its caption, to clarify this. We also removed the upper row of the figure panels to clarify the figure and message (Figure 1 – supplement 1e).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Supp.Figure 2-5. Would it be possible to average the three types of maps (deformation/actin/normalized stain), after classification, to perhaps allow easy and visual comparison of the effects of the treatments?</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate this suggestion and the value of trying to capture the signature of these complex maps in a simplified manner. Since the particles are only aligned along the phagocytic axis, particles have an arbitrary position with respect to rotation around this axis. Therefore, any features orthogonal to the phagocytic axis will be mostly averaged out when averaging the maps. In addition, since each of these cups is in a different stage of engulfment (ranging from &lt;20% to &gt;90%), averaging the maps directly, without some normalization for the fraction engulfment, is likely not very informative. We believe that visualization of the deformation, curvature and fluorescent intensity profiles along the phagocytic axis (averaged in the directions orthogonal to the phagocytic axis) and then normalized to the fraction engulfed, is the most natural way for easy and visual comparison of the treatments, and this is how we choose to present this data in figure 2f and figure 3d in the main text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Supp. Figure 7-8 &quot;physical properties&quot; is imprecise. What do you mean exactly? F-actin intensity? Size? Please clarify.</p></disp-quote><p>To address the reviewers concern we have changed this wording to “teeth number, size and indentation”.</p></body></sub-article></article>
