expression of metabolic genes in mammals. Here, we characterized its function in the zebrafish and revealed an unexpected role of this pathway in vertebrate embryonic development. We showed that knockdown of <italic>mondoa</italic> impaired the early morphogenetic movement of epiboly in zebrafish embryos and caused microtubule defects. Expression of genes in the terpenoid backbone and sterol biosynthesis pathways upstream of pregnenolone synthesis was coordinately downregulated in these embryos, including the most downregulated gene <italic>nsdhl</italic>. Loss of Nsdhl function likewise impaired epiboly, similar to MondoA loss of function. Both epiboly and microtubule defects were partially restored by pregnenolone treatment. Maternal-zygotic mutants of <italic>mondoa</italic> showed perturbed epiboly with low penetrance and compensatory changes in the expression of terpenoid/sterol/steroid metabolism genes. Collectively, our results show a novel role for MondoA in the regulation of early vertebrate development, connecting glucose, cholesterol and steroid hormone metabolism with early embryonic cell movements.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>In most animals, a protein called MondoA closely monitors the amount of glucose in the body, as this type of sugar is the fuel required for many life processes. Glucose levels also act as a proxy for the availability of other important nutrients. Once MondoA has detected glucose molecules, it turns genetic programmes on and off depending on the needs of the cell. So far, these mechanisms have mainly been studied in adult cells.</p><p>However, recent studies have shown that proteins that monitor nutrient availability, and their associated pathways, can control early development. MondoA had not been studied in this context before, so Weger et al. decided to investigate its role in embryonic development. The experiments used embryos from zebrafish, a small freshwater fish whose early development is easily monitored and manipulated in the laboratory.</p><p>Inhibiting production of the MondoA protein in zebrafish embryos prevented them from maturing any further, stopping their development at an early key stage. This block was caused by defects in microtubules, the tubular molecules that act like a microscopic skeleton to provide structural support for cells and guide transport of cell components.</p><p>In addition, the pathway involved in the production of cholesterol and cholesterol-based hormones was far less active in embryos lacking MondoA. Treating MondoA-deficient embryos with one of these hormones corrected the microtubule defects and let the embryos progress to more advanced stages of development.</p><p>These results reveal that, during development, the glucose sensor MondoA also controls pathways involved in the creation of cholesterol and associated hormones. These new insights into the metabolic regulation of development could help to understand certain human conditions; for example, certain patients with defective cholesterol pathway genes also show developmental perturbations. In addition, the work highlights a biological link between cholesterol production and cellular responses to glucose, which Weger et al. hope could one day help to identify new cholesterol-lowering drugs.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>metabolism</kwd><kwd>cholesterol</kwd><kwd>pregnenolone</kwd><kwd>microtubule</kwd><kwd>epiboly</kwd><kwd>carbohydrate response element</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Zebrafish</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004350</institution-id><institution>Studienstiftung des Deutschen Volkes</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Weger</surname><given-names>Meltem</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Marie Curie Intra-European Fellowship</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PIEF-GA-2013-625827</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Weger</surname><given-names>Meltem</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Excellence cluster &quot;CellNetworks&quot;</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Dickmeis</surname><given-names>Thomas</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Effect-Net research network in water research, Ministerium für Wissenschaft, Forschung und Kunst Baden-Württemberg</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Dickmeis</surname><given-names>Thomas</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100007393</institution-id><institution>Association Française contre les Myopathies</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Dickmeis</surname><given-names>Thomas</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>EU FP7-ZFHEALTH-2007-B2</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Strähle</surname><given-names>Uwe</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Interreg Network for Synthetic Biology in the Upper Rhine Valley</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Strähle</surname><given-names>Uwe</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund8"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001656</institution-id><institution>Helmholtz-Gemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BioInterfaces in Technology and Medicine (BIFTM)</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Strähle</surname><given-names>Uwe</given-names></name><name><surname>Nienhaus</surname><given-names>Gerd Ulrich</given-names></name><name><surname>Mikut</surname><given-names>Ralf</given-names></name><name><surname>Dickmeis</surname><given-names>Thomas</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund9"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001656</institution-id><institution>Helmholtz-Gemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Science and Technology of Nanostructures (STN)</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Nienhaus</surname><given-names>Gerd Ulrich</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The glucose-sensing transcription factor MondoA regulates zebrafish epiboly via cholesterol biosynthesis genes including the human disease gene Nsdhl, revealing an unknown role for metabolic glucose signalling in vertebrate development.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The glucose-sensing Mondo pathway is a key regulator of energy metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abdul-Wahed et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Richards et al., 2017</xref>).

As it is currently unknown if and how MondoA, ChREBP or Mlx contribute to metabolic regulation of embryogenesis, we investigated a potential developmental role of the Mondo pathway in zebrafish, a model for early vertebrate development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Nüsslein-Volhard, 2002</xref>). After fertilization, a cap of cells (the blastoderm) forms on top of the yolk cell, which it subsequently engulfs in a morphogenetic movement called epiboly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bruce, 2016</xref>). Mechanistically, epiboly involves processes both in the enveloping layer (EVL) as well as the deep cell layer (DEL) of the blastoderm and in a teleost specific structure of the yolk cell, the yolk syncytial layer (YSL). By the end of epiboly, germ layers and body axes have been formed. Most developmental pathways as well as many facets of metabolism and its regulation are highly conserved between mammals and zebrafish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gut et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Schier and Talbot, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Solnica-Krezel and Sepich, 2012</xref>). However, studies addressing Mondo pathway function in the zebrafish are still lacking.</p><p>Herein, we uncover a role of the Mondo pathway in vertebrate development. Mondo pathway gene expression and function was characterized in zebrafish embryos and cultured cells. Morpholino oligonucleotide (MO) mediated loss-of-function of MondoA severely impaired epiboly movements. Subsequent transcriptome analysis revealed genes deregulated upon loss of MondoA function and highlighted an enzyme involved in cholesterol biosynthesis, Nsdhl (NAD(P) dependent steroid dehydrogenase-like), as a potential key mediator of MondoA function in epiboly. Functional analysis of Nsdhl suggests that Nsdhl-mediated cholesterol synthesis downstream of MondoA is required for the synthesis of sufficient levels of the steroid hormone pregnenolone, which stabilizes YSL microtubules necessary for epiboly. Maternal-zygotic (MZ) mutant embryos homozygous for a small deletion allele of <italic>mondoa</italic> leading to a premature stop codon showed a severe aberrant epiboly phenotype, albeit with low penetrance that our transcriptome analysis indicates to result from compensatory changes in the expression of cholesterol and steroid biosynthesis genes.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Glucose signaling by the Mondo pathway is conserved in zebrafish</title><p>For each of the Mondo pathway members MondoA, ChREBP and Mlx one single orthologue is present in the zebrafish genome (GRCz11/danRer11).

We observed that the overlap in downregulated genes was weaker between morphants and mutants without aberrant epiboly phenotype (compare lower left quadrant in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2B and C</xref>).

By contrast, MZ<italic>mondoa</italic> mutants with unaffected epiboly showed a coordinated upregulation of terpenoid pathway genes (i.e., they showed a statistically significant enrichment for upregulation in a directional gene set enrichment test; p=0.012; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F–G</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>).

Previously, studies in non-vertebrates have implicated homologs of Mondo pathway factors in later stages of embryonic or larval development: Loss of function of the Mlx orthologue in <italic>Drosophila</italic> is lethal at the late pupal stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Havula et al., 2013</xref>), while knockdown of a distant Mlx homolog in <italic>C. elegans</italic> affected movements of ray one precursor cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Pickett et al., 2007</xref>), which will form a subset of male-specific sense organs in the tail. To the best of our knowledge, ours is the first study demonstrating conserved Mondo signaling mechanisms between zebrafish and mammals and linking its function to early embryonic development of vertebrates.</p><p>Our findings demonstrate that MondoA acts upstream of the synthesis of pregnenolone, an important regulator of yolk cell microtubule stability and epiboly movements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hsu et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Schwend et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Weng et al., 2013</xref>), by regulating the expression of a whole set of genes in the terpenoid/sterol biosynthesis pathway, as exemplified by the cholesterol synthesis enzyme <italic>nsdhl</italic>. It is tempting to speculate that the role of MondoA in cholesterol/steroid metabolism we here uncover in the zebrafish is a feature conserved across vertebrates, albeit not much is known in mammals. One <italic>in vitro</italic> study described ‘sterol biosynthetic process’ as one category of genes upregulated in MondoA deficient HeLa cells under conditions of acidosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Wilde et al., 2019</xref>). For the MondoA paralogue Chrebp, a study <italic>in vivo</italic> reported that ‘cholesterol biosynthesis’ genes are upregulated in the liver of <italic>Chrebp</italic> knockout mice which were fed with a high fructose diet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib112">Zhang et al., 2017</xref>). While these studies were performed under specific disease conditions (i.e., a human cancer cell line under acidosis conditions or animals fed with a high fructose diet), they support our observations that the Mondo pathway plays an important role in the regulation of cholesterol/steroid metabolism also under non-disease conditions. Furthermore, these observations indicate gene expression changes due to compensatory mechanisms upon loss of Mondo pathway function, as observed in our study and discussed in the following section.</p><p>The low penetrance of epiboly phenotypes in MZ<italic>mondoa</italic> mutant zebrafish embryos indicates the presence of efficient compensatory pathways, triggered by the genetic lesion but not by antisense-mediated knockdown, that may be operating in mammals as well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">El-Brolosy and Stainier, 2017</xref>). Nonsense mediated decay products of the mutated transcript are proposed to trigger transcriptional upregulation of homologous genes that compensate for the mutant gene’s function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">El-Brolosy et al., 2019</xref>). However, <italic>chrebp</italic> and <italic>mlx</italic> mRNA levels were not significantly changed compared to wild-type in mutants with unaffected epiboly, implicating the presence of alternative compensatory mechanisms. Interestingly, many terpenoid, sterol and steroid biogenesis genes showed lower than wild-type levels of expression in the morphants and equal or higher levels in the mutants with unaffected epiboly, suggesting that increased steroidogenesis activity rescues epiboly in a majority of MZ mutant embryos. In the remaining mutant embryos, the lack of coordinated upregulation of terpenoid backbone biosynthesis genes is indicative of an incomplete compensation attempt. Apparently, concerted changes across the entire cholesterol/steroid biosynthesis pathway are needed to rescue epiboly progression in the absence of MondoA function. The mere restoration of <italic>nsdhl</italic> expression levels, for example, appears not to be sufficient for such a rescue, perhaps because a few genes in the sterol biosynthesis pathway still show deregulation of expression in MZ mutant embryos of both phenotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Therefore, even though globally there is no coherent up- or downregulation in sterol biosynthesis gene expression of mutants compared to wild-type embryos based on gene set enrichment analysis, pathway function in mutants may still be suboptimal and require the compensatory upregulation in the upstream terpenoid pathway to achieve sufficient synthesis flux. Furthermore, random variation in the amount of material deposited by the mother or in protein expression of key genes may limit compensation in the mutants with affected epiboly. A more detailed understanding of these processes awaits the determination of metabolite fluxes in morphants, mutants and wild-type embryos, specifically in the YSL. Importantly, incomplete penetrance is a frequent phenomenon in human genetic diseases and has been attributed to a wealth of mechanisms, which have been suggested as targets for therapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cooper et al., 2013</xref>). Future studies how disturbed MondoA function is buffered during development might open leads to manipulating dysregulated Mondo pathway function in adult metabolic regulation.</p><p>We observed that <italic>mondoa</italic> knockdown in the YSL was sufficient to cause an epiboly phenotype, pointing towards a crucial role of MondoA in this tissue. Even though the YSL and epiboly movements are specific for teleosts, there are several indications that the mechanisms detected in the zebrafish are relevant in mammals as well. For example, steroidogenic enzymes are expressed in extraembryonic tissues in both fish and mice, the fish YSL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hsu et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hsu et al., 2009</xref>) and the giant trophoblast cells of the murine placenta (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arensburg et al., 1999</xref>). Indeed, it has been proposed that zebrafish epiboly is analogous to the spreading of the trophectoderm during implantation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kane and Adams, 2002</xref>). Consistent with this idea, epiboly movements are severely impaired upon knockdown of the zebrafish homolog of solute carrier family 3 member 2 (<italic>Slc3a2</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Takesono et al., 2012</xref>), a factor crucial for trophoblast cell adhesion, migration and fusion in mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kabir-Salmani et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Kudo et al., 2003</xref>). Thus, it is conceivable that developmental functions of MondoA are conserved among vertebrates. Testing this hypothesis awaits a close examination of early embryonic and placental phenotypes in MondoA mutant mice, the analysis of which has so far been limited to adult phenotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ahn et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Imamura et al., 2014</xref>), and of potential functions of maternal MondoA mRNA or protein in mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Li et al., 2010a</xref>). Given the small litter size of rodents, phenotypes with low penetrance may easily be overlooked and are difficult to study in these animals.</p><p>Importantly, mutations in the <italic>NSDHL</italic> gene in humans have been linked to an X-linked dominant condition called CHILD syndrome (‘congenital hemidysplasia with ichthyosiform erythroderma and limb defects’, reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Herman, 2000</xref>) that is usually lethal in males (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bornholdt et al., 2005</xref>). Murine male embryos carrying <italic>Nsdhl</italic> mutations die shortly after implantation, and those carrying moderate or mild alleles showed reduced placental thickness with a poorly vascularized fetal labyrinth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Caldas et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Liu et al., 1999</xref> and references therein). Interestingly, also in female mouse embryos carrying a maternal null allele placental area was severely reduced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cunningham et al., 2010</xref>). In these embryos, paternal X chromosome inactivation in yolk sac endoderm and trophoblast-derived lineages causes complete loss of function only in these tissues. Given the potential analogous functions of placenta and YSL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Carvalho and Heisenberg, 2010</xref>), our results regarding Nsdhl function in epiboly make it tempting to speculate that Nsdhl contributes to the development of the mammalian placenta by regulating microtubule stability. Remarkably, stability of microtubules apparently plays a role in trophoblast differentiation and implantation based on <italic>in vitro</italic> studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bates and Kidder, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Douglas and King, 1993</xref>).</p><p>In summary, our results identify a novel role for the Mondo pathway in vertebrate development and link glucose sensing to cholesterol/steroid biogenesis.

Images were taken on a Leica TCS SP5 upright microscope using either a HCX PL APO 20x/0.70 lambda blue IMM CORR or a HCX APO L 20x/0.50 W U-V-I objective at 26°C. Spatial and sensitivity resolution were strictly kept constant between samples of comparative analysis. Reflection images using 458/488/496 nm incident light were used to assess whether a nucleus is in the EVL or YSL. The reflected light images require no labeling and provide a confocal contrast at the boundary of different tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Jester et al., 1991</xref>). We used the GFP fluorescence channel to identify the nucleus and the label-free reflection channel to visualize the extracellular matrix. Whether a nucleus belongs to EVL or YSL was individually determined in the XZ or YZ plane using the reflection channel. Images were analyzed and processed in Fiji/ImageJ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Schindelin et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>To visualize endocytotic vesicles, embryos were dechorionated at five hpf and placed in 1.5% (w/v) Lucifer Yellow CH (Sigma-Aldrich, L0259) dissolved in E3 medium for 15 min (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Solnica-Krezel and Driever, 1994</xref>). After the incubation, embryos were washed briefly with excess E3 medium and mounted in 0.5% low-melting temperature agarose for confocal imaging.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Digital scanned laser light sheet microscopy (DSLM)</title><p>Time-lapse DSLM images of developing zebrafish embryos were acquired on a home-built microscope described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Kobitski et al., 2015</xref>. In the DSLM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Keller et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Schmid et al., 2013</xref>), the sample is irradiated with two opposing beams of 488 nm laser light (LuxX 488–60 laser, Omicron-Laserage Laserprodukte GmbH, Rodgau, Germany) that were scanned up and down so as to excite fluorescence in the samples in a slab (‘light sheet’) with an average thickness of 6.6 µm across the field of view (1038 × 875 µm<sup>2</sup>). Fluorescence emission from the illuminated region was collected perpendicular to the light sheet by using a water dipping objective (16x/0.8 w, Nikon) and projected on a 5.5 megapixel sCMOS camera (Neo, Andor, Belfast, UK), yielding 1.5 µm lateral image resolution. Image stacks of 500 frames at 2 µm displacement were collected at a rate of 20 frames per second by moving the sample through the light sheet. To achieve optimal image quality across the entire sample, images from two opposing views were acquired for each light sheet position by rotating the samples by 180°. Consequently, a complete 3D image stack was collected every 60 s.</p><p>For DSLM imaging, dechorionated embryos were embedded in 0.1% (w/v) low melting agarose in 1x E3 medium, mounted in fluorinated ethylene propylene tubes as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kaufmann et al., 2012</xref>), and placed inside a sample chamber. During image acquisition over 15 hr, the temperature in the sample chamber was kept constant at 26°C.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Automated image processing and analysis</title><p>Fluorescently labeled nuclei were automatically extracted from the 3D image stacks using the fast segmentation approach described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Stegmaier et al., 2014</xref>). In a post-processing step, the extracted features from complementary rotation images were registered using a bead-based registration technique (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Preibisch et al., 2010</xref>). Moreover, redundant nuclei were fused on the basis of spatial overlap of segments; a feature based object rejection was performed to minimize the amount of false positive detections. Nucleus counts reflect the number of remaining objects after information fusion and object rejection.</p><p>To track the detected nuclei over multiple time points, we made use of a nearest neighbor tracking algorithm implemented in the open-source MATLAB toolbox SciXMiner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Mikut et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Stegmaier et al., 2012</xref>). To attain more comprehensive tracks, we used an additional heuristic to reconstruct nuclei that were missing in a single frame and we fused extracted sub-tracks in the spatio-temporal domain by applying an additional nearest neighbor matching on the start and end points of sub-tracks. It should be noted, though, that these tracks did not necessarily reflect perfect tracks on the single cell level over the whole duration, but merely are used to identify and trace the qualitative movements of nuclei in certain regions.</p><p>To compute the cell density distribution, we counted the number of nuclei located within a bounding sphere with a radius of 40 µm centered on the nucleus of interest. For visualization, we aligned the virtual embryo by manually centering it on the origin and rotating the vegetal pole such that it was centered on the positive y-axis and finally converting the Cartesian coordinates into a spherical projection using azimuth, elevation and radius (see schematic in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). This representation allows us to unwrap the embryo by plotting the azimuth (range: [-pi, pi]) and the elevation (range: [-pi/2, pi/2]) in a 2D graph.</p><p>For speed determination of ingressing deep cells, we manually selected a minimum number of ten cells for each condition and tracked their movement over a time window of 100 frames, that is, for 200 min. We included only internalizing deep cells which could be tracked over the entire time frame in both conditions. The time point of ingression onset was visually determined using slice-based maximum intensity projection videos. The estimated speed reflects the arithmetic mean of approximately 1000 displacement steps of the selected cells during the time interval.</p><sec id="s4-12-1"><title>Implementation details</title><p>Maximum intensity projections, seed detection and segmentation were performed using a custom-built C++ application based on the Insight Toolkit (ITK). To speed up calculations, we processed multiple image stacks in parallel on a Hadoop cluster containing 25 nodes (each equipped with two quad-core Intel Xeon E5520 CPUs @ 2.27 GHz and 36 GB of memory) of the Large Scale Data Facility (LSDF) of the KIT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Garcia et al., 2011</xref>).

Metabolites were extracted from three pools of 30 zebrafish embryos of each condition with 0.3 ml of 0.1 M HCl in an ultrasonic ice bath for 10 min. The resulting homogenates were centrifuged twice for 10 min at 4°C and 16.400 g to remove cell debris. AMP, ADP and ATP were derivatized with chloroacetaldehyde as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bürstenbinder et al., 2007</xref>) and separated by reversed phase chromatography on an Acquity BEH C18 column (150 mm x 2.1 mm, 1.7 µm, Waters) connected to an Acquity H-class UPLC system. Prior to separation, the column was heated to 42°C and equilibrated with five column volumes of buffer A (5.7 mM TBAS, 30.5 mM KH2PO4 pH 5.8) at a flow rate of 0.45 ml min<sup>−1</sup>. Separation of adenosine derivates was achieved by increasing the concentration of buffer B (2/3 acetonitrile in 1/3 buffer A, by volume) in buffer A as follows: 1 min 1% B, 1.6 min 2% B, 3 min 4.5% B, 3.7 min 11% B, 10 min 50% B, and return to 1% B in 2 min. The separated derivatives were detected by fluorescence (Acquity FLR detector, Waters, excitation: 280 nm, emission: 410 nm, gain: 100) and quantified using ultrapure standards (Sigma). Data were acquired and processed with the Empower3 software suite (Waters). Energy charge values were calculated for each batch of embryos separately according to ([ATP] + 0.5 [ADP])/([ATP] + [ADP] + [AMP]) and were analyzed for differences between conditions by One-Way ANOVA.</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>Next-generation sequencing</title><sec id="s4-14-1"><title>Generation and sequencing of mRNA and total RNA libraries</title><p>RNA-seq analysis was performed on embryos injected with mondoa-mo or mondoa-mis as well as on MZ<italic>mondoa</italic> mutants affected or unaffected in epiboly and wild-type embryos. MO injected embryos were sampled when control embryos were at sphere stage (age-matched), mutant and wild-type embryos when affected mutants could be clearly distinguished (90% epiboly of controls). Triplicate total RNA samples of each condition were used to generate cDNA libraries. The quality and integrity of the sampled total RNA were assessed with a Bioanalyzer 2100 (Agilent). Sample concentrations were measured using a NanoDrop spectrometer (ThermoScientific). Sequencing libraries were prepared from total RNA with a RNA integrity number (RIN) greater than 8.0. Indexed mRNAseq libraries were generated from morphant samples following the TruSeq mRNA kit protocol (Illumina). Libraries for mutant samples were prepared using the TruSeq Stranded Total RNA Sample Prep Kit with Ribo-Zero Gold depletion (Illumina). Libraries of the morphant experiments were sequenced on a HiSeq 1000 system (Illumina) in 3 lanes of a paired-end flow cell. For each end, 50 nucleotides were sequenced. Cluster and sequencing reactions were performed with the TruSeq SBS kit v3-HS and the paired-end cluster v3-cBot-HS kit. The libraries of the MZ<italic>mondoa</italic> mutants were sequenced on Illumina Hiseq 4000 sequencer as Paired-End 50 base reads following Illumina’s instructions.

Briefly, we applied SAMtools view (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Li et al., 2009</xref>) to assign uniquely mapped paired-end reads. For downstream applications such as data visualization, we normalized the count data by size factor and applied a variance stabilizing transformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Huber et al., 2002</xref>).

In the revised version, the reviewers requested that these issues should be addressed. If you cannot address these by more extensive informatics analysis of the existing RNA-seq data, additional experiments may be needed.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>The manuscript by Weger et al. describes a role of glucose-sensing MondoA in cholesterol/pregenenolon biogenesis-dependent control of epiboly movement in zebrafish. The authors demonstrate that antisense morpholino (MO)-mediated knockdown of <italic>mondoa</italic> led to defective epiboly. Furthermore, MO-mediated knockdown of nsdhl, which encodes an enzyme of cholesterol and pregnenolone synthesis and functions downstream of MondoA, also resulted in similar epiboly defects. Pregnenolon was previously reported to be involved in formation of microtubules and microtubule-dependent epiboly. The authors show treatment with pregnenolone rescues defective epiboly in in <italic>mondoa</italic> and <italic>nsdhl</italic> morphants. They conclude that the ModoA-Nsdhl pathway controls epiboly through upregulation of pregnenolon. The manuscript could be the first report showing involvement of the glucose-sensing MondoA system in early vertebrate development. They show a lot of data that support their conclusion. Quality of the data is high. The manuscript is well written.</p><p>My major concern is partial rescue of <italic>mondoa</italic> morphants by wild-type <italic>mondoa</italic> mRNA (Figure 2E and subsection “Loss of <italic>mondoa</italic> function leads to severe epiboly defects”) and of mondoa/<italic>nsdhl</italic> morphants by the treatment with pregnenolone (Figure 5, subsection “Pregnenolone partially rescues epiboly in <italic>mondoa</italic> morphants and normalizes microtubule patterns”). These data raise the question whether effects of MO-mediated knockdown are really specific. However, the authors demonstrate that injection of MO did not induce defective epiboly in <italic>MZmondoa</italic> mutants, although only a small number of <italic>MZmondoa</italic> mutants showed epiboly defects. This experiment satisfies the recent criteria for MO experiments. Analyses of maternal and maternal zygotic mutants are not easy. The authors tried to explain the low penetrance by gene expression profiling. Although the authors did not show data from <italic>nsdhl</italic> mutants, I believe that the authors have shown compelling evidence for their conclusion. I would not ask them to do additional experiments.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>This is an interesting and well-done paper that presents a characterization of the glucose sensing transcription factors, MondoA, Mlx and ChREBP in zebrafish epiboly. This is the first characterization of this transcription family in zebrafish, so it will be of interest to that community of developmental biologists. It is uncertain whether it will have broad appeal to the general audience of <italic>eLife</italic>. The analysis shows that MondoA and Mlx function at the mechanistic level much like their mammalian counterparts as glucose responsive transcription factors. A series of morpholino experiments connect MondoA to epiboly via the regulation of <italic>nsdhl</italic> and ultimately steroid biosynthesis. The authors then develop and partially characterize a genetic mutant of MondoA, which doesn't phenocopy the morphant phenotype in epiboly, or only does so with low penetrance. Their claim that a compensatory mechanism involving upregulation of genes involved in terpenoid biosynthesis. They demonstrate that several of the pathway genes are upregulated in the MZMondoA mutant, validating two, but there is no functional characterization of the putative compensatory mechanism. The discussion is balanced and the authors argue that similar mechanisms could be at play in mammals. It is true that phenotypes of MondoA, and ChREBP have only been characterized in adults (there is paper looking at Mlx in skeletal muscle that should be referenced). Whole body knockouts of ChREBP (published) and MondoA/Mlx(unpublished) don't display developmental defects, so the mechanisms described in the zebrafish system may not extend to mammalian systems.</p><p>It would be interesting to know whether the regulation of <italic>nsdhl</italic> and other cholesterol biosynthetic genes is direct and contain ChoREs. This could be accomplished with a more thorough bioinformatic analysis. It would also be nice to know if the genes induced by 2-DG treatment are also MondoA dependent.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>The study of Weger and coworkers explores the role of conserved intracellular sugar sensor MondoA-Mlx in zebrafish early development. The study shows that transient knockdown of MondoA and its necessary binding partner Mlx lead to impaired morphogenetic movement of epiboly in the embryos. The authors also use (likely null) mutants of MondoA and observe similar defects, however with very low penetrance. Rnaseq analysis of MondoA knockdown embryos revealed strong downregulation of nsdhl, encoding an enzyme involved in cholesterol biosynthesis. Knockdown of <italic>nsdhl</italic> showed similar epiboly phenotype as MondoA knockdown, implying that defect of cholesterol biosynthesis is the underlying reason for the developmental defect. This is supported by the finding that treatment with steroid hormone pregnenolone partially rescues the MondoA phenotype.</p><p>This study is of high interest to the field, and therefore possibly suitable for <italic>eLife</italic>. It is to my knowledge the first characterization of MondoA-Mlx in vivo function in fish, it provides unprecedented evidence for MondoA-Mlx in early embryogenesis, and it establishes MondoA-Mlx as a putative regulator of steroid hormone metabolism. In general, the experiments have been carefully designed, conducted and documented and the conclusions are sound.</p><p>I have a couple of requests to strengthen the central findings of the manuscript that should be addressed prior to publication.</p><p>1) While <italic>nsdhl</italic> knockdown produces similar phenotype to MondoA knockdown, it remains unclear whether the epiboly phenotype can be mainly explained by deregulation of this one target gene. To test this, the authors should test whether transgenic <italic>nsdhl</italic> is sufficient to rescue the MondoA knockdown phenotype.</p><p>2) The partial rescue of MondoA knockdown by pregnenolone supports the idea that the phenotype is due to defects in steroid biosynthesis. The authors should directly analyze the levels of cholesterol (for example cholesterol binding fluorescent dyes) to test whether the biosynthesis is indeed affected by MondoA knockdown.</p><p>3) RNAseq data should be more thoroughly analyzed and represented. Gene set enrichment analyses should be done to show, which pathways and processes are affected by MondoA knockdown. It would be also interesting to know, whether the conserved MondoA targets (shown in Figure 1) were affected by MondoA knockdown or MondoA mutant.</p><p>4) The differences between MondoA knockdown and MondoA mutant are the most puzzling part of this manuscript. I have several requests regarding this part:</p><p>– The authors performed an RNAseq of mutant embryos without an epiboly phenotype and state that &quot;Surprisingly, <italic>nsdhl</italic> mRNA levels were not altered&quot; (data not shown). It remains unclear to me whether this means not altered from MondoA knockdown (downregulated) or not altered from control (not downregulated). Please clarify this (and show the data). If not downregulated compared to control, it would be important to see what is the expression of <italic>nsdhl</italic> mRNA in mutants that show epiboly phenotype.</p><p>– The authors also show that a set of genes involved in terpenoid biosynthesis is differentially expressed in mutants (upregulated) and knockdown (downregulated) and suggest this would be the reason for the lacking phenotype. How are these genes expressed in MondoA mutant embryos with an epiboly phenotype? Does their knockdown cause an epiboly phenotype?</p><p>– In order to validate the effects of the genetic perturbations, a systematic comparison between the gene expression changes in the MondoA knockdown vs. mutants should be represented. Are other gene groups similarly deregulated in the two conditions and only the terpenoid group shows differential expression?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #4:</italic></p><p>In this manuscript, the authors analyzed the function of MondoA in vivo in zebrafish. They found that knockdown of MondoA caused the epiboly defects. Then they analyzed the morphant phenotypes extensively, and found defects in the YSL structure or function. Next, they performed RNA -seq analysis, and identified the <italic>nsdhl</italic> gene as a target, which is important for cholesterol and pregnenolone synthesis. The Nsdhl morphants showed a similar phenotype as the MondoA morpants, and the MondoA morphant phenotypes were partially rescued by pregnenolone, thus revealing a novel MondoA-pregnenolone pathwaty. Furthermore, they showed that during epiboly pregnenolone controls stabilization of yolk microtubules. Finally, they created knockout mutant of MondoA by CRISPR/Cas9. Homozygotes are viable and they created maternal zygotic MondoA mutant embryos. They saw the epiboly phenotype in smaller percentages of MZ embryos. Unlike the morphants, in MZ embryos the terpenoid pathway genes are upregulated. This is the first demonstration of how MondoA knockdown affects embryonesis in details in a vertebrate.</p><p>Major concerns:</p><p>1) Rescue efficiencies by MondoA mRNA injected to MondoA morphants seem low.</p><p>2) They tried to interprete the difference between MondoA morphants and knockout mutants by an unknown compensatory mechanism. I think the argument was not strong enough. The authors at least need to show that upregulation of the terpenoid pathway can rescue the epiboly phenotype seen in morphants.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Regulation of cholesterol biosynthesis by glucose-sensing MondoA is required for zebrafish epiboly&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by four peer reviewers, including Koichi Kawakami as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #4, and the evaluation has been overseen by Marianne Bronner as the Senior Editor.

Specifically, we are asking editors to accept without delay manuscripts, like yours, that they judge can stand as <italic>eLife</italic> papers without additional data, even if they feel that they would make the manuscript stronger. Thus the revisions requested below only address clarity and presentation.</p><p>The manuscript has been significantly revised. In the revised version, the authors extensively performed transcriptome analysis of morphants and mutants with or without the phenotype, and identified overlap between morphants and mutants and differences between mutants with and without the phenotype. Unexpectedly expression of <italic>nsdhl</italic> was not downregulated in the mutants with or without the phenotype. The authors found that mutants with unaffected epiboly showed stronger upregulation of genes in the terpenoid biosynthesis pathway and steroid hormone biosynthesis, compared to mutants with affected epiboly. The data strongly suggest that the upregulation of these genes compensated for Mondoa deficiency in the mutants, supporting the conclusion that MondoA-mediated cholesterol biosynthesis plays an important role.</p><p>Major concerns:</p><p>1) A main concern with the original manuscript version was that there was no downstream mechanism for the epiboly phenotype presented, which would be consistently supported by evidence obtained from both morpholino and mutant experiments. With the new RNAseq dataset the gene expression output of the morphants and the mutants with affected epiboly can be compared. The morphants show significant downregulation of genes in the terpenoid backbone and sterol biosynthesis pathways (including the most strongly downregulated gene nsdhl), supporting the main conclusion. The mutants with affected epiboly, however, show no change in sterol biosynthesis (including nsdhl) or the terpenoid backbone biosynthesis pathways. The authors draw attention to the upregulation of the terpenoid backbone biosynthesis pathway in the unaffected mutants (in contrast to the affected mutants) and imply that these genes have a compensatory role. However, experimental evidence for such a compensatory effect is not presented. It also remains unclear to me what would these genes compensate for, since no impairment of cholesterol or steroid hormone metabolism is observed in the mutants. Accordingly, this should be discussed. Further, the main conclusion is &quot;regulation of cholesterol biosynthesis by glucose-sensing MondoA is required for zebrafish epiboly” is not sufficiently supported by the <italic>mondoa</italic> mutant data presented. From this aspect, the title better be modified.</p><p>2) (similar to the #1) The fact that expression of <italic>nsdhl</italic> was not altered in the MZ mutants with or without the phenotype should be discussed (in Discussion). The authors should address why they do not think the transcriptome analysis of morphants were artifacts.</p><p>3) The section &quot;<italic>MZmondoa</italic> mutants show compensatory changes in expression of cholesterol/steroid biosynthesis genes&quot; was really difficult to read. I think the authors better describe the results as they described in the reply mail to us.</p><p>Also subsection “Maternal-zygotic mutants of <italic>mondoa</italic> show partially penetrant epiboly phenotypes”: “an epiboly phenotype” should be “the epiboly phenotype”.</p><p>Subsection “<italic>MZmondoa</italic> mutants show compensatory changes in expression of cholesterol/steroid biosynthesis genes”: “<italic>MZmondoa</italic> embryos with and without an epiboly phenotype”… This should be: <italic>MZmondoa</italic> embryos with and without the mutant phenotype, or <italic>MZmondoa</italic> embryos with severe and no mutant phenotype or <italic>MZmondoa</italic> embryos with severe and no epiboly anomalies.</p><p>Also in the same section: “both phenotypes of MZ mutants” should be “the MZ mutants of both phenotypes”</p><p>“… as an important component of the compensation response”.

Furthermore, we added an unbiased global gene set enrichment analysis to the manuscript that highlights the importance of cholesterol related pathways for compensation of the epiboly phenotype. These results are shown in a set of new figures and/or figure panels (new Figure 7, Figure 7—figure supplement 1 and Figure 7—figure supplement 2) and a new Supplementary file 2.</p><p>To compare the gene expression signatures of MZ<italic>mondoa</italic> mutants with and without epiboly phenotype to those of <italic>mondoa</italic> morphants and their respective controls, we employed the rank-rank hypergeometric overlap (RRHO) algorithm (Plaisier et al., 2010). As shown in Figure 7—figure supplement 2A-D, the analysis reveals that differential gene expression significantly overlaps between mutants and morphants, demonstrating that both conditions are reflecting a lack of MondoA function. Specifically, mutant embryos show a significant overlap in differential gene expression with respect to the morphants mainly in the upregulated gene fraction. There are also some differences apparent between the mutants with and without an epiboly phenotype. One observes that the overlap in downregulated genes is weaker between morphants and mutants without epiboly phenotype (compare lower left quadrant in B and C). This observation indicates that mainly the downregulated genes in <italic>mondoa</italic> morphants are transcriptionally compensated in MZ<italic>mondoa</italic> mutants with unaffected epiboly. In contrast, the affected mutants show a weaker overlap in the upregulated gene signatures, indicating that only a fraction of the upregulated genes in MZ<italic>mondoa</italic> mutants is actually important for phenotype compensation.</p><p>We next explored differences in gene expression between the two mutant phenotypes to reveal potential mechanisms for epiboly compensation. We turned our attention to genes in the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway based on our previous observations in morphant embryos. Our analysis showed that <italic>nsdhl</italic> gene expression is comparable to wild-type embryos in both MZ<italic>mondoa</italic> mutant phenotypes (affected and unaffected epiboly) and, thus, is compensated in both (Supplementary file 1 and Figure 7—figure supplement 2E). To better illustrate the expression pattern of <italic>nsdhl</italic> across the different conditions, we now have added the additional graphs as Figure 7—figure supplement 2F. Therefore, differences in <italic>nsdhl</italic> expression between MZ<italic>mondoa</italic> mutants cannot explain the differences in the epiboly phenotype. This observation indicates that the restoration of expression to wild-type levels of this most downregulated gene upon <italic>mondoA</italic> knockdown by itself is not sufficient for compensation. Consistently, in both mutant phenotypes the entire sterol biosynthesis pathway of which <italic>nsdhl</italic> forms part, lacks the coordinated downregulation that was seen in the morphants (unaffected: p= 0.87, affected: p= 0.79; Figure 7F and Figure 7—figure supplement 1A).</p><p>But what is causing the epiboly arrest if MZ<italic>mondoa</italic> mutants with affected epiboly share such compensatory transcriptional signatures with MZ<italic>mondoa</italic> mutants without epiboly phenotype? <italic>mondoa</italic> morphants show a significant downregulation in terpenoid biosynthesis (p=0.016) as well as in sterol biosynthesis pathways (p=0.022; Top 2 downregulated pathways in a global gene set enrichment analysis, Supplementary file 2). As indicated in the previous version of the manuscript, we observed a broad compensatory upregulation of gene expression in the terpenoid backbone biosynthesis pathway upstream of cholesterol biosynthesis: MZ<italic>mondoa</italic> mutants with unaffected epiboly show a coordinated upregulation of terpenoid pathway genes (i.e., they show a statistically significant enrichment for upregulation in a directional gene set enrichment test; p=0.012; Figure 7F-G, Figure 7—figure supplement 1B and Supplementary file 2). Intriguingly, mutants with affected epiboly lack this significant coordinated upregulation in the terpenoid backbone biosynthesis pathway that is present in unaffected mutants (p=0.178; Figure 7F-G and Figure 7—figure supplement 1B). This key difference highlights the terpenoid backbone biosynthesis pathway as an important component of the compensation response.</p><p>As we have likewise reported in the previous version of the manuscript, gene expression of steroid hormone biosynthesis pathway genes shows a coordinated upregulation in MZ<italic>mondoa</italic> mutants with unaffected epiboly (p=0.033; Figure 7F and Figure 7—figure supplement 1C), probably to compensate for reduced flux through the biosynthesis pathways upstream. This upregulation is also shown by MZ<italic>mondoa</italic> mutants with epiboly phenotype (p=0.017; Figure 7F and Figure 7—figure supplement 1C). Strikingly, it is even increased when compared to the mutants with unaffected epiboly (p=0.049), and thereby can lead to strongly increased expression levels compared to wild-type. This is illustrated by the expression of <italic>cyp11a1</italic>, the enzyme that is immediately upstream of pregnenolone synthesis (Figure 7—figure supplement 2G ). However, in the absence of coordinated regulation of genes in the terpenoid pathway, this regulation is apparently not sufficient to rescue epiboly progression.</p><p>In summary, despite some successful compensatory gene expression regulations, MZ<italic>mondoa</italic> mutants with affected epiboly fail to properly regulate the entire set of genes necessary for epiboly progression. They are not lacking compensation <italic>per se</italic>, but their compensation is inadequate and fails. We have implemented these results into the revised version of the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>[…] My major concern is partial rescue of mondoa morphants by wild-type mondoa mRNA (Figure 2E and subsection “Loss of mondoa function leads to severe epiboly defects”) and of mondoa/nsdhl morphants by the treatment with pregnenolone (Figure 5, subsection “Pregnenolone partially rescues epiboly in mondoa morphants and normalizes microtubule patterns”). These data raise the question whether effects of MO-mediated knockdown are really specific. However, the authors demonstrate that injection of MO did not induce defective epiboly in MZmondoa mutants, although only a small number of MZmondoa mutants showed epiboly defects. This experiment satisfies the recent criteria for MO experiments. Analyses of maternal and maternal zygotic mutants are not easy. The authors tried to explain the low penetrance by gene expression profiling. Although the authors did not show data from nsdhl mutants, I believe that the authors have shown compelling evidence for their conclusion. I would not ask them to do additional experiments.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank reviewer #1 for the appreciation that we have performed our MO experiments according to “the recent criteria for morpholino experiments” and that we provide “compelling evidence” for our conclusions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>This is an interesting and well-done paper that presents a characterization of the glucose sensing transcription factors, MondoA, Mlx and ChREBP in zebrafish epiboly. This is the first characterization of this transcription family in zebrafish, so it will be of interest to that community of developmental biologists. It is uncertain whether it will have broad appeal to the general audience of eLife. The analysis shows that MondoA and Mlx function at the mechanistic level much like their mammalian counterparts as glucose responsive transcription factors. A series of morpholino experiments connect MondoA to epiboly via the regulation of nsdhl and ultimately steroid biosynthesis. The authors then develop and partially characterize a genetic mutant of MondoA, which doesn't phenocopy the morphant phenotype in epiboly, or only does so with low penetrance. Their claim that a compensatory mechanism involving upregulation of genes involved in terpenoid biosynthesis. They demonstrate that several of the pathway genes are upregulated in the MZMondoA mutant, validating two, but there is no functional characterization of the putative compensatory mechanism. The discussion is balanced and the authors argue that similar mechanisms could be at play in mammals. It is true that phenotypes of MondoA, and ChREBP have only been characterized in adults (there is paper looking at Mlx in skeletal muscle that should be referenced). Whole body knockouts of ChREBP (published) and MondoA/Mlx(unpublished) don't display developmental defects, so the mechanisms described in the zebrafish system may not extend to mammalian systems.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now added the reference to the <italic>mlx</italic> mutant mice (Hunt et al., 2015) into the introductory part of the revised version of the manuscript.</p><p>It is certainly possible that the MondoA function in early development which we report is species specific. However, given the strong genetic compensation that we observed even in our maternal-zygotic mutants, it is equally possible that such genetic compensation occurs in mammals as well. These are interesting questions for future work, both from a mechanistic and an evolutionary viewpoint.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It would be interesting to know whether the regulation of nsdhl and other cholesterol biosynthetic genes is direct and contain ChoREs.

The study shows that transient knockdown of MondoA and its necessary binding partner Mlx lead to impaired morphogenetic movement of epiboly in the embryos. The authors also use (likely null) mutants of MondoA and observe similar defects, however with very low penetrance. Rnaseq analysis of MondoA knockdown embryos revealed strong downregulation of nsdhl, encoding an enzyme involved in cholesterol biosynthesis. Knockdown of nsdhl showed similar epiboly phenotype as MondoA knockdown, implying that defect of cholesterol biosynthesis is the underlying reason for the developmental defect. This is supported by the finding that treatment with steroid hormone pregnenolone partially rescues the MondoA phenotype.</p><p>This study is of high interest to the field, and therefore possibly suitable for eLife. It is to my knowledge the first characterization of MondoA-Mlx in vivo function in fish, it provides unprecedented evidence for MondoA-Mlx in early embryogenesis, and it establishes MondoA-Mlx as a putative regulator of steroid hormone metabolism. In general, the experiments have been carefully designed, conducted and documented and the conclusions are sound.</p><p>I have a couple of requests to strengthen the central findings of the manuscript that should be addressed prior to publication.</p><p>1) While nsdhl knockdown produces similar phenotype to MondoA knockdown, it remains unclear whether the epiboly phenotype can be mainly explained by deregulation of this one target gene. To test this, the authors should test whether transgenic nsdhl is sufficient to rescue the MondoA knockdown phenotype.</p></disp-quote><p>While <italic>nsdhl</italic> is the most downregulated gene identified in our RNA-seq study of the morphants, it is not the only one. In fact, the terpenoid backbone synthesis and the sterol biosynthesis pathways hold a prominent place among the pathways significantly downregulated in morphants (new Supplementary file 2). These data were illustrated in the gene set enrichment bar code plots of Figure 7 in the previous version of the manuscript, but not mentioned when we introduced the RNA-seq study of the morphants earlier in the manuscript. This may have created the impression that <italic>nsdhl</italic> is the only relevant target gene, which was not our intention. Our decision to focus on <italic>ndshl</italic> was motivated by the fact that it was the most downregulated gene in the entire set, and that it is a human disease gene. In the revised version of the manuscript, we have now expanded the description of the morphant RNA-seq data and mention the enrichment of the terpenoid and sterol biogenesis pathways within a systematic gene set enrichment analysis (Supplementary file 2 and Figure 7—figure supplement 1; we also indicate these pathways and the steroid biosynthesis pathway already in the simplified scheme in Figure 5B and mention them in the Abstract). Furthermore, we have rephrased parts of both the Results and the Discussion sections to better reflect these observations.</p><p>A rescue of <italic>mondoa</italic> morphants with <italic>nsdhl</italic> mRNA might seem to add a nice additional piece of data, but the rescue by the downstream pathway product pregnenolone is more informative in this context, especially as we observe deregulation also in other parts of the cholesterol/steroid biosynthesis pathway and not only in <italic>nsdhl</italic> expression. As described above and in our reply to the “Essential Revisions” section, Nsdhl is a crucial player in the pathway, but not the only one.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The partial rescue of MondoA knockdown by pregnenolone supports the idea that the phenotype is due to defects in steroid biosynthesis. The authors should directly analyze the levels of cholesterol (for example cholesterol binding fluorescent dyes) to test whether the biosynthesis is indeed affected by MondoA knockdown.</p></disp-quote><p>In an attempt to answer this question, we have tried to measure cholesterol related compounds both downstream and upstream of the Nsdhl-mediated synthesis steps applying mass spectrometry, but were not able to reliably detect them. One reason for this was interference by the large amount of cholesterol present at this early developmental stage in the embryonic extracts (personal communication from our collaborators, consistent with literature reports (Wiegand, 1996)). These high levels in early stage embryos are likely due to maternal deposition of cholesterol that potentially masks the effects of temporally or locally increased or decreased synthesis when measuring global concentrations. One can expect different pools of newly synthesized cholesterol and of cholesterol deposited in the egg. With regard to epiboly, our observations suggest that cholesterol synthesis seems to be required specifically in the YSL, since both MondoA and Nsdhl knockdowns restricted to the YSL impair epiboly (Figure 4C, D and 5G). Apparently, it is not the overall amount of cholesterol present in the yolk which is limiting. Rather, local synthesis or availability is important. Thus, local flux changes in cholesterol biosynthesis may be altered, which are currently not detectable due to a lack of adequate molecular probes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) RNAseq data should be more thoroughly analyzed and represented. Gene set enrichment analyses should be done to show, which pathways and processes are affected by MondoA knockdown. It would be also interesting to know, whether the conserved MondoA targets (shown in Figure 1) were affected by MondoA knockdown or MondoA mutant.</p></disp-quote><p>A global gene set enrichment analysis that complements the gene set enrichment analysis for the cholesterol related pathways shown in Figure 7 of the previous version of the manuscript has now been added to the manuscript (Supplementary file 2).</p><p>Expression of the conserved MondoA target genes was not or only slightly altered compared to wild-type in the morphant dataset (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig2">Author response image 2</xref>); however, we observed that the glucose induction of <italic>txnipa</italic> was abolished by MondoA knockdown, as mentioned above in our reply to reviewer 2. In the mutant data set, <italic>hk2</italic> and <italic>fasn</italic> expression is not or only slightly altered compared to wildtype in both epiboly-affected and unaffected mutants. By contrast, expression of both <italic>txnipa</italic> and <italic>b</italic> is very low in both mutant phenotypes. The different behaviour of the <italic>txnip</italic> genes and of <italic>hk2</italic> and <italic>fasn</italic> may relate to redundancy with other factors capable of sustaining the expression of the latter two genes.

I have several requests regarding this part:</p><p>– The authors performed an RNAseq of mutant embryos without an epiboly phenotype and state that &quot;Surprisingly, nsdhl mRNA levels were not altered&quot; (data not shown). It remains unclear to me whether this means not altered from MondoA knockdown (downregulated) or not altered from control (not downregulated). Please clarify this (and show the data). If not downregulated compared to control, it would be important to see what is the expression of nsdhl mRNA in mutants that show epiboly phenotype.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for pointing this out. We have now added the reference to the corresponding Figure (new Figure 7—figure supplement 2 E) and, in addition, provide the single plots for <italic>nsdhl</italic> in <italic>mondoa</italic> morphant and mutant embryos in the revised Figure 7—figure supplement 2F.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– The authors also show that a set of genes involved in terpenoid biosynthesis is differentially expressed in mutants (upregulated) and knockdown (downregulated) and suggest this would be the reason for the lacking phenotype. How are these genes expressed in MondoA mutant embryos with an epiboly phenotype? Does their knockdown cause an epiboly phenotype?</p></disp-quote><p>To answer this question, we now provide and analyze additional RNA-seq data of MZ<italic>mondoa</italic> mutants with affected epiboly. Please see our response to this point in the “Essential Revisions” paragraph above.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– In order to validate the effects of the genetic perturbations, a systematic comparison between the gene expression changes in the MondoA knockdown vs. mutants should be represented. Are other gene groups similarly deregulated in the two conditions and only the terpenoid group shows differential expression?</p></disp-quote><p>Common and differential gene expression changes in morphants and mutants are evident from our RRHO analysis, as detailed in the “Essential Revisions” section above. Furthermore, we have added a systematic metabolic pathway and GO term enrichment analysis comparing the different conditions to the manuscript (Supplementary file 2). This analysis shows, for example, that TCA pathway genes are upregulated in morphants and both mutant phenotypes, and that genes belonging to the lipopolysaccharide biosynthetic process GO are downregulated in all conditions. Not only the terpenoid group shows differential expression, but also, for example, sterol biosynthesis (see also Figure 7F).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #4:</p><p>[…] Major concerns:</p><p>1) Rescue efficiencies by MondoA mRNA injected to MondoA morphants seem low.</p><p>2) They tried to interprete the difference between MondoA morphants and knockout mutants by an unknown compensatory mechanism. I think the argument was not strong enough. The authors at least need to show that upregulation of the terpenoid pathway can rescue the epiboly phenotype seen in morphants.</p></disp-quote><p>The rescue efficiencies might appear low at a first glance, but are similar to those observed in previous studies that address other genes implicated in epiboly (Hsu et al., 2006; Schwend et al., 2011). Rescue efficiency may be limited by mRNA stability and/or translation efficiency of the rescue construct in vivo. Importantly, we observe a rescue not only with <italic>mondoa</italic> mRNA but also with the downstream product of the pathway, pregnenolone. Finally, the resistance of the mutant to the morpholino further validates the specificity of this tool for interference with MondoA function. Taken together, as also noted by reviewer #1, our rescue experiments satisfy “the recent criteria for MO experiments” (see also (Stainier et al., 2017)).</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The manuscript has been significantly revised. In the revised version, the authors extensively performed transcriptome analysis of morphants and mutants with or without the phenotype, and identified overlap between morphants and mutants and differences between mutants with and without the phenotype. Unexpectedly expression of nsdhl was not downregulated in the mutants with or without the phenotype. The authors found that mutants with unaffected epiboly showed stronger upregulation of genes in the terpenoid biosynthesis pathway and steroid hormone biosynthesis, compared to mutants with affected epiboly. The data strongly suggest that the upregulation of these genes compensated for Mondoa deficiency in the mutants, supporting the conclusion that MondoA-mediated cholesterol biosynthesis plays an important role.</p></disp-quote><p>We would like to thank the reviewers and editors for the overall positive evaluation of our work, in particular their appreciation that the data presented in the manuscript support “the conclusion that MondoA-mediated cholesterol biosynthesis plays an important role” in embryonic development.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Major concerns:</p><p>1) A main concern with the original manuscript version was that there was no downstream mechanism for the epiboly phenotype presented, which would be consistently supported by evidence obtained from both morpholino and mutant experiments. With the new RNAseq dataset the gene expression output of the morphants and the mutants with affected epiboly can be compared. The morphants show significant downregulation of genes in the terpenoid backbone and sterol biosynthesis pathways (including the most strongly downregulated gene nsdhl), supporting the main conclusion. The mutants with affected epiboly, however, show no change in sterol biosynthesis (including nsdhl) or the terpenoid backbone biosynthesis pathways. The authors draw attention to the upregulation of the terpenoid backbone biosynthesis pathway in the unaffected mutants (in contrast to the affected mutants) and imply that these genes have a compensatory role. However, experimental evidence for such a compensatory effect is not presented. It also remains unclear to me what would these genes compensate for, since no impairment of cholesterol or steroid hormone metabolism is observed in the mutants. Accordingly, this should be discussed.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now expanded our discussion of the compensatory mechanisms in the Discussion section accordingly:</p><p>“Interestingly, many terpenoid, sterol and steroid biogenesis genes showed lower than wild-type levels of expression in the morphants and equal or higher levels in the mutants with unaffected epiboly, suggesting that increased steroidogenesis activity rescues epiboly in a majority of MZ mutant embryos. In the remaining mutant embryos, the lack of coordinated upregulation of terpenoid backbone biosynthesis genes is indicative of an incomplete compensation attempt. Apparently, concerted changes across the entire cholesterol/steroid biosynthesis pathway are needed to rescue epiboly progression in the absence of MondoA function. The mere restoration of <italic>nsdhl</italic> expression levels, for example, appears not to be sufficient for such a rescue, perhaps because a few genes in the sterol biosynthesis pathway still show deregulation of expression in MZ mutant embryos of both phenotypes (Figure 7—figure supplement 1 A). Therefore, even though globally there is no coherent up- or downregulation in sterol biosynthesis gene expression of mutants compared to wild-type embryos based on gene set enrichment analysis, pathway function in mutants may still be suboptimal and require the compensatory upregulation in the upstream terpenoid pathway to achieve sufficient synthesis flux. Furthermore, random variation in the amount of material deposited by the mother or in protein expression of key genes may limit compensation in the mutants with affected epiboly. A more detailed understanding of these processes awaits the determination of metabolite fluxes in morphants, mutants and wild-type embryos, specifically in the YSL.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Further, the main conclusion is &quot;regulation of cholesterol biosynthesis by glucose-sensing MondoA is required for zebrafish epiboly” is not sufficiently supported by the mondoa mutant data presented. From this aspect, the title better be modified.</p></disp-quote><p>In order to more precisely describe our observations, we have now modified the title to “MondoA regulates gene expression in cholesterol biosynthesis-associated pathways required for zebrafish epiboly”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) (similar to the #1) The fact that expression of nsdhl was not altered in the MZ mutants with or without the phenotype should be discussed (in Discussion).</p></disp-quote><p>As included above (reply to #1), this is now discussed explicitly:</p><p>“The mere restoration of <italic>nsdhl</italic> expression levels, for example, appears not to be sufficient for such a rescue, possibly because a few genes in the sterol biosynthesis pathway still show deregulation of expression in MZ mutant embryos of both phenotypes (Figure 7—figure supplement 1 A).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors should address why they do not think the transcriptome analysis of morphants were artifacts.</p></disp-quote><p>We are convinced that the morpholino results are not artifacts. The most important control experiment we performed is the experiment that reveals resistance of the MZ<italic>mondoa</italic> mutants to morpholino-induced phenotypes (Figure 7D). If the observed epiboly were due to off-target effects of the morpholino, these off-target effects would still elicit an aberrant epiboly phenotype in MondoA mutants. To better highlight this point, we have now emphasized this aspect in the revised version of the manuscript as follows: “Indeed, we observed a resistance of the mutants to the perturbance of epiboly caused by this MO in wild-types (Figure 7D). This observation strongly suggests the presence of strong compensatory or buffering mechanisms that enable embryonic development even when MondoA function is genetically perturbed. It also further confirms the specificity of the morphant phenotype.”</p><p>In addition to this experiment, which is considered as “the most definitive evidence for MO specificity” (Stainier et al., 2017), we also provided additional controls to prove morpholino specificity in the manuscript. Specifically, we 1) employed a 5 bp mismatch MO control, which is a more stringent control than the frequently used GeneTools standard control morpholino; 2) we tested for knockdown efficiency with a reporter construct, 3) we could partially rescue the phenotype with a non-targetable mRNA., 4) we demonstrated that no p53 mediated off target effects occur by co-injection with an anti-p53 morpholino, 5) knockdown of genes coding for an interaction partner of the pathway (<italic>mlx</italic>) or for a downstream target gene (<italic>nsdhl</italic>) led to similar phenotypes, strongly suggesting their contribution to a common pathway, and 6) the morphant phenotypes of both <italic>mondoa</italic> and <italic>nsdhl</italic> could be partially rescued by treatment with the downstream effector of the pathway, pregnenolone.</p><p>Finally, regarding the transcriptome analysis, we observed that none of the eight genes recently reported as commonly upregulated off-target genes in morpholino experiments (<italic>isg20</italic>, <italic>isg15</italic>, <italic>tp53</italic>, <italic>casp8</italic>, <italic>phlda3</italic>, <italic>gadd45aa</italic>, <italic>mdm2</italic>; (Lai, Gagalova, Kuenne, El-Brolosy, and Stainier, 2019)) were upregulated in our morphant RNAseq data set: 6 were not significantly regulated, while two (<italic>isg20</italic>, <italic>phlda3</italic>) showed downregulation in the morphants. Furthermore, GO terms related to stress response and apoptosis were not enriched in our gene set enrichment analysis of the morphant data (Supplementary file 2), in contrast to observations in the cited study. We are therefore confident that our morphant RNAseq data reflect the specific knockdown of MondoA function.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The section &quot;MZmondoa mutants show compensatory changes in expression of cholesterol/steroid biosynthesis genes&quot; was really difficult to read.
