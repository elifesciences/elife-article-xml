However, the significance of this high ATP level under physiological conditions and the mechanisms that maintain ATP remain unclear. We herein demonstrated that AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and adenylate kinase (ADK) cooperated to maintain cellular ATP levels regardless of glucose levels. Single-cell imaging of ATP-reduced yeast mutants revealed that ATP levels in these mutants underwent stochastic and transient depletion, which promoted the cytotoxic aggregation of endogenous proteins and pathogenic proteins, such as huntingtin and α-synuclein. Moreover, pharmacological elevations in ATP levels in an ATP-reduced mutant prevented the accumulation of α-synuclein aggregates and its cytotoxicity. The present study demonstrates that cellular ATP homeostasis ensures proteostasis and revealed that suppressing the high volatility of cellular ATP levels prevented cytotoxic protein aggregation, implying that AMPK and ADK are important factors that prevent proteinopathies, such as neurodegenerative diseases.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Cells use a chemical called adenosine triphosphate (ATP) as a controllable source of energy. Like a battery, each ATP molecule contains a specific amount of energy that can be released when needed. Cells just need enough ATP to survive, but most cells store a lot more than they need. It is unclear why cells keep so much ATP, or whether this excess ATP has any other purpose.</p><p>To answer these questions, Takaine et al. identified mutants of the yeast <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> that had low levels of ATP, and studied how these cells differ from normal yeast The results showed that, in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> cells with lower and variable levels of ATP, proteins stick together, forming clumps. Proteins are molecules that perform diverse roles, keeping cells alive. When they clump together, they stop working and can cause cells to die. Further experiments showed that reducing the levels of ATP just for a short time increased the rate at which proteins stick together.</p><p>Taken together, Takaine et al.’s results suggest that ATP plays a role in stopping proteins from sticking together, explaining why cells may store excess ATP, since it could aid survival.</p><p>Protein clumps, also called aggregates, are a key feature of various illnesses, including neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s. Takaine et al. provide a possible cause for why proteins aggregate in these diseases, which may be worth further study.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>ATP</kwd><kwd>proteostasis</kwd><kwd>AMPK</kwd><kwd>adenylate kinase</kwd><kwd>yeast</kwd><kwd>homeostasis</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>19K06654</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Takaine</surname><given-names>Masak</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>16H04781</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Takaine</surname><given-names>Masak</given-names></name><name><surname>Yoshida</surname><given-names>Satoshi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>15K18525</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Takaine</surname><given-names>Masak</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100007449</institution-id><institution>Takeda Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yoshida</surname><given-names>Satoshi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection, and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The first demonstration that cellular ATP homeostasis suppresses high volatility of cellular ATP levels to ensure proteostasis that prevents accumulation of cytotoxic protein aggregation.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is the main energy currency used by all living organisms. In addition to its role as energy currency, ATP has recently been suggested to influence the balance between the soluble and aggregated states of proteins, indicating that proteostasis is maintained by energy-dependent chaperones and also by the property of ATP as a hydrotrope to solubilize proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hayes et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Patel et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Pu et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Sridharan et al., 2019</xref>). Furthermore, ATP levels have been shown to regulate the physicochemical properties of the cytoplasm, such as viscosity, macromolecular crowding, and liquid–liquid phase separation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Marini et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Persson et al., 2020</xref>). However, the role of ATP was assessed in these studies using artificial ATP depletion. Therefore, it currently remains unclear whether ATP-dependent protein solubilization/desolubilization have physiologically significant cellular roles.</p><p>We recently established a reliable imaging technique to quantify intracellular ATP levels in single living yeast cells using the genetically encoded fluorescent ATP biosensor QUEEN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Yaginuma et al., 2014</xref>), which enables long-term evaluations of ATP homeostasis in individual cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Takaine et al., 2019</xref>). The findings obtained demonstrated that intracellular ATP levels did not vary within a yeast population grown in the same culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Takaine et al., 2019</xref>), which was in contrast to the large variations observed in intracellular ATP levels within a bacterial cell population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Yaginuma et al., 2014</xref>). Moreover, intracellular ATP levels in individual living yeast cells were stably and robustly maintained at approximately 4 mM, irrespective of carbon sources and cell-cycle stages, and temporal fluctuations in intracellular ATP levels were small (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Takaine et al., 2019</xref>). Based on these findings, we hypothesized that an exceptionally robust mechanism exists to precisely regulate ATP levels in eukaryotes. It currently remains unclear why ATP is stably maintained at a markedly higher level than the <italic>K<sub>m</sub></italic> (Michaelis constant) required for the enzymatic activities of most ATPases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Edelman et al., 1987</xref>), and the consequences associated with failed ATP homeostasis in living organisms have not yet been elucidated.</p><p>The most promising candidate regulator of ATP homeostasis is adenosine monophosphate (AMP)-activated protein kinase (AMPK). AMPK, which is activated by AMP and inhibited by ATP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Xiao et al., 2007</xref>), has long been regarded as an important regulator of the whole-body and cellular energy status in eukaryotes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hardie et al., 2016</xref>). AMPK is activated by increases in the AMP:ATP or ADP:ATP ratio (i.e.<italic>,</italic> low-energy state), and regulates its downstream effectors by phosphorylation to redirect cell metabolism from an anabolic (ATP-consuming) state to catabolic (ATP-producing) state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Herzig and Shaw, 2018</xref>). In the budding yeast <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>, the sucrose nonfermenting 1 (Snf1) protein kinase complex is the sole AMPK. Similar to other AMPKs, the yeast Snf1 complex comprises three subunits: the catalytic α subunit (<italic>SNF1</italic>), scaffolding β subunit (<italic>SIP1</italic>, <italic>SIP2</italic>, or <italic>GAL83</italic>), and regulatory γ subunit (<italic>SNF4</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Ghillebert et al., 2011</xref>). The role of the Snf1 complex in adaptation to glucose limitations has been characterized in detail (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hedbacker and Carlson, 2008</xref>). The Snf1 complex is inactive in the presence of sufficient glucose levels in media (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Wilson et al., 1996</xref>). Decreases in glucose levels have been shown to activate the Snf1 complex and phosphorylate the transcriptional repressor Mig1, which then triggers the transcription of numerous glucose-repressed genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Carlson, 1999</xref>). However, the contribution of AMPK or the Snf1 complex to cellular ATP levels remains unknown.</p><p>Other possible candidate regulators of ATP homeostasis include genes whose mutation leads to decrease in the cellular content of ATP. However, based on biochemical analyses of cell populations, few yeast mutants reduced ATP levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gauthier et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Ljungdahl and Daignan-Fornier, 2012</xref>). Adenylate kinase (ADK) is a key enzyme that synthesizes ATP and AMP using two adenosine diphosphate (ADP) molecules as substrates, and the null mutant of ADK (<italic>adk1∆</italic>) was shown to have a reduced cellular ATP level (~70% of the wild type) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gauthier et al., 2008</xref>). Bas1 is a transcription factor that is required for de novo purine synthesis and <italic>bas1∆</italic> also has a reduced ATP level (~50% of the wild type) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gauthier et al., 2008</xref>). However, the regulation of ATP levels and the physiological consequences of reduced ATP levels in these mutants remain unclear, particularly at the single-cell level.</p><p>In the present study, we investigated the roles of AMPK, ADK, and Bas1 in ATP homeostasis using the QUEEN-based single-cell ATP imaging technique. We demonstrated for the first time that AMPK is involved in the regulation of intracellular ATP levels, even under glucose-rich conditions. Furthermore, time-lapse ATP imaging revealed that cells lacking both AMPK and ADK frequently underwent transient ATP depletion, while ATP levels oscillated in those lacking Bas1. These ATP dynamics in the mutants were overlooked in previous biochemical studies. The transient depletion of ATP closely correlated with and often preceded the accelerated accumulation of protein aggregates. We found that some intrinsic proteins and aggregation-prone model proteins, including α-synuclein, which is responsible for Parkinson’s disease, aggregated and were cytotoxic in all of the ATP-reduced mutants tested. The present results suggest that the stable maintenance of ATP is essential for proteostasis and imply that an ATP crisis promotes proteinopathies, such as neurodegenerative diseases.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>ADK1 cooperates with AMPK to regulate ATP homeostasis</title><p>We recently developed a reliable monitoring system for cytoplasmic ATP levels in living yeast cells using the ATP biosensor QUEEN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Takaine et al., 2019</xref>). We herein conducted a more detailed examination of ATP dynamics in wild-type and mutant yeast cells using this system. We initially investigated whether the deletion of <italic>SNF1</italic>, which encodes a catalytic subunit of AMPK, affected cellular ATP levels. Cellular ATP levels were significantly lower in <italic>SNF1</italic>-null mutant (<italic>snf1∆</italic>) cells than in wild-type cells at various glucose levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A, B</xref>). It is important to note that in addition to low glucose conditions (0.05% glucose), at which the Snf1 complex is active, <italic>snf1</italic>∆ cells showed significantly reduced ATP levels even under high glucose conditions (2% glucose), at which the Snf1 complex is considered to be inactive. Moreover, the deletion of each gene encoding the β subunit of AMPK (<italic>SIP1</italic>, <italic>SIP2</italic>, or <italic>GAL83</italic>) reduced cellular ATP levels to a similar extent as the deletion of <italic>SNF1</italic>, suggesting that three subtypes of the Snf1 complex were involved in maintaining ATP concentrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). On the other hand, the deletion of <italic>MIG1</italic> had a negligible effect on ATP levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>), suggesting that as yet unknown factors other than Mig1 primarily regulate ATP levels under the control of the Snf1 complex. Collectively, these results demonstrated for the first time that AMPK/SNF1 affect cellular ATP levels even under glucose-rich conditions.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Interconversion and active synthesis of adenine nucleotides are important for adenosine triphosphate (ATP) homeostasis.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Adk1 and Snf1 synergistically control cellular ATP levels.

We also quantitatively and statistically examined the sharp elevation in the fluorescence intensity of Hsp104-RS2 followed by the ATP dip by calculating the RMSD. In these cases, the RMSD was calculated using the linear regression of Hsp104-RS2 fluorescence intensities before the onset of the ATP dip (the dotted line in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). The periods in which the RMSD before the ATP dip was calculated were more than 92 min, and 248 min on average, ensuring that the fluorescence intensity of Hsp104-RS2 had stably and linearly increased in the hours preceding the ATP dip in these cells. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref> shows a line chart of the RMSD before and after the ATP dip (<italic>N</italic> = 25 cells).

This result suggests that even in double mutant cells, which have the potential to undergo the ATP dip, the intensity of Hsp104-RS2 increased slowly and linearly, similar to that in cells with stable ATP dynamics, until they exhibited the ATP dip. Therefore, these results indicate that the sharp elevation observed in the fluorescence intensity of Hsp104-RS2 is a phenomenon specific to cells exhibiting the ATP dip.

This function of the Snf1 complex in ATP homeostasis is independent of glucose levels in the medium and Mig1, the major transcriptional repressor involved in glucose repression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>); therefore, this is distinct from its well-characterized role in adaptation to glucose limitations. The activity of the Snf1 kinase complex may be sharply tuned depending on the intracellular levels of adenine nucleotides or other metabolites indicative of cellular energy to prevent a rapid ATP dip (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), even in the presence of sufficient amounts of glucose. It is important to note that the reductions observed in intracellular ATP levels in <italic>snf1∆</italic> cells in the presence of glucose were overlooked in previous biochemical analyses, again demonstrating the usefulness of QUEEN-based ATP imaging. A recent study showed that the deletion of <italic>SNF1</italic> decreased glycolytic flux in cells cultured in 1% glucose (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Martinez-Ortiz et al., 2019</xref>), which supports the novel function of the Snf1 complex.</p><fig id="fig8" position="float"><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Models for adenosine triphosphate (ATP) homeostasis and its role in proteostasis.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic summary of the roles of Snf1, Adk1, and Bas1 in ATP homeostasis.

This assumption is reasonable because the pool size of recyclable ATP restricts ATP levels based on the rapid turnover rate of ATP. Bas1 maintains the pool size of ATP by balancing ATP synthesis and irreversible decreases, such as incorporation into RNA and DNA (following conversion to deoxy-ATP), degradation, and excretion in rapidly proliferating yeasts.</p><p>The decreases observed in ATP levels in the ATP-mutant cells were confirmed by our biochemical measurements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). The biochemical assay also revealed that ADP levels decreased in ATP mutants, similar to ATP levels, and, as a consequence, ATP/ADP ratios, indicators of cellular energy charges, remained largely unchanged. On the other hand, the sum of ATP and ADP levels, indicators of the pool size of adenine nucleotides, decreased in the mutants, which may explain the instability observed in ATP levels. While cytosolic ATP levels were reduced and unstable in <italic>snf1∆ adk1∆</italic> cells, high ATP levels may have accumulated in intracellular membrane compartments (e.g., vacuoles, lysosomes, and mitochondria), which were not visualized by QUEEN. The hidden fraction of ATP may have increased the average ATP level of whole cells measured by the biochemical assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>).</p><p>We also showed that key regulators of ATP homeostasis play roles in preventing cytotoxic protein aggregation in budding yeast (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>). The common feature associated with these mutants is reduced ATP levels, suggesting that high ATP levels are essential for protein solubilization.</p><p>A proteomic study suggested that the main role of ATP changes depending on its level. At levels lower than 0.5 mM, ATP mainly serves as a substrate for enzymes, such as protein kinases and heat shock protein chaperones, whereas at levels higher than 2 mM, ATP may exert solubilizing effects on disordered proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Sridharan et al., 2019</xref>). ATP homeostasis may also be required to constantly drive proteasomal protein degradation, which requires high levels of ATP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Benaroudj et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Tanaka et al., 1983</xref>).</p><p>Previous biochemical measurements indicated that although ATP levels were lower in <italic>adk1</italic> and <italic>bas1</italic> mutants than in the wild type, these mutants still had ATP levels that were higher than 2 mM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gauthier et al., 2008</xref>). This does not directly explain the accumulation of protein aggregates in these mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) because most proteins are expected to be soluble at &gt;2 mM ATP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Sridharan et al., 2019</xref>). In this study, we explained this discrepancy by using the biosensor-based ATP imaging technique we developed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Takaine et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Yaginuma et al., 2014</xref>). The simultaneous visualization of ATP dynamics and protein aggregates in living cells at the single-cell level revealed that ATP underwent transient depletion (the ATP dip) in AMPK and ADK double mutants. Moreover, the ATP dip strongly correlated with and was often followed by the accelerated accumulation of protein aggregates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). This result implies that even a transient decrease in cellular ATP levels can trigger the aberrant accumulation of protein aggregates.</p><p>The ATP dip at 25°C was often followed by the accelerated accumulation of protein aggregates labeled with Hsp104-RS2 within a few hours, but not immediately. We speculate that this was because markedly lower amounts of proteins aggregated upon ATP depletion at 25°C, a temperature at which they were thermodynamically more stable, than at 35°C and the expression level of Hsp104 was also more than 50-fold lower (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Parsell et al., 1994</xref>). Undetectable fine aggregates gradually grow into evident Hsp104-RS2 foci within hours and facilitate the accumulation of whole Hsp104-RS2 foci. Although the mechanisms by which protein aggregates irregularly induced by the ATP dip grow and enhance the overall accumulation of protein aggregates have not yet been elucidated, these results provide insights into how aggregation-prone proteins aggregate and cause cytotoxicity in the mutant. A similar, but distinct, instability in ATP was observed in <italic>bas1∆</italic>, further confirming that the ATP dip promotes protein aggregation. Although severe ATP depletion in these mutants was gradually recovered by as yet uncharacterized negative feedback regulation, the duration period of ~15 min with reduced ATP levels may induce some proteins to form aggregates that last for generations. The close relationship between uncontrolled fluctuations in ATP levels, rather than a low ATP level itself, and unfavorable protein aggregation again suggests the biological importance of ATP homeostasis. However, the more instantaneous ATP dip that occurred within only seconds or a few minutes, which was unobservable with the current imaging system, may affect protein aggregation in ATP mutants.</p><p>A recent study revealed that forced energy (ATP) depletion from budding yeast cells induced extensive cytoplasmic reorganization, including increases in macromolecular (ribosome) crowding, the emergence of numerous membrane-less organelles, and the polymerization of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2B (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Marini et al., 2020</xref>). Another recent study showed that the depletion of ATP triggered the ‘viscoadaptation’ of yeast cytoplasm by an as yet unknown mechanism, and induced increases in viscosity and decreases in biomolecular solubility, thereby enhancing phase separation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Persson et al., 2020</xref>). These findings imply that malfunctional ATP homeostasis may induce undesirable and dysregulated biomolecular assemblies driven by enhanced liquid–liquid phase separation and molecular crowding. The present study using ATP-mutant cells is the first to demonstrate the consequence of failed ATP homeostasis under physiologically relevant conditions and highlights the biological significance of ATP homeostasis. In bacterial cells entering dormancy after the application of antibiotics, the depletion of ATP was shown to induce cytoprotective protein aggregation that regulated the depth of dormancy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Pu et al., 2019</xref>). Therefore, ATP-dependent protein solubilization/desolubilization may have diverse roles depending on the biological context.</p><p>Many neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer’s, Huntington’s, and Parkinson’s diseases, are associated with protein aggregation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Eisele et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kirkwood et al., 2017</xref>). On the other hand, based on a large body of evidence, mitochondrial dysfunction and accompanying energy failure in nerve cells may result in many types of neurodegenerative diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Haelterman et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Pathak et al., 2013</xref>). Previous studies demonstrated that ATP levels in the brain were decreased in patients with early Parkinson’s disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Mochel et al., 2012b</xref>) and also that ATP synthesis in the brain was not properly regulated in patients with early Huntington’s disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hattingen et al., 2009</xref>) and in the corresponding mouse model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Mochel et al., 2012a</xref>). Therefore, protein aggregation induced by the ATP dip, as revealed in the present study, may link energy failure and protein aggregation, providing a comprehensive insight into the onset of neurodegenerative diseases. Further studies are warranted to clarify whether the ATP dip also occurs in the neurons of patients at risk of neurodegenerative diseases or in the elderly. However, neither biochemical measurements nor mass spectrometry is capable of detecting the ATP dip because of their insufficient time and space resolution. Therefore, an ATP imaging approach using the yeast system will be the leading model for elucidating the molecular mechanisms underlying ATP homeostasis and ATP dip-induced protein aggregation.</p><p>A recent study reported that the activation of AMPK by metformin ameliorated the progression of Huntington’s disease in a mouse model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Arnoux et al., 2018</xref>), and the potential therapeutic use of metformin for neurodegenerative diseases is being discussed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Rotermund et al., 2018</xref>). Furthermore, the involvement of ATP and ADK in preventing the manifestation of Parkinson’s disease in mouse models and patients has been proposed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Garcia-Esparcia et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Nakano et al., 2017</xref>). Protein aggregation induced by the ATP dip may be a general mechanism for the development of proteinopathies. The present study using ATP imaging revealed a physiological consequence of a failure in ATP homeostasis in living cells for the first time and suggests that ATP homeostasis has potential as a target for preventing/treating neurodegenerative diseases.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Yeast strains and plasmids</title><p>The budding yeast strains and plasmids used in the present study are listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1 supp2">Supplementary files 1 and 2</xref>, respectively.

All measurements were repeated at least twice to confirm reproducibility.</p><p>During time-lapse imaging, QUEEN fluorescence was sometimes not acquired by the correct exposure time because of a mechanical malfunction in the microscope system, producing an abnormally high or low QUEEN ratio. The incorrect acquisition of the QUEEN signal was readily noticeable and clearly distinguishable from the ATP dip because one of the two QUEEN fluorescence signals (excited at 410 or 490 nm) was unusually intense in that frame. The error rate was approximately once in 70 frames (which varied day to day), and the abnormal QUEEN ratio was corrected by replacing it with the average value calculated using the previous and next frames.</p><p>ATP levels in yeast cells were estimated using QUEEN-based ratiometric imaging, as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Takaine, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Takaine et al., 2019</xref>). The QUEEN ratio is proportional to ATP levels and pseudocolored to reflect its value throughout the present study. The mean QUEEN ratio inside of a cell represents the intracellular ATP level of the cell.</p><p>We examined temporal fluctuations in the mean QUEEN ratio inside a cell using time-course data as follows.

The calculation was then expanded by introducing the parameter <italic>l</italic> indicating the time lag of the frame to deduct (∆<italic>ratio</italic>(<italic>t</italic>, <italic>l</italic>) = <italic>ratio<sub>t</sub> − ratio<sub>t−l</sub></italic>), and the calculation was repeated. We found that most of the maxima of differences fell between 0.2 and 0.4 in wild-type cells, and the value of the parameter <italic>l</italic> did not affect the result obtained (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A</xref>). On the other hand, in <italic>snf1∆ adk1∆</italic> cells, the maxima of differences were distributed above 0.4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2B</xref>), demonstrating large temporal fluctuations in the mean QUEEN ratio specific to the double mutant. In consideration of these results, we defined a transient decrease in the mean QUEEN ratio in a cell of more than 0.5 and spanning more than 2 frames as ‘the ATP dip’. If the decrease in the ratio was in the range of 0.33–0.5, it was classified as a shallow ATP dip. In cases in which the mean QUEEN ratio decreased by more than 0.33 and did not recover during the observation period (as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>), the irreversible change was defined as ‘the ATP shift’. If the cell showed neither the ATP dip nor ATP shift during the observation period, at least for the 2 × doubling time (3.6 hr for the wild type and 4.8 hr for <italic>snf1∆ adk1∆</italic>), the ATP dynamics of the cell were classified as ‘stable’.</p><p>The RMSD in the mean Hsp104-RS2 intensity of an <italic>snf1∆ adk1∆</italic> cell undergoing the ATP dip (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2</xref>) was calculated as follows. The time series of the mean Hsp104-RS2 intensity before the ATP dip were fit to a linear regression line, and a deviation was defined as the difference between the measured value of Hsp104-RS2 intensity and the estimated value calculated from the regression line.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and David Ron as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Liam J Holt (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) It is important to co-image the ATP sensor and aggregates in the same cell to directly associate the fluctuations in ATP with aggregation response. At this point the ATP fluctuations are documented and the aggregation is documented but it is not clear these are directly associated. These experiments need to be performed in a sufficient number of cells that a statistically robust correlation is shown.</p><p>2) There is a need to show conclusions in a greater number of cells, please increase the N in presented data to improve statistical rigor throughout the paper.</p><p>3) The idea that ATP homeostasis is relevant was very exciting to the reviewers but we suggest that a situation with a transient inhibitor of the one of the pathways is performed to assess how acute inhibition differs from the null mutants.</p><p>4) We also suggest amplifying the message that the results suggest that fluctuations in ATP may be more relevant than an absolute level of ATP in the cell in the discussion. Please also make all other textual and figure edits suggested below to improve clarity of communication.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1. What is the pH of the cytosol in the AMK/ADK mutants? Is the mechanism of aggregation during &quot;catastrophe&quot; essentially what has been reported previously in yeast?</p><p>2. What happens in a more transient loss of enzyme activity rather than a null?</p><p>3. How widespread is the aggregation phenomena- do other proteins aggregate or assemble into filaments as has been reported by others under ATP limitations/stationary phase? It would be good to expand the effect to see if this is similar to what has been seen with other modes of ATP depletion.</p><p>4. Are these aggregates asymmetrically segregated if cells are persistently depleted of ATP, such as in the null mutants? It seems if there are persistent spikes in ATP, would see a population of mothers enriched in aggregates and this may have long-term consequences on longevity.</p><p>5. If make an extract and add exogenous ATP is this sufficient to rescue the aggregates? This might be a more direct way to assess ATP levels, though will still be an issue to disentangle enzymatic vs direct roles.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1. Acute activation or inhibition of AMPK with drugs would further test if the effects on ATP levels are direct or indirect (e.g., through transcription or some other downstream effect). For example, it would be nice to see changes in ATP levels and protein aggregation immediately following acute inhibition of AMPK.</p><p>2. Figure 2 needs wild-type control images. Furthermore, more quantification of the ATP catastrophe phenotype would strengthen the paper.</p><p>3. Figure 3B. Please provide a rationale for why H2O2 is used as an insult.</p><p>4. Recheck the statistical tests. I'm not sure a One-tailed Welch test is appropriate in most cases. Most of their data should fit a two-tailed distribution. Also, you can't apply Welch to groups (e.g., Figure 1B); when comparing multiple mutants to wild-type, one must perform a One-Way ANOVA followed by a post-hoc test (Dunnett's multiple comparison test is best when you're comparing several mutants to the wild-type; must test for normality first).</p><p>5. Figure 3A. The labels in this figure are so small. I can't read anything.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1. Based on genetic interaction data, the authors identified protein folding/glycosylation as common genetic interactors with ATP catastrophe mutants. This motivated investigation of several models of protein aggregation (heat shock induced Hsp104 aggregates, neurodegenerative proteins such as α-synuclein and HTT103Q) in ATP mutants. Furthermore, 2DG treatment was also applied to deplete ATP to induce Ubc9ts aggregate formation. However, the authors should be careful when interpreting these data. For example, the authors made use of 2DG in glucose depleted medium to abolish cellular ATP and concluded the Ubc9ts protein aggregates formation were due to ATP removal. However, these treatments can also lead to acidification of cytosol, and whether reduced cytosolic pH contributes to Ubc9ts aggregates formation remains untested. The authors should try buffering the extracellular media to 7.5 to investigate the effect of pH.</p><p>2. When the QUEEN data were presented, some graphs were presented as absolute ATP concentrations while others were presented as mean QUEEN ratio. The authors should convert all to absolute ATP concentrations.</p><p>3. There are some discrepancies in ATP measurements. For example, comparing the ATP concentrations measured by the QUEEN sensor vs biochemical ascertainment in Figure 1B and 1C, the mutants showed inconsistent levels by the orthogonal methods, yet no explanation or discussion was given.</p><p>4. On the other hand, comparing ATP levels in the same condition by QUEEN (WT cells compare Figure 1B and 1E), the WT mean absolute ATP concentration varies around 30%. These two datapoints are essentially biological replicates. This makes me wonder why the authors aren't presenting biological replicates for each experiment.</p><p>5. According to early characterization of QUEEN sensor (Yaginuma et al. 2014), the measured 400ex/484ex ratio varies depending on the environmental pH and temperature. Have the authors considered those factors when converting the mean QUEEN ratio to absolute ATP concentration? It would be informative to provide detailed guidelines or conversion tables of the mean QUEEN ratio to absolute ATP concentration. In our opinion, the authors should perform a detailed QUEEN calibration protocol in a supplementary figure and in the Methods. There should be a calibration curve in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> cells, rather than reliance on prior results. The autofluorescence properties of <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> could be quite distinct.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.67659.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) It is important to co-image the ATP sensor and aggregates in the same cell to directly associate the fluctuations in ATP with aggregation response.

We conducted the simultaneous time-lapse imaging of QUEEN and protein aggregates in wild-type and <italic>snf1∆ adk1∆</italic> cells at 25℃ to examine the relationship between ATP fluctuations and protein aggregation more directly and added the results obtained to Figures 6 and 7 and the accompanying figure supplements. Corresponding information has been added to the figure legends and the Results, Discussion, and Methods sections in the revised manuscript (lines 327-395, lines 451-474, lines 487-490 and lines 623-634). We used Hsp104 tagged with RedStar2 (Hsp104-RS2) to visualize protein aggregates because after several attempts, we found that Hsp104-RS2 labeled protein aggregates at 25℃ (Figure 6A-B), similar to the intense accumulation of aggregates labeled with Hsp104-GFP (Figure 3C), in the double mutant. In cells showing stable ATP levels, either wild-type or <italic>snf1∆ adk1∆</italic>, the intracellular fluorescence intensity of Hsp104-RS2 increased slowly and linearly with time (Figure 6C-F). On the other hand, we found that in <italic>snf1∆ adk1∆</italic> cells that underwent the transient depletion of ATP, namely, the ATP dip (referred as the ATP catastrophe in the previous manuscript), a sharp elevation was observed in the fluorescence intensity of Hsp104-RS2 from the slow and linear increase within hours of the ATP dip (Figure 7). We quantified this sharp elevation in the fluorescence intensity of Hsp104-RS2 by calculating the root mean square deviation (RMSD) (a detailed method for this calculation was described in the Methods section). We then quantitatively and statistically examined the RMSD using data from dozens of examples of wild-type and double mutant cells (Figure 7C and Figure 7—figure supplement 2). These analyses revealed that the sharp elevation in the fluorescence intensity of Hsp104-RS2 was a phenomenon specific to cells exhibiting the ATP dip, and the ATP dip preceded the accelerated accumulation of protein aggregates, suggesting a strong correlation between them. These new results indicate that even a transient decrease in ATP levels can trigger aberrant protein aggregation, again indicating the biological importance of ATP homeostasis.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) There is a need to show conclusions in a greater number of cells, please increase the N in presented data to improve statistical rigor throughout the paper.</p></disp-quote><p>We performed a statistical analysis of ATP dynamics in wild-type and <italic>snf1∆ adk1∆</italic> cells with sufficient sample sizes in revised Figure 2F and Figure 2—figure supplement 2. Corresponding information has been added to the figure legends and the Results and Methods sections in the revised manuscript (lines 176-183 and lines 550-568). In this analysis, we classified ATP dynamics into three types: stable, the ATP dip, and the ATP shift. The ATP dip means a transient decrease in ATP levels, which had been referred to as the ATP catastrophe in the previous manuscript. During the course of the analysis, we found that multiple ATP dips in the same cell were rare and, thus, corrected the text accordingly. The ATP shift means an irreversible decrease in the level of ATP, which we had considered to be nearly equal to cell death in the previous manuscript. In the revised manuscript, we refrained from associating ATP depletion with cell death because based on the findings of experiments conducted in other projects, we found that we cannot confidently assess cell viability according to intracellular ATP concentrations or cell morphologies. Moreover, we reconfirmed statistical rigorousness throughout the revised manuscript (refer to our response to comment #4 by Reviewer #2).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The idea that ATP homeostasis is relevant was very exciting to the reviewers but we suggest that a situation with a transient inhibitor of the one of the pathways is performed to assess how acute inhibition differs from the null mutants.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the comment. However, the acute inhibition of AMPK and ADK at least in budding yeast is practically very difficult for the following reasons:</p><p>(i) To the best of our knowledge, there are no inhibitors that specifically block the enzymatic activities of ADK or AMPK of budding yeast.</p><p>(ii) Thermo-sensitive mutants of ADK and AMPK have not yet been isolated, and, thus, the acute inactivation of these proteins by a temperature shift is impossible.</p><p>(iii) The complete cessation of protein expression generally takes several hours. It seems self-evident that the deletion of ADK1 and BAS1 affects intracellular ATP levels because they have well-defined and limited functions that modulate cellular ATP concentrations; Adk1 catalyzes the interconversion of adenine nucleotides, and Bas1 up-regulates the expression of genes involved in de novo purine synthesis. On the other hand, the Snf1 complex, budding yeast AMPK, clearly appears to be multifunctional, and we reported for the first time a novel function of the Snf1 complex that maintains cellular ATP levels even in the presence of sufficient glucose. However, we are confident of the result because we found that the deletion of each gene encoding the β subunit of AMPK (<italic>SIP1</italic>, <italic>SIP2</italic>, or <italic>GAL83</italic>) reduced cellular ATP levels to a similar extent as the deletion of SNF1. These results support the new function of the SNF1 complex and suggest that three subtypes of the complex are involved in maintaining ATP concentrations. Moreover, a recent study showed that the deletion of SNF1 decreased glycolytic flux in cells cultured in 1% glucose (Martinez-Ortiz et al., 2019, <italic>Yeast</italic>, 36 (8), 487-494), which also supports the function of SNF1. We added these new results to Figure 1—figure supplement 1C and the corresponding information to the Results and Discussion sections (lines 116-119 and lines 359-361).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) We also suggest amplifying the message that the results suggest that fluctuations in ATP may be more relevant than an absolute level of ATP in the cell in the discussion. Please also make all other textual and figure edits suggested below to improve clarity of communication.</p></disp-quote><p>We consider the new results added to Figure 7 to demonstrate the close relationship between the ATP dip and subsequent increase in the accumulation of protein aggregates, and the corresponding discussion (lines 451-474) strengthens our claim that fluctuations in ATP levels may induce cytotoxic protein aggregation. Moreover, we revised the revised manuscript according to the comments suggested below to convey this message more clearly.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>1. What is the pH of the cytosol in the AMK/ADK mutants? Is the mechanism of aggregation during &quot;catastrophe&quot; essentially what has been reported previously in yeast?</p></disp-quote><p>According to a genome-wide analysis of the intracellular pH of budding yeast cells, the deletion of <italic>SNF1</italic>, <italic>ADK1</italic>, or <italic>BAS1</italic> does not significantly alter cellular pH (Orij et al., 2012, <italic>Genome Biol.</italic>, 13 (9), R80).

We added these new results to Figure 1—figure supplement 1C and the corresponding information to the Results and Discussion sections (lines 117-120 and lines 408-410).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. How widespread is the aggregation phenomena- do other proteins aggregate or assemble into filaments as has been reported by others under ATP limitations/stationary phase? It would be good to expand the effect to see if this is similar to what has been seen with other modes of ATP depletion.</p></disp-quote><p>Large-scale studies revealed that many metabolic enzymes in budding yeast assemble into cytoplasmic foci or filaments under nutrient starvation conditions (Narayanaswamy et al., 2009, <italic>PNAS</italic>, 106 (25), 10147-10152; Noree et al., 2010, <italic>JCB</italic>, 190 (4), 541-551; Noree et al., 2019, <italic>MBC</italic>, 30 (21), 2721-2736); however, none have been proven to aggregate through the direct effects of ATP depletion. For example, the glutamine synthetase Gln1 forms filaments upon glucose starvation (Narayanaswamy et al., 2009; Petrovska et al., 2014, <italic>eLife</italic>), but not upon ATP depletion by 2-deoxyglucose (our unpublished observation). On the other hand, Pu et al. (2019) showed that in bacterial cells, a decrease in intracellular ATP levels during nutrient starvation directly promoted the aggregation of endogenous proteins to form “aggresomes” that regulate cell dormancy (Pu et al., 2019, <italic>Molecular Cell</italic>, 73 (1), 143156). The dynamic assembly of bacterial aggresomes is similar to protein aggregation induced by the ATP dip (this study) in that they are both driven by ATP-dependent protein solubilization/desolubilization, which appears to mainly be driven by the hydrotropic effects of ATP (Patel et al., 2017, <italic>Science</italic>, 356 (6339), 753-756). On the other hand, they also have dissimilarities because the assembly of the aggresome is a regulated mechanism and noncytotoxic, whereas the ATP dip irregularly induces cytotoxic protein aggregation. We added a discussion to the revised manuscript (lines 487-490).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. Are these aggregates asymmetrically segregated if cells are persistently depleted of ATP, such as in the null mutants? It seems if there are persistent spikes in ATP, would see a population of mothers enriched in aggregates and this may have long-term consequences on longevity.</p></disp-quote><p>As far as we observed, protein aggregation induced by ATP depletion appeared to be distributed evenly in mother and daughter cells. In addition, we sometimes noted a large Hsp104-RS2 focus that migrated from a mother cell to a daughter cell. These behaviors of protein aggregates appear to differ from those of protein aggregates induced by a high temperature that are retained in mother cells and excluded from daughter cells (Liu et al., 2010, <italic>Cell</italic>, 140 (2), 257-267). The protein aggregates induced by ATP depletion may have biological properties that differ from those of heat-induced aggregates and are separately controlled. In future studies, we will examine the inheritance and clearance of ATP depletion-induced protein aggregation and hope to verify whether aggregates are an aging factor.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. If make an extract and add exogenous ATP is this sufficient to rescue the aggregates? This might be a more direct way to assess ATP levels, though will still be an issue to disentangle enzymatic vs direct roles.</p></disp-quote><p>We may be able to extract intact protein aggregates from yeast cells by preparing a dense native cell lysate that mimics the intracellular milieu (<italic>cf.</italic>, Persson et al., 2020, <italic>Cell</italic>, 183 (6), 1572-1585). As the Reviewer suggested, the addition of exogenous ATP may dissolve aggregates. Possible mechanisms for ATP-induced dissolution include (1) degradation by proteasomes, (2) disaggregation into denatured proteins by Hsp104, and (3) the further refolding of denatured proteins into native proteins by the chaperones Hsp70 and Hsp40. Using specific inhibitors and mutants, we may be able to differentiate these mechanisms and quantitatively examine protein dissolution through each pathway. However, we cannot assess the hydrotropic effects of ATP in the cell-free system because ATP as a hydrotrope may inhibit the denaturation of proteins and subsequent aggregation, but not resolve preexisting protein aggregates (Patel et al., 2017, <italic>Science</italic>, 356 (6339), 753-756). To examine the hydrotropic effects of ATP, ATP concentrations need to be decreased and the de novo assembly of denatured proteins or protein aggregates needs to be detected in the experimental system. These procedures, particularly the rapid depletion of ATP, appear to be difficult in the cell extract system.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>1. Acute activation or inhibition of AMPK with drugs would further test if the effects on ATP levels are direct or indirect (e.g., through transcription or some other downstream effect).

Figure 2 needs wild-type control images. Furthermore, more quantification of the ATP catastrophe phenotype would strengthen the paper.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the comment and added wild-type data to revised Figure 2A. Moreover, we performed a statistical analysis of ATP dynamics in wild-type and <italic>snf1∆ adk1∆</italic> cells with sufficient sample sizes in revised Figure 2F and Figure 2—figure supplement 2. Corresponding information has been added to the figure legends and the Results and Methods sections in the revised manuscript (lines 170-184 and lines 603-621). In this analysis, we classified ATP dynamics into three types: stable, the ATP dip, and the ATP shift. The ATP dip means a transient decrease in ATP levels, which had been referred to as the ATP catastrophe in the previous manuscript. During the course of the analysis, we found that multiple ATP dips in the same cell were rare and, thus, corrected the text accordingly. The ATP shift means an irreversible decrease in the level of ATP, which we had considered to be nearly equal to cell death in the previous manuscript. In the revised manuscript, we refrained from associating ATP depletion with cell death because based on the findings of experiments conducted in other projects, we found that we cannot confidently assess cell viability according to intracellular ATP concentrations or cell morphologies.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3.

Recheck the statistical tests. I'm not sure a One-tailed Welch test is appropriate in most cases. Most of their data should fit a two-tailed distribution. Also, you can't apply Welch to groups (e.g., Figure 1B); when comparing multiple mutants to wild-type, one must perform a One-Way ANOVA followed by a post-hoc test (Dunnett's multiple comparison test is best when you're comparing several mutants to the wild-type; must test for normality first).</p></disp-quote><p>We considered a one-tailed test to be appropriate in most cases because results are generally predictable based on previous studies (<italic>e.g.</italic>, decrease in ATP level in mutant cells) or direct observations of the data obtained before quantification (<italic>e.g.</italic>, percentages of cells with protein foci).

Based on genetic interaction data, the authors identified protein folding/glycosylation as common genetic interactors with ATP catastrophe mutants. This motivated investigation of several models of protein aggregation (heat shock induced Hsp104 aggregates, neurodegenerative proteins such as α-synuclein and HTT103Q) in ATP mutants. Furthermore, 2DG treatment was also applied to deplete ATP to induce Ubc9ts aggregate formation. However, the authors should be careful when interpreting these data. For example, the authors made use of 2DG in glucose depleted medium to abolish cellular ATP and concluded the Ubc9ts protein aggregates formation were due to ATP removal. However, these treatments can also lead to acidification of cytosol, and whether reduced cytosolic pH contributes to Ubc9ts aggregates formation remains untested. The authors should try buffering the extracellular media to 7.5 to investigate the effect of pH.</p></disp-quote><p>According to a genome-wide analysis of the intracellular pH of budding yeast cells, the deletion of <italic>SNF1</italic>, <italic>ADK1</italic>, or <italic>BAS1</italic> does not significantly alter cellular pH (Orij et al., 2012, <italic>Genome Biol.</italic>, 13 (9), R80).

On the other hand, comparing ATP levels in the same condition by QUEEN (WT cells compare Figure 1B and 1E), the WT mean absolute ATP concentration varies around 30%. These two datapoints are essentially biological replicates. This makes me wonder why the authors aren't presenting biological replicates for each experiment.</p></disp-quote><p>Many factors may affect the QUEEN ratio, including the physiological conditions of the cell culture, the batch of the culture medium, temperature, the power output of the fluorescence excitation lamp, and the conditions of optical filters (excitation, emission, and neutral density) for fluorescence microscopy. These factors slightly vary day to day independently of each other and, thus, the combination of their differences may produce a 30% difference in the mean QUEEN ratio even between the same strains. Therefore, we typically compare data obtained from experiments performed on the same day and within the same time zone, and refrain from pooling data from experiments performed on different days (<italic>i.e.</italic>, biological replicates).

According to early characterization of QUEEN sensor (Yaginuma et al. 2014), the measured 400ex/484ex ratio varies depending on the environmental pH and temperature.

It would be informative to provide detailed guidelines or conversion tables of the mean QUEEN ratio to absolute ATP concentration. In our opinion, the authors should perform a detailed QUEEN calibration protocol in a supplementary figure and in the Methods. There should be a calibration curve in S. cerevisiae cells, rather than reliance on prior results. The autofluorescence properties of S. cerevisiae could be quite distinct.</p></disp-quote><p>As mentioned in the response to comment #1, we assumed that intracellular pH in ATP mutant cells was nearly identical to that in wild-type cells (and bacterial cells). On the other hand, temperature was carefully controlled during the imaging of QUEEN signals because we know that at a temperature higher than 25℃, the QUEEN ratio appears to be low and the dynamic range of the QUEEN ratio narrows. The mean QUEEN ratio was converted to an absolute ATP concentration according to the previously reported procedure (Takaine et al., 2019, <italic>JCS</italic>; Takaine, 2019, <italic>Bio-protocol</italic>). We confirmed that the intensities of autofluorescence in yeast cells were at negligible levels to QUEEN fluorescence. We assumed that the calibration of ATP was appropriate because the estimated values were consistent with intracellular ATP concentrations calculated from biochemical measurements of ATP based on a cell volume of wild-type budding yeast cell of 42 µm<sup>3</sup> (Jorgensen et al., 2002, <italic>Science</italic>, 297 (5580), 395-400). Detailed guidelines and protocols regarding the QUEEN calibration are needed for future studies that require the more precise estimation of intracellular ATP levels.</p></body></sub-article></article>
