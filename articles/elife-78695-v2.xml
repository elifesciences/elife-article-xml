For paralogs that encode components of protein complexes such as the ribosome, a central question is whether they encode functionally distinct proteins or whether they exist to maintain appropriate total expression of equivalent proteins. Here, we systematically tested evolutionary models of paralog function using the ribosomal protein paralogs <italic>Rps27</italic> (<italic>eS27</italic>) and <italic>Rps27l</italic> (<italic>eS27L</italic>) as a case study. Evolutionary analysis suggests that <italic>Rps27</italic> and <italic>Rps27l</italic> likely arose during whole-genome duplication(s) in a common vertebrate ancestor. We show that <italic>Rps27</italic> and <italic>Rps27l</italic> have inversely correlated mRNA abundance across mouse cell types, with the highest <italic>Rps27</italic> in lymphocytes and the highest <italic>Rps27l</italic> in mammary alveolar cells and hepatocytes. By endogenously tagging the Rps27 and Rps27l proteins, we demonstrate that Rps27- and Rps27l-ribosomes associate preferentially with different transcripts. Furthermore, murine <italic>Rps27</italic> and <italic>Rps27l</italic> loss-of-function alleles are homozygous lethal at different developmental stages. However, strikingly, expressing Rps27 protein from the endogenous <italic>Rps27l</italic> locus or vice versa completely rescues loss-of-function lethality and yields mice with no detectable deficits. Together, these findings suggest that <italic>Rps27</italic> and <italic>Rps27l</italic> are evolutionarily retained because their subfunctionalized expression patterns render both genes necessary to achieve the requisite total expression of two equivalent proteins across cell types. Our work represents the most in-depth characterization of a mammalian ribosomal protein paralog to date and highlights the importance of considering both protein function and expression when investigating paralogs.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>gene duplication</kwd><kwd>ribosomal proteins</kwd><kwd>mRNA translation</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>F30HD100123</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Xu</surname><given-names>Adele Francis</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100011098</institution-id><institution>Stanford Bio-X</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Xu</surname><given-names>Adele Francis</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>5R01HG008140</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Pritchard</surname><given-names>Jonathan K</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100003194</institution-id><institution>New York Stem Cell Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NYSCF-R-I36</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Barna</surname><given-names>Maria</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01HD086634</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Barna</surname><given-names>Maria</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000879</institution-id><institution>Alfred P.

A variety of evolutionary models have been proposed to explain why some gene duplicates, or paralogs, become fixed in a population and conserved over long evolutionary time scales (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Conant and Wolfe, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Innan and Kondrashov, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Ohno, 1970</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Prince and Pickett, 2002</xref>). For some genes, an increase in copy number may be directly advantageous (beneficial dosage increase) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Innan and Kondrashov, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kondrashov et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Stark and Wahl, 1984</xref>). In other cases, duplication creates redundancy that relaxes the purifying selection on both paralogs. Such conditions may allow one paralog to evolve regulatory features for expressing in new contexts (neofunctionalized expression) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Force et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Sidow, 1996</xref>) or to encode a new gene product (i.e. a neofunctionalized protein) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Ohno, 1970</xref>). Rather than allow new functions, redundancy can alternatively allow paralogs to partially degenerate. If <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory features are included in a duplication, a newly formed paralog pair should initially exhibit symmetric expression. Under the relaxed selection, each may accumulate regulatory mutations of similar effect and continue expressing symmetrically at a lower total level, but often one paralog eventually degenerates more than the other (asymmetric expression) or undergoes nonfunctionalization altogether (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lan and Pritchard, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lynch and Conery, 2000</xref>). It is also possible for two paralogs’ regulatory features to undergo complementary degeneration such that each becomes the major source of expression in a different subset of the ancestral contexts (subfunctionalized expression) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Force et al., 1999</xref>). Symmetric, moderately asymmetric, or subfunctionalized expression can promote retention of paralogs if they engage in dosage sharing, a situation in which both paralogs are needed to achieve the necessary total expression of the gene product (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Force et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lan and Pritchard, 2016</xref>). Analogous to subfunctionalized expression, complementary degeneration of gene products (i.e. subfunctionalized proteins) can render both paralogs necessary to carry out the functions once performed by one ancestral gene product (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hughes, 1994</xref>). A final potential benefit of paralog retention is that one paralog may be able to compensate if the other paralog is disabled, thus conferring resilience against loss-of-function mutations (paralog buffering) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">De Kegel and Ryan, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gu et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Thompson et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>Comparing theoretical models to experimental data on real-world paralogs is critical to understanding how genomes evolve and to predicting the effects of polymorphisms or therapeutic interventions involving paralogous genes. In terms of observable features in present-day paralogs, the above models fall into two categories: either the paralogs evolve to encode distinct gene products or the expression of both paralogs becomes advantageous or necessary even if they encode similar gene products. Importantly, classic knockout, knockdown, and overexpression experiments cannot conclusively distinguish whether observed effects are caused by perturbing a function specific to one paralog’s gene product, or by altering total expression of two interchangeable gene products, or both. Instead, experimental designs that manipulate gene product characteristics without altering expression levels, or that isolate both gene products and their interactors from a source that expresses both paralogs, can help decouple the significance of expression level from that of divergent gene product characteristics. Editing an endogenous paralog gene to encode the gene product of the other paralog is an elegant approach of this nature that has occasionally been employed, as exemplified by previous work to substitute the exons of mouse <italic>Hoxa3</italic> for those of <italic>Hoxd3</italic> and vice versa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Greer et al., 2000</xref>), or to edit codons corresponding to differing residues between mouse actin paralogs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Patrinostro et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Vedula et al., 2017</xref>). Rigorous experimental design was especially important in these cases because organisms are sensitive to the expression levels of Hox and actin genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Greer et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Vedula et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Sensitivity to expression level is also often encountered in genes encoding components of protein complexes, some of which require expression of all components at balanced dosages to achieve effective assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Papp et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Taggart et al., 2020</xref>). However, it is also noteworthy that the functions of protein complexes can be modulated by incorporating alternative isoforms of their components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Antebi et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Raices and D’Angelo, 2012</xref>). It is thus especially important to determine whether paralogs of protein complex components serve as necessary sources of expression, as functionally distinct proteins, or both. In particular, growing interest surrounds the paralogs of genes that encode the protein components of the ribosome, the ubiquitous macromolecular complex that catalyzes translation of all protein-coding transcripts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Genuth and Barna, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gerst, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Komili et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Topisirovic and Sonenberg, 2011</xref>). In mammals, each ribosome consists of 80 ribosomal proteins (RPs) and 4 ribosomal RNAs (rRNAs), which together form a 40S small subunit and a 60S large subunit that join during translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Anger et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Uechi et al., 2001</xref>). Each RP is encoded by a different genomic locus. Ten of these RP genes are known to exist as paralog pairs in the human genome, several of which are conserved among other mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Balasubramanian et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gupta and Warner, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Nakao et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Sugihara et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>Two main categories of hypotheses could explain why some duplicated RP genes have been evolutionarily conserved. The first category posits that RP paralogs have diverged in their protein functions: they may have acquired distinct extraribosomal functions, which have been observed previously for certain RPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Warner and McIntosh, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Zhang et al., 2017b</xref>), or they may encode alternative RP isoforms that assemble to form ribosomes with different translational characteristics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gerst, 2018</xref>). The latter possibility is especially intriguing, given that other variations in ribosome composition have been observed to affect protein synthesis or modulate the translation of specific genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Genuth and Barna, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Xue and Barna, 2012</xref>). Studies in yeast, in which 59 of the 79 RP genes exist as paralog pairs, have motivated speculation that functionally distinct RP paralogs are a major component of translational gene regulation through the formation of ribosomes that are heterogeneous in composition, a model known as the ‘ribosome code’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ghulam et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Komili et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Parenteau et al., 2015</xref>). Conversely, one could propose a second category of hypotheses that RP paralogs do not encode functionally distinct proteins, but are rather retained because their expression has become necessary. This possibility would be consistent with observations suggesting that, for paralogs in general, retention due to expression may be more common than divergence of protein function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Prince and Pickett, 2002</xref>). Such observations include systems-level analysis showing that paralogs found throughout fungal genomes rarely change gene ontologies or protein interaction networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Wapinski et al., 2007</xref>), and experimental demonstrations for individual genes such as Hox paralogs that suggest equivalent protein function despite distinct expression patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bruce et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Greer et al., 2000</xref>).</p><p>In this work, we systematically examine these two categories of hypotheses in the case of the RP paralogs <italic>Rps27</italic> and <italic>Rps27l</italic> (known in standardized RP nomenclature as <italic>eS27</italic> and <italic>eS27L</italic>, respectively <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Ban et al., 2014</xref>).

However, the study of <italic>Rps27</italic> and <italic>Rps27l</italic> is complicated by the consideration that impaired ribosome biogenesis due to perturbed dosage balance of other RPs has also been shown to activate <italic>Trp53</italic> via nucleolar stress or translation inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Nicolas et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Russo and Russo, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Zhang and Lu, 2009</xref>).

Next, we examined single-cell transcriptomics of normal mouse tissues and found previously unreported cell type-specific patterns of <italic>Rps27</italic> and <italic>Rps27l</italic> expression. We confirmed that the Rps27 and Rps27l proteins are incorporated into ribosomes and used endogenously epitope-tagged Rps27 and Rps27l combined with immunoprecipitation and ribosome profiling to examine whether Rps27l- and Rps27l-ribosomes associate with different transcripts. We then examined the functions of <italic>Rps27</italic> and <italic>Rps27l</italic> at an organismal level by first generating loss-of-function alleles for each gene and, most importantly, generating ‘homogenized’ mouse lines in which the <italic>Rps27</italic> locus has been edited to encode the Rps27l protein, or vice versa. Finally, we performed a detailed characterization of the homogenized mouse lines with particular attention to the cell types that preferentially express one paralog and also examined the effects of paralog homogenization on aging and response to genotoxic stress.</p><p>In sum, investigating the functions of RP paralogs is valuable for elucidating the evolutionary fates of paralogs that encode components of protein complexes and may shed light on the potential role of paralogs in the ribosome code. Such work demands careful distinctions between the possibility that paralogs encode functionally distinct proteins, as opposed to the possibility that they provide expression of similar proteins. With close attention to these challenges, we present here the most in-depth profiling of a mammalian RP paralog to date, in which we have leveraged single-cell transcriptomics, molecular assays, and mouse genetics to comprehensively examine the above hypotheses regarding paralog function in the case of <italic>Rps27</italic> and <italic>Rps27l</italic>.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title><italic>Rps27</italic> and <italic>Rps27l</italic> are vertebrate ohnologs encoding highly conserved proteins</title><p>To guide our functional analysis of <italic>Rps27</italic> and <italic>Rps27l</italic>, we first considered their probable evolutionary trajectory by examining their gene structure, intraspecies synteny, and interspecies molecular phylogeny.

While none of the nine included invertebrates had more than one <italic>Rps27</italic> ortholog, nearly all vertebrates had two <italic>Rps27</italic> paralogs, and most teleost fish species had three to six (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>).

Interestingly, it has long been hypothesized that at least one WGD occurred in a common ancestor of all vertebrates (‘1R’), followed closely by either a second WGD (‘2R’) with subsequent loss of many duplicates or by several large segmental duplications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dehal and Boore, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Nakatani et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Ohno, 1970</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Sacerdot et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Simakov et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Smith et al., 2018</xref>). Indeed, in systematic efforts to map 1R/2R remnants throughout vertebrate genomes based on phylogeny and large-scale synteny (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Makino and McLysaght, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Sacerdot et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Singh and Isambert, 2020</xref>), <italic>Rps27</italic> and <italic>Rps27l</italic> are consistently identified among the ‘ohnolog’ gene duplicates that still comprise 25–35% of present-day vertebrate genes. Furthermore, a third WGD occurred in the common ancestor to teleost fish. Carp and salmon, which each have six <italic>Rps27</italic> paralogs, have each experienced an independent fourth WGD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Macqueen and Johnston, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Xu et al., 2019</xref>). Thus, increases in the number of <italic>Rps27</italic> paralogs coincide in evolutionary timing with WGDs.</p><p>The probable evolutionary trajectory of <italic>Rps27</italic> and <italic>Rps27l</italic> should also be considered in relation to other RPs: in fungi, genes encoding protein complexes such as the ribosome often remain duplicated after WGD but rarely duplicate on an individual basis. This observation supports a model that assumes dosage balance is required between components of a protein complex, such that duplicating one gene would cause a deleterious imbalance but simultaneously duplicating all the components would maintain balance and favor initial retention of the resulting paralogs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Papp et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Wapinski et al., 2007</xref>). Notably, most RPs in present-day mammalian genomes are encoded by a single gene; there are only 10 known human RP paralog pairs, several of which have hallmarks of tandem duplication or retrotransposition rather than WGD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gupta and Warner, 2014</xref>). Two evolutionary trajectories are thus possible: either all RP genes were duplicated via WGD and <italic>Rps27</italic> is one of the few that did not eventually revert to a single gene through nonfunctionalization of one duplicate, or a smaller-scale duplication occurred for <italic>Rps27</italic> alone and survived despite initial excess dosage. Based on the above evidence that <italic>Rps27</italic> and <italic>Rps27l</italic> are vertebrate-specific, we consider 1R/2R WGD to be the more parsimonious explanation for their origin.</p><p>Based on these evolutionary features of <italic>Rps27</italic> and <italic>Rps27l</italic>, we can preliminarily assess the relevance of the proposed paralog retention models. Given the evidence from fungi that RP genes are subject to dosage balance constraints, beneficial dosage increase and neofunctionalized expression are less likely models of paralog retention in this case. However, the other proposed models all remain plausible. In contrast to tandem duplications in which both paralogs reside near the same regulatory features (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lan and Pritchard, 2016</xref>) or transpositions that introduce a duplicate into a completely different regulatory context, WGD produces duplicates on separate chromosomes with initially identical regulatory features that may then diverge. Notably, while the coding sequences of <italic>Rps27</italic> and <italic>Rps27l</italic> are highly divergent, almost all substitutions are synonymous and their protein sequences only differ by three N-terminal residues out of a total of 84: K5R, P12L, and R17K. These differences between the two paralogous proteins are well-conserved among mammals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). This high degree of protein sequence conservation over a long evolutionary history suggests that the proteins still perform related molecular roles in the cell and could thus participate in dosage sharing or paralog buffering. On the other hand, the three differing residues could confer partially distinct protein functions by affecting protein structure or post-translational modifications. Thus, we proceeded to compare both the expression patterns and the protein characteristics of <italic>Rps27</italic> and <italic>Rps27l</italic>.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title><italic>Rps27</italic> and <italic>Rps27l</italic> mRNA expression are cell type-dependent</title><p>We next leveraged publicly available single-cell RNA-seq datasets to compare expression levels of <italic>Rps27</italic>, <italic>Rps27l</italic>, and other RP genes in previously unexamined primary cell types. Different cell types express RP genes at different levels, likely reflecting the ribosome production rate needed to accommodate each cell type’s translational or proliferative demands. However, transcript abundance among the core RP genes is highly correlated across cell types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref>), which is consistent with the theory that components of a protein complex must have balanced expression for effective assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Guimaraes and Zavolan, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Papp et al., 2003</xref>).

from in vitro cultured mouse cells and focused on comparing the mRNAs with which they associate. To enable isolation of Rps27- and Rps27l-ribosomes without overexpressing an exogenous epitope-tagged construct, we used CRISPR to homozygously insert 3xFLAG epitope tags immediately preceding the stop codon at the <italic>Rps27</italic> and <italic>Rps27l</italic> loci (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). This approach yielded three independently selected clones (biological replicates) of <italic>Rps27-FLAG</italic> mESCs and three of <italic>Rps27l-FLAG</italic> mESCs. Rps27- and Rps27l-FLAG proteins are expressed at comparable levels to the untagged proteins and are incorporated into actively translating ribosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B and C</xref>). We confirmed by western blot that anti-FLAG immunoprecipitation (FLAG-IP) efficiently enriches for Rps27- and Rps27l-ribosomes from the <italic>Rps27-FLAG</italic> and <italic>Rps27l-FLAG</italic> mESCs, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1D</xref>). Minimal Rps27 is detected when targeting Rps27l for pulldown and vice versa, confirming that a ribosome does not simultaneously contain Rps27 and Rps27l and that we did not isolate undigested polysomes containing multiple ribosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1D</xref>). We then performed ribosome profiling on the total ribosome population in each line and on the paralog-containing ribosomes isolated via FLAG-IP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). Ribosome profiling identifies mRNA regions occupied by ribosomes, using RNAse digestion to enable sequencing of ribosome-protected fragments of mRNA (RPFs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Ingolia et al., 2009</xref>). The total RPFs from the two FLAG-tagged cell lines did not contain mRNAs that differed significantly in abundance either in comparison between the <italic>Rps27-FLAG</italic> line and <italic>Rps27l-FLAG</italic> line or in comparison to a passage-matched wild-type (WT) control line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1E</xref>). This confirms that FLAG-tagging did not alter the landscape of normally translated mRNAs. We then compared the IP RPFs from both cell lines to each other using the total RPFs from each clone to normalize for its overall translational landscape (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E and F</xref>). After excluding a <italic>Tmod3</italic> transcript as a likely artifact of FLAG-IP (Appendix 1, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig1">Appendix 1—figure 1</xref>), we identified 8 transcripts enriched among Rps27-ribosomes and 46 transcripts enriched among Rps27l-ribosomes (absolute value of log<sub>2</sub> fold change &gt; 0.25, false discovery rate &lt; 0.05; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>). Among the latter set of transcripts, Gene Ontology terms associated with cell cycle processes were enriched (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>). These findings intriguingly demonstrated that Rps27- and Rps27l-ribosomes associate differently with specific mRNAs.</p><p>Importantly, our experimental design minimized the possibility that these results reflect translational changes due to genetically editing the cell lines: no knockdown, knockouts, or overexpression were used, and the IP RPF transcript abundances were normalized by the total RPF transcript abundances for each clone. A critical consideration, however, is that this approach demonstrates a correlation between Rps27l incorporation and ribosome association with cell cycle-related transcripts, but it does not directly demonstrate that Rps27l causes ribosomes to preferentially bind these transcripts. To definitively compare the functions of the two proteins, we next turned to in vivo approaches.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title><italic>Rps27</italic> and <italic>Rps27l</italic> homozygous knockouts are lethal at different developmental stages</title><p>To compare <italic>Rps27</italic> and <italic>Rps27l</italic> in vivo, we first examined the organism-level effects of knocking out each paralog.

these <italic>Rps27<sup>exon2del</sup></italic> and <italic>Rps27l<sup>exon2del</sup></italic> loss-of-function alleles yield several preliminary insights on the possible roles of these RP paralogs in vivo. The fact that <italic>Rps27</italic> and <italic>Rps27l</italic> loss-of-function alleles are each lethal in homozygosity, even with both alleles of the other paralog intact, disfavors the hypothesis that <italic>Rps27</italic> and <italic>Rps27l</italic> engage in paralog buffering. The difference in the timing of lethality could be consistent with the two proteins having distinct functions; under such a model, it would appear that Rps27 protein has a critical function in very early developmental processes, while the functions of Rps27l protein are dispensable until postnatal stages. Divergent protein function could also explain why an increase in Rps27 protein is insufficient to rescue the <italic>Rps27l<sup>exon2del / exon2del</sup></italic> genotype. However, divergent protein function is not the only possible explanation for either of these observations: the timing difference could also be explained by early reliance on expression from the <italic>Rps27</italic> locus, whereas this dependence later shifts to expression of an equivalent protein from the <italic>Rps27l</italic> locus. If the regulatory characteristics of <italic>Rps27</italic> and <italic>Rps27l</italic> are sufficiently dissimilar, it may be impossible for one paralog to compensate for the other’s loss of function in specific cell types. Therefore, with the evidence presented thus far, it remains possible that Rps27 and Rps27l are functionally identical proteins, and that the <italic>Rps27l<sup>exon2del / exon2del</sup></italic> genotype is lethal because the quantity of Rps27 increase is insufficient to compensate for the Rps27l deficiency.</p><p>Previous work has shown that the early postnatal lethality of <italic>Rps27l<sup>GT/GT</sup></italic> can be rescued on a <italic>Trp53</italic> loss-of-function (<italic>Trp53<sup>LOF/+</sup></italic> or <italic>Trp53<sup>LOF/LOF</sup></italic>) background. This finding was attributed to a model in which <italic>Rps27l</italic> depletion impairs ribosome biogenesis and thus causes accumulation of unincorporated RPs, which increase <italic>Trp53</italic> activity by blocking its degradation by Mdm2. The increased Trp53 triggers apoptosis in hematopoietic tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Xiong et al., 2014</xref>). We thus crossed the <italic>Rps27<sup>exon2del</sup></italic> and <italic>Rps27l<sup>exon2del</sup></italic> mice to <italic>Trp53<sup>null</sup></italic> mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Jacks et al., 1994</xref>). We indeed found that <italic>Rps27l<sup>exon2del / exon2del</sup>;Trp53<sup>null / +</sup></italic> mice are viable. However, no <italic>Rps27<sup>exon2del / exon2del</sup>;Trp53<sup>null / +</sup></italic> or <italic>Rps27<sup>exon2del / exon2del</sup>;Trp53<sup>null / null</sup></italic> offspring were recovered from crossing <italic>Rps27<sup>exon2del / +</sup>;Trp53<sup>null / +</sup></italic> males and females (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>). These results suggest that disabling expression from the <italic>Rps27</italic> locus disrupts ribosome biogenesis either to a greater degree than <italic>Rps27l</italic> that cannot be mitigated by <italic>Trp53</italic> depletion or through a non-<italic>Trp53</italic>-mediated mechanism.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Rps27 and Rps27l proteins are functionally interchangeable across all examined murine tissues</title><p>Having demonstrated that expression of both <italic>Rps27</italic> and <italic>Rps27l</italic> is essential to development at different stages, we next asked whether Rps27 protein can rescue loss of Rps27l protein, and vice versa, at the whole-organism level. This test is critical to understanding whether the two paralogs’ gene products are functionally interchangeable, especially in light of the above finding that the <italic>Rps27l<sup>exon2del / exon2del</sup></italic> genotype is early postnatal lethal despite an increased amount of Rps27 protein. In order to do so rigorously, it was ideal to express the swapped protein sequences from the endogenous genomic loci with minimal perturbation to the regulatory contexts. Using CRISPR in mouse embryos, we minimally edited the endogenous genomic loci for <italic>Rps27</italic> and <italic>Rps27l</italic> to encode the protein sequence of the other paralog. This yielded two novel mouse alleles: <italic>Rps27<sup>Rps27l</sup></italic>, which expresses Rps27l protein from the <italic>Rps27</italic> locus; and <italic>Rps27l<sup>Rps27</sup></italic>, which expresses Rps27 protein from the <italic>Rps27l</italic> locus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A and B</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Homogenized <italic>Rps27</italic> and <italic>Rps27l</italic> alleles in mice exhibit normal genotype ratios and early development.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) CRISPR editing to generate <italic>Rps27<sup>Rps27l</sup></italic> and <italic>Rps27l<sup>Rps27</sup></italic> homogenized mice.

Remarkably, heterozygous crosses for both alleles (<italic>Rps27<sup>Rps27l /+</sup></italic> × <italic>Rps27<sup>Rps27l /+</sup></italic>, and <italic>Rps27l<sup>Rps27 /+</sup></italic> × <italic>Rps27l<sup>Rps27 /+</sup></italic>) resulted in normal genotype frequencies among offspring of both sexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). Western blots of adult mouse tissues confirmed loss of Rps27 protein and increased Rps27l protein in <italic>Rps27<sup>Rps27l / Rps27l</sup></italic> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D and E</xref>). This effect is most pronounced in the spleen, which contains abundant B cells, one of the cell types that highly express the <italic>Rps27</italic> locus as shown above (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Likewise, loss of Rps27l protein expression with concurrently increased Rps27 protein was observed in <italic>Rps27lRps27<sup>Rps27 / Rps27</sup></italic> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D and E</xref>) and the effect is most pronounced in liver tissue, which contains hepatocytes that highly express the <italic>Rps27l</italic> locus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2E</xref>). This demonstrates that expressing Rps27 from the <italic>Rps27l</italic> locus completely rescues the early lethality observed upon homozygous truncation of <italic>Rps27l</italic>, and vice versa. Later organism fitness was also rescued: pups of all genotypes gained weight at similar rates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>), and male and female heterozygous and homozygous mice are viable to at least 1 year of age and are fertile. A detailed necropsy of homozygous 10–16-week-old males and age-matched wild-type controls, performed by a veterinary pathologist blinded to specimen genotype, revealed no clinically significant differences in gross organ weight, gross organ morphology, or tissue histology for either line (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref>) upon examination of neurological, cardiovascular, respiratory, gastrointestinal, genitourinary, lymphatic, endocrine, hematopoietic, integumentary, and musculoskeletal tissues.</p><p>Given the cell type-specific patterns of <italic>Rps27</italic> and <italic>Rps27l</italic> mRNA levels that we have described above, it was important to explore whether a functional difference between the Rps27 and Rps27l proteins might only be apparent in tissues that preferentially express one paralog or the other. The top cell types of interest included mammary alveolar cells and hepatocytes, which have a high <italic>Rps27l:Rps27</italic> ratio; and B, T, and NK cells, which have a low ratio (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). We, therefore, devoted additional effort to characterizing the mammary gland, liver, and hematopoietic organs. A liver panel and complete blood count were performed on the 10–16-week-old male necropsy specimens to survey for anomalies in liver function or hematopoiesis. These yielded no clinically significant differences between genotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp5">Supplementary file 5</xref>). To assess the mammary gland, we focused on the pregnancy and lactation stages because precursors to alveolar cells emerge and mature during these stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Macias and Hinck, 2012</xref>), and because we had detected fluctuations in <italic>Rps27</italic> and <italic>Rps27l</italic> mRNA abundance in bulk tissues from these timepoints relative to nulliparous samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E and F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2D and E</xref>). We first tracked pup weight gain as a metric of mammary gland function. Nulliparous littermate-matched females at 8 weeks of age were housed with stud males and separated from the males before parturition. Since genetically manipulated mouse lines can exhibit lactation failure at a range of timepoints (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Palmer et al., 2006</xref>), litter size and pup weight were assessed at P4, P13, and P21 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>).

It has previously been reported that <italic>Trp53</italic> differentially regulates <italic>Rps27</italic> and <italic>Rps27l</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">He and Sun, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Li et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Xiong et al., 2011</xref>). Furthermore, Rps27 and Rps27l proteins reportedly bind and regulate the <italic>Trp53</italic>-regulating ubiquitin ligase Mdm2 with different affinity in vitro, and thus may form distinct feedback loops impacting <italic>Trp53</italic> activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Xiong et al., 2011</xref>). Even though the expression patterns of <italic>Rps27</italic> and <italic>Rps27l</italic> that we observed are not likely driven by <italic>Trp53</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A and B</xref>), we hypothesized that functional differences between the Rps27 and Rps27 proteins might be revealed under the types of genotoxic or cell cycle-related stress conditions for which <italic>Trp53</italic> is classically a master regulator of response. We isolated mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) from homozygous, heterozygous, and wild-type mice of the <italic>Rps27<sup>Rps27l</sup></italic> and <italic>Rps27l<sup>Rps27</sup></italic> lineages. We first analyzed their distribution across cell cycle phases when cultured in vitro and found that MEFs of all genotypes had similar frequency in each phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). We then treated them with varying doses of doxorubicin and etoposide, two chemotherapeutic drugs that induce DNA damage and consequently activate <italic>Trp53</italic>. The number of viable and metabolically active cells was assessed after 24–48 hr of drug treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). Higher doses of doxorubicin and etoposide consistently resulted in decreased cell viability, yet the same degree of effect was seen across all genotypes. Thus, for the purposes of cellular survival and proliferation under doxorubicin or etoposide treatment, the Rps27 and Rps27l proteins also appear to be interchangeable.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In this work, we set out to test two categories of hypotheses regarding the evolutionary retention of a mammalian RP paralog pair: either that the paralogs encode functionally distinct proteins or that their essentiality is due to dosage sharing or paralog buffering. We observed that <italic>Rps27</italic> and <italic>Rps27l</italic> mRNA abundance is inversely correlated and cell type-dependent across healthy mouse tissues, showed that Rps27- and Rps27l-ribosomes differentially associate with transcripts of cell cycle-related genes, and demonstrated that loss-of-function alleles of <italic>Rps27</italic> and <italic>Rps27l</italic> are both homozygous lethal but manifest at different developmental stages. Based on these findings, divergent protein functions and dosage sharing through subfunctionalized expression were both plausible reasons for <italic>Rps27</italic> and <italic>Rps27l</italic> conservation, while paralog buffering was not. Ultimately, after extensive examination of <italic>Rps27<sup>Rps27l</sup></italic> and <italic>Rps27l<sup>Rps27</sup></italic> mice, we concluded that the Rps27 and Rps27l proteins are functionally interchangeable. Together, these results suggest that <italic>Rps27</italic> and <italic>Rps27l</italic>, which most likely arose alongside other RP gene duplicates during a whole-genome duplication, have been evolutionarily retained because the divergence of their expression patterns has resulted in both genes becoming necessary for achieving adequate total expression of the RP across cell types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>).</p><fig id="fig8" position="float"><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Comparison of empirical <italic>Rps27</italic> and <italic>Rps27l</italic> characteristics with hypothesized evolutionary trajectories.</title><p>Yellow boxes indicate the most likely trajectory for <italic>Rps27</italic> and <italic>Rps27l</italic>. In brief, a whole-genome duplication (WGD) during early vertebrate evolution duplicated all RP genes. This mechanism is probable because the maintained dosage balance between RPs would have promoted initial preservation of duplicates. While most RP genes then reverted to single genes via nonfunctionalization of one paralog, some paralog pairs evolved features that promoted retention. Immediately after duplication, <italic>Rps27</italic> and <italic>Rps27l</italic> probably had similar regulatory elements and thus would have expressed symmetrically, but our findings suggest that <italic>Rps27</italic> and <italic>Rps27l</italic> now exhibit subfunctionalized expression that renders both paralogs necessary to achieve the requisite total expression of this RP. We found no evidence of functional differences between <italic>Rps27</italic> and <italic>Rps27l</italic> protein, nor successful compensation by either paralog for a loss-of-function of the other. Not pictured here are neofunctionalized expression and beneficial dosage increase; while these modes of paralog retention have been observed for other genes, they are less relevant for RP paralogs if it is assumed that excess dosage of an individual RP gene is not advantageous. *Symmetric expression frequently shifts towards asymmetric expression, which can be an intermediate state towards nonfunctionalization of the minor paralog.</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-78695-fig8-v2.tif"/></fig><p>Several questions arise when considering the in vivo homogenized mouse outcomes alongside the molecular findings reported here and in previous literature. We detected preferential association of Rps27- or Rps27l-ribosomes with cell cycle-related transcripts, yet replacing Rps27 protein with Rps27l and vice versa had no detectable impact on cell cycle progression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). One explanation is that Rps27- and Rps27l-ribosomes may have cell cycle-dependent abundance and therefore differentially encounter cyclically expressed transcripts, a consideration that remains to be addressed in future work. Another possibility is that Rps27 and Rps27l proteins do affect ribosome affinity for specific transcripts, but other pathways compensate to maintain a normal cell cycle in homogenized cells.</p><p>From previous literature, some evidence may suggest that Rps27 and Rps27l do have distinct protein functions, especially in <italic>Trp53</italic>-related signaling pathways and apoptotic processes resulting from genotoxic stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">He and Sun, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Li et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Xiong et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Xiong et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Zhao et al., 2018</xref>). Depletion or overexpression of <italic>Rps27l</italic> was reported to impact <italic>Trp53</italic> activity differently than <italic>Rps27</italic> depletion or overexpression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Xiong et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Xiong et al., 2011</xref>). Purified Rps27 and Rps27l protein bind the <italic>Trp53</italic> ubiquitin ligase Mdm2 in vitro with different affinity and are degraded by Mdm2 at different rates, which depends on the N-terminal portion of Rps27 and Rps27l where the differing residues reside (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Xiong et al., 2011</xref>). Also, knockdown of <italic>Rps27l</italic> but not <italic>Rps27</italic> was reported to reduce the levels of DNA repair proteins FANCD2 and FANCI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Sun et al., 2020</xref>). However, in our comparison of WT and homogenized cells under genotoxic stimuli known to activate the <italic>Trp53-Mdm2</italic> axis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>), we did not detect any differences in cell survival that would suggest functional divergence between the Rps27 and Rps27l proteins. We acknowledge the possibility that the two proteins could have distinct functions under environmental conditions not tested here or that the effects of homogenization are masked by compensation in other cellular pathways. Nevertheless, the normal physiology of both homogenized mouse lines until at least 9–10 months of age suggests that total expression of <italic>Rps27</italic> and <italic>Rps27l</italic> impacts in vivo fitness more so than differences in protein characteristics. Importantly, our findings regarding homogenization involved no knockdown, knockout, or overexpression of RPs, thereby minimizing any indirect effects of perturbing RP expression.</p><p>The conclusion that <italic>Rps27</italic> and <italic>Rps27l</italic> likely persisted across evolution due to dosage sharing emphasizes the principle that distinct protein sequences and distinct expression patterns do not always indicate a paralog with tissue-specific protein functions. With the greater ease of genetic editing afforded by CRISPR, it would be fascinating to apply the endogenous epitope tagging and homogenization approaches used here to other mammalian RP paralogs that also have tissue- or cell type-dependent expression. <italic>Rpl3l</italic> (<italic>uL3L</italic>), for example, is an RP paralog that only expresses in skeletal and cardiac myocytes, where <italic>Rpl3</italic> (<italic>uL3</italic>) is not expressed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Guimaraes and Zavolan, 2016</xref>). While knockdowns and knockouts of <italic>Rpl3l</italic> in cells and mice have been characterized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chaillou et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kao et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Milenkovic et al., 2021</xref>), a homogenized <italic>Rpl3l<sup>Rpl3</sup></italic> mouse allele would be invaluable for determining whether Rpl3l-ribosomes have myocyte-specific functions. As another example, <italic>Rpl10l</italic> (<italic>uL16L</italic>) and <italic>Rpl39l</italic> (<italic>eL39L</italic>) are mainly expressed in the testes and likely compensate during spermatogenesis for their respective progenitor genes, <italic>Rpl10</italic> (<italic>uL16</italic>) and <italic>Rpl39</italic> (<italic>eL39</italic>); the latter are encoded on the X chromosome and are therefore not expressed after meiotic X chromosome inactivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Guimaraes and Zavolan, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Sugihara et al., 2010</xref>). Knockouts of each have been characterized in vivo and in vitro, respectively: exogenous expression of <italic>Rpl10</italic> partially rescues spermatogenesis in the <italic>Rpl10L</italic> knockout (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Jiang et al., 2017</xref>), whereas <italic>Rpl39L</italic> knockout in vivo also impairs spermatogenesis, and in vitro Rpl39L knockout with attempted rescue by <italic>Rpl39</italic> overexpression suggests that the <italic>Rpl39</italic> paralogs are non-interchangeable with respect to functions related to nascent peptide folding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Li et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Zou and Qi, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Zou et al., 2021</xref>). In both cases, a homogenization approach would aid in determining whether the residual functional defect is because the rescue does not precisely recapitulate the endogenous expression pattern of the deleted paralog or because the overexpressed paralog lacks some specific function performed by the depleted protein. It is important to note that the properties of <italic>Rps27</italic> and <italic>Rps27l</italic> observed here do not necessarily extend to all mammalian RP paralogs, and that some mammalian RP paralog pairs, such as <italic>Rpl3/Rpl3l</italic> and <italic>Rpl22</italic>/<italic>Rpl22l</italic> (<italic>eL22/eL22L</italic>), have more differences in amino acid sequence than <italic>Rps27/Rps27l</italic>. Our work reinforces the importance of directly comparing protein function between RP paralogs in an endogenous context.</p><p>Lastly, our findings raise questions about the two <italic>Rps27</italic> copies that have long been asked about gene duplication in general: Did the ancestral <italic>Rps27</italic> have some characteristic that led to its duplication and preservation? Is the existence of two copies with divergent expression but equivalent proteins evolutionarily beneficial? Or did their preservation and cell type-dependent expression patterns result from genetic drift without adaptive selection? It should first be noted that gene duplication is common (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lynch and Conery, 2000</xref>), and that few duplicates persist while most degrade. It should also be noted that not all gene features arising during evolution are necessarily beneficial, and that neutral evolution may play a large role in determining which duplicates persist and how their regulatory elements evolve (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Lynch, 2007</xref>). RPs, in general, may have a propensity for paralog retention: in <italic>Paramecium</italic> and yeast, for example, duplicates of highly translated genes or components of protein complexes often persist, including ribosome, histone, or cytoskeleton proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Aury et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Wapinski et al., 2007</xref>). Among present-day mammalian RPs, however, existing as a paralog pair puts <italic>Rps27</italic> in the minority. A final curious observation that we (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) and others have made is that, in teleost fish species that underwent 3R and 4R WGD, more than four <italic>Rps27</italic> copies have been reported, whereas most other RPs have reverted to fewer copies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kuang et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Manchado et al., 2007</xref>). Is there something about <italic>Rps27</italic> that causes its paralogs to persist when other RP paralogs generated by WGD do not? Perhaps it is advantageous to have multiple copies whose expression could be more finely regulated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Greer et al., 2000</xref>) or perhaps the ancestral Rps27 protein was already pleiotropic in its expression or protein function and was thus amenable to divergence into two genes with different expression and possibly subtle protein differences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Conant and Wolfe, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Prince and Pickett, 2002</xref>). More work is needed to further probe the evolution and function of mammalian RP paralogs, and to provide additional comparisons between theoretical and experimental perspectives on paralog evolution. As a paradigm, the studies we report here set the groundwork for future investigation of RP paralog function.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom">Reagent type (species) or resource</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Designation</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Source or reference</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Identifiers</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Gene (<italic>Mus musculus</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><italic>Rps27</italic> (<italic>eS27</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Ensembl version 109</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">ENSMUSG00000090733</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Gene (<italic>M. musculus</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><italic>Rps27l</italic> (<italic>eS27L</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Ensembl version 109</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">ENSMUSG00000036781</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Gene (<italic>Homo sapiens</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><italic>RPS27</italic> (<italic>eS27</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Ensembl version 109</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">ENSG00000177954</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Gene (<italic>H. sapiens</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><italic>RPS27L</italic> (<italic>eS27L</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Ensembl version 109</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">ENSG00000185088</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Gene (multiple species)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><italic>Rps27</italic> and <italic>Rps27l</italic> orthologs</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Multiple</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="left" valign="bottom">See <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref> for full details</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Strain, strain background (<italic>M. musculus</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><italic>Rps27<sup>exon2del</sup></italic>, C57BL/6J</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">This paper</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="left" valign="bottom">See ‘Generation of genetically edited mouse lines,’ <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp7">Supplementary file 7</xref></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Strain, strain background (<italic>M. musculus</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><italic>Rps27l<sup>exon2del</sup></italic>, C57BL/6J</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">This paper</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="left" valign="bottom">See ‘Generation of genetically edited mouse lines,’ <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp7">Supplementary file 7</xref></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Strain, strain background (<italic>M. musculus</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><italic>Rps27<sup>Rps27l</sup></italic>, C57BL/6J</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">This paper</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="left" valign="bottom">See ‘Generation of genetically edited mouse lines,’ <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp7">Supplementary file 7</xref></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Strain, strain background (<italic>M. musculus</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><italic>Rps27l<sup>Rps27</sup></italic>, C57BL/6J</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">This paper</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="left" valign="bottom">See ‘Generation of genetically edited mouse lines,’ <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp7">Supplementary file 7</xref></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Strain, strain background (<italic>M. musculus</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><italic>Trp53<sup>null</sup></italic>, C57BL/6J</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Jackson Laboratories <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1016/s0960-9822(00)00002-6">https://doi.org/10.1016/s0960-9822(00)00002-6</ext-link></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Strain #002101;

Each 20 nt gRNA sequence was each cloned into a PX459 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Ran et al., 2013</xref>) (Addgene 62988, Watertown, MA) backbone digested with BbsI (Thermo FD1014), with a single upstream G nucleotide preceding the gRNA sequence since this has been shown to improve cutting efficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Ran et al., 2013</xref>). To construct the homology-directed repair template, the sequence between the two gRNA cut sites was cloned along with 300 bp homology arms on each end. Immediately preceding the stop codon in the repair template, a sequence was inserted to encode a 2xGGGS linker and a 3xFLAG peptide. The gRNA recognition sites or protospacer adjacent motifs (PAM) on the repair template were modified at silent coding positions or non-coding positions with low evolutionary conservation to prevent cutting of the repair template or of the repaired genomic DNA. To deliver the repair template, an unmodified PAM and gRNA recognition sequence were appended to each end of the repair template, distal to the homology arms. Distal to the appended gRNA and PAM sequences on each side, 10 additional bases were appended to buffer against small deletions that occur with TOPO cloning. This construct was then inserted into a non-expressing pCR4Blunt-TOPO backbone (Thermo Fisher 450031) such that the Cas9-gRNAs expressed from the PX459 plasmids would cleave the repair template as a linear dsDNA from the circular pCR4Blunt-TOPO plasmid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Zhang et al., 2017a</xref>).</p><p>At passage number 28, 10<sup>6</sup> mESCs were transfected with the two PX459-based plasmids harboring a Cas9-puromycin fusion construct and gRNAs flanking the targeted exon (0.5 µg each), and one pCR4Blunt-TOPO-based plasmid harboring the linearizable repair template (2 µg) (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp7">Supplementary file 7</xref> for sequences). The three combined plasmids were diluted in 100 µL Opti-MEM Reduced Serum Medium (Thermo Fisher 11058021). In parallel, 7.5 µL of Lipofectamine 2000 (Thermo Fisher 11668-019) was diluted in 100 µL Opti-MEM. The plasmid/Opti-MEM and Lipofectamine/Opti-MEM were combined and incubated for 20 min at room temperature. Cells were trypsinized as described above, resuspended in 250 µL Opti-MEM, added to the plasmid-Lipofectamine complexes for 10 min at room temperature, and plated into one 12-well. Media was changed after 4 hr. At 24 hr after transfection, cells were treated with media containing 1 µg/mL puromycin (Millipore P8833). At 48 hr after transfection, fresh media containing puromycin was changed in. At 72 hr after transfection, puromycin-free media was changed in.

Comparing IP RPFs to total RPFs for both the <italic>Rps27-FLAG</italic> and <italic>Rps27l-FLAG</italic> mESC lines, we detected that <italic>Tmod3</italic> mRNA was more enriched than other transcripts in the IP RPFs for both lines. This enrichment was more pronounced for the <italic>Rps27l-FLAG</italic> line than for <italic>Rps27-FLAG</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig1">Appendix 1—figure 1A</xref>). Interestingly, Tmod3 protein is frequently reported as a contaminant of FLAG IPs in the mass spectrometry CRAPome, a repository of proteins that are non-specifically detected across many affinity purification experiments with different baits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Mellacheruvu et al., 2013</xref>). We inspected the amino acid sequence of <italic>Tmod3</italic> and found that it contains a sequence with high homology to the FLAG and 3xFLAG epitope tag sequences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig1">Appendix 1—figure 1B</xref>). Furthermore, we found that Rps27- and Rps27l-FLAG IP RPFs are relatively enriched in <italic>Tmod3</italic> reads at the 3′ end of the <italic>Tmod3</italic> coding sequence relative to the 5′ end. The beginning of this enriched interval corresponds with the base position in the coding sequence at which the ribosome would have completely translated <italic>Tmod3’s</italic> N-terminal FLAG-like sequence and presented it as a nascent peptide chain emerging from the ribosome’s peptide exit tunnel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig1">Appendix 1—figure 1C</xref>). We thus propose that ribosomes that are translating <italic>Tmod3</italic> transcripts are preferentially enriched during FLAG IP, whether or not they contain Rps27-FLAG or Rps27l-FLAG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig1">Appendix 1—figure 1D</xref>). We also note that the RNA concentration of IP RPFs obtained from <italic>Rps27-FLAG</italic> mESCs was greater than that of <italic>Rps27l-FLAG</italic> mESCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig1">Appendix 1—figure 1E</xref>). This suggests that a larger proportion of anti-FLAG binding sites remained unoccupied during the Rps27l-FLAG IP compared to the Rps27-FLAG IP, and may explain why <italic>Tmod3</italic> appears to be more enriched among Rps27l-FLAG IP RPFs.</p></sec></app></app-group></back><sub-article article-type="editor-report" id="sa0"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.78695.sa0</article-id><title-group><article-title>Editor's evaluation</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Kuraku</surname><given-names>Shigehiro</given-names></name><role specific-use="editor">Reviewing Editor</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/02xg1m795</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Genetics</institution></institution-wrap><country>Japan</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group><related-object id="sa0ro1" object-id-type="id" object-id="10.1101/2022.05.03.490441" link-type="continued-by" xlink:href="https://sciety.org/articles/activity/10.1101/2022.05.03.490441"/></front-stub><body><p>This article focuses on the fate of two ribosomal protein genes, <italic>Rps27</italic> and <italic>Rps27L</italic>, of vertebrates after they split in whole-genome duplication.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen byGeorge Perry as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Jonathan Dinman (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) As pointed out in item 1 by Reviewer #2, the authors should consider performing western blotting experiments to confirm the amount of protein products should make the manuscript more convincing.</p><p>2) As pointed out by Reviewer #1 and Reviewer #3 (item 1), the authors should consider improving phylogenetic analysis and comparative data presentation to provide a more reliable timing and mode of the gene duplication eS27 and eS27L.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>I would basically congratulate the authors for achieving so thorough experiments and data analysis, but have two crucial comments.</p><p>Most critically, the authors need to present molecular phylogenetic tree and synteny conservation data to show the timing of the gene duplication between eS27 and eS27L, rather than just speculate on it. Also, their alignment in Figure 1A and the description about evolutionary conservation of any kind should ideally include non-tetrapod vertebrates, such as zebrafish, spotted gar, sharks, and jawless fishes, even if they cannot produce any data from laboratory experiments using these animals. It is very unbalanced that the authors invested so much on functional characterizations of the two proteins, but pay little attention to molecular phylogeny which should be the basis of the study.</p><p>The title of the manuscript should include the specific names of the target genes of the study.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1. Figure 1A: Conclusion from Figure 1A is that the eS27 gene duplication most likely occurred through a DNA-based gene duplication event in an ancestor common to most vertebrates. However, in this figure, the alignments are mostly mammals, with only one bird and one amphibian represented. Given that, in the end, this is a paper about evolutionary biology, they should go deeper into the phylogenetic analysis. In particular, they should more deeply examine the junction between vertebrates and invertebrates. For example, in amphibians, is S27 also duplicated in salamanders? In Caecillians? And in fish, they should perform a wider analysis, from the most &quot;recent&quot;, e.g. lungfish and coelacanths, down to sharks, hagfish and lamprey. It would also be interesting to examine a few advanced invertebrates such as sea lilies, starfish and sea urchins.</p><p>2. Figure 3B, closeup insert: what is the identity of the SSU protein that the eS27 amino acid residues 5, 12, and 17 about? Might this be important? At the very least, this RP should be labeled.</p><p>3. I found it interesting that both liver and lactating mammary glands preferentially contain eS27L enriched ribosomes as compared to heart, brain and nulliparous mammary gland. I have two observations regarding this. First, both are organs that tend to undergo higher amounts of cell replication compared to heart, brain and NP mammary gland. This is consistent with the observation of higher association of eS27L ribosomes with cell cycle-associated mRNAs. Testing whether ribosomes are reprogrammed to contain eS27L in highly dividing versus stationary phase cultured cells would be a relatively quick and inexpensive way to test this idea. Secondly, these two organs also produce large amounts of secreted proteins as compared to the other organs. Given that the group has tagged versions of the two proteins, they could test whether or not eS27L ribosomes are preferentially associated with endoplasmic reticulum than their eS27 counterparts using cultured cells. Alternatively, they might examine whether ribosomes are reprogrammed to contain eS27L when cells are programmed to become secretory cells, e.g. compare resting B-cells to B-cells stimulated to secrete antibody (i.e. plasma cells). I note that these experiments are mere suggestions, and are not required.</p><p>4. In a similar vein, rapidly duplicating and secreting cells such as liver and lactating mammary glands synthesize more protein than brain, heart and NP mammary gland cells. Perhaps the eS27L form produces ribosomes that are better tuned for speed versus accuracy. This can be tested by measuring rates of protein synthesis differences in translational accuracy in eS27 and eS27L homogenized cell lines.</p><p>5. Although it is clear that there are no differences between the homogenized mice and their heterologous littermates, one possible experiment would be to examine whether homogenization is disfavored over the course of multiple generations, i.e. a long term fitness experiment. However, given the extremely high costs and potentially low impact of such an experiment, I do not recommend that it be done.

We have now performed Western blots for Rps27 and Rps27l protein and Gapdh loading control on liver, heart, forelimb, and brain tissue of postnatal day 0 mice that are wild-type, heterozygous, or homozygous for the Rps27<sup>exon2del</sup> and Rps27l<sup>exon2del</sup> truncation alleles. We did not include the Rps27<sup>exon2del / exon2del</sup> genotype from these blots because we have previously shown that it is early embryonic lethal (revised Figure 4C-D) and the majority of these embryos yield no recoverable material even when dissecting as early as embryonic day 8.5. These Western blots and accompanying quantification of protein amounts are shown in Figure 4E-F, and are discussed in the highlighted text additions to the section “Rps27 and Rps27l homozygous knockouts are lethal at different developmental stages.” In brief, the results confirm that detectable protein expression from the respective truncated paralog is slightly diminished in Rps27<sup>exon2del / +</sup> specimens and nearly eliminated in Rps27l<sup>exon2del / exon2del</sup> specimens, with residual detection due to trace antibody cross-reactivity against the intact paralog (as demonstrated in Figure 3—figure supplement 1A, D). Interestingly, we observed that Rps27l<sup>exon2del / +</sup> and Rps27l<sup>exon2del / exon2del</sup> tissues had increased expression of the intact Rps27 protein, which is analogous to previously reported instances in which depletion of an RP gene is associated with increased expression of a paralogous gene (O’Leary et al. 2013; Milenkovic et al. 2023). Despite the increase in Rps27 protein level, Rps27l<sup>exon2del / exon2del</sup> is early postnatal lethal; this suggests that the quantity of Rps27 increase in mice that are homozygous for the Rps27l<sup>exon2del</sup> allele is insufficient to compensate for the Rps27l deficiency.</p><p>We have also performed Western blots for Rps27 and Rps27l protein and Gapdh loading control on tissue samples from adult mice that are wild-type, heterozygous, or homozygous for the Rps27<sup>Rps27l</sup> and Rps27l<sup>Rps27</sup> homogenized alleles. These Western blots and accompanying quantification of protein amounts are shown in Figure 5D-E, and are discussed in the highlighted text additions to the section “Rps27 and Rps27l proteins are functionally interchangeable across all examined murine tissues.” In brief, these new results confirmed loss of Rps27 protein and increased Rps27l protein in Rps27<sup>Rps27l / Rps27l</sup> mice. This effect is most pronounced in the spleen, which contains abundant B cells, one of the cell types that highly express the Rps27 locus as shown above (Figure 1D). Likewise, loss of Rps27l protein expression with concurrently increased Rps27 protein was observed in Rps27l<sup>Rps27 / Rps27</sup> mice and the effect is most pronounced in liver tissue, which contains hepatocytes that highly express the Rps27l locus.</p><p>We have also added the methods and source data for these Western blots to the methods section and source data zipped file, respectively.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) As pointed out by Reviewer #1 and Reviewer #3 (item 1), the authors should consider improving phylogenetic analysis and comparative data presentation to provide a more reliable timing and mode of the gene duplication eS27 and eS27L.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that additional analysis of Rps27’s evolutionary history would improve the robustness of our conclusions regarding its origin. First, following the recommendation of Reviewer #1 to present synteny conservation data, we now depict a 5 Mb window surrounding the Rps27 and Rps27l loci in the human genome and annotate several nearby genes that form a syntenic block between the two loci (Figure 1A). We previously described the similar exon structure between Rps27 and Rps27l, and we now depict this as well in Figure 1—figure supplement 1A. Together, the synteny and shared exon structure strongly support that the duplication occurred through a DNA-based mechanism such as DNA transposition or tandem/segmental/whole-genome duplication, as opposed to retrotransposition of RNA which generally results in intronless processed pseudogenes and would not include surrounding genes.</p><p>Regarding the timing of the duplication, we have followed the recommendations of Reviewers #1 and #3 to expand the multispecies protein sequence alignment, now presented in Figure 1C with the addition of newt, caecilian, lungfish, coelacanth, zebrafish, gar, shark, lamprey, sea squirt, amphioxus, sea star, sea urchin, and worm to represent more amphibians, fish, cyclostomes, and invertebrates. We also present a phylogenetic tree showing these and additional species (sponge, limpet, crinoid (closely related to sea lilies), hagfish, lizard, carp, pufferfish, tilapia, and salmon) with the putative timings of the 1R – 4R whole-genome duplications marked, and the number of Rps27 paralogs per species displayed (Figure 1B). We also constructed a molecular phylogenetic tree based on coding sequences of the Rps27/Rps27l orthologs across multiple species (Figure 1—figure supplement 1B). The results are discussed in the section “Rps27 and Rps27l are vertebrate ohnologs encoding highly conserved proteins.” In brief, while none of the nine included invertebrates had more than one Rps27 ortholog, nearly all vertebrates had two Rps27 paralogs, and most teleost fish species had three to six. These increases in Rps27 copy number thus coincide with the proposed timing of several WGDs. Furthermore, the Rps27 sequences from mammals and coelacanth formed a distinct clade from the corresponding Rps27l sequences, suggesting that duplication and subsequent divergence of these loci began in a common ancestor of these species.</p><p>We are aware that the 2R hypothesis has been challenged in recent years (i.e. Smith et al. 2018) and the WGD history of cyclostomes (hagfish and lampreys) remains controversial (i.e. Simakov et al. 2020, Nakatani et al. 2021). A detailed discussion of Rps27 paralogs in cyclostomes is beyond the scope of this work, but we did detect two Rps27 paralogs in lamprey and one in hagfish; the latter may be due to incomplete genome assembly/annotation or lineage-specific loss of a paralog. We also found that the confidence of the CDS phylogenetic tree was limited by the relatively short CDS and high conservation of Rps27 and the substantial evolutionary distance between the included species; nevertheless, these lines of evidence overall strongly suggest that the present-day Rps27 paralog pair is a remnant of the 1R/2R WGDs in the common vertebrate ancestor.</p><p>Details on the reference genomes and sequences used for phylogenetic analysis are available in Supplementary File 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>I would basically congratulate the authors for achieving so thorough experiments and data analysis, but have two crucial comments.</p><p>Most critically, the authors need to present molecular phylogenetic tree and synteny conservation data to show the timing of the gene duplication between eS27 and eS27L, rather than just speculate on it. Also, their alignment in Figure 1A and the description about evolutionary conservation of any kind should ideally include non-tetrapod vertebrates, such as zebrafish, spotted gar, sharks, and jawless fishes, even if they cannot produce any data from laboratory experiments using these animals. It is very unbalanced that the authors invested so much on functional characterizations of the two proteins, but pay little attention to molecular phylogeny which should be the basis of the study.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with this excellent suggestion and have followed these recommendations.

Figure 1A: Conclusion from Figure 1A is that the eS27 gene duplication most likely occurred through a DNA-based gene duplication event in an ancestor common to most vertebrates. However, in this figure, the alignments are mostly mammals, with only one bird and one amphibian represented. Given that, in the end, this is a paper about evolutionary biology, they should go deeper into the phylogenetic analysis. In particular, they should more deeply examine the junction between vertebrates and invertebrates. For example, in amphibians, is S27 also duplicated in salamanders? In Caecillians? And in fish, they should perform a wider analysis, from the most &quot;recent&quot;, e.g. lungfish and coelacanths, down to sharks, hagfish and lamprey. It would also be interesting to examine a few advanced invertebrates such as sea lilies, starfish and sea urchins.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with this excellent suggestion and have followed these recommendations.

We note that although Rps27l-ribosomes were associated with cell cycle-associated mRNAs, our analysis of cell cycle dynamics in mouse embryonic fibroblasts revealed no differences between wild-type and homogenized lines (Figure 7). However, we acknowledge that there are many other assays and conditions that could be used to characterize cell cycle parameters, which we hope to pursue in the future. Similarly, we note that our homogenized mice exhibited no signs of disease that might be expected if ER-associated translation were impaired, but acknowledge that subtle changes in ER function may not manifest in mouse models.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4.
