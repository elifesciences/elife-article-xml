genetic changes. To elucidate the mechanisms by which the translational machinery adapts to such changes, we perturbed the tRNA pool of <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> by tRNA gene deletion. We then evolved the deletion strain and observed that the genetic adaptation was recurrently based on a strategic mutation that changed the anticodon of other tRNA genes to match that of the deleted one. Strikingly, a systematic search in hundreds of genomes revealed that anticodon mutations occur throughout the tree of life. We further show that the evolution of the tRNA pool also depends on the need to properly couple translation to protein folding. Together, our observations shed light on the evolution of the tRNA pool, demonstrating that mutation in the anticodons of tRNA genes is a common adaptive mechanism when meeting new translational demands.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.01339.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.01339.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.01339.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Genes contain the blueprints for the proteins that are essential for countless biological functions and processes, and the path that leads from a particular gene to the corresponding protein is long and complex. The genetic information stored in the DNA must first be transcribed to produce a messenger RNA molecule, which then has to be translated to produce a string of amino acids that fold to form a protein. The translation step is performed by a molecular machine called the ribosome, with transfer RNA molecules bringing the amino acids that are needed to make the protein.</p><p>The information in messenger RNA is stored as a series of letters, with groups of three letters called codons representing the different amino acids. Since there are four letters—A, C, G and U—it is possible to form 64 different codons. And since there are only 20 amino acids, two or more different codons can specify the same amino acid (for example, AGU and AGC both specify serine), and two or more different transfer RNA molecules can take this amino acid to the ribosome. Moreover, some codons are found more often than others in the messenger RNA molecules, so the genes that encode the related transfer RNA molecules are more common than the genes for other transfer RNA molecules.</p><p>Environmental pressures mean that organisms must adapt to survive, with some genes and proteins increasing in importance, and others becoming less important. Clearly the relative numbers of the different transfer RNA molecules will also need to change to reflect these evolutionary changes, but the details of how this happens were not understood.</p><p>Now Yona et al. have explored this issue by studying yeast cells that lack a gene for one of the less common transfer RNA molecules (corresponding to the codon AGG, which specifies the amino acid arginine). At first this mutation resulted in slower growth of the yeast cells, but after being allowed to evolve over 200 generations, the rate of growth matched that of a normal strain with all transfer RNA genes. Yona et al. found that the gene for a more common transfer RNA molecule, corresponding to the codon AGA, which also specifies arginine, had mutated to AGG. As a result, the mutated yeast was eventually able to produce proteins as quickly as wild type yeast. Moreover, further experiments showed that the levels of some transfer RNAs are kept deliberately low in order to slow down the production of proteins so as to ensure that the proteins assume their correct structure.</p><p>But does the way these cells evolved in the lab resemble what happened in nature? To address this question Yona et al. examined a database of transfer RNA sequences from more than 500 species, and found evidence for the same codon-based switching mechanism in many species across the tree of life.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.01339.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.01339.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>tRNA gene</kwd><kwd>anticodon</kwd><kwd>translation</kwd><kwd>evolution</kwd><kwd>protein folding stress</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ERC-2007-StG 205199-ERNBPTC</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Pilpel</surname><given-names>Yitzhak</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Ben-May Charitable Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Pilpel</surname><given-names>Yitzhak</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Experimental evolution and systematic sequence analysis of transfer RNA genes reveal that anticodon mutations provide adaptive plasticity to the translation machinery.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The process of gene translation is fundamental to the function of living cells, and as such its apparatus is highly conserved across the tree of life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Müller and Wittmann-Liebold, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Itoh et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Wolf et al., 2001</xref>). Yet, the capacity of the translation machinery to adaptively evolve is crucial in order to support life in changing environments. Therefore, a key open question is to identify the mechanisms by which the translation machinery adapts to changing conditions.</p><p>A thoroughly studied aspect of translation that demonstrates its adaptation capacities is the different proportions by which synonymous codons are used, a phenomenon known as ‘codon usage bias’. Although differential use of codons can be the result of neutral processes such as mutational biases and the genomic GC content (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Urrutia and Hurst, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Rao et al., 2011</xref>), natural selection also influences codon usage bias. Indeed, it has been demonstrated that codon choice affects expression level, protein folding, translational accuracy, and other translational features (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Akashi, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Parmley and Hurst, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Zhou et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hudson et al., 2011</xref>). Since both neutral and selective processes govern codon usage bias, the balance between selection, mutational bias and drift is crucial in shaping the codon usage of each species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bulmer, 1991</xref>). Importantly, although the selective advantage offered by alternative synonymous codons is considered to be moderate, it was recently demonstrated that selection can still shape codon usage patterns in vertebrates even with their small effective population sizes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Doherty and McInerney, 2013</xref>).</p><p>Notably, the differential usage of codons represents the evolution of the ‘demand’ aspect of translation, namely the codon usage of all expressed genes. Yet, the adaptation mechanisms of the ‘supply’, namely the expression level of each tRNA type that is loaded with an amino acid, are not fully understood. While ribosomal genes do not exhibit appreciable changes in response to environmental alterations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Müller and Wittmann-Liebold, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Itoh et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Wolf et al., 2001</xref>), tRNA genes may provide an important source of evolutionary plasticity for fine tuning translation.</p><p>tRNAs constitute a fundamental component in the process of translation, linking codons to their corresponding amino acids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Widmann et al., 2010</xref>). tRNA genes are classified into gene families according to their anticodon, with each gene family containing between one and several copies scattered throughout the genome. Importantly, it has been experimentally observed for <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Tuller et al., 2010</xref>) and <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dong et al., 1996</xref>) that the cellular concentrations of each tRNA family in the cell (i.e., the tRNA pool) correlate with its genomic tRNA copy number (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Percudani et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kanaya et al., 1999</xref>). Notably, the rate-limiting step of polypeptide elongation is the recruitment of a tRNA that matches the translated codon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Varenne et al., 1984</xref>). Thus, the translation efficiency is defined as the extent to which the tRNA pool can accommodate the transcriptome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Sharp and Li, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dos Reis et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Stoletzki and Eyre-Walker, 2007</xref>), thereby affecting protein production and accuracy.</p><p>In general, highly expressed genes exhibit a marked codon usage bias toward ‘optimal’ codons, whose corresponding tRNA gene copy number is high (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Sharp and Li, 1986a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">1986b</xref>). The evolutionary force that acts to maintain optimal translation efficiency of such genes was coined ‘translational selection’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dos Reis et al., 2004</xref>). It was previously suggested that translational selection acts to maintain a balance between codon usage and tRNA availability. On the one hand, there is a selective pressure to increase the frequency of preferred codons in highly expressed genes. On the other hand, changes in the tRNA pool may also occur, for example duplication of tRNA genes for which high codon demand exists. Thus, codon frequencies and tRNA copy numbers coevolve toward a supply versus demand balance that facilitates optimal protein production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Higgs and Ran, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gingold et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>The fitness effects of an unmet translational demand and its potential role in shaping the tRNA pool are not fully characterized. Evolutionary changes to the tRNA pool were appreciated mainly via bioinformatics studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Rawlings et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Withers et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Higgs and Ran, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bermudez-Santana et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Rogers et al., 2010</xref>) and only a handful of experimental findings have been reported, which rely on genetic manipulations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Byström and Fink, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Von Pawel-Rammingen et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Aström et al., 1993</xref>) or direct mutagenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Saks et al., 1998</xref>). Sequence analyses of divergent genomes have demonstrated that both the sequence and copy number of tRNA genes may change among various species or strains. However, it is unclear whether the observed variations in the tRNA pool are a consequence of an adaptive process due to unbalanced translational demand or the result of random genomic processes, as tRNA genes are a known source of genomic instability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">McFarlane and Whitehall, 2009</xref>).</p><p>Further, the forces that direct and maintain low copy tRNA families remain unclear. Specifically, it is not clear whether translational selection acts only to favor optimal codons or also acts in particular cases to keep other codons deliberately as ‘non-optimal’ by maintaining their tRNA supply at low level. Encoding genes with optimal codons might not always lead to higher protein expression levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kudla et al., 2009</xref>). Similarly, the use of ‘slow codons’ may not always result in lower levels of protein expression as they could have functional roles in improving expression, for example when enriched at the beginning of a transcript in order to reduce the energy of the RNA structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Goodman et al., 2013</xref>) or to efficiently allocate ribosomes along the mRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Tuller et al., 2010</xref>). Additionally, it has been proposed that non-optimal codons may play a role in governing the process of cotranslational folding by slowing down translation, which supports proper folding between domain boundaries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Thanaraj, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kramer et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cabrita et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Wilke and Drummond, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Pechmann and Frydman, 2012</xref>). Yet, the contribution of non-optimal codons to proper protein folding was observed only for specific genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Crombie et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Komar et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cortazzo et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Tsai et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Zhang et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Zhou et al., 2013</xref>). Thus, the extent and relevance of this phenomenon to the global folding state of the proteome needs to be substantiated.</p><p>To elucidate the importance of restoring translational equilibrium, we used an experimental evolution approach. To this end, we genetically perturbed the tRNA pool of the budding yeast <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>. In this yeast, the genetic code is decoded by 42 different tRNA families that make up a total of 274 tRNA genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chan and Lowe, 2009</xref>). Each tRNA gene family ranges from 1–16 copies, with 6 tRNA families consisting of only a single copy. In a recent study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bloom-Ackermann et al., In press</xref>), we have systematically manipulated the tRNA pool in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> by individually deleting most tRNA genes from its genome. Here, we focus on one particular deletion strain that showed the most extreme fitness reduction among the viable deletion mutants in this tRNA deletion library. This tRNA exists in only one copy in the genome, thus after its deletion the cell is left without a tRNA with the corresponding anticodon. Lab-evolution experiments performed on this strain demonstrated that the translational balance was rapidly restored by mutations in other tRNA genes that compensated for the tRNA deletion. An extensive bioinformatic analysis revealed that a similar evolutionary trend is widespread in nature too, suggesting that the anticodon mutations we observed in the lab recapitulate an existing mechanism that shapes the tRNA pool. To shed light on the constraints that shape the size of tRNA gene families, we artificially overexpressed singleton tRNAs, rather than deleting them. We found that when low copy tRNAs were overexpressed, the protein quality control machinery was challenged due to increased proteotoxic stress. This observation suggests that low tRNA availability for particular codon can serve an essential means to ensure proper cotranslation folding of proteins.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Deletion of singleton tRNA gene breaks the translational balance</title><p>To demonstrate the importance of the balance between codon usage and the cellular tRNA pool we created a yeast strain in which the single copy of the arginine tRNA gene, <italic>tR(CCU)J</italic>, was deleted (designated ΔtRNA<sup>Arg</sup><sub>CCU</sub>). Consequently, in this deletion strain, the arginine codon AGG cannot be translated with its fully matched tRNA and it is presumably translated by another arginine tRNA, tRNA<sup>Arg</sup><sub>UCU</sub>, owing to a wobble interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Begley et al., 2007</xref>). This shortage in tRNA supply is particularly evident given the demand: AGG is the second most highly used codon for arginine in the yeast genome (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Supplementary file 1A</xref>). Indeed, the ΔtRNA<sup>Arg</sup><sub>CCU</sub> strain showed a severe growth defect compared to the wild-type strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, blue and green curves, respectively). This growth difference demonstrates the effect of translational imbalance on cellular growth. Although the deletion mutant of this single copy tRNA is viable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Clare et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kawakami et al., 1993</xref>), its severe growth defect also reveals the inability of the wobble interactions to fully compensate for the tRNA gene deletion.<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.01339.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>The growth defect associated with deletion of a singleton tRNA gene was rapidly rescued during the lab-evolution experiment.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Growth curve measurements of wild-type (WT) (green), ΔtRNA<sup>Arg</sup><sub>CCU</sub> (blue) and the evolved deletion (red) are shown in optical density (OD) values over time during continuous growth on rich medium at 30°C.

The deletion strain was grown under optimal laboratory conditions (rich medium at 30°C) and was diluted daily into a fresh medium by a factor of 120, corresponding to approximately 7 generations per cycle. Every 50 generations, the growth of the evolving population was compared to both the wild-type and the ancestor ΔtRNA<sup>Arg</sup><sub>CCU</sub> strains. Strikingly, after 200 generations we observed a full recovery of the growth defect of the ancestor strain ΔtRNA<sup>Arg</sup><sub>CCU</sub>, as the growth curve of the evolved population was indistinguishable from that of the wild-type strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, red curve). Similar dynamics were observed in all four independent evolutionary lines.</p><p>In search of the potential genetic adaptations underlying this rapid recovery, we first looked for genetic alterations in other arginine tRNA genes. We found a single point mutation in another arginine tRNA gene that codes for tRNA<sup>Arg</sup><sub>UCU</sub>. This mutation changed the anticodon triplet of tRNA<sup>Arg</sup><sub>UCU</sub> from UCU to CCU (i.e., T→C transition). Consequently, the evolved tRNA<sup>Arg</sup><sub>UCU</sub> perfectly matched the AGG codon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Unlike the singleton tRNA<sup>Arg</sup><sub>CCU</sub>, there are 11 copies of tRNA<sup>Arg</sup><sub>UCU</sub> in the yeast genome. Although each of the 4 independent lab-evolution experiments showed the exact same solution (that is, a mutation in the anticodon of a tRNA<sup>Arg</sup><sub>UCU</sub> gene), 3 different copies of this gene were changed among the 4 lines (i.e., 1 of the 11 copies of tRNA<sup>Arg</sup><sub>UCU</sub> was mutated in 2 repetitions; see ‘Materials and methods’). To confirm that a single point mutation in the anticodon of tRNA<sup>Arg</sup><sub>UCU</sub> is sufficient to fully compensate for the growth defect of ΔtRNA<sup>Arg</sup><sub>CCU</sub>, we artificially inserted the same T→C mutation into the deletion ΔtRNA<sup>Arg</sup><sub>CCU</sub> mutant.

The switching events that we observed (from tRNA<sup>Arg</sup><sub>UCU</sub> to tRNA<sup>Arg</sup><sub>CCU</sub>) suggest that the effective gene copy number of each tRNA anticodon set can change during evolution, presumably due to demand-to-supply changes. Given that a single point mutation can functionally convert one tRNA into another, an interesting question emerges: why does the genome maintain a single copy of tRNA<sup>Arg</sup><sub>CCU</sub>? T to C mutations must have occurred in evolution but they appear to have been selected against so as to preserve only a single copy of the CCU anticodon tRNA. Consistent with this hypothesis is the observation that other yeast species maintain tRNA<sup>Arg</sup><sub>CCU</sub> at a single copy (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Supplementary file 1C</xref>).

Other deleterious effects that may stem from a high copy number of tRNA<sup>Arg</sup><sub>CCU</sub> could be misincorporation of arginine into non-arginine codons, or the misloading of arginine tRNA molecules with other amino acids. These potential sources of errors are not mutually exclusive and can each contribute to the observed growth defect by exerting a protein folding stress.</p><p>To examine the possibility that the growth defect associated with multiple copies of tRNA<sup>Arg</sup><sub>CCU</sub> is indeed associated with such a proteotoxic stress, we used an established method that examines the load on the protein quality control machinery of the cell (see ‘Materials and methods’) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kaganovich et al., 2008</xref>). In this assay, we transformed cells with a plasmid harboring the human gene, von Hippel–Lindau (VHL), fused to a fluorescent tag (mCherry). Fluorescently tagged VHL that is present as aggregated puncta (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>), and not as a disperse cytosolic localization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>), indicates that the protein quality control machinery is saturated due to high levels of misfolding in the cell’s endogenous proteins.

This scenario is particularly feasible given that the genes needed in various environments do show differences in codon usage, for example respiration as opposed to fermentation in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Man and Pilpel, 2007</xref>).</p><p>Indeed, when faced with different environmental challenges, transcriptional changes affect the codon usage of the transcriptome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gingold et al., 2012</xref>), and hence the demand for the various tRNAs, and may thus cause translational imbalances. To maintain optimal protein production, the tRNA pool is under pressure to restore the translational balance by accommodating the new translational demands. On a short timescale, the tRNA pool might respond non-genetically by changing expression profiles of the tRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Tuller et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Saikia et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Pavon-Eternod et al., 2013a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">2013b</xref>). Yet, if changes in demand-to-supply persist, a genetic change in the tRNA pool might become beneficial evolutionarily. In this work, we demonstrate how anticodon mutations provide a rapid mechanism to alter the tRNA pool. We propose that during evolution, novel translational requirements can be addressed by anticodon shifting of tRNA copies more readily than by duplications and deletions of tRNA genes. The tRNA pool can evolve to meet new translation demands by adjusting the ratios of tRNA families that code for the same amino acid. Within a single mutational event, anticodon switching holds the potential to rapidly change the ratios of tRNAs within the pool, by increasing the copy number of one tRNA family at the expense of a counterpart. A similar solution could be obtained by a sequence of genomic duplications and deletions of tRNA genes. These alternatives are likely to fixate less frequently than anticodon switching, as they may carry negative effects due to duplications or deletions of adjacent unrelated genetic features. Furthermore, our systematic search for tRNA switching events throughout the tree of life revealed the prevalence of tRNA anticodon mutations in nature. This observation is consistent with the results of our lab-evolution experiment and may be the evolutionary outcome to novel translational demands in the wild.</p><p>Studies on methionine tRNAs have previously shown that the scaffold sequences determine their function as either initiator or elongator Met tRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Von Pawel-Rammingen et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Aström et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kolitz and Lorsch, 2010</xref>). Yet, the initiator and the elongator represent extreme cases of tRNAs that are used at different stages in translation. The present chimeric tRNAs that emerged in our lab-evolution experiments successfully replaced the deleted tRNA, despite differences in 20 nucleotide positions between the 2 tRNA scaffolds. If tRNA scaffolds are interchangeable in terms of the effect of their function on the fitness, what can explain the high sequence similarity observed among tRNA gene copies of the same family in yeast? It is possible that the sequence of the tRNA scaffold is indeed important under specific conditions that were not examined in this work, or that our measurements were not sensitive enough to detect small selective disadvantages that can act against chimeric tRNAs in nature. Under these scenarios, the high sequence similarity can be explained by purifying selection that maintains sequence identity within tRNA families. Yet, there is also a possibility that the sequence similarity is not due to purifying selection but the result of ‘concerted evolution’, an evolutionary process that maintains sequence identity by frequent recombination events among copies of the same gene family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Munz et al., 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Amstutz et al., 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Teshima and Innan, 2004</xref>). This possibility implies that the high conservation observed within tRNA gene families is not due to functionality, but is rather the result of neutral evolution. At present, it is not possible to determine which of the two possibilities explains best the observed sequence identity.</p><p>If a single point mutation in one of the tRNA<sup>Arg</sup><sub>UCU</sub> copies enables it to function like a tRNA from a different family, what were the evolutionary constraints that have left some families with more members while others with fewer? Is purifying selection acting to deliberately maintain low levels of certain tRNAs? Such selection would render their corresponding codons ‘non-optimal’. To examine potential adaptive functions of tRNA family sizes, we tested the consequences of increasing the sizes of several tRNA families. We found that keeping low copy tRNA families is adaptive, as increasing their copy number can result in a proteotoxic stress due to problems in protein folding.</p><p>Most of the published work on the functionality of codons that correspond to rare tRNAs have so far tested how modified codon usage of specific proteins influences their proper folding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Crombie et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Komar et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cortazzo et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Tsai et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Zhang et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Zhou et al., 2013</xref>). In contrast, we took a different approach, in which no protein coding gene sequence is modified, but rather the tRNA supply is manipulated. Thus, the effect we generated could be exerted on all genes, and we could indeed detect it as a global proteotoxic stress in the cell. Our observations are consistent with the theory that programmed pauses in the translation process could promote proper folding during translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Thanaraj, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kramer et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cabrita et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Wilke and Drummond, 2010</xref>). The overexpression of the rare tRNA could have thus impaired with cotranslation folding. Yet, there could be additional reasons for the observed proteotoxic stress, which are not necessarily mutually exclusive. First, overexpression of tRNA<sup>Arg</sup><sub>CCU</sub> may result in misincorporation of arginine into non-arginine codons. Second, other aminoacyl tRNA synthetases may aminoacylate an incorrect amino acid to the highly expressed tRNA. Misloading will result in the incorporation of a different amino acid instead of arginine. A potential part of the observed proteotoxic stress due to misincorporation still remains to be studied. Yet, such an effect should be relevant not only for the overexpression of the rare tRNA<sup>Arg</sup><sub>CCU</sub> but also for the overexpression of the abundant tRNA<sup>Arg</sup><sub>UCU</sub>. Our results show a sever proteotoxic stress only upon expression of the rare tRNA, thus landing more support to the intriguing hypothesis, that the proteotoxic phenotypes observed are due to converting a slow translating codon, scattered in many genes in the genome, into a fast one. This notion is consistent with and complementary to the picture that emerges from single gene-based analyses.</p><p>When facing the need to adapt, the tRNA pool (that is the supply) provides evolutionary plasticity to the translation machinery. The ability of the tRNA pool to change rapidly can be mainly attributed to its unique architecture in the form of multimember gene families. Only on a much longer evolutionary timescale, will the genome-wide codon usage of genes change so as to further fine tune the translational balance. Notably, the plasticity of the tRNA genes is constrained by the need to maintain proper protein folding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Drummond and Wilke, 2008</xref>). Thus, the need to accommodate changes in codon usage demands acts together with protein folding constrains to shape the tRNA pool in the living cells.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Yeast strains and plasmids</title><p>The following <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> strains were used in this study: ΔtRNA<sup>Arg</sup><sub>CCU</sub> (based on Y5565, genetic background: <italic>ΔtR(CCU)J::Hyg, MATα, can1Δ::MFA1pr-HIS3 mfα1Δ::MFα1pr-LEU2 lyp1Δ ura3Δ0 leu2Δ0)</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bloom-Ackermann et al., In press</xref>) was used for lab-evolution experiments. <italic>MutΔtRNA</italic><sup><italic>Arg</italic></sup><sub><italic>CCU</italic></sub> is based on ΔtRNA<sup>Arg</sup><sub>CCU</sub> and carries a mutation (T→C transition) in <italic>tR(UCU)K</italic> gene plus a <italic>URA3</italic> selection marker.

This assay provides an indication for the protein unfolding stress in cells by assessing the load on the protein quality control machinery. In this assay, the cells were introduced with a high copy number plasmid that contains the human gene VHL fused to a fluorescent tag (mCherry). VHL is a naturally unstructured protein and is dependent on two additional proteins (Elongin B and C) for proper folding in human cells. Expressing VHL in yeast cells, which lack VHL’s complex partners, leads to misfolding of the translated proteins. Under normal conditions, the misfolded VHL proteins are handled by the cell’s quality control machinery. When the quality control machinery is not saturated, the fluorescently tagged VHL appears in the cytosol. However, under stress, in which the quality control machinery is fully occupied, misfolded proteins in the cytosol are processed into dedicated inclusions (JUNQ and IPOD) and form punctum structures. Hence, a punctum phenotype of the VHL-mCherry construct is an indication for cells that experience proteotoxic stress and saturation of the protein quality control machinery.</p><p>Wild-type yeast cells harboring the pGAL-VHL-mCherry (CHFP) fusion plasmid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kaganovich et al., 2008</xref>) and either an additional empty plasmid or the tRNA overexpression plasmid, were grown overnight on SC+2% raffinose, diluted into SC+2% galactose and grown at 30°C for 6 hr.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by a Senior editor and 3 reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The following individuals responsible for the peer review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Michael Laub (Reviewing editor) and Chris Marx (peer reviewer).</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the other reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Overall, this paper was favorably received by all three reviewers. The general consensus was that the results provide important new insights into the evolution of tRNAs and represents a nice example of the power of experimental evolution to provide novel biological insights. There are, however, several concerns about the writing and interpretation of a few things that we felt warranted revision. More generally, there was a concern that the paper felt like a loose collection of vignettes and better writing to integrate them would serve the reader well. Each of these concerns about the writing must be dealt with through changes in the text. There is also one experiment that is straightforward that would be necessary to bolster one of the primary claims made in the text (item #1 below) and one experiment (item #6 below) that a reviewer suggests (it's not essential, but could really enhance the paper). All of the major issues to address, collated from the three independent reviewers, are listed below:</p><p>1) The authors argue that overproducing low-copy tRNAs causes proteotoxic stress. This conclusion rests primarily on a single assay involving the expression of an mCherry-tagged human protein. I think it's important to assess this by at least one other means; for example, testing whether various HSPs are induced (either individual HSPs or, preferably, a genome-wide transcriptional analysis by arrays or RNA-Seq).</p><p>(As a side note: it was not clear whether the potential proteotoxic stress observed resulted from misincorporation of amino acids per se or defects in co-translational folding that result from changes in translation speed/efficiency without misincorporation. The reviewers did not think experiments to address this were necessary for a revised manuscript, but we felt future experiments ought to try and distinguish between these models. For instance, one could measure rates of misincorporation. Or, if the defect is in cotranslational folding, one could imagine taking a protein in which a “slow” and a “fast” codon are near each other: it should be true (if cotranslational folding is the culprit) that making both codons “fast” is detrimental, but that swapping them (and retaining one slow, one fast) is tolerated. The misincorporation model would, by contrast, predict that the exact position of the “slow” codon matters.)</p><p>2) The authors often refer to “translation efficiency” in the text, but does this mean translation speed, accuracy, or some combination thereof? Can you be more explicit about the intended meaning?</p><p>3) The data are clear and compelling that “chimeric” tRNAs harboring the backbone of one tRNA and the anticodon of another can compete with wild-type under a range of conditions. But this begs the question of why duplicated tRNAs in yeast retain nearly 100% sequence identity - one would expect, given the data presented here, to see much more sequence diversity. Can this be commented on?</p><p>4) The first paragraph introduces codon bias, then states that the existence of codon usage implies that translation has undergone adaptation. This is not the case, because mutational biases are known to cause codon usage bias. The manuscript states that adaptation is “presumably” to fine-tune codon usage to gene expression. One need not presume, as the subject has been studied for decades. The authors should expand this section to give a more accurate picture of the question at hand. Plotkin &amp; Kudla (Nat Rev Genet 2011) provide a solid review.</p><p>5) It has not been established that any tRNA scaffold with an anticodon change suffices to restore function and fitness, only isoaccepting scaffolds.</p><p>One would not expect the scaffold to be entirely interchangeable. Some aa-tRNA synthetases do not bind the anticodon (Leu, Ala and Ser-accepting aaRS), and the anticodon of the corresponding tRNAs can be changed without affecting charging (see Beuning and Musier-Forsyth, Biopolymers 1999). For these species, the scaffold is decisive for proper charging.</p><p>Thus, the claim that the tRNA scaffold does not confer tRNA functionality is incorrect.

This conclusion rests primarily on a single assay involving the expression of an mCherry-tagged human protein. I think it's important to assess this by at least one other means; for example, testing whether various HSPs are induced (either individual HSPs or, preferably, a genome-wide transcriptional analysis by arrays or RNA-Seq)</italic>.</p><p>Following the reviewers’ suggestion, we measured the expression level of six canonical heat shock proteins (HSPs) by RT-qPCR in order to establish the proteotoxic stress in the two tRNA overexpressing strains. Our new results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>) demonstrate that indeed HSP genes are induced 2–8-fold when overexpressing the originally low copy number tRNA gene. In contrast, none of the HSP genes was induced in the cells that overexpress the high copy number tRNA gene. Thus, the RT-PCR measurements support our initial claim that over-expressing a rare tRNA gene causes a proteotoxic stress, ascribing a pro-folding function to rare tRNAs, and suggest that at least part of the fitness reduction observed upon over expression of a rare tRNA is caused by proteotoxic stress.</p><p><italic>(As a side note: it was not clear whether the potential proteotoxic stress observed resulted from misincorporation of amino acids</italic> per se <italic>or defects in co-translational folding that result from changes in translation speed/efficiency without misincorporation. The reviewers did not think experiments to address this were necessary for a revised manuscript, but we felt future experiments ought to try and distinguish between these models. For instance, one could measure rates of misincorporation. Or, if the defect is in cotranslational folding, one could imagine taking a protein in which a “slow” and a “fast” codon are near each other: it should be true (if cotranslational folding is the culprit) that making both codons “fast” is detrimental, but that swapping them (and retaining one slow, one fast) is tolerated. The misincorporation model would, by contrast, predict that the exact position of the “slow” codon matters.</italic>)</p><p>We agree that the proteotoxic stress may have several origins and thus discuss three mechanisms that may lead to it in the text. We also further clarify that the potential part of the observed proteotoxic stress due to mis-incorporation still remains to be studied.</p><p>Currently in our lab, we aim to pursue this line of research by protein sequencing. We use mass spectrometry technology on designated proteins enriched with arginine. We also thank the reviews for the suggested “slow” and “fast” adjacent arginine codons as it is an elegant experiment that can be performed in future by using the same mass-spec method.</p><p><italic>2) The authors often refer to “translation efficiency” in the text, but does this mean translation speed, accuracy, or some combination thereof? Can you be more explicit about the intended meaning</italic>?</p><p>We now clarify in the text the definition of translation efficiency. We note that the translation efficiency affects both production throughput and accuracy.</p><p><italic>3) The data are clear and compelling that “chimeric” tRNAs harboring the backbone of one tRNA and the anticodon of another can compete with wild-type under a range of conditions. But this begs the question of why duplicated tRNAs in yeast retain nearly 100% sequence identity - one would expect, given the data presented here, to see much more sequence diversity. Can this be commented on</italic>?</p><p>We agree that in light of our results the origin of the high sequence identity among tRNA genes is an interesting question. We added the following paragraph to the Discussion as follows:</p><p>“The present chimeric tRNAs that emerged in our lab-evolution experiments successfully replaced the deleted tRNA, despite differences in 20 nucleotide positions between the two tRNA scaffolds…”</p><p><italic>4) The first paragraph introduces codon bias, then states that the existence of codon usage implies that translation has undergone adaptation. This is not the case, because mutational biases are known to cause codon usage bias. The manuscript states that adaptation is “presumably” to fine-tune codon usage to gene expression. One need not presume, as the subject has been studied for decades. The authors should expand this section to give a more accurate picture of the question at hand. Plotkin &amp; Kudla (Nat Rev Genet 2011) provide a solid review</italic>.</p><p>We thank the reviewers for this important point. We extensively edited the first three paragraphs of the Introduction and elaborated on the evolutionary processes of codon usage bias.</p><p><italic>5) It has not been established that any tRNA scaffold with an anticodon change suffices to restore function and fitness, only isoaccepting scaffolds</italic>.</p><p>One would not expect the scaffold to be entirely interchangeable. Some aa-tRNA synthetases do not bind the anticodon (Leu, Ala and Ser-accepting aaRS), and the anticodon of the corresponding tRNAs can be changed without affecting charging (see Beuning and Musier-Forsyth, Biopolymers 1999). For these species, the scaffold is decisive for proper charging.</p><p><italic>Thus, the claim that the tRNA scaffold does not confer tRNA functionality is incorrect. It also does not follow that the anticodon is the dominant feature. It may be the dominant feature so long as the tRNA scaffold is from a synonymous family</italic>.</p><p>We agree that our observations focus on synonymous tRNA families only. Thus, we changed the text accordingly:</p><p>“Hence, the chimeric tRNA provides a direct in vivo indication that the scaffolds of tRNAs, which encode for the same amino-acid, may be interchangeable in terms of their effect on cellular growth under the conditions we tested.”</p><p><italic>6) Not reporting results after starving the cells for arginine seems a missed opportunity</italic>.</p><p>We now preformed arginine-starving assays on the deletion strain (ΔtRNA<sup>Arg</sup><sub>CCU</sub>) compared to the WT (not shown). Yet, we did not observe any significant difference in the growth, comparing this medium to a medium containing arginine. Accordingly, we did not pursue this line of research further.</p><p><italic>7) The levels of tRNAs achieved after multicopy plasmid expression remain unclear. At present, we do not know whether the fold-change in tRNA for each tRNA variant is equivalent, or whether the absolute change is equivalent. We also have no guidance as to which one matters. It would seem that if achieving an increase of x molecules of tRNA means a 10% increase in the abundant tRNA and a 10-fold increase in the rare tRNA, then the results obtained may not be surprising. Please address why adding a putatively constant amount of additional tRNA is the correct experiment</italic>.</p><p>We acknowledge that this is a valid point, yet with the aim to recapitulates the natural evolutionary process of gene dosage changes we used similar increments in gene copy number for both rare and abundant tRNA. We started with addition of a centromeric plasmid (considered as an equivalent to addition of a single copy) and observed minor effects under severe growth conditions only. Therefore, we aimed to shift tRNA copies of both families to the extreme. For that we used high-copy plasmids in which both families were supplemented with the same number of copies. Since expression of each tRNA is determined by its endogenous promoter we could not control for differences in tRNA expression, only for differences in tRNA gene copy number. It is also worth noting that the copy number of the plasmid that we used (2μ plasmid) ranges from 20 to 80 in a single cell. Thus, we believe that the expression level of both rare and abundant tRNAs were greatly influenced in our experiments.</p><p><italic>8) The paper jumps to assuming codon usage bias emerges from selection before providing evidence that it isn't just random drift.
