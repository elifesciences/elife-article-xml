We discovered a CAPERα/TBX3 repressor complex required to prevent senescence in primary cells and mouse embryos. Critical, previously unknown roles for CAPERα in controlling cell proliferation are manifest in an obligatory interaction with TBX3 to regulate chromatin structure and repress transcription of <italic>CDKN2A-p16</italic><sup><italic>INK</italic></sup> and the RB pathway. The IncRNA <italic>UCA1</italic> is a direct target of CAPERα/TBX3 repression whose overexpression is sufficient to induce senescence. In proliferating cells, we found that hnRNPA1 binds and destabilizes <italic>CDKN2A-p16</italic><sup><italic>INK</italic></sup> mRNA whereas during senescence, <italic>UCA1</italic> sequesters hnRNPA1 and thus stabilizes <italic>CDKN2A-p16</italic><sup><italic>INK</italic></sup>. Thus CAPERα/TBX3 and <italic>UCA1</italic> constitute a coordinated, reinforcing mechanism to regulate both <italic>CDKN2A-p16</italic><sup><italic>INK</italic></sup> transcription and mRNA stability. Dissociation of the CAPERα/TBX3 co-repressor during oncogenic stress activates <italic>UCA1</italic>, revealing a novel mechanism for oncogene-induced senescence. Our elucidation of CAPERα and <italic>UCA1</italic> functions in vivo provides new insights into senescence induction, and the oncogenic and developmental properties of TBX3.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.02805.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.02805.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.02805.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Cell division and growth are essential for survival. But it is equally important that cells can stop dividing, because failing to do so can lead to the uncontrolled tumor growth seen in cancer. One such quality control mechanism is called senescence, which stops the growth and multiplication of cells that are old, damaged or behaving in ways that may harm the organism. All cells eventually stop dividing and undergo senescence, but a number of factors may trigger the process early, such as DNA damage, stress or the appearance of cancer-causing proteins.</p><p>Senescence can be harmful if it occurs too early in life and interferes with normal growth. Severe birth defects—including fatal heart problems and limb malformations—occur if senescence is inappropriately triggered early in development. Mutations in a gene encoding a protein called TBX3 have been linked to these severe birth defects.</p><p>Normally, TBX3 stops the production of other proteins that trigger senescence in early development, and helps to maintain stable conditions in adult cells. Understanding how it does so could help scientists understand normal cell function and aging, and also help to find ways to trigger senescence in cancerous cells.</p><p>Kumar et al. found that a protein called CAPERα—for short Coactivator of AP1 and Estrogen Receptor—forms a complex with TBX3 that stops cells dividing in living organisms in at least two different ways. One way is by altering how DNA is folded. The other way involves a non-coding strand of RNA from a gene called UCA1: this RNA prevents the degradation of proteins that stop cell division.</p><p>In normal proliferating cells, the CAPERα/TBX3 protein complex prevents the production of UCA1 RNA. In contrast, in cells that received a cancer causing stimulus, TBX3 and CAPERα physically separate: this activates production of UCA1 RNA and causes senescence. Further studies will be required to establish exactly how the CAPERα/TBX3 protein complex interacts with DNA and RNA to control senescence and prevent cancer.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.02805.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.02805.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>senescence</kwd><kwd>oncogenesis</kwd><kwd>development</kwd><kwd>p16</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><funding-statement>No external funding was received.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A novel master regulatory mechanism of cell proliferation and senscence employs the lncRNA UCA1 and a CAPERα/TBX3 corepressor.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Senescence is defined as irreversible arrest of cell growth and loss of replicative capacity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hayflick, 1965</xref>).

Immunoblotting for Tbx3 confirmed its interaction with Caperα (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, lane 5) and in vitro pull down assays revealed that their interaction is direct (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, lane 6). <italic>Caperα</italic> is very broadly expressed during mouse embryonic development (Moon, unpublished), whereas <italic>Tbx3</italic> expression is very tissue specific and dynamic. We thus questioned whether the endogenous proteins interact in mouse tissues relevant to malformations seen in humans with UMS. Immunohistochemistry on sectioned e10.5 embryos showed that Tbx3 and Caperα proteins are co-expressed and have distinct localization patterns in different tissues: Caperα is detected in all dorsal root ganglia nuclei (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>), some of which contain co-localized Tbx3; in proximal limb mesenchyme, Tbx3 and Caperα co-localize in nuclei (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>) while in some distal cells and the ectoderm, Caperα is nuclear and Tbx3 is cytoplasmic (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>, white arrowheads).

To identify domains required for CAPERα interaction, we used a series of overexpression plasmids encoding mouse Tbx3 proteins with different mutations and functional domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>). The DBD, deleted repressor domain (ΔRD) and exon7 missense mutants are untagged proteins, whereas the C-terminal deletion mutants are Myc-tagged.</p><p>To assay the interactions of the untagged exogenous proteins with endogenous CAPERα in HEK293 cells, we needed to knockdown endogenous TBX3 with shRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref>).

Both CAPERα and TBX3 shRNAs effectively decreased the amount of CAPERα mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1 fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplements 1A and 2A,B</xref>). Knockdown of either protein resulted in a dramatic increase in senescence associated β-galatosidase activity (SA-βgal, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A–D</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1 fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplements 1 and 2C–H</xref>).

In this study, we provide compelling evidence for critical and novel functions of CAPERα, the lncRNA <italic>UCA1</italic> and TBX3 in the regulation of cell proliferation and senescence. We have discovered a CAPERα/TBX3 complex that is required to prevent senescence of primary human and mouse cells in vivo and that functions as a master regulator of cell proliferation by directly repressing transcription of lncRNA <italic>UCA1</italic>, <italic>p16</italic><sup><italic>INK</italic></sup> and other tumor suppressor genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7P</xref>). Overexpression of <italic>UCA1</italic> occurs after loss of TBX3/CAPER<italic>α</italic> and in OIS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7Q</xref>), and is itself sufficient to induce senescence at least in part, by disrupting the interaction of <italic>p16</italic><sup><italic>INK</italic></sup> mRNA with hnRNP A1 leading to increased <italic>p16</italic><sup><italic>INK</italic></sup> mRNA stability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7P,Q</xref>). Disrupting the CAPERα/TBX3 complex by decreasing the amount of either TBX3 or CAPER<italic>α</italic>, or by CAPER<italic>α</italic> mislocalization during OIS, coordinately increases activity of multiple pro-senescence targets at both the transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels in a reinforcing mechanism.</p><p>Increased CAPER<italic>α</italic> has been reported in human breast cancers and a shift from cytoplasmic to nuclear localization correlates with transition from pre-malignant to malignant lesions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Mercier et al., 2009</xref>). In contrast, CAPERα co-activates vRel mediated transcription but inhibits vREL transforming activity in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dutta et al., 2008</xref>). It is likely that anti- or pro- oncogenic activity of CAPER<italic>α</italic> is determined by cell type and the interacting protein(s) present in a given context; our results suggest that CAPER<italic>α</italic> has oncogenic potential in primary cells since loss of CAPERα/TBX3 induces premature senescence, a vital tumor suppressor mechanism. CAPER<italic>α</italic> binds to regulatory chromatin domains via TBX3 but dissociates from these domains and becomes concentrated in large intranuclear foci prior to senescence induced by loss of TBX3 or during OIS. Future efforts will define the composition of CAPER + nuclear foci and the role of this nuclear subdomain during senescence induction.</p><p>The TBX3 RD is required for TBX3 to interact with CAPERα (this study), immortalize primary fibroblasts and confer senescence bypass (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Carlson et al., 2001</xref>). Since loss of CAPERα activates target gene transcription despite continued TBX3 occupancy, it is the CAPERα/TBX3 complex (interacting via TBX3 RD) that represses pro-senescence target loci. It will be important to determine if previously identified targets of TBX3 transcriptional repression are actually regulated by this complex.</p><p>Additional studies are warranted to determine the precise mechanisms whereby histone status is regulated by CAPERα/TBX3: TBX3 is known to interact directly with HDACs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Yarosh et al., 2008</xref>), but there are no reports of it or CAPERα interacting with histone methyltransferases or demethylases. Our recently published Mass Spec screen for Tbx3/TBX3 interactors did not identify such factors however, the screen cannot be considered exhaustive as we did not reproducibly detect HDACs or transcription factors previously reported to interact with Tbx3. Future studies to specifically determine whether TBX3 and/or CAPERα interact with, recruit, or modify the function of EZH2, SUV39 and other methyltransferases will be informative.</p><p>Previous studies showed that TBX3 represses transcription of <italic>p14</italic><sup><italic>ARF</italic></sup> (upstream of p53) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bamshad et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fan et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kumar et al., 2014</xref>), yet embryonic lethality and mammary phenotypes of <italic>Tbx3</italic> mutants are p53-independent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Jerome-Majewska et al., 2005</xref>). Our findings reconcile these observations because CAPERα/TBX3 represses <italic>p16</italic><sup><italic>INK</italic></sup>, the p16/RB pathway is activated in <italic>Tbx3−/−</italic> embryos, and knockdown of either RB or p16 (but not p53) prevents senescence after loss of CAPERα/TBX3.

Our discoveries of multiple CAPERα/TBX3 binding sites across the <italic>CDKN2A</italic> locus, and altered chromatin marks after TBX3 and CAPERα KD, indicate that the complex directly represses transcription by regulating chromatin structure. In total, the data conclusively demonstrate that p16 elevation, <italic>CDK2</italic> and <italic>CDK4</italic> downregulation, and RB hypophosphorylation mediate senescence downstream of CAPERα/TBX3 loss of function in primary human cells and <italic>Tbx3</italic> null mutant embryos.

In contrast, our results support a tumor suppressor/prosenescence function for <italic>UCA1</italic> in primary cells<italic>.

In the case of <italic>UCA1</italic> and hnRNP A1 however, the sequestration has a very specific effect: even though <italic>UCA1</italic> expression stabilizes (and hnRNP A1 destabilizes) both <italic>p16</italic><sup><italic>INK</italic></sup> and <italic>p14</italic><sup><italic>ARF</italic></sup> mRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A,B</xref>), <italic>UCA1</italic> only disrupts the association of hnRNP A1 with <italic>p16</italic><sup><italic>INK</italic></sup> mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s4">Figure 6—figure supplement 4</xref>).

As noted above, expression of <italic>CDKN2A-p14</italic><sup><italic>ARF</italic></sup> and <italic>CDKN1A</italic>-<italic>p21</italic><sup><italic>CIP</italic></sup> are repressed by TBX2 and TBX3 and this is postulated to confer the ability of overexpressed TBX2 and TBX3 to permit senescence bypass of <italic>Bmi1</italic>−/− and SV40 transformed mouse embryonic fibroblasts, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Jacobs et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brummelkamp et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Prince et al., 2004</xref>). Numerous overexpression studies have suggested a role for TBX3 in breast cancer ((<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Liu et al., 2011</xref>) and references therein) and recent papers have reported the tumorigenic and proinvasive effects of overexpressed TBX3 in melanoma cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Peres et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Peres and Prince, 2013</xref>) which may derive in part from TBX3 repression of E-cadherin expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Rodriguez et al., 2008</xref>).

Your article has been favorably evaluated by a Senior editor and 2 reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the other reviewer discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>In this study, Kumar et al. report on the role of corepressor complex composed of Caper and TBX3 in control of senescence. They document the existence of a Caper-TBX3 complex and then show that it is required to prevent senescence. They go on to demonstrate that the Caper-Tbx3 functions to prevent senescence by repression of p16 and RB family members. Most interestingly, they show that Caper-Tbx3 targets and repress a long non-coding RNA, UCA1, and that over-expression of UCA1 is sufficient to induce senescence. They provide evidence that p16 mRNA is bound and destabilized by hnRNP A1 and that UCA1 stabilizes p16 mRNA by sequestering hnRNP A1. Activated Ras, which induces senescence in primary cells, disrupts and inactivates the Caper-TBX3 corepressor resulting in UCA1 expression and senescence induction.</p><p>In general, the major conclusions of the work are interesting and supported by the presented results. However, there are number of areas in which the manuscript can be improved.</p><p>The following issues must be addressed for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>1) It is relatively standard in shRNA experiments to validate the results using a second shRNA against the same target gene to rule out off-target effects. Ideally, two shRNAs should be used for all experiments but minimally this should be done for the initial and key experiments. Two shRNAs to Caper and Tbx3 are mentioned in the methods section but it is not clear which were used in the various experiments and whether any experiment was performed with two shRNAs. This same concern applies to the other shRNAs used in the study, such as that directed against p53.</p><p>2) In the knockdown/ectopic expression rescue experiments, it is not clear whether the ectopically expressed mRNA is subject to RNAi-mediated degradation. This can affect the interpretation of the results.</p><p>For example, in the experiments performed to determine the domain of TBX3 required for interaction with CAPERalpha. Use of shRNAs against TBX3 makes the interpretation of the results difficult, because it might also target some of the TBX3 deletion constructs. It would be preferable to perform these experiments using epitope-tagged TBX3 in the absence of shRNAs against TBX3.</p><p>Also, the rescue experiments using ectopic expression of CAPERalpha are difficult to interpret without knowing the region of CAPERalpha mRNA that is being targeted by the CAPERalpha shRNA. Please provide this information for all the shRNAs in the experimental methodology section. As in point 1 above, the authors should also include a second shRNA for their experiments to rule out shRNA-related “off-target” effects.</p><p>3) Statistical analyses are missing throughout the manuscript. Because of this it is not clear if some of the results presented in the manuscript are statistically significant. Please provide p-values for all of the results.</p><p>4) The reviewers felt that the writing and presentation of the manuscript can be considerably improved. For example, there are uncommon usage of phrases (for example, embryonic mice, rather than mouse embryo; oncogene-induced stress physically dissociate, rather than disrupt; many others).</p><p>In general the figure legends are too sparse for the interested reader to fully understand how the experiments were carried out and presented. <italic>eLife</italic> does not have arbitrary word limits so there is no reason that additional details can't be provided. For example, in the mass spec experiment of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, it is not clear which peaks are those of Caper and there is no information in the legends. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1b, c</xref> and elsewhere there is no description as to what the black and red arrows indicate.</p><p>Finally, in the Method section, I could find no description of the methods used for the RIP experiments.</p><p>The following issues would be desirable to address for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>. We encourage the authors to address as many of these as possible.</p><p>1) The experiments in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref> E-G seem very tangential to the main conclusions of this study. The authors should consider removing these to help focus the manuscript.</p><p>2) For all of the mRNA stability experiments can the authors provide a half-life estimate for the mRNA and discuss whether the half-life measurement is consistent with those obtained in other studies. Also, it would be desirable to confirm at least the key half-life experiments, such as those measuring p16 mRNA, by northern blot to rule out possible amplification artifacts that can arise by PCR.</p><p>3) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>. Can the increased hnRNPA1 binding to UAC1 following Ras expression be attributed to increased UAC1 RNA levels?</p><p>4) Why is H3K27me3 levels measured in some but not all experiments?</p><p>5) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>. In contrast to what is stated in the text, it is not clear that Caper levels markedly decrease in the cytoplasm. Also in panels J and L the magnifications are not equivalent.</p><p>6) The authors use differential display to identify UAC1. This is an older and currently infrequently used procedure. Can the authors provide a rationale for their use of differential display?</p><p>7) The authors show that CAPERalpha/TBX3 regulates histone modifications associated with p16 and UCA1 promoters. However, it is not clear how CAPERalpha/TBX3 achieves this. Are the changes in histone modifications a direct consequence of CAPERalpha/TBX3 activity? It would be desirable if the authors had results that address this issue but minimally the various possibilities should be discussed. Additionally, it would be desirable for these experiments if total RNA polymerase II and elongating RNA polymerase II ChIP results could be included.</p><p>8) The results describing the role of CAPERalpha/TBX3 in premature senescence and oncogene-induced senescence are interesting but do not provide any insight into the role of this CAPERalpha/TBX3 pathway in either the process of aging or RAS-driven tumor initiation. Is there a tumor type where the authors can show this regulation occurs and modulates RAS-induced tumor initiation? This would add an important physiological context. Fibroblast-based experiments do not provide meaningful advances in our understanding for the role of CAPERalpha/TBX3 mediated senescence repression to either aging or tumorigenesis. Also, it will be desirable to determine the state of telomerase expression/activity, telomere length and state of shelterin proteins in the experiments where premature senescence is measured.</p><p>9) There are several previous reports that TBX3 represses cellular senescence. These previous should be discussed. Similarly, there are several reports on the role of long non-coding RNAs in the regulation of cellular senescence and these studies should also be discussed.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.02805.035</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>1<italic>) It is relatively standard in shRNA experiments to validate the results using a second shRNA against the same target gene to rule out off-target effects.

This can affect the interpretation of the results</italic>.</p><p>We completely agree that this is an important consideration and apologize that our strategies to deal with this issue were not made clear.</p><p>In our manuscript that was in press at the time of the original submission and is now published [6], we show that all the mutant Tbx3 (mouse) proteins are produced in TBX3 knockdown HEK293 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure S2</xref> of the published manuscript). We apologize that we did not provide access to this data to the reviewers of the present manuscript and have remedied this by citing the paper, extensively revising the text, legend, and figure in the revised manuscript to more clearly explain the experimental design.</p><p>The DNA binding domain mutants and the ΔRD and exon7 missense mutations are untagged while the C-terminal deletion mutants are Myc-tagged. In order to assay the interactions of the untagged proteins with CAPERα, we needed to use TBX3 shRNA knockdown HEK293 cells. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, panel J shows that CAPERαis present and can be IP’d despite knockdown of endogenous human TBX3 and subsequent overexpression of mutant mouse Tbx3 proteins. Panel J’ shows that the Tbx3 point mutant proteins (L143P, N227D) coIP with CAPERα in an anti-CAPERα IP. We did not think it necessary to show that the mutant proteins were expressed in the knockdown cells since they are detected in the IP with CAPERαand the data demonstrating their production in the knockdown cells are published.</p><p>The deletion constructs were Myc- tagged and did not require assay in knockdown cells and so panels K/K’ are in wild type HEK293 cells. Thus, failure to detect interaction is not attributable to knockdown of the overexpression mutant mRNAs. In this case, because the IP was performed for Myc-Tbx3, panel K shows that the Myc-tagged deletion mutants can be IP’d by the anti-Myc antibody. In Panel K’, probing the anti-Myc IP for CAPERα shows that deletions more proximal than amino acid 655 disrupt the CAPERα/Tbx3 interaction.</p><p>The observation that C-terminal deletions interfere with CAPERα/Tbx3 led us to test whether the C-terminal repressor domain was important for the interaction (K, K’). In this case, because there was no interaction of the untagged ΔRD mutant with CAPERα, we thought it important to show that both the control and ΔRD mutant proteins were produced in the knockdown cells even though this has now been published.</p><p>In addition to revising the text and legend, we have modified the figure to illustrate which proteins are tagged and untagged in the schematic.</p><p>All the data are consistent with the conclusion that the C-terminal portion of Tbx3 and the C-terminal repressor domain are required for interaction with CAPERα.</p><p><italic>For example, in the experiments performed to determine the domain of TBX3 required for interaction with CAPERalpha. Use of shRNAs against TBX3 makes the interpretation of the results difficult, because it might also target some of the TBX3 deletion constructs. It would be preferable to perform these experiments using epitope-tagged TBX3 in the absence of shRNAs against TBX3</italic>.</p><p><italic>Also, the rescue experiments using ectopic expression of CAPERalpha are difficult to interpret without knowing the region of CAPERalpha mRNA that is being targeted by the CAPERalpha shRNA. Please provide this information for all the shRNAs in the experimental methodology section. As in point 1 above, the authors should also include a second shRNA for their experiments to rule out shRNA-related “off-target” effects</italic>.</p><p>These sequences were originally listed in the methods section but not specifically labeled as to which were employed, we have now clarified this and also state the region of the mRNA that is targeted by each shRNA in the Methods section.</p><p><italic>3) Statistical analyses are missing throughout the manuscript. Because of this it is not clear if some of the results presented in the manuscript are statistically significant. Please provide p-values for all of the results</italic>.</p><p>We have now added p values for all data as requested. As is standard for the presentation of qPCR gene expression data, the data is presented in bar graph form with the mean and standard deviation represented as error bars. The p values are relative to control levels, as we are not directly comparing transcript levels TBX3 and CAPERα knockdown to one another; the point we are trying to convey with the expression data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2O</xref> is not that all senescence related genes are dysregulated in a statistically significant manner, but that the overall pattern of change seen in response to loss of TBX3 and CAPERα is similar (as was subsequently confirmed by the transcriptional profiling shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>).</p><p>We have further clarified this point in the text.</p><p>The 3T5 growth curves shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2 E,F, and R</xref> do not have error bars as each point on the population doubling curve represents the total cell count from each plate in an individual experiment. The curves shown are representative of results obtained from 2 independent experiments.</p><p><italic>4) The reviewers felt that the writing and presentation of the manuscript can be considerably improved. For example, there are uncommon usage of phrases (for example, embryonic mice, rather than mouse embryo; oncogene-induced stress physically dissociate, rather than disrupt; many others)</italic>.</p><p>We have had the revised manuscript reviewed by additional readers and made edits requested by the reviewers and suggested by the readers.</p><p><italic>In general the figure legends are too sparse for the interested reader to fully understand how the experiments were carried out and presented.</italic> eLife <italic>does not have arbitrary word limits so there is no reason that additional details can't be provided. For example, in the mass spec experiment of</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1"><italic>Figure 1A</italic></xref><italic>, it is not clear which peaks are those of Caper and there is no information in the legends</italic>.</p><p>We have expanded the legend for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> as requested; the spectrum fragmentation peaks are diagnostic for one of the six peptides that specifically identified CAPERα.

We encourage the authors to address as many of these as possible</italic>.</p><p><italic>1) The experiments in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1"><italic>Figures 1</italic></xref> <italic>E-G seem very tangential to the main conclusions of this study. The authors should consider removing these to help focus the manuscript</italic>.</p><p>We respectfully disagree that the results are tangential as they illustrate key points that led us to pursue the interaction of these two proteins:</p><p>a) Endogenous <italic>Caper</italic>α is very broadly expressed whereas <italic>Tbx3</italic> expression is tissue specific and dynamic. Because we are interested in the developmental implications of this interaction as it may improve our understanding of the mechanisms underlying human ulnar-mammary syndrome associated with mutations in <italic>TBX3</italic>, it was important to determine <italic>in vivo</italic> co-localization in relevant tissues in developing embryos.</p><p>b) Since the data show that the proteins co-localize in the nuclei of some tissue types and not others (particularly apparent when comparing distal limb AER versus mesenchyme), they support the hypothesis that the interaction is regulated and tissue specific.</p><p>We have added this rationale to the text to allow the reader to appreciate our logic for these experiments.</p><p><italic>2) For all of the mRNA stability experiments can the authors provide a half-life estimate for the mRNA and discuss whether the half-life measurement is consistent with those obtained in other studies. Also, it would be desirable to confirm at least the key half-life experiments, such as those measuring p16 mRNA, by northern blot to rule out possible amplification artifacts that can arise by PCR</italic>.</p><p>To obtain the estimated half-lives, we used linear regression on the data shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6 A and B</xref>; those best fit lines, their equations and R values are now shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1 fig6s2">Figure 6–figure supplements 1 and 2</xref>, respectively. The differences in control half-lives between <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6 A and B</xref> are likely attributable to the different control treatments: in A, control cells were transfected with pcDNA3.1 plasmid, while in B, control cells were transfected with control siRNA.</p><p>Note that in panel A, <italic>p16</italic>, <italic>p14</italic> and <italic>E2F1</italic> mRNAs do not decay in the time frame examined and their t<sub>1/2</sub> are denoted as “n” (no decay).</p><p>The half-life of an mRNA is cell/context specific (as evident in the differences in control half-lives in A versus B) and in general, cell cycle regulatory genes have short half-lives [7]. The t<sub>1/2</sub> of <italic>p16</italic> mRNA we observed in HFFs transfected with either control plasmid (t<sub>1/2</sub> ∼3.9) or control siRNA (t<sub>1/2</sub> ∼2.1) is similar to that reported in HeLa cells (t<sub>1/2</sub> ∼2.9) [8]. The results we obtained were also similar to those reported for <italic>MYC</italic> mRNA [7, 9], <italic>CDKN1A</italic> mRNA in HT29-tsp53 cells [10] and ES cells [7], and <italic>E2F1</italic> mRNA in ES cells [7], The half- lives of <italic>Rb</italic> and <italic>TGF</italic>β<italic>1</italic> are mRNAs extremely variable and those we obtained in HFFs were shorter than reported in ES cells [7].

This is an older and currently infrequently used procedure</italic>. <italic>Can the authors provide a rationale for their use of differential display?</italic></p><p>We appreciate the reviewers’ question: the rationale was that we had no funding for this line of investigation and Dr. Kumar already had the library of differential display primers and experience with this approach so at the time, this was the fastest and cheapest way for us to obtain insight into, and compare, what was happening after loss of TBX3 and CAPERα. Even though we knew it was not a comprehensive analysis, it revealed known and novel senescence effectors and because so little was known about <italic>UCA1</italic>, we pursued it.</p><p><italic>7) The authors show that CAPERalpha/TBX3 regulates histone modifications associated with p16 and UCA1 promoters. However, it is not clear how CAPERalpha/TBX3 achieves this. Are the changes in histone modifications a direct consequence of CAPERalpha/TBX3 activity? It would be desirable if the authors had results that address this issue but minimally the various possibilities should be discussed</italic>.</p><p>TBX3 is known to interact directly with HDACs [11] but there are no reports of it, or CAPERα interacting with histone methyltransferases or demethylases. Our recently published Mass Spec screen for Tbx3/TBX3 interactors did not identify such factors however, the screen cannot be considered exhaustive as we did not reproducibly detect HDACs or transcription factors thought to interact with Tbx3. Future studies to specifically determine whether TBX3 and/or CAPERα interact with, recruit, or modify the function of EZH2, SUV39 and other methyltransferases will be informative. For the present manuscript, we have added additional discussion regarding known and potential roles for TBX3/CAPERα to regulate histone modifications.</p><p><italic>Additionally, it would be desirable for these experiments if total RNA polymerase II and elongating RNA polymerase II ChIP results could be included</italic>.</p><p>We appreciate the reviewers’ point, but did not perform these ChIP experiments because we felt that the additional information to be gained was limited since the activating histone modifications observed correlated with the changes in gene expression.</p><p><italic>8) The results describing the role of CAPERalpha/TBX3 in premature senescence and oncogene-induced senescence are interesting but do not provide any insight into the role of this CAPERalpha/TBX3 pathway in either the process of aging or RAS-driven tumor initiation. Is there a tumor type where the authors can show this regulation occurs and modulates RAS-induced tumor initiation? This would add an important physiological context. Fibroblast-based experiments do not provide meaningful advances in our understanding for the role of CAPERalpha/TBX3 mediated senescence repression to either aging or tumorigenesis</italic>.</p><p>We agree that the systems we employed (primary HFFs, mouse embryos and MEFs), while informative models, provide limited information that can be directly applied to aging or tumor initiation without extensive further experimentation. Based on the evidence suggesting that TBX3 influences the formation and progression of breast cancer, we performed a very preliminary assay on 8 human breast cancer tissue samples and 2 controls (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Author response image 1</xref>, below). We assayed whether there was a correlation between the ability to detect CAPERα/TBX3 interaction by co-IP and the type of tissue (normal breast, Invasive ductal CA, Ductal Carcinoma in Situ, other carcinoma) or hormone receptor status. We did not observe any correlation however, these data are too preliminary to draw any conclusions because: 1) the sample size was small; 2) we are unable to perform immunohistochemistry on the available samples due to how they were preserved; 3) we do not have the ability to determine how heterogeneous the samples were. For these reasons, we have not included this data in the present manuscript. In the future, we hope to obtain funding for a study to examine CAPERα and TBX3 immunostaining and interaction in a larger clinical sample in which we have more detailed clinical information, and detailed tumor and control histo- and immune- pathology for each patient.<fig id="fig8" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><graphic xlink:href="elife-02805-resp-fig1-v2"/></fig></p><p>Despite this uninformative preliminary experiment, our models, and the data derived therefrom, do support an important role for CAPERα and TBX3 in regulation of cell proliferation and senescence in developmental contexts. The role of the p16/RB pathway in tumor initiation is cell and context dependent and thus our observation that CAPERα/TBX3 complex regulates this pathway, combined with an increasing literature supporting roles for both TBX3 and CAPERα in multiple aspects of behavior of different tumor types indicate that several complex lines of investigation focused on specific tumor types will need to be pursued. We have added this to the Discussion.</p><p><italic>Also, it will be desirable to determine the state of telomerase expression/activity, telomere length and state of shelterin proteins in the experiments where premature senescence is measured</italic>.</p><p>This manuscript addresses the effects of TBX3/CAPERα and UCA1 on non-telomere dependent mechanisms of senescence induction. Investigating whether TBX3 and/or CAPERα could additionally influence senescence by regulating telomere function is an interesting question, but it is beyond the scope of this paper.</p><p><italic>9) There are several previous reports that TBX3 represses cellular senescence. These previous should be discussed. Similarly, there are several reports on the role of long non-coding RNAs in the regulation of cellular senescence and these studies should also be discussed</italic>.</p><p>In the original manuscript, we presented the fact that expression of <italic>CDKN2A-p14</italic><sup><italic>ARF</italic></sup> and <italic>CDKN1A</italic>-<italic>p21</italic><sup><italic>CIP</italic></sup> are repressed by TBX2 and TBX3 and that this mechanism has been proposed to account for the ability of overexpressed TBX2 and TBX3 to permit senescence bypass of <italic>Bmi1</italic>-/- and SV40 transformed mouse embryonic fibroblasts, respectively [12-14]_ENREF_7. Numerous overexpression studies have suggested a role for TBX3 in breast cancer initiation and progression (reviewed in [15, 16]) and recent papers have reported the tumorigenic and proinvasive effects of overexpressed TBX3 in melanoma cells [17, 18] which may in part result from repression of E-cadherin expression [19]. More relevant to our work on the importance of the CAPERα/TBX3 complex to prevent senescence and regulate cell proliferation are studies reporting that Tbx3 improves the pluripotency of iPS cells [20] and prevents differentiation of mouse ES cells [21]. As of this writing, we have found no other studies directed at the role of TBX3 in repressing senescence in primary cells or <italic>in vivo</italic> and this is one of the important contributions of our manuscript. We have added this information to the Discussion section as requested by the reviewers.</p><p>Regarding lncRNAs in senescence, although there has been a logarithmic increase in studies exploring their expression and function, lncRNA regulation of senescence remains largely unexplored. LncRNA <italic>HOTAIR</italic> has been shown to function as a scaffold to regulate ubiquitination of Ataxin-1 and Snurportin-1 to prevent premature senescence [22]. Global alterations in lncRNA expression have been reported in association with replicative senescence and telomere specific lncRNAs that regulate telomere during this process have been identified function [23, 24]. We found no reports of lncRNAs sufficient to induce senescence.</p><p>We have added the above information to the Discussion as requested by the reviewers.</p><p><italic>References</italic></p><p>1.
