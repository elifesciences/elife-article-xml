One such factor, TRRAP, functions as part of two large complexes, SAGA and TIP60, which have crucial roles during transcription activation. Structurally, TRRAP belongs to the phosphoinositide 3 kinase-related kinases (PIKK) family but is the only member classified as a pseudokinase. Recent studies established that a dedicated HSP90 co-chaperone, the triple T (TTT) complex, is essential for PIKK stabilization and activity. Here, using endogenous auxin-inducible degron alleles, we show that the TTT subunit TELO2 promotes TRRAP assembly into SAGA and TIP60 in human colorectal cancer cells (CRCs). Transcriptomic analysis revealed that TELO2 contributes to TRRAP regulatory roles in CRC cells, most notably of MYC target genes. Surprisingly, TELO2 and TRRAP depletion also induced the expression of type I interferon genes. Using a combination of nascent RNA, antibody-targeted chromatin profiling (CUT&amp;RUN), ChIP, and kinetic analyses, we propose a model by which TRRAP directly represses the transcription of <italic>IRF9</italic>, which encodes a master regulator of interferon-stimulated genes. We have therefore uncovered an unexpected transcriptional repressor role for TRRAP, which we propose contributes to its tumorigenic activity.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>transcription</kwd><kwd>chaperone</kwd><kwd>PIKK</kwd><kwd>interferon</kwd><kwd>colorectal cancer</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004097</institution-id><institution>Fondation ARC pour la Recherche sur le Cancer</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PJA-20181208277</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Helmlinger</surname><given-names>Dominique</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100006364</institution-id><institution>Institut National Du Cancer</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PLBIO 2016-161</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Pradet-Balade</surname><given-names>Berengere</given-names></name><name><surname>Helmlinger</surname><given-names>Dominique</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Ligue Nationale Contre le Cancer</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Graduate Student Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Detilleux</surname><given-names>Dylane</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Ligue Nationale Contre le Cancer</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Comité Hérault</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Raynaud</surname><given-names>Peggy</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A transcriptional coactivator turns into a repressor at specific genes in colorectal cancer cells.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Transcriptional regulation is crucial for cells to adapt to external changes, for example, during development or to maintain homeostasis. A critical step in gene expression is the initiation of transcription, which is controlled by both <italic>cis</italic>- and <italic>trans</italic>-regulatory mechanisms. These include the coordinated activities of large, multimeric complexes that modify histones or remodel nucleosomes at promoters. These complexes often function as coactivators, bridging DNA-bound transcription factors to the general transcription machinery. By interacting with many transcription factors, coactivators integrate <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory information from multiple inputs and have important roles in establishing specific gene expression programs. The evolutionary conserved TIP60 and SAGA complexes are two paradigmatic examples of such multifunctional coactivator complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Lu et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Helmlinger and Tora, 2017</xref>). SAGA carries histone acetyltransferase (HAT) and de-ubiquitination (DUB) activities, which preferentially target histone H3 and H2B, respectively. Similar to the general transcription factor TFIID, with which it shares four core TAF subunits in humans, SAGA delivers TBP to specific promoters, stimulating pre-initiation complex (PIC) assembly. TIP60 also carries HAT activity and, through the EP400 subunit, catalyzes deposition of the H2A.Z variant. TIP60 acetylates histones H4 and H2A, as well as the histone variant H2A.Z.</p><p>SAGA and TIP60 share one component, named TRRAP in mammals or Tra1 in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Grant et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Vassilev et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Allard et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Saleh et al., 1998</xref>). The primary role of Tra1/TRRAP is to recruit SAGA and TIP60 to specific promoters upon binding of an activator. TRRAP was initially discovered as a coactivator for the c-MYC and E2F transcription factors and is essential for their oncogenic activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">McMahon et al., 1998</xref>). Further work demonstrated that many additional activators require Tra1 or TRRAP to stimulate transcription initiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Park et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Bouchard et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Lang et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Deleu et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Ard et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Lang and Hearing, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Memedula and Belmont, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Knutson and Hahn, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Lin et al., 2012</xref>). Work in yeast demonstrated that Tra1 physically interacts with the transactivation domain of activators in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Brown et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bhaumik and Green, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bhaumik et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Fishburn et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Reeves and Hahn, 2005</xref>). Accordingly, genetic studies showed that TRRAP activates the expression of genes involved in a number of important processes. In mammals, these include cell cycle progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Herceg et al., 2001</xref>), mitotic checkpoints (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Li et al., 2004</xref>), the maintenance of a pool of stem or progenitor cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Loizou et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib112">Wurdak et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Tapias et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Tauc et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Sawan et al., 2013</xref>), and the regulation of cellular differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">Wang et al., 2018</xref>). However, the direct regulatory roles of Tra1/TRRAP have been challenging to study because TRRAP is essential for cell proliferation and early embryonic development in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Herceg et al., 2001</xref>). Phenotypic analyses have thus relied on partial depletion and conditional knock-out strategies, which are limited by the slow kinetics and irreversibility of the disruption.</p><p>TRRAP is an evolutionary conserved member of an atypical family of kinases, called phosphoinositide 3 kinase-related kinases (PIKK), with which it shares a characteristic domain architecture. However, TRRAP lacks all catalytic residues and is therefore the sole pseudokinase of this family (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Elías-Villalobos et al., 2019a</xref>). Active PIKKs are implicated in diverse processes. ATM, ATR, and DNA-PKcs control DNA repair and telomere homeostasis, mTOR modulates cell growth, proliferation, and survival in response to metabolic inputs, and SMG-1 mediates nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Elías-Villalobos et al., 2019a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Lempiäinen and Halazonetis, 2009</xref>). Elegant studies have demonstrated that PIKKs require a dedicated HSP90 co-chaperone, the triple T (TTT) complex, for their stabilization and incorporation into active complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Takai et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Anderson et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Takai et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Hurov et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Kaizuka et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Izumi et al., 2010</xref>). TTT was initially discovered in the fission yeast <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic> and is composed of three conserved, specific subunits, TELO2, TTI1, and TTI2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Takai et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hayashi et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Shevchenko et al., 2008</xref>). Biochemical evidence suggests a model by which TTT targets the pleiotropic HSP90 chaperone to PIKKs specifically. Mechanistically, TTT recruits HSP90 through the phosphorylation-dependent interaction of TELO2 with the R2TP complex, formed by RPAP3, PIH1D1, and the AAA+ ATPases RUVBL1 and RUVBL2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Horejsí et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Hořejší et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Pal et al., 2014</xref>). Functional studies in various organisms have implicated TTT, particularly TELO2, in PIKK signaling in response to DNA damage or metabolic stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Takai et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Anderson et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Hurov et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Kaizuka et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ahmed et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Shikata et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Izumi et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Kim et al., 2013</xref>). More recent work showed that TTT itself can respond to signaling cues, such as nutrient levels, to modulate PIKK levels, localization, or substrate binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Kim et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Rao et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">David-Morrison et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Brown and Gromeier, 2017</xref>). In contrast, the effect of TTT on the incorporation of the TRRAP pseudokinase into the SAGA or TIP60 complexes and on their transcription regulatory roles remains poorly characterized, despite evidence that TTT interacts with and stabilizes TRRAP in mammalian cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Takai et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Hurov et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Kaizuka et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Izumi et al., 2012</xref>). We recently showed that, in fission yeast, TTT promotes Tra1 stabilization and complex assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Elías-Villalobos et al., 2019b</xref>). Interestingly, however, <italic>S. pombe</italic> apparently lacks orthologs of the R2TP-specific subunits RPAP3 and PIH1D1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Inoue et al., 2017</xref>), suggesting that the mechanism of PIKK complex assembly may differ between species. In addition, little is known about how the SAGA and TIP60 complexes are assembled in mammals, which chaperones are required, and whether TRRAP is incorporated into each complex by similar or distinct mechanisms.</p><p>Here, we characterized the role of TTT in gene expression and its contribution to TRRAP regulatory activities. Using CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing, we fused an auxin-inducible degron (AID) to the endogenous TELO2 or TRRAP proteins in human HCT116 colorectal cancer cells (CRCs). Biochemical and functional analyses indicated that TELO2 controls TRRAP activity in several ways. First, TELO2 promotes the incorporation of TRRAP into both SAGA and TIP60 complexes. Second, TELO2 regulates the expression of a large fraction of TRRAP-dependent genes. Most genes were previously annotated as targets of c-MYC and E2Fs, suggesting that TTT has an important role in sustaining the activities of these oncogenic transcription factors in CRC cells. Unexpectedly, we also found that both TTT and TRRAP inhibit the expression of type I interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs). Taking advantage of the rapid kinetics and reversibility of the degron allele, we provide evidence that TRRAP is a new, direct transcriptional repressor of the <italic>IRF7</italic> and <italic>IRF9</italic> genes, which encode master regulators of ISG induction. To conclude, our work shows that TRRAP, although a pseudokinase, shares a dedicated chaperone machinery with its cognate kinases for its stability and function. Furthermore, we have identified an unexpected repressive role of TRRAP in the transcription regulation of a subset of genes important for innate immunity and resistance to chemotherapy in CRC cells.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Rapid and efficient depletion of TELO2 and TRRAP using an auxin-inducible degron</title><p>Previous work reported that the TTT components TELO2, TTI1, and TTI2 stabilize TRRAP levels at steady state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Takai et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Hurov et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Kaizuka et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Izumi et al., 2012</xref>). We therefore sought to determine whether and how TTT contributes to TRRAP-dependent gene regulation. For this aim, we first asked if TTT promotes the incorporation of TRRAP into the SAGA and TIP60 coactivator complexes.</p><p>Our initial attempts to knock down TTT components in HCT116 CRC cells using RNA interference (RNAi) produced inconclusive results. We reasoned that, to observe the effects of a chaperone on its clients, we need an inducible depletion strategy that targets protein levels directly. Such systems allow assaying phenotypes rapidly after protein depletion and facilitate the ordering of mechanistic events. In addition, a conditional approach was dictated by the observations that both TELO2 and TRRAP are essential for early embryonic development and cell proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Herceg et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Takai et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>For this, we constructed HCT116 cell lines in which an AID sequence is integrated at the endogenous <italic>TELO2</italic> or <italic>TRRAP</italic> loci. The AID system mediates proteasomal-dependent degradation of AID-tagged proteins through auxin-mediated interaction with the F-box protein transport inhibitor response 1 (TIR1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Nishimura et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Holland et al., 2012</xref>). We first generated an HCT116 cell line that stably expresses <italic>Oryza sativa</italic> (OsTIR1). One cell line, which we will refer to as parental control (control), was then used for CRISPR-Cas9-mediated biallelic integration of an AID sequence encoding a full-length IAA17-derived degron (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A and B</xref>). We also included a YFP fluorescent tag to allow clone selection. We integrated the AID-YFP tag at the 3′-end of <italic>TELO2</italic>. In contrast, we targeted the 5′-end of <italic>TRRAP</italic> because its C-terminal FATC domain is critical for function in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Hoke et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Helmlinger et al., 2011</xref>). We also inserted repeated HA epitopes and a 2A peptide (P2A) between the YFP and HA-AID sequences to cleave off the YFP tag during translation in order to lower the risks of affecting TRRAP function with a long fusion sequence. After transfection, sorting, clonal dilution, and amplification, we amplified about 60 clones that showed normal proliferation rates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C and D</xref>). We then identified homozygous clones using Western blot with antibodies against endogenous TELO2 and TRRAP by screening for the appearance of a slower-migrating band, indicative of a size shift (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E and F</xref>). For each tagged protein, three distinct homozygous clones were isolated and further characterized.</p><p>We found that auxin addition induces a rapid and robust depletion of either TELO2<sup>AID</sup> or <sup>AID</sup>TRRAP, whose levels become undetectable after 4 hr of treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and B</xref>). Depletion of either TELO2 or TRRAP progressively decreases the proliferation rate of HCT116 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C and D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C and D</xref>), consistent with previous results in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Herceg et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Takai et al., 2007</xref>). As expected, prolonged TELO2 depletion reduces the steady-state levels of the TRRAP, ATM, ATR, and mTOR proteins and impairs mTORC1 activity, as illustrated with p70-S6K phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E</xref>). Similarly, prolonged TRRAP depletion reduces the expression of the Cyclin A2 (<italic>CCNA2</italic>) gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1F</xref>), which is a known target of TRRAP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib112">Wurdak et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Tapias et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Herceg et al., 2003</xref>). Finally, we verified that cell proliferation and PIKK levels are not affected upon treating the parental, TIR1-expressing control cell line with either auxin or its vehicle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C and D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C–F</xref>).

Cellular fractionation followed by Western blot analysis showed that endogenous TELO2 is detected in cytoplasmic extracts (CE), but not in nuclear extracts (NE) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). We observed a similar pattern of the YFP fluorescence signal of TELO2-AID cells using live microscopy (data not shown). In contrast, TRRAP is predominantly nuclear (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>), consistent with its function and published immunofluorescence microscopy staining (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib112">Wurdak et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">Wang et al., 2018</xref>). Nonetheless, TRRAP can also be observed in the cytoplasmic fraction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Immunoprecipitation of TRRAP from each compartment showed that TELO2 interacts specifically with the cytoplasmic fraction of TRRAP, but not the nuclear fraction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). We noticed that TELO2 depletion primarily affects nuclear TRRAP levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E and F</xref>), suggesting that TELO2 binds newly synthesized TRRAP in the cytoplasm to promote its assembly into SAGA and TIP60, which would then be imported into the nucleus.</p><p>We therefore examined the effect of TELO2 on TRRAP incorporation into each complex. For this, we treated TELO2<sup>AID</sup> cells with auxin for only 24 hr, a time point when TRRAP levels remain unchanged (input in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G and H</xref>). Immunoprecipitation of the SAGA-specific subunit SUPT3H showed a reduced interaction with TRRAP upon TELO2 depletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>).

Similarly, we observed a reduced interaction between TRRAP and the TIP60-specific component EP400 upon TELO2 depletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>). Overall, we conclude that TELO2 promotes TRRAP stability, nuclear localization, and incorporation into the SAGA and TIP60 complexes.

This observation suggests that TRRAP, despite being about 420 kDa and the largest subunit of SAGA, might be dispensable for SAGA’s overall integrity and function, as demonstrated in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Elías-Villalobos et al., 2019b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Helmlinger et al., 2011</xref>). To explore this possibility further, we tested the role of TRRAP in the expression of SAGA-dependent genes during the unfolded protein response (UPR). For this, we monitored UPR gene expression, which requires SAGA for induction in response to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress in human cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Nagy et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Lang et al., 2011</xref>).

Taken together, these results suggest that TRRAP does not have a major contribution to SAGA integrity and function at these genes. Thus, despite its large size and absence of catalytic activity, TRRAP is presumably not a core subunit of SAGA in human cells, consistent with recent structural studies revealing its peripheral localization within the complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Papai et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">Wang et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Herbst et al., 2021</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>TELO2 and TRRAP have overlapping regulatory roles in gene expression</title><p>We next sought to characterize the role of TTT in gene expression and its contribution to TRRAP regulatory roles.

Indeed, a majority of genes whose expression decreases upon TELO2 depletion (152/212) are downregulated in TRRAP-depleted cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Likewise, almost half of the genes whose expression increases upon TELO2 depletion (118/258) are upregulated in TRRAP-depleted cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>).

We found that the set of genes downregulated upon TRRAP depletion is mostly enriched for MYC or E2Fs target genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, lower panels). This observation confirms that TRRAP is a coactivator of the c-MYC and E2Fs transcription factors in HCT116 cells, similar to its role in other mammalian cell types. Remarkably, the set of genes activated by TELO2 was also enriched for MYC or E2Fs targets, with comparable enrichment scores (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, upper panels). Therefore, TELO2 is a novel regulator of the c-MYC and E2Fs transcriptional factors in HCT116 CRC cells, presumably through its role in promoting TRRAP incorporation into the SAGA and TIP60 coactivator complexes.</p><p>Despite these similarities, we also observed differences between each transcriptome profile. First, differentially expressed genes are quantitatively more affected upon TRRAP depletion than upon TELO2 depletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C and D</xref>). Second, TRRAP regulates a higher number of genes than TELO2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C and D</xref>). Specifically, most genes that are either downregulated (1125/1277) or upregulated (832/950) upon TRRAP depletion remain unchanged in absence of TELO2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). These differences likely result from the incomplete depletion of TRRAP at this time point of auxin treatment in TELO2<sup>AID</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E and F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E</xref>). Finally, a TORC1 signaling hallmark was specifically enriched in the gene set regulated by TELO2, consistent with its well-characterized roles in TORC1 assembly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Takai et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Kaizuka et al., 2010</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>TELO2 and TRRAP repress type I interferon-stimulated genes</title><p>Unexpectedly, our ontology analysis also revealed that both TELO2 and TRRAP regulate the expression of genes induced by type I interferons (IFN-I). Using an adjusted p-value threshold of 0.05, we found that nearly one-third of the 97 ISGs (28/97) from the IFNα response hallmark is differentially expressed in the absence of TELO2 and TRRAP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, right panels). However, in contrast to the activation of MYC and E2Fs targets, we observed that most ISGs (23/28) are repressed by TELO2 and TRRAP (23/28), whereas they activate the expression of only a few ISGs (5/28) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>).

To strengthen this observation, we performed RT-qPCR analyses of selected ISGs. We measured the expression of <italic>IRF7</italic>, which encodes a transcription factor acting as a master regulator of IFN-I production and signaling, and of two downstream effectors of this pathway, 2'–5'-oligoadenylate synthetase 1 (<italic>OAS1)</italic> and interferon-induced protein with tetratricopeptide repeats 1 (<italic>IFIT1)</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Schoggins, 2019</xref>). All three genes exhibit increased mRNA levels upon depletion of either TELO2 or TRRAP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E and F</xref>).

Western blot analyses showed no detectable increase in IRF3 Ser396 phosphorylation and STAT1 Ser727 phosphorylation upon TRRAP depletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). IRF3 and STAT1 phosphorylation levels remain unchanged both at early and late time points of TRRAP depletion. We noted that IRF3 and STAT1 protein levels did not change, although RNA-seq showed a modest 1.7-fold increase in STAT1 mRNA levels (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). As a control, we treated <sup>AID</sup>TRRAP cells with a double-stranded (ds) RNA mimic, polyinosinic acid:polycytidylic acid (poly(I:C)), which is a potent IFN-I inducer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Field et al., 1967</xref>). As expected, poly(I:C) induced IRF3 and STAT1 phosphorylation, validating our experimental conditions and indicating that a functional innate immune response can be triggered in <sup>AID</sup>TRRAP HCT116 cell lines. Therefore, TRRAP depletion induces ISG expression without activating the PRR and IFN-I signaling pathways and presumably acts downstream of the IRF3 and IRF7 transcription regulators.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>Kinetic analysis of ISG regulation by TRRAP</title><p>While performing this analysis, we noticed that different innate immune response factors accumulate with apparently distinct kinetics in TRRAP-depleted cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C and D</xref>). Specifically, the IRF7 and IRF9 transcription factors accumulate earlier than the dsRNA sensor DDX58 (RIG-I). We thus took advantage of the kinetics of the degron system to better characterize the dynamics of ISG expression upon TRRAP depletion in an attempt to order phenotypic events. For this, we used quantitative RT-PCR to follow the expression of representative ISGs over a time course of auxin treatment in <sup>AID</sup>TRRAP cells. This analysis showed that the relative mRNA levels of <italic>IRF9</italic> change rapidly, increasing about twofold already 5 hr after auxin addition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>), which is concomitant with the loss of a detectable TRRAP signal by Western blot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). However, <italic>IRF9</italic> levels do not increase noticeably beyond 10 hr of TRRAP depletion and reach a plateau around fourfold. In contrast, <italic>IRF7</italic> mRNA levels gradually increase over a period of 24 hr of TRRAP depletion and accumulate with a slight delay compared to <italic>IRF9</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). Western blot analyses showed the same trend. IRF7 progressively accumulates over the time course of TRRAP depletion, whereas IRF9 begins to level off at an earlier time point, around 15 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C and D</xref>). Finally, we found that the expression of ISGF3 targets, including <italic>RIG-I</italic>, <italic>OAS1</italic>, <italic>IFIT1</italic>, and <italic>MX1,</italic> gradually increases upon TRRAP depletion, similar to <italic>IRF7</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). Likewise, Western blotting showed that RIG-I upregulation is detectable only 24 hr after auxin addition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). Altogether, the progressive accumulation of ISGs indicates that this phenotype appears early after the loss of TRRAP, rather than at late time points. Furthermore, this kinetic analysis indicates that the IRF9 transcription factor is induced earlier than its target genes, including <italic>IRF7</italic>.</p></sec><sec id="s2-8"><title>TRRAP represses a specific subset of ISGs</title><p>We next sought to determine how TRRAP modulates ISG expression without activating an innate immune response or the IFN-I signaling pathway. Accumulating evidence highlights the existence of non-canonical regulatory mechanisms of ISG transcription. Notably, high levels of IRF9 alone are sufficient to trigger ISG transcription in HCT116 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Kolosenko et al., 2015</xref>). Indeed, IRF9 and STAT2 can form STAT1-independent complexes that drive specific transcriptional programs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Fink and Grandvaux, 2014</xref>). Here, our RNA-seq, quantitative RT-PCR, and Western blot analyses indicate that IRF9 levels increase about fourfold (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C and E</xref>). In contrast, STAT1 and STAT2 levels do not change (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B and C</xref>). Thus, TRRAP depletion induces a progressive accumulation of IRF9, but neither activation nor overexpression of its partners STAT1 and STAT2.</p><p>Work in both normal and cancer cells demonstrated that IRF9 can assemble with unphosphorylated STAT1 and STAT2 to form the unphosphorylated ISGF3 (U-ISGF3) complex. U-ISGF3 induces the transcription of a subset of 29 ISGs and sustains their prolonged, constitutive expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Cheon et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Sung et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Platanitis et al., 2019</xref>). In contrast, the phosphorylated form of ISGF3 activates an additional 49 ISGs upon acute IFN-I signaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). We thus compiled a list of 148 ISGs, combining the ISGs from the MSigDB IFNα response hallmark gene set (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Liberzon et al., 2015</xref>) with the U-ISGF3- and ISGF3-regulated ISGs defined in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Cheon et al., 2013</xref>. Of these, 113 ISGs were detected and quantified in our RNA-seq experiments (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>). Using an adjusted p-value threshold of 0.05, we found that TRRAP regulates the mRNA levels of about a third of all ISGs (39/113), mostly negatively (30/39) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>). Interestingly, we noticed that the effect of TRRAP on all 113 ISGs shows a bimodal distribution (gray violin plot, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>), suggesting that TRRAP regulates a specific subset of ISGs. To compare the effect of TRRAP on U-ISGF3- and ISGF3-regulated genes, we plotted each set separately and observed that TRRAP primarily represses U-ISGF3-dependent genes, while ISGF3-dependent genes remain largely unaffected (compare green and orange violin plots, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). Specifically, the expression of 20 of the 28 U-ISGF3-dependent genes increases at least 1.5-fold in TRRAP-depleted cells, whereas only 6 of the 35 ISGF3-dependent genes are induced. Finally, we determined whether specific transcription factor binding sites are enriched in the set of 39 ISGs regulated by TRRAP using the i-<italic>cis</italic>Target and Pscan tools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib114">Zambelli et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Imrichová et al., 2015</xref>). This analysis identified the interferon-stimulated response element (ISRE) as the most enriched motif in the promoter regions of TRRAP-regulated ISGs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>). ISREs are specifically recognized by IRF9 homo- or heterodimers, as well as the ISGF3 complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Negishi et al., 2018</xref>), suggesting that IRF9 upregulation is sufficient to induce ISG expression in TRRAP-depleted cells, independently of IFN-I signaling. IRF7-binding sites were the second most enriched motifs in the set of TRRAP-regulated ISGs. In agreement with this observation, IRF7 protein levels progressively accumulate upon TRRAP depletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>), consistent with the 2.6-fold increase observed by RNA-seq (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>).</p><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>TRRAP specifically represses U-ISGF3-regulated genes.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic representation of the transcription regulation of distinct subsets of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs), depending on whether ISGF3 unphosphorylated, in basal conditions (U-ISGF3, left), or phosphorylated in response to IFN-I signaling (ISGF3, right).

Although chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) is typically used to identify genomic regions occupied by transcription regulators, this procedure suffers from poor signal-to-noise ratio, particularly for factors that do not bind DNA directly, such as TRRAP and TRRAP-containing complexes. To overcome this problem, we implemented a novel profiling strategy, called Cleavage Under Targets and Release Using Nuclease followed by high-throughput sequencing (CUT&amp;RUN-seq) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Skene and Henikoff, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Meers et al., 2019</xref>). This technique is based on targeted endogenous cleavage of chromatin by micrococcal nuclease (MNase), which is directed to the protein of interest using a specific antibody. Overall, CUT&amp;RUN avoids formaldehyde crosslinking, which can yield misleading results and mask epitopes, and generates very little noise because undigested chromatin and genomic DNA are not extracted.</p><p>To benchmark our protocol against the published procedure, we assessed TRRAP occupancy at a well-characterized MYC-bound locus. We reasoned that TRRAP binding reflects that of MYC because they interact both physically and functionally in many cell lines. Accordingly, our RNA-seq analysis shows that TRRAP activates MYC target genes in HCT116 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). We selected the <italic>MIR17-HG</italic> gene, which encodes an oncomir precursor, is a prominent target of MYC in cancer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Li et al., 2014</xref>), and is activated by TRRAP in HCT116 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1F</xref>). Analysis of published MYC CUT&amp;RUN-seq data confirmed that it binds to a large region of the <italic>MIR17-HG</italic> promoter in human K562 chronic myeloid leukemia cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Skene and Henikoff, 2017</xref>). In agreement, using conventional quantitative PCR of DNA fragments released after an anti-MYC CUT&amp;RUN analysis, we found that MYC binds to the promoter of <italic>MIR17-HG</italic> in HCT116 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>), validating our protocol. To measure TRRAP binding, we performed CUT&amp;RUN-qPCR using an anti-HA antibody that recognizes the repeated HA epitopes fused to the N-terminal end of <sup>AID</sup>TRRAP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). This strategy was remarkably efficient to profile endogenous TRRAP chromatin occupancy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Indeed, we observed a strong footprint signal of TRRAP at the promoter region of <italic>MIR17-HG</italic>. Comparison with several negative controls confirmed the robustness and specificity of this observation. First, TRRAP binding at <italic>MIR17HG</italic> is about 60-fold above that observed using control rabbit IgGs. Second, enrichment at the promoter is specific because only background signals are detected downstream, in the gene body. Third, auxin-mediated TRRAP depletion reduces the HA signal to background levels. Interestingly, TRRAP depletion also reduces the binding of MYC to <italic>MIR17-HG</italic>, suggesting that TRRAP contributes to MYC recruitment to promoters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>). We verified that this effect is specific to TRRAP depletion as MYC binding remains unaffected in parental, TIR1-expressing HCT116 cells treated with auxin.</p><p>We then measured the genome-wide occupancy of TRRAP using high-throughput sequencing (CUT&amp;RUN-seq). As controls, we performed a similar anti-HA CUT&amp;RUN-seq after auxin-mediated TRRAP depletion and included a rabbit IgG CUT&amp;RUN-seq sample. Visualization of aligned reads immediately identified many TRRAP-dependent footprints on the genome, with a high signal-to noise ratio compared to both control conditions. Statistical analysis of enriched genomic regions using the MACS2 algorithm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib115">Zhang et al., 2008</xref>) identified 22,219 peaks of TRRAP binding, which decreased down to 849 peaks upon auxin-mediated TRRAP depletion (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref>). Plotting the distribution of the position of each peak relative to the position of the nearest TSS revealed that TRRAP binds mostly within about 300 base pairs (bp) of the TSS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). This range corresponds to the median size of nucleosome-depleted regions (NDRs) measured by NOMe-seq in HCT116 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Lay et al., 2015</xref>), indicating that TRRAP predominantly binds promoter-proximal regions.

Visualization on a heatmap ranked by basal transcript levels demonstrated that TRRAP binds to most genes that are detectably expressed in proliferating HCT116 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>).

We noticed that TRRAP appears to bind genes that are modestly induced upon its depletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>), suggesting that TRRAP does not have a strong repressive role. Conversely, only 16% of genes (211/1277) are presumably indirectly activated by TRRAP, whereas a higher fraction of genes, about one-third (326/950), are indirectly repressed.

We found that, 6 hr after auxin removal, TRRAP occupancy is similar to that observed in control conditions, suggesting that TRRAP binding is highly dynamic at these promoters.

Using an inducible degron for rapid and robust depletion of endogenous proteins, we demonstrate that the TTT subunit TELO2 promotes TRRAP assembly into functional complexes, SAGA and TIP60, and contributes to TRRAP regulatory roles in gene expression. Functional and transcriptomic analyses indicate that both TELO2 and TRRAP promote proliferation of CRC cells and regulate an overlapping set of genes, including MYC targets. We also uncovered an unexpected negative role of TRRAP in the expression of a subset of type I ISGs. Notably, we accumulated evidence that TRRAP acts as a transcriptional repressor of <italic>IRF9</italic>, which encodes a subunit of the ISGF3 regulatory complex. Our findings suggest that TRRAP and its chaperone TTT might contribute to colorectal tumorigenesis by promoting a specific transcriptional program, both as a coactivator of c-MYC and a repressor of specific ISGF3 targets.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Chaperone-mediated biogenesis and regulation of the TRRAP pseudokinase</title><p>TRRAP is a member of the PIKK family of atypical kinases. Studies in mammals revealed that the pleiotropic HSP90 chaperone is specifically recruited to PIKKs by a dedicated cochaperone, the TTT complex, to promote their stability and incorporation into active complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Takai et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Anderson et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Takai et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Hurov et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Kaizuka et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Izumi et al., 2012</xref>). In contrast, the effect of TTT on the TRRAP pseudokinase, the only inactive PIKK, is less characterized. Previous work showed that TTT stabilizes TRRAP in human cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Takai et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Hurov et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Kaizuka et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Izumi et al., 2012</xref>). Furthermore, the yeast ortholog of TRRAP, Tra1, also requires TTT and Hsp90 for stability, incorporation into the NuA4 and SAGA coactivator complexes, and function in gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Elías-Villalobos et al., 2019b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Genereaux et al., 2012</xref>). Here, conditional and rapid depletion of endogenous TELO2 allowed us to better characterize the role of TTT in TRRAP biogenesis and functions in human cells. Our results suggest a model by which TELO2 promotes the cytoplasmic assembly of TRRAP-containing complexes, TIP60 and SAGA, and regulates the expression of a large number of TRRAP-dependent genes. Altogether, these studies indicate that TTT functional roles are conserved between yeast and mammals. Therefore, despite its lack of catalytic activity, Tra1/TRRAP shares a dedicated chaperone machinery with active PIKK kinases for assembly and function. Phylogenetic analyses of PIKK orthologs show that Tra1/TRRAP appeared early in the eukaryotic lineage, concomitantly with all other PIKKs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Elías-Villalobos et al., 2019a</xref>). Although catalytic residues diverge, all TRRAP orthologs harbor the distinctive domain architecture of PIKKs, including the highly conserved FAT and kinase domains. Similar to PIKKs, orthologs of TELO2 and TTI1 are found in the genomes of species representative of all major eukaryotic clades (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Elías-Villalobos et al., 2019a</xref>). We thus propose that the requirement of PIKKs for a dedicated cochaperone explains the selection pressure observed on the sequence and domain organization of the Tra1/TRRAP pseudokinase.</p><p>Finally, our work indicates that assembly of the NuA4/TIP60 and SAGA complexes requires the HSP90 cochaperone TTT, contributing to the emerging concept that dedicated mechanisms and chaperones control the de novo assembly of transcription complexes. For example, a recent study showed that human TAF5 and its paralog TAF5L, which are specific to the general transcription factor TFIID and SAGA, respectively, require the CCT chaperonin for incorporation into preassembled modules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Antonova et al., 2018</xref>). An alternative mechanism, involving cotranslational interactions between other SAGA subunits, was recently described in yeast and human cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Kassem et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Kamenova et al., 2019</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Inhibitory roles of TRRAP in ISG expression</title><p>We show here that TELO2 and TRRAP regulate the expression of an overlapping set of genes. Notably, we found that TELO2 is important for the activation of MYC and E2F target genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). In agreement, TRRAP is essential for transcription activation by MYC and E2F and contributes to their oncogenic functions during tumorigenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">McMahon et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Park et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Bouchard et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Lang et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Nikiforov et al., 2002</xref>). Unexpectedly, we found that TELO2 and TRRAP also repress several genes, particularly those mediating the IFN-I response during innate immunity. Because TRRAP has well-established roles in transcription activation, rather than repression, we decided to characterize this phenotype further.</p><p>The IFN-I signaling pathway is divided into two branches that define an early and a late response, and involves five major transcription factors. Following detection of ‘non-self’ elements, such as pathogens, PRR signaling leads to activation of the IRF3 and IRF7 transcription factors and production of IFN-Is during the early response. Then, these cytokines activate autocrine and paracrine JAK kinase signaling to induce the formation of the ISGF3 transcription factor complex during the late response. ISGF3 comprises the IRF9, STAT1, and STAT2 transcription factors, which activate several ISGs encoding downstream effectors of IFN-I signaling and innate immunity. ISGF3 also activates <italic>IRF7</italic>, <italic>IRF9</italic>, <italic>STAT1</italic>, and <italic>STAT2</italic> expression to establish a positive feedback loop (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). We found that neither the PRR nor the IFN-I signaling pathways are activated upon TRRAP depletion. Rather, TRRAP represses a specific subset of ISGs, named U-ISGs, likely by directly inhibiting <italic>IRF7</italic> and <italic>IRF9</italic> transcription. Four lines of evidence support this model. First, TRRAP depletion induces ISGs independently of PRR and IFN-I signaling pathway activation, as shown by the lack of IRF3 and STAT1 phosphorylation, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Second, time-course analyses suggest that IRF7 and IRF9 accumulation precedes that of its target genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C–E</xref>). Third, TRRAP specifically represses U-ISGs, which can be induced by the sole overexpression of unphosphorylated IRF9, including in CRCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Kolosenko et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Cheon et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Sung et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Platanitis et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Blaszczyk et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Fourth, TRRAP dynamically binds to the promoters of <italic>IRF7</italic> and <italic>IRF9</italic> and represses their transcription (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5</xref>—<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7</xref>). Although both IRF7 and IRF9 likely contribute to ISG induction upon TRRAP depletion, we propose that IRF9 mediates the effect of TRRAP on U-ISGs expression. Indeed, ISGF3, particularly IRF9, is the critical effector of IFN-I signaling and induces the expression of ISGs downstream of TBK1 and IRF7 activation. In addition, IRF9 can activate <italic>IRF7</italic> expression itself, including in HCT116 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Kolosenko et al., 2015</xref>). Altogether, the rapid kinetics, efficiency, and reversibility of the AID allowed us to deduce a putative sequence of phenotypic events, by which TRRAP depletion would relieve <italic>IRF9</italic> repression, subsequently inducing the transcription of <italic>IRF7</italic> and a subset of other U-ISGs, independently of IFN-I signaling. Nevertheless, we note that seven additional U-ISGs are both repressed and bound by TRRAP and thus putative direct targets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>). These genes encode key components of the IFN-I signaling pathway and include the viral RNA sensors DDX58 (RIG-I) and IFIH1 (MDA5), the signaling adaptor IFIT3, and the ISGF3 transcription complex subunit STAT1. Although we did not test this possibility, TRRAP might directly contribute to their repression, reinforcing its inhibitory effect on <italic>IRF7</italic> and <italic>IRF9</italic> expression.</p><p>An alternative mechanism is that TRRAP activates the transcription of a yet uncharacterized repressor of ISGs, particularly of IRF9. Although we cannot formally exclude this possibility, examination of the list of genes bound and activated by TRRAP did not identify an obvious candidate. However, so far, little is known about the regulation of <italic>IRF9</italic> expression, both in immune cells and cancer tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Suprunenko and Hofer, 2016</xref>). Gene expression databases indicate that <italic>IRF9</italic> is expressed constitutively. Accordingly, previous studies demonstrated that its regulation primarily occurs at the level of ISGF3 complex formation and nucleocytoplasmic shuttling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Wang et al., 2017</xref>). ISGF3 activation does not require de novo gene expression, although IFN-I signaling induces expression of <italic>IRF9</italic> and other transcription actors in a positive feedback loop. Further work is therefore needed to identify direct regulators of <italic>IRF9</italic> transcription, particularly repressors, to test whether TRRAP can also inhibit IRF9 expression indirectly.</p><p>How does TRRAP represses specific ISGs? Several studies suggest that both the TIP60 and SAGA complexes might be involved. A proximity labeling screen identified EP400, which catalyzes H2A.Z deposition, as a putative interactor of IRF9 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Platanitis et al., 2019</xref>). Furthermore, H2A.Z is removed during ISGF3-dependent transcription activation and, conversely, H2A.Z silencing induces ISGF3 recruitment to ISG promoters, ISG mRNA expression, and IFN-stimulated antiviral immunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Au-Yeung and Horvath, 2018</xref>). However, we did not detect a reproducible effect of TRRAP on H2A.Z occupancy at the <italic>IRF9</italic> promoter (our unpublished observations). Another study identified TIP60 as a repressor of endogenous retroviral elements (ERVs), which can activate innate immune signaling pathways when expressed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Rajagopalan et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Chiappinelli et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Roulois et al., 2015</xref>). However, we did not detect activation of an innate immune response in TRRAP-depleted cells. Moreover, these studies show that TIP60 depletion does not induce expression of IRF9 and its target ISGs, suggesting a different mechanism. In contrast, recent work in <italic>Drosophila</italic> found that the Tip60 subunit E(Pc) attenuates expression of components of JAK/STAT signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bailetti et al., 2019</xref>), which is reminiscent of our findings and suggests that this function of TRRAP might be conserved in other eukaryotic species. Finally, genetic and biochemical evidence indicates that the SAGA subunit GCN5/PCAF represses IFN-I signaling by inhibiting the TBK1 kinase, which targets IRF3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Jin et al., 2014</xref>). In contrast, we observed that TRRAP depletion induces ISG expression without IRF3 phosphorylation and activation of IFN signaling, demonstrating that TRRAP functions by a distinct mechanism in the context of CRC HCT116 cells.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>ISG expression in colorectal cancer</title><p>Alterations of TIP60 and SAGA activities have been documented in various cancers, for example, as essential cofactors of pro-oncogenic transcription factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Wang and Dent, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Judes et al., 2015</xref>). The shared subunit TRRAP represents a compelling example because it was identified in a screen for factors that are essential for MYC-dependent transcription and malignant transformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">McMahon et al., 1998</xref>). Supporting this conclusion, TRRAP is recurrently overexpressed in CRC patient samples (our analysis of the COADREAD cohort, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://xena.ucsc.edu/">http://xena.ucsc.edu/</ext-link>), and we show here that TRRAP depletion primarily affects a MYC target signature in HCT116 cells. In addition, our work suggests that TRRAP might also contribute to colorectal tumorigenesis by restricting ISG expression levels. Indeed, several studies reported that ISGs are normally repressed in CRC cells, but upregulated upon acquisition of radio- and chemoresistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Cheon et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Gongora et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Khodarev et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib111">Weichselbaum et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Khodarev et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Fryknäs et al., 2007</xref>). Specifically, gene expression profiling identified a subset of ISGs, defined as the interferon-related DNA damage signature (IRDS), which increases in cancer cells that become resistant to ionizing radiation, topoisomerase inhibitors, or DNA damage. Remarkably, the IRDS is virtually identical to the subset of ISGs induced by unphosphorylated U-ISGF3 and those repressed by TRRAP in HCT116 CRC cells. Therefore, TRRAP might play a new role in colorectal tumorigenesis by repressing a subset of ISGs.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cell culture, reagents, and transfection</title><p>HCT116 cells (a gift from Dr. Vogelstein, Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Baltimore, MD) were cultured in McCoy’s 5A medium (Sigma) supplemented with 10% (v/v) FBS and 100 U/ml penicillin/streptomycin in 5% CO<sub>2</sub> at 37°C.

Purified newly synthesized RNAs were recovered using the RNeasy MinElute Cleanup Kit (QIAGEN, 74204), according to the manufacturer’s instruction. 1 μg RNA was reverse-transcribed using the SuperScript III reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen, Life Technologies). RT-qPCR was performed using SYBR Green Master Mix and the LightCycler 480 instrument (Roche). Relative levels of gene expression were analyzed using the 2ΔΔCt method and compared to the expression of the human housekeeping gene <italic>PPIB</italic>. The cycling conditions comprised an initial denaturation phase at 95°C for 5 min, followed by 50 cycles at 95°C for 10 s, 60°C for 30 s, and 72°C for 15 s.

DNA was recovered using 200 µl of elution buffer supplemented with 100 mM NaHCO<sub>3</sub> and 1% SDS. Crosslinks were reversed by incubating samples overnight at 65°C and treated with RNAse A and proteinase K for 2 hr at 55°C. DNA was extracted using NucleoSpin columns (Macherey-Nagel) and eluted in 60 μl of NE buffer and used for qPCR analysis using SYBR Green Master Mix and the LightCycler 480 instrument (Roche).</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>RNA-seq</title><p>Total RNA was extracted using the TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen, 15596018) according to the manufacturer’s instructions, followed by DNAse digestion step using the TURBO DNA-free kit (Ambion, AM1907). RNA concentration and quality were analyzed using an Agilent Bioanalyzer 2100 (Agilent Technologies). Total RNA-seq libraries were generated from 1 μg of total RNA using TruSeq Stranded Total RNA LT Sample Prep Kit. High-throughput sequencing of cDNA libraries was performed following the standard protocol from Fasteris (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.fasteris.com">https://www.fasteris.com</ext-link>). All sequencing runs were performed on an Illumina HiSeq 2500.</p><p>Transcripts were purified by polyA-tail selection. Stranded dual-indexed cDNA libraries were constructed using the Illumina TruSeq Stranded mRNA Library Prep kit. Library size distribution and concentration were determined using an Agilent Bioanalyzer. 12 libraries were sequenced in one lane of an Illumina HiSeq 4000, with 1 × 50 bp single reads, at Fasteris SA (Plan-les-Ouates, Switzerland). After demultiplexing according to their index barcode, the total number of reads ranged from 23 to 27 million per library. Adapter sequences were trimmed from reads in the FastQ sequence files. Reads were aligned using HISAT2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Kim et al., 2015</xref>), with strand-specific information (–rnastrandness R) and otherwise default options to human genome assembly GRCh37 (hg19). For all samples, the overall alignment rate was over 80%, including over 90% of reads mapping uniquely to the human genome. Reads were then counted for exon features using htseq-count (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Anders et al., 2015</xref>) in union mode (–mode union), reverse stranded (–stranded Reverse), and a minimum alignment quality of 10 (–minaqual 10). For all samples, over 95% of reads were assigned to a feature (–type gene). Variance mean dependence was estimated from count tables and tested for differential expression based on a negative binomial distribution using DESeq2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Love et al., 2014</xref>). Pairwise comparison or one-way ANOVA were run with a parametric fit and ‘treatment as the source of variation’ (factor: auxin or NaOH).

Briefly, cells were grown up to 80% confluence, harvested from fresh cultures, and counted. About 250,000 cells were used per CUT&amp;RUN sample. Cells were washed and incubated for 10 min at room temperature with 10 µl of concanavalin A-coated beads. Cells bound to beads were permeabilized and incubated with a ChIP-grade anti-HA antibody (ab9110, Abcam) at 4°C overnight. Protein A-MNAse (pA-MN) was added to a final concentration of 700 ng/ml and incubated with cells at 4°C for 1 hr. Next, pA-MN was activated with 2 µl of 100 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub> and digestion was performed for 30 min at 0°C. The reaction was stopped with 100 µl of stop buffer containing 2 pg/ml of sonicated genomic DNA from <italic>Drosophila</italic> S2 cells as a heterologous spike-in. Release of the DNA fragments was achieved by incubating samples at 37°C during 15 min. DNA was extracted following using NucleoSpin columns (Macherey-Nagel) and eluted in 30 µl of NE buffer. Extracted DNA was used either for qPCR analysis or for Illumina high-throughput sequencing. qPCR was performed using the SYBR Green Master Mix and the LightCycler 480 instrument (Roche). Ct values were transformed into a DNA quantity value using a sample of genomic DNA of known concentration in each qPCR plate. Data were then analyzed and graphed using GraphPad Prism without any further normalization.

Yield and size distribution were quantified on a 2100 Bioanalyzer instrument (Agilent). High-throughput sequencing of libraries was performed on an Illumina HiSeq 3000/4000, with 2 × 150 pb paired-end reads, at Fasteris SA (Plan-les-Ouates). After demultiplexing according to their index barcode, the total number of reads ranged from 2.7 to 4.5 million per library.

Your article has been reviewed by 2 peer reviewers, including Jerry L Workman as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Kevin Struhl as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>The manuscript by Detilleux and coworkers continues studies by the Helmlinger group on the conserved TRAPP subunit of the SAGA and TIP60 (NuA4 in yeast) complexes. In this manuscript the authors create auxin-inducible degron allelles of TRAPP and of its TTT chaperone TELO2 in the HCT116 colorectal cancer cell line. In previous work the group showed that the TTT complex stabilizes TRAPP, and indeed degradation of TELO2 reduces nuclear accumulation of TRAPP. As expected direct auxin-induced degradation of TRAPP is more rapid, and inhibits HTC116 cell growth already after one day instead of two days for TELO2. Loss of TRAPP from the SAGA and TIP60 is significant, but not complete. RNAseq analysis showed that reduced TELO2 and TRAPP mostly leads to a reduced expression of genes, including MYC and E2F target genes, which is expected given the documented role of TRAPP as a co-activator for MYC ad E2F.</p><p>Unexpected is the increase expression of the interferon type 1 group of genes (ISGs). The authors investigated regulation of the ISG pathway to find that TRAPP depletion mostly affects IRF9 expression at the mRNA and protein levels and to a lesser extent IRF7 expression. IRF9 and IRF7 are critical transcription factors for the ISG pathway and these observations offer an explanation for the induction of interferon type 1 genes after TRAPP depletion. The authors continue to show by 4SU labeling that IRF9 and IRF7 are transcriptionally induced and by CUT&amp;RUN-PCR that TRAPP binds to the promoter regions of these genes. Re-expression of TRAPP reverses these effects. In order to dissect which of the TRAPP containing complexes several SAGA and TIP60 complexes are targeted by siRNA knock-down, but this does not provide clear distinction between SAGA and TIP60. In general, the exact mechanistic details of TRAPP-mediated repression of gene transcription have not been worked out, but the current work provides a strong basis for future studies addressing this.</p><p>Major open issues:</p><p>1) The reviewers did not think the authors need a detailed understanding of the repression mechanism. However, the basic conclusion has to be correct, and the various models of &quot;indirect effect&quot; such as TRRAP activating a repressor (which are very plausible and even more likely) are inconsistent with the main conclusion.

However, the basic conclusion has to be correct, and the various models of &quot;indirect effect&quot; such as TRRAP activating a repressor (which are very plausible and even more likely) are inconsistent with the main conclusion. The interest of the paper is that, although TRRAP is well described as a positive factor, it has a direct negative effect on a set of genes. However, the &quot;indirect&quot; models involve TRRAP function in the usual positive manner, which isn't novel or even interesting.

As suggested, we simultaneously followed RNA Polymerase II (RNAPII) occupancy within the gene bodies of <italic>IRF7</italic> and <italic>IRF9</italic>, using ChIP, and TRRAP binding at their promoters, using CUT&amp;RUN, over a time-course of auxin-induced depletion of TRRAP. Kinetic experiments showed that ISG expression starts to increase shortly after TRRAP is depleted (Figure 1B and 3E), between 5 and 10 hours after adding auxin. We therefore measured RNAPII and TRRAP binding at early (7 hours), middle (10 hours), and late (16 hours) time points of auxin treatment. RNAPII ChIP and TRRAP CUT&amp;RUN experiments are presented in Figure 6B and 6C, respectively, and described in a novel paragraph from the Results section (“<italic>TRRAP represses IRF7 and IRF9 transcription</italic>”, page 20-21). Briefly, we observed an increase in RNAPII occupancy at both genes, using ChIP-qPCR with an antibody that recognizes all forms of RNAPII (F-12). Compared to control, NaOH-treated cells, RNAPII levels are higher already 7 hours after adding auxin and do not further increase. In parallel, we observed background TRRAP binding at the promoter regions of both genes already 7 hours after auxin addition.</p><p>This kinetic analysis supports a direct inhibitory role of TRRAP on the transcription of these genes in two ways. First, TRRAP disappearance from the promoter is concomitant with the appearance of RNAPII in the transcribed region. Second, this increase in RNAPII occupancy occurs at an early time-point of TRRAP depletion, 7 hours after adding auxin, which is about 2-3 hours after TRRAP levels become undetectable by Western blot. Moreover, the transcriptional effect of TRRAP is now supported by orthogonal evidence from nascent RT-qPCR and RNAPII ChIP experiments, shown in Figure 6A and 6B, respectively. We revised the corresponding paragraphs of the Discussion to incorporate these observations (page 26-27).</p><p>Finally, we agree that TRRAP might also repress ISGs indirectly, for example by activating a repressor of IRF7 and IRF9 expression, perhaps even redundantly with its direct regulatory role. To the best of our knowledge, no specific transcriptional repressor has been identified for <italic>IRF9</italic>, which regulation primarily occurs post-translationally upon activation of innate immune signaling pathways. Furthermore, examination of the list of genes regulated by TRRAP did not identify obvious candidate or factors involved in global transcriptional repression. We have amended the Abstract (page 2) and the Discussion (page 27-28) to include these considerations.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) It is unclear why the authors did not choose to sequence the DNA from the TRAP CUT&amp;RUN experiment, but rather performed (a more cumbersome) PCR analysis. A genome-wide CUT&amp;RUN dataset for TRAPP would have allowed a direct comparison with their TELO2 and TRAPP depletion RNAseq datasets.</p></disp-quote><p>The CUT&amp;RUN-qPCR analysis of TRRAP binding was indeed promising and we thus proceeded with Illumina high-throughput sequencing. Specifically, we performed anti-HA CUT&amp;RUN-seq of <sup>AID</sup>TRRAP cells treated with either NaOH or auxin for 12 hours, each in two independent replicates. We included a rabbit IgG sample to control for background pA-MNase activity. We processed and analyzed the data using conventional ChIP-seq bioinformatic tools, such as MACS2 for peak calling, here ran against the control IgG sample. These data are presented in a new Figure 5 and described in the Results under the “<italic>Genome-wide profiling of TRRAP occupancy</italic>” and “<italic>TRRAP binds to the IRF7 and IRF9 promoters</italic>” sections, page 18-20. We also revised the Discussion to integrate these results (page 27-28).</p><p>In summary, CUT&amp;RUN-seq was remarkably efficient to measure TRRAP occupancy profile genome-wide and we thank the reviewers for prompting us to go on with this experiment. Notably, we confirmed the robust binding of TRRAP at the <italic>IRF7</italic> and <italic>IRF9</italic> promoters and identified 7 additional U-ISGs that are both bound and repressed by TRRAP and thus putative direct targets (Figure 5E-F).</p><p>Furthermore, comparing our CUT&amp;RUN-seq and RNA-seq data showed a strong overlap between TRRAP binding and effect on gene expression, with about 75% of deregulated genes bound by TRRAP. This observation is important because this overlap is much higher than that obtained in a previous study comparing TRRAP binding and regulatory effects using ChIP-seq and RNA-seq, respectively (PMID: 29588376), in which only about 26% of TRRAP-regulated genes are bound by TRRAP. We conclude that CUT&amp;RUN-seq represents a significant methodological improvement for profiling the genome-wide binding of factors that, similar to TRRAP-containing complexes, do not bind DNA directly. We also confirm initial observations from the Henikoff lab that CUT&amp;RUN-seq has a very high signal-to-noise ratio, substantially reducing the cost of sequencing.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The experiments implicating both TIP60 and SAGA in the repression of the IRF9 gene are not convincing.

As suggested, we entirely removed the paragraph entitled ”<italic>Both TIP60 and SAGA contribute to ISG repression</italic>” from the Results section, along with Figure 7, and the corresponding sentence and information from the Discussion (page 28) and Materials and methods. We kept and modified our discussion of the possible molecular mechanisms by which TRRAP functions as a transcriptional repressor at specific genes (page 28-29, paragraph starting with “<italic>How does TRRAP represses specific ISGs?</italic>”).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The authors mention in the methods section that heterologous DNA was used to normalize CUT&amp;RUN experiments but make no reference to this normalization in their figures or explained in the methods.

We have now clarified this point and explain in more details how we processed both the CUT&amp;RUN-qPCR and the novel CUT&amp;RUN-seq data in Materials and methods, page 37-38. We also updated the description of the CUT&amp;RUN-qPCR data in the corresponding figures and legends, which are now Figure 6C and Figure 5—figure supplement 1.</p><p>For CUT&amp;RUN-qPCR, we used a genomic DNA sample of known concentration in each plate to transform Ct values into DNA quantity values and to calibrate experiments performed on different days and by distinct experimenters. These values represent raw amounts of DNA released after pA-MNase activation, or “TRRAP footprints”, without any further normalization. We thus changed the y-axis label in both figures from “occupancy levels” to “CUT&amp;RUN signal”. In addition, we repeatedly found more TRRAP binding at the <italic>MIR17-HG</italic> promoter than at <italic>IRF7</italic> and <italic>IRF9</italic>, relative to IgG controls. However, we noted that the values obtained for the IgG samples are very low, close to the limit of the detection by qPCR, such that they cannot be used confidently as a reference point for calculating an enrichment ratio. Finally, we addressed the issue of variability by adding more replicates to the control condition, particularly for <italic>IRF7</italic> and <italic>IRF9</italic> (Figure 6C). While merging all experiments, we noticed an error in processing the data for <italic>IRF9</italic> in the original version of the figure, which likely explains why the values were so different between <italic>IRF7</italic> and <italic>IRF9</italic>. This has been corrected and we thank the reviewers for bringing this issue to our attention.</p><p>For CUT&amp;RUN-seq, we have now included these data in the revised manuscript and provide a global view of TRRAP chromatin occupancy in HCT116 cells (see our response to comment #2 for details). Here, although we added sonicated genomic DNA from <italic>Drosophila</italic> S2 cells as a heterologous spike-in, as recommended in the original protocol, we did not use it during data analysis. Indeed, for this manuscript, we performed neither a differential nor a quantitative analysis of TRRAP binding (Figure 5). Rather, we focused on the steady-state level of TRRAP binding to promoters and compared it with its effects on the transcriptome measured by our RNA-seq of TRRAP-depleted cells.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) In addition, a drop in MYC occupancy at MIR17-HG promoter following auxin induction is observed and the authors explain this by a role for TRRAP in stabilizing MYC at its target genes. However, non-specific effects of auxin on CUT&amp;RUN results are not ruled out. Profiling an additional factor that should not be affected by TRRAP depletion would be necessary to validate and increase confidence in the results obtained in Figure 6, where the authors look at the dynamics of ISG regulation by TRRAP over a time course after removing auxin by coupling CUT&amp;RUN to RT-PCR analyses, and to confirm that TRRAP indeed is a direct repressor of IRF9.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for raising this point, which we addressed by measuring the effect of auxin on cells lacking AID-tagged TRRAP. For this, we performed a anti-MYC CUT&amp;RUN experiment in the parental, TIR1-expressing HCT116 cell line used for CRISPR-Cas editing of <italic>TRRAP</italic>. We reasoned that finding a factor that is not affected by TRRAP, which can interact with many different transcription factors, might be challenging. We observed that treating HCT116 cells with auxin for 12 hours had no effect on MYC binding to the <italic>MIR17-HG</italic> promoter, contrasting with the decrease observed in auxin-treated AID-TRRAP cells (Figure 5—figure supplement 1A). We conclude that the effect of auxin on MYC binding is specific to TRRAP depletion, validating our CUT&amp;RUN results. These data are presented in a much-revised version of what is now Figure 5—figure supplement 1A and described in the paragraph from the Results section that describe our implementation of the CUT&amp;RUN procedure (page 17-18). We are grateful to the reviewers for suggesting this important control, which clearly strengthens the manuscript.</p></body></sub-article></article>
