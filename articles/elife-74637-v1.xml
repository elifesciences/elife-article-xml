centers features one of the major aims in olfactory neuroscience. Here, we investigated how odor information is transformed and represented in higher-order neurons of the lateral horn, one of the higher olfactory centers implicated in determining innate behavior, using <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>. We focused on a subset of third-order glutamatergic lateral horn neurons (LHNs) and characterized their odor coding properties in relation to their presynaptic partner neurons, the projection neurons (PNs) by two-photon functional imaging. We show that odors evoke reproducible, stereotypic, and odor-specific response patterns in LHNs. Notably, odor-evoked responses in these neurons are valence-specific in a way that their response amplitude is positively correlated with innate odor preferences. We postulate that this valence-specific activity is the result of integrating inputs from multiple olfactory channels through second-order neurons. GRASP and micro-lesioning experiments provide evidence that glutamatergic LHNs obtain their major excitatory input from uniglomerular PNs, while they receive an odor-specific inhibition through inhibitory multiglomerular PNs. In summary, our study indicates that odor representations in glutamatergic LHNs encode hedonic valence and odor identity and primarily retain the odor coding properties of second-order neurons.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>sensory processing</kwd><kwd>two-photon imaging</kwd><kwd>odor coding</kwd><kwd>insect olfaction</kwd><kwd>lateral horn</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004189</institution-id><institution>Max Planck Society</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Das Chakraborty</surname><given-names>Sudeshna</given-names></name><name><surname>Chang</surname><given-names>Hetan</given-names></name><name><surname>Hansson</surname><given-names>Bill S</given-names></name><name><surname>Sachse</surname><given-names>Silke</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100005156</institution-id><institution>Alexander von Humboldt-Stiftung</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Das Chakraborty</surname><given-names>Sudeshna</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Two-photon functional imaging linked to olfactory preference in <italic>Drosophila</italic> provides the first understanding of how odors are integrated, transformed, and represented in the lateral horn by an ensemble of higher-order glutamatergic lateral horn neurons.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Insects are the most successful taxon among the whole animal kingdom in terms of their distribution and ability to survive in a multitude of environmental conditions. Largely they rely on their olfactory sense to carry out their fundamental goal-directed behaviors, such as food navigation, mating, ovipositing, or escape from predators. The powerful ability to detect odor cues, to evaluate the information efficiently with a relatively small number of neurons and to transform the neuronal signal into an appropriate behavioral output, makes the insect olfactory system a premier model system for olfactory research. Numerous studies have investigated the neuronal representation of odors at successive neuronal layers from the periphery to higher brain levels using <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> as a model organism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bhandawat et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Ng, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Root et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Schmuker et al., 2007a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Schmuker and Schneider, 2007b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Seki et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Wilson et al., 2004</xref>) Although much progress has been made in understanding odor coding at the antennal lobe (AL) level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bhandawat et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Galizia, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Ng, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Wilson et al., 2004</xref>), the coding strategies and processing mechanisms of higher brain centers still remain largely elusive. In this regard, the lateral horn (LH) has recently gained attention as a crucial signal processing center integrating both innate and learned behavioral information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Das Chakraborty and Sachse, 2021</xref>). Several studies during recent years have advanced our understanding of the anatomical and functional properties of higher-order lateral horn neurons (LHNs) regarding odor processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Das Chakraborty and Sachse, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dolan et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Frechter et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Jeanne et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lerner et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Varela et al., 2019</xref>). The generation of several LH cell-type-specific lines, characterization of polarity and neurotransmitter identity of LHNs, as well as the establishment of detailed EM connectomic datasets have led to a significant progress in the field to study the function of specific LHN classes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dolan et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Frechter et al., 2019</xref>). The LH is comprised of three categories of neurons, which include LH input neurons (LHINs, which are mainly olfactory projection neurons [PNs] along with mechanosensory, thermosensory, and gustatory neurons), LH local neurons (LHLNs), and LH output neurons (LHONs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bates et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dolan et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Frechter et al., 2019</xref>). In terms of PN-LHN connectivity, the olfactory PNs deriving from individual glomeruli of the AL form stereotyped and conserved connections with certain LHNs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fişek and Wilson, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Jeanne et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Jefferis et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Marin et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Wong et al., 2002</xref>). Although all kinds of connections are possible, PNs having similar odor-tuning patterns are prone to target similar LHN types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Jeanne et al., 2018</xref>). Certain pairs of narrowly tuned glomeruli encoding ecologically relevant odors and eliciting specific kinds of behavior, such as courtship, aggregation, or food seeking, converge onto the same LHN types and have been shown to be overrepresented in the LH in terms of synaptic densities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bates et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Jeanne et al., 2018</xref>). Furthermore, a high amount of divergence has also been described to occur at the level of PN to LHN connectivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Huoviala et al., 2018</xref>). Altogether, these complex connectivity patterns in addition to direct pooling of feedforward inputs from PNs innervating different glomeruli result in broader tuning patterns of LHNs compared to their presynaptic PNs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bates et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Frechter et al., 2019</xref>). In addition to the observed broadly tuned LHNs, narrowly tuned LHNs also exist, which receive input from a single type of PN and which are assumed to be further modulated by odorant-selective inhibition through inhibitory neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fişek and Wilson, 2014</xref>). Although several studies agree that odors are compartmentalized in the LH based on either their chemical identity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Frechter et al., 2019</xref>), behavioral significance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bates et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Jeanne et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Jefferis et al., 2007</xref>), or hedonic valence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Strutz et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Tanaka et al., 2004</xref>), it still remains controversial how the odor information is transformed from the PN to the LHN level and which odor features are coded by subtypes of LHNs.</p><p>In this study, we aimed to elucidate the odor coding and processing strategies of LHNs by investigating how a neuronal subset of particular neurotransmitter identity encodes different odor features in the LH and how this representation is correlated to their presynaptic partner neurons in the AL, the uniglomerular PNs (uPNs) and multiglomerular PNs (mPNs). Using photoactivatable GFP, we first identified diverse clusters of LHNs based on their different neurotransmitter identities and further focused our detailed analysis exclusively on glutamatergic LHNs. Using in vivo two-photon functional imaging, we characterized several aspects of odor-evoked activity in these neurons, such as odor-specific response patterns, reproducibility of repeated stimulations, as well as stereotypy across different individuals. We could successfully demonstrate that attractive and aversive odors are clearly segregated and that the response amplitudes of glutamatergic LHNs are positively correlated with the innate behavioral preference to an odor. We also dissected how the excitatory input from uPNs and odor-specific inhibition from mPNs contribute to the fine-tuning of odor-specific response patterns of LHNs. Altogether, this study demonstrates a significant role of glutamatergic LHNs regarding olfactory processing and extends our knowledge about the transformation processes of neuronal information taking place from the periphery to higher brain levels, such as the LH.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Identification of higher-order neurons in the LH</title><p>To unravel distinct neuronal circuits in the LH, we expressed photoactivatable GFP (<italic>UAS-C3PA GFP</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Ruta et al., 2010</xref>) under different Gal4 driver lines with various neurotransmitter and neuromodulator identities (i.e., <italic>Cha-Gal4, GAD1-Gal4, dVGlut-Gal4, TH-Gal4,</italic> and <italic>tdc2-Gal4</italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and B</xref>). To precisely define the upper and lower limits of the LH, we labeled uPNs using <italic>GH146-QF, QUAS-mtd tomato</italic> in the background as a landmark in every experiment. Using two-photon excitation, we photoactivated <italic>C3PA-GFP</italic> throughout the LH neuropil with laser pulses of 760 nm in the in vivo fly brain. Photoactivation of the LH using driver lines for cholinergic (<italic>Cha-Gal4</italic>) and GABAergic neurons (<italic>GAD1-Gal4</italic>) revealed clusters of LHNs with labeled somata along with cholinergic and GABAergic PNs, respectively. The labeled cholinergic and GABAergic LHN clusters were located ventrolaterally to the LH. Selective labeling of glutamatergic neurons in the LH by photoactivation using the <italic>dVGlut-Gal4</italic> driver line revealed several clusters of LHN cell bodies positioned dorsomedial, ventrolateral, and ventral to the LH with major neurite tracts entering the LH at distinctive locations. Glutamatergic LHNs are comprised of a large number of labeled somata (~40) and a few ventrolateral and ventral clusters possessing long neuronal tracts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). The labeled glutamatergic LHNs most likely include both LHLNs and LHONs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Frechter et al., 2019</xref>). Photoactivation using PA-GFP of individual neurons in the dorsomedial cluster revealed the detailed arborization of single LHLNs within the LH (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Due to the position of the cell bodies, the primary neurite, as well as the neurotransmitter identity, we assume that these LHLNs belong to the PD3a1 and PD3a2 neuron cluster described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dolan et al., 2019</xref>. Photoactivation of the LH using drivers for dopaminergic (<italic>TH-Gal4</italic>) and octopaminergic neurons (<italic>tdc2-Gal4</italic>) revealed the presence of both kinds of LHNs (i.e., LHLNs, LHONs) in the LH (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). These neurons innervate the LH sparsely with a very long neuronal tract and their somata positioned far away from the LH. Since we observed a high abundance of glutamatergic neurons in the LH, which were nonoverlapping with second-order neurons (i.e., PNs) deriving from the AL, we confined our further experiments on this subset of LHNs to elucidate their functional properties regarding odor coding.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Selective labeling of lateral horn neurons (LHNs) based on their neurotransmitter identities.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Photoactivation of <italic>UAS-C3PA-GFP</italic> expressed under the control of different Gal4 lines with various neurotransmitter and neuromodulator identities (<italic>Cha-Gal4</italic>, <italic>GAD1-Gal4</italic>, <italic>dVGlut-Gal4</italic>, <italic>tdc2-Gal4,</italic> and <italic>TH-Gal4</italic>) reveals subsets of cholinergic, GABAergic, glutamatergic, octopaminergic, and dopaminergic LHNs (left to right).

To do so, we expressed the genetically encoded calcium sensor <italic>UAS-GCaMP6f</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chen et al., 2013</xref>) that has a high sensitivity and low basal fluorescence under the control of <italic>dVGlut-Gal4</italic>. In order to accurately and consistently identify a comparable focal plane for functional imaging across different animals, we expressed <italic>QUAS-mtd tomato</italic> in uPNs using <italic>GH146-QF</italic> in the background as a landmark (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>). We performed in vivo two-photon functional imaging from the glutamatergic LHNs at three different focal planes to comprehensively monitor odor responses throughout the LH (i.e., upper, middle, and lower planes). We used a panel of 14 ecologically relevant odors at a concentration of 10<sup>–3</sup>, which have been shown to be behaviorally either attractive or aversive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Knaden et al., 2012</xref>). Our imaging data show that each odor evoked a specific activity pattern across all three focal planes in the LH (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Since the LH appears rather homogenous and lacks clear morphological landmarks, we used a grid approach for imaging data analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>) (see Materials and methods for details) and determined the ΔF/F to analyze the neuronal activity across odors for each animal. The correlation coefficient for each odor pair for the given odor panel was analyzed based on the similarity of odor responses obtained from all 65 pixels for individual animals and was then averaged across animals. At first, we compared the reproducibility of the evoked responses of these glutamatergic LHNs to two sequential presentations of each odor. This analysis of neuronal activity for repeated odor stimulations clearly showed that the odor-evoked responses were highly reproducible both qualitatively and quantitatively across trials (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>), which is further depicted by a high correlation coefficient across repeated stimulations for all odors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). Hence, although the odor responses appear generally broad, each odor induced an unique stereotyped response pattern in these glutamatergic LHNs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Furthermore, a cluster analysis based on the linkage distance between the spatial patterns of each odor response reveals that the majority of the replicates for each odor are clustered together, confirming that individual odors are represented in an odor-specific manner by glutamatergic LHNs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). To investigate whether the observed odor response properties of glutamatergic LHNs derived from their presynaptic partner neurons, we determined the odor representations of uPNs in the LH to the same odor set. Previous studies based on the innervation pattern of PNs reported a compartmentalization in the LH either based on the hedonic valence of an odor, that is, attractive versus aversive odors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Seki et al., 2017</xref>), the odor category, that is, pheromones versus food odors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Jefferis et al., 2007</xref>) or with regard to the behavioral ‘odor scene’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bates et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Jeanne et al., 2018</xref>). However, whether an odor-specific response map exists at the uPN level in the LH has so far not been unambiguously shown with a functional approach. We therefore expressed <italic>UAS-GCaMP6f</italic> under the control of <italic>GH146-Gal4</italic> and monitored odor-evoked responses at the two-photon microscope from the same three focal planes as used for the LHN imaging experiments. Notably, when we compared the odor response properties of uPNs for individual animals with those of LHNs we observed that the PNs possess a significantly reduced correlation coefficient as compared to LHNs, implying that odors are better segregated at the uPN level in the LH than at the third-order neuron level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). In addition, a cluster analysis based on the linkage distance between the spatial patterns of each odor response at the PN level confirms that uPNs also reveal stereotyped odor-specific response patterns in the LH (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Altogether, these observations clearly demonstrate and signify that uPNs as well as glutamatergic LHNs exhibit an odor-specific response map in the LH.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Odor response properties of glutamatergic lateral horn neurons (LHNs) and uniglomerular projection neurons (uPNs).</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Representative images of calcium responses of glutamatergic LHNs in the LH brain area in three focal planes, evoked by various odors (repulsive odors: acetophenone, geosmin, benzaldehyde; attractive odors: vinegar, 2,3 butanedione, propionic acid; pheromone: cVA).

We therefore quantified and pooled the correlation coefficients of all odor responses of glutamatergic LHNs to all attractive and aversive odors and compared those that shared the same valence (i.e., within valence), as well as for odors having an opposing valence (i.e., across valence) for all three focal planes measured (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Interestingly, we observed that the responses to odors with the same valence were significantly more similar, depicted by a higher correlation coefficient, compared to the odor responses across valence. In order to visualize the odor representations in a multidimensional space, we employed a principal component analysis (PCA) of the odor response profiles by taking into account two parameters, the spatial response patterns, as well as the intensity of odor-evoked responses by each odor. As expected, the attractive and aversive odor responses were segregated significantly throughout the LH (*p&lt;0.05, one-way ANOSIM), confirming that odors are indeed categorized according to their behavioral value by these third-order glutamatergic LHNs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Notably, when only the response amplitude was considered, it was obvious that attractive odors in general evoked a stronger activity in glutamatergic LHNs compared to responses to behaviorally aversive odors across all three focal planes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C and D</xref>). Next, we examined whether odor responses of second-order uPNs also reflect the hedonic valence of an odor within the LH as it has been shown for the AL level previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Knaden et al., 2012</xref>). A PCA of the odor response profile of uPNs revealed that the attractive and aversive odors are clearly segregated (**p&lt;0.005, one-way ANOSIM) at the PN level also in the LH (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). In order to investigate whether the response magnitude in uPNs contributes to the observed clear segregation,as observed for LHNs, we averaged the overall response activities to attractive and aversive odors across all three planes. Indeed, we observed a similar trend, meaning that uPNs responded stronger to attractive odors than to aversive ones in the LH (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D and F</xref>). This observation was novel and unexpected and tempted us to postulate that the flies’ innate odor preference might be determined by the response amplitude of uPNs and glutamatergic LHNs. To address whether the odor-evoked response strength is correlated with behavioral preference, we performed T-maze assays to the same odor set as used for the functional imaging experiments. As shown in previous studies, flies displayed different levels of attraction and aversion to individual odors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Knaden et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">MacWilliam et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Min et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Strutz et al., 2014</xref>). Plotting the olfactory preference indices of all tested odors with the response strengths of glutamatergic LHNs indeed revealed a significant correlation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>), showing that odors eliciting stronger LHN activity induce stronger attraction, while odors that elicit lower LHN responses induce a stronger aversion. Interestingly, the response strength of uPNs did not correlate significantly with the olfactory preference indices (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref>), although uPNs activity displayed a valence-specific representation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). This observation suggests that the activity in the subset of glutamatergic LHNs may contribute significantly to the observed behavioral odor preferences. However, this correlation does not confirm any causality between the response strength of glutamatergic LHNs and the behavioral output. To test a causal relationship, it would be necessary to silence or artificially activate the glutamatergic LHNs and determine the functional consequences with regard to behavioral valence. However, since the line <italic>dVGlut-Gal4</italic> is broadly expressed throughout the whole brain, genetic manipulations would not be confined to the subset of glutamatergic LHNs and would therefore be difficult to evaluate. One might argue that the observed differential LHN responses emerge already at the sensory neuron level and are not the result of neuronal processing within the AL or LH. To examine this idea, we obtained odor-evoked response of olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs) to individual odors from the DoOR database (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Münch and Galizia, 2016</xref>) and plotted the response strengths of glutamatergic LHNs either against the overall OSN activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3I</xref>) or the number of ORs (olfactory receptors) activated by a specific odor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3J</xref>). Interestingly, we could not observe any correlation in either case, indicating that the differential LHN activity observed here is not deriving from the OSN level, but is the result of second-order neuronal processing. Notably, the comparison between uPNs and LHNs responses also did not show any correlation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3K</xref>), further suggesting that the differential activity observed in the glutamatergic LHNs is not a mere relay of the AL input through uPNs, but rather processed by either mPNs or other LHNs to generate the observed graded odor responses in higher-order glutamatergic LHNs.</p><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Segregation of hedonic valence in the lateral horn (LH).</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Comparison of the correlation coefficients of odor responses of glutamatergic lateral horn neurons (LHNs) between the odors that share the same valence (i.e., within valence) and odors having an opposite valence (i.e., across valence).

Immunohistochemistry followed by confocal scanning demonstrated that these neurons possess both presynaptic dendrites and postsynaptic axon terminals in the LH (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, left and right panels), indicating that the cell cluster of glutamatergic LHNs probably comprises both LHLNs and LHONs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dolan et al., 2019</xref>). The presence of presynaptic terminals suggests that these neurons provide input to other LHONs, LHLNs, or even perform a feedback excitation and/or inhibition onto PNs. To assess the neuronal connectivity of these neurons with excitatory and inhibitory PNs at the morphological level in detail, we employed the GRASP technique (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Feinberg et al., 2008</xref>). Initially, we employed two split-GFP fragments, tagged to the extracellular domain of the CD4 transmembrane protein (hereafter referred to as <italic>CD4-GRASP</italic>).

In both cases, we observed a clear neuronal connectivity to the glutamatergic LHNs. However, since <italic>CD4-GRASP</italic> is not synaptically targeted and can potentially lead to false-positive signals at nonsynaptic locations, we employed in addition a GFP 1–10 fragment, which is tagged to the synaptic protein neurexin, resulting in an enhancement of synaptic specificity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Fan et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Shearin et al., 2018</xref>). Neurexin is present predominantly at the presynaptic site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Fan et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Xing et al., 2018</xref>), but also occurs along with postsynaptic terminals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Taniguchi et al., 2007</xref>). When we performed GRASP by expressing neurexin in glutamatergic LHNs and the other fragment of GFP in uPNs, we observed a clear GFP signal in the LH (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>, left panel) implying that glutamatergic LHNs provide presynaptic output onto uPNs and therefore convey a feedback input (either excitatory or inhibitory) to the AL. Such a feedback connection needs to be verified in future experiments. In order to determine the synaptic connectivity between glutamatergic LHNs and mPNs, we expressed neurexin in mPNs and the other fragment of GFP in glutamatergic LHNs. We observed distinct GFP puncta in the LH implying that also mPNs form presynaptic and probably postsynaptic connections with glutamatergic LHNs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>, right panel).</p><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Polarity and morphological connectivity of glutamatergic lateral horn neurons (LHNs) with uniglomerular projection neurons (uPNs) and multiglomerular projection neurons (mPNs).</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Expression of syp GC3 (left panel) and homer GC3 (right panel) in glutamatergic LHNs suggesting the presence of pre- as well as postsynapses in the LH.

To manipulate the input from uPNs, we microlesioned the iACT tract entering the LH and compared the odor-evoked responses to vinegar and benzaldehyde from the glutamatergic LHNs before and after laser ablation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, schematic upper panel). After transecting the iACT tract, we observed that the odor-induced responses to both vinegar and benzaldehyde were completely abolished across all three focal planes of the LH (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A–A’’ and B–B’’</xref>). This finding implies that glutamatergic LHNs receive their major excitatory input from the AL through uPNs. To verify whether this complete elimination of the odor-evoked activity is not just a technical side effect of the laser ablation procedure, we also monitored odor responses from the glutamatergic LHNs in the other, untreated brain hemisphere before and after microlesioning, which proved not to be affected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). In order to examine the functional connectivity between mPNs and glutamatergic LHNs, we also transected the mACT tract entering the LH and monitored odor responses from glutamatergic LHNs before and after laser transection. Notably, transecting the mACT led to a significant increase in the odor-evoked responses in the middle and upper planes of the glutamatergic LHNs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C–C’’ and D–D’’</xref>). We further observed that the mACT transection affected the odor-evoked responses differentially in a way that the response increase was higher in the case of vinegar than for benzaldehyde. In order to investigate whether this response increase following a transection of the mACT is odor-specific, we performed this treatment with four other odors, two attractive ones (2,3 butanedione, ethyl acetate) and two aversive odors (acetophenone, linalool). Notably, only acetophone revealed a significant increment in the odor-evoked responses of the glutamatergic LHNs after transection, while we observed only a trend for 2,3 butanedione, ethyl acetate, and linalool, which was not significantly different from the odor responses before transection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>).

To address this issue, we monitored odor-evoked responses in the glutamatergic LHNs to two repeated stimulations of vinegar and benzaldehyde (depicted as 1 and 2 in the schematic in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A and A’</xref>), followed by measuring LHN activity after microlesioning the mACT tract (depicted as 3 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A and A’</xref>). Since, we observed a significant response increase following mPN-mediated inhibition only in the middle and upper planes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C’, C”, D’ and D”</xref>), we confined our analysis to these two areas. In order to determine whether the laser ablation of mACT alters also the odor-evoked spatial pattern in addition to an increase in the response amplitude, we compared the correlation coefficients between the repeated responses before laser ablation to those after the transection. Our results revealed that removal of the inhibitory input from mPNs leads to a reduced correlation coefficient of the odor response patterns evoked by vinegar in LHNs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B and B’</xref>). Interestingly, such an effect was not observed in the case of benzaldehyde, although we observed a weak mPN-mediated inhibition for this odor before (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B and B’</xref>). Since the odor-evoked spatial patterns were modified after silencing the mPN input into the LH, we next wondered whether this also affected the odor specificity of the LHN responses. We therefore compared the correlation coefficients ‘across odors’ (i.e., between vinegar and benzaldehyde) before and after microlesion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). Strikingly, we observed that the odor-evoked response patterns of vinegar and benzaldehyde became increasingly similar after removal of the mPN-mediated inhibition depicted as an increased correlation coefficient after laser ablation.

LHLNs have been reported to inhibit each other as well as LHONs as well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bates et al., 2020</xref>). LHONs, in addition to providing feedback excitation to LHLNs, relay the information to further higher brain centers. mPNs provide an odorant-selective inhibition to glutamatergic LHNs. mPNs are known to encode odor valence in the LH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Strutz et al., 2014</xref>), uPNs and glutamatergic LHNs encode odor identity as well as odor valence. The thickness of the line indicates the strength of excitatory or inhibitory input.

Notably, the differential activity levels of glutamatergic LHNs to attractive and aversive odors are positively correlated to the olfactory behavioral preference, indicating that these neurons are mainly tuned to attractive odors. The response features do not arise from the OSN level, but rather derive from local processing within the LH by integrating inputs from multiple olfactory channels through uPNs, which also show a valence-specific odor representation. Furthermore, laser transection experiments demonstrate that these higher-order neurons receive their major excitatory input from uPNs and an odor-specific inhibitory input from mPNs.

Although it has been assumed previously that odor specificity may not be encoded in higher-order brain centers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Grabe and Sachse, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Strutz et al., 2014</xref>), our findings are in accordance with a recent study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Frechter et al., 2019</xref>, who demonstrate the existence of 33 different LH cell types exhibiting stereotypic odor response properties with increased tuning breadth than PNs. The observed odor-evoked response features of LHNs that are odor-specific but with a broader tuning breadth could be due to several reasons. First, they receive input from similarly as well as differently tuned uPNs; therefore, the topographic map of uPN axonal terminals is not clearly retained at the level of LHNs. Second, LHNs integrate inputs from multiple odor channels, for example, one LHN receives on average excitatory input from ~5.2–6.2 glomeruli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Frechter et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Jeanne et al., 2018</xref>). Third, both uPNs and mPNs provide input to glutamatergic LHNs and those LHNs in turn feedback onto those second-order neurons and provide feedforward information to other LHNs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bates et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Frechter et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Jeanne et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). Here, we observed that uPNs are more efficient in encoding odor identity than the glutamatergic LHNs in the LH (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>), whereas LHNs reveal an improved categorization of odors either based on behavioral significance, ‘odor scene’ or chemical group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bates et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Frechter et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Jeanne et al., 2018</xref>). However, the distinct odor-specific response map by glutamatergic LHNs observed in our study suggests that the dimensionality of odor features might not get reduced but still retains information about the odor specificity at the third-order processing stage.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Coding of hedonic odor valence</title><p>Our functional imaging recordings revealed that odor valence is encoded by glutamatergic LHNs, leading to different activation strengths and patterns for attractive and aversive odors in the LH. Although the valence code is already present at the AL level in uPNs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Knaden et al., 2012</xref>), it could be assumed that the same valence code might be translated to the next level of higher-order neurons. However, evidence of high convergence and divergence of neurons from different sensory modalities in the LH argues against a simple translation of the valence code or odor identity to the LHN level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Huoviala et al., 2018</xref>). Our observation is well in line with previous studies that have revealed that odor-evoked responses in higher brain centers are generally categorized according to certain odor features as already mentioned above. For example, using functional imaging or patch-clamp recordings of second-order olfactory neurons revealed the existence of distinct attractive and aversive odor response domains in the LH formed by uPNs and mPNs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Seki et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Strutz et al., 2014</xref>). Such a categorization according to hedonic valence is also visible in our study when the odor-evoked responses of glutamatergic LHNs were plotted in a PCA, taking into account the spatial response patterns as well as the intensity of activity. Although no prominent spatial domain of attractive or aversive odors was evident in our recordings, we observed that attractive odors evoked a generally stronger activity when compared to aversive odors in this subset of LHNs. We noted a similar trend in second-order uPNs. However, their response strength was neither correlated with the olfactory preference determined in behavior nor the odor response properties of LHNs. The observed significant correlation between the amount of odor-evoked activity in glutamatergic LHNs to the behavioral valence of an odor leads us to postulate that the activity strengths of higher-order olfactory neurons to odor stimulation might determine the behavioral response – an assumption that needs to be tested in future studies.</p><p>Although we have documented in our study how the glutamatergic LHNs determine the innate behavioral valence, odor valence in the LH can also be achieved through learning and LHNs have also been shown to play a critical role for learned behavior. A specific class of LHNs (so-called PD2a1/b1) has been reported to mediate innate approach response in addition to learned avoidance response in an odor concentration-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Das Chakraborty and Sachse, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dolan et al., 2018</xref>). Therefore, depending upon the context, the same LHNs can mediate innate as well as learned behavior with opposing valence. Extensive interconnections between the two higher brain centers, the MB and the LH through MBONs and LHONs, signify how the MB modulates the innate olfactory pathways and the valence code in the LH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bates et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Das Chakraborty and Sachse, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dolan et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Frechter et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Our study suggests that glutamatergic LHNs use different strategies to extract different features of odor information, (1) conserving the identity of an olfactory stimulus by forming an odor-specific activity map and (2) encoding the valence of an odor by integrating information from multiple olfactory channels. It is an ongoing debate regarding how neurons in the LH evaluate an odor stimulus. Gradual detection, encoding, and categorization of an odor at different olfactory processing levels can result in a simple binary choice or complex behavioral responses of an animal. The behavioral preferences are simply reflected in either to approach (positive) or to leave (negative), to copulate (positive) or to reject (negative), and to oviposit (positive) or to find another suitable oviposition site (negative) depending upon the behavioral assays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Galizia, 2014</xref>). Hence, based on the context or ecological relevance, an odor can be evaluated either as ‘pleasant’ or ‘unpleasant,’ which is well reflected by the response properties of glutamatergic LHNs regarding their valence specificity and their correlation between response strength and behavioral odor preference.</p><p>Notably, such a correlation between response intensity and behavioral preference has also been observed in previous studies, where the amplitude of food odor-evoked activity in neuropeptide F (dNPF) neurons was found to strongly correlate with food odor attractiveness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Beshel and Zhong, 2013</xref>). Another study that combined functional imaging with tracking of innate behavioral responses revealed that the behavioral output could be accurately predicted by a model summing up the normalized glomerular responses, in which each glomerulus contributes a small but specific part to the resulting odor preference (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Badel et al., 2016</xref>). At the level of the LH, LHNs then integrate the olfactory information from the glomerular responses conveyed via uPNs and mPNs. In one of our previous studies, we demonstrated that mPNs respond differently to attractive and aversive odors, and mediate behavioral attraction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Strutz et al., 2014</xref>). In this context, our study complements this previous finding by showing that also uPNs display distinct valence-specific responses in the LH to attractive and aversive odors. Information from these two PN pathways becomes integrated and processed in the LH, resulting in valence-specific activities in glutamatergic LHNs, which may in turn determine the relative behavioral preference.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>mPN-mediated inhibition generates odor-specific response patterns in the LH</title><p>We demonstrate that mPNs inhibit the glutamatergic LHNs in an odor-selective manner, leading to an odor-specific response pattern. According to our observations, glutamatergic LHNs receive a stronger inhibition from mPNs in response to the odors vinegar and acetophenone than to benzaldehyde, whereas other odors, such as 2,3 butanedione, linalool, and ethyl acetate, seem not to induce an inhibition. In the absence of this inhibition, we noted that in addition to an increased response amplitude and altered odor representation, the activity patterns of different odors became more strongly correlated and hence more similar. We therefore conclude that the mPN-mediated selective inhibition on this glutamatergic subset of LHNs is necessary to maintain odor specificity. Along this line, a previous study has reported that mPNs provide an odor-selective input to vlpr neurons, another class of third-order LHNs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Liang et al., 2013</xref>). According to these authors, this odor-specific modulation depends on the nature of the odor and results from the stereotyped connectivity of mPNs in the AL as well as in the LH. Although this study provides evidence that uPNs are not presynaptically inhibited by mPNs, another study established that mPNs indeed inhibit uPNs in the LH, facilitating odor discrimination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Parnas et al., 2013</xref>). In addition to uPNs and vlpr neurons, our study identifies another class of recipient neurons (glutamatergic LHNs) that receives mPN-mediated odorant-selective inhibition.</p><p>The glutamatergic LHN population in our study comprises glutamatergic LHONs as well as LHLNs since we used a broad line that labels an ensemble of all glutamatergic LHNs. The study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dolan et al., 2019</xref> employed specific split-Gal4 lines to selectively label LHINs, LHLNs, and LHONs with different neurotransmitter identities and analyzed their connectivity using EM connectomics. By employing artificial activation of specific subsets of LHNs via CsChrimson, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dolan et al., 2019</xref> was able to demonstrate that one class of glutamatergic LHLNs (so-called PV4a1:5) forms excitatory synapses with AV1a1 LHONs that mediate aversive behavioral responses. In our study, since we used a generic Gal4-line to label all glutamatergic LHNs, we could neither activate nor silence specific neuronal subsets to observe their relevance with regard to odor-guided behavior. However, when we correlated the odor response strength of LHNs to the olfactory preference, we observed that these neurons are mainly tuned to attractive odors, suggesting that they are involved in mediating approach behavior. Although we were not able to clearly differentiate the functional properties between different populations of LHONs and LHLNs, our study provides the first understanding of how odors are integrated, transformed, and finally represented in the LH by an ensemble of glutamatergic LHNs.</p><p>Intriguingly, the neurotransmitter identity of this class of LHNs opens up another interesting aspect: Knowing that glutamate can act as an excitatory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aungst et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Das et al., 2011a</xref>) or inhibitory neurotransmitter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Liu and Wilson, 2013</xref>), as well as a coincident detector (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Das et al., 2011b</xref>), depending upon the receptors present in the postsynaptic neurons, further experiments are needed to reveal the consequences of glutamatergic LHN input onto their postsynaptic partner neurons. Certainly, the presence of an impressive amount of vesicular glutamate in the LH points towards a significant role of glutamatergic LHNs with regard to odor coding and processing at this higher brain center.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Fly stocks</title><p>Flies were raised on autoclaved cornmeal-yeast-sucrose-agar food in a 12 hr light/dark cycle at 25°C incubator.

Flies were briefly immobilized on ice and then mounted onto a custom-made Plexiglas stage with a copper plate (Athene Grids, Plano). A needle before the head was placed to stabilize the proboscis and align the head properly. Protemp II composite (3M ESPE) was used to fix the head with the copper plate. We bent the anterior part of the fly’s head with fine gold wire, and a small plastic plate having a round window was placed on top. We sealed the head with that plate using two-component silicone (Kwik Sil) and leaving the center part open to make a cut. The cuticle between the eyes and the ocelli was gently cut under saline (130 mM NaCl, 5 mM KCl, 2 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 2 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 36 mM saccharose, 5 mM HEPES, 1 M NaOH, pH 7.3). The cuticle was either bent forward and fixed to the silicon or removed.

The microscope and the laser were placed on a smart table UT2 (New Corporation, Irvine, CA). The fluorophore of GCaMP6f was excited with 925 nm.

and utilized at multiple levels in the brain. In this study, the authors use a variety of modern genetic and optophysiological tools to uncover the function and connectivity of glutamatergic neurons in a higher brain center of <italic>Drosophila</italic> – the lateral horn. They find that these neurons do not only encode chemical odor identity, but also the hedonic value (attractive or repulsive) of odors. This advances our understanding of how odors are represented in the brain and will be of value to those who are interested in odor coding and behavioral valence of various odors.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="decision-letter" id="sa1"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.74637.sa1</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision letter</article-title></title-group><contrib-group content-type="section"><contrib contrib-type="editor"><name><surname>Sen</surname><given-names>Sonia</given-names></name><role>Reviewing Editor</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/04xf4yw96</institution-id><institution>Tata Institute for Genetics and Society</institution></institution-wrap><country>India</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="reviewer"><name><surname>Sen</surname><given-names>Sonia</given-names></name><role>Reviewer</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/04xf4yw96</institution-id><institution>Tata Institute for Genetics and Society</institution></institution-wrap><country>India</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="reviewer"><name><surname>Fiala</surname><given-names>André</given-names></name><role>Reviewer</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/01y9bpm73</institution-id><institution>University of Göttingen</institution></institution-wrap><country>Germany</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><boxed-text id="sa2-box1"><p>Our editorial process produces two outputs: i) <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://sciety.org/articles/activity/10.1101/2021.09.29.462361">public reviews</ext-link> designed to be posted alongside <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.09.29.462361v1">the preprint</ext-link> for the benefit of readers; ii) feedback on the manuscript for the authors, including requests for revisions, shown below.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, including Sonia Sen as Reveiwng Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by K VijayRaghavan as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: André Fiala (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1.

We could successfully label and reconstruct single LHLNs from the dorsomedial cluster (incorporated now into Figure 1C). Due to the position of the cell bodies, the primary neurite as well as the neurotransmitter identity, we assume that these LHLNs belong to the PD3a1 and PD3a2 neuron cluster according to Dolan et al., 2019.

Along with our data we have also incorporated the connectivity data reported in Dolan et al., 2019, Frechter et al., 2019 and Bates et al., 2020. We have discussed our observed odor-evoked response patterns in glutamatergic LHNs in the context of the known connectivity as suggested in the Discussion part (page13). However, it is rather difficult to predict precisely how the known connectivity based on the EM connectomics data would result in the observed odor-evoked activity patterns in LHNs. First of all, the topographic map of uPN axonal terminals is not retained at the level of LHNs, since the same LHNs receive input from similarly tuned as well as differently tuned uPNs. Secondly, both uPNs as well as mPNs provide input to glutamatergic LHNs and those LHNs in turn feedback onto those second-order neurons and provide feedforward information to other LHNs. Due to this complex network connectivity rather broad than sparse, but odor-specific, activity patterns in LHNs can be expected.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2.

We observed for all odors a trend in increased activity after the laser ablation of mPNs, while only acetophenone displays a significant enhancement in a consistent manner. These observations altogether confirm that glutamatergic LHNs receive an odor-specific inhibition, that is strong for vinegar and acetophenone, moderate for benzaldehyde and weak or absent for 2,3 butanedione, linalool and ethyl acetate. The new data are provided in Figure 5—figure supplement 2 (Results section, page 11). Since Figure 5 fills already one page, it is not possible to include the control data in the main figure (as suggested by the reviewers) without removing data of the transection experiments with benzaldehyde and vinegar and therefore decided to provide the old and new control data in Figure 5—figure supplement 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3.

To clarify the reviewer’s doubt, the individual odor-evoked responses of each grid/ pixel were compared only within one animal, not across brains. Therefore, the correlation coefficient and linkage analyses were obtained based on the similarity of responses for all 65 pixels across odors for each animal. The obtained correlation coefficient from each animal was then averaged.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Typo in line 201: It should be 3F, I think.</p></disp-quote><p>I think there is some misunderstanding.

It reveals on one hand the robust signal of CD8 GRASP and on the other hand how the similar pattern of synaptic connectivity is reflected in the neurexin GRASP. Moreover, we would like to keep the colored images, since the green signal in the neurexin GRASP staining clearly shows the sparse synaptic connectivity of glutamatergic LHNs with uPNs and mPNs, which is not so clearly visible in the gray-scaled images.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– The ablation experiments: I would recommend adding the controls to the main figure.

While repeating the mACT ablation for additional odors, we have also performed the controls for 2,3 butanedione and collected additional data for benzaldehyde, which shows now a lower increase compared to the previous plot.

The two approaches are different, and I'm sure there's merit in both.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that both studies have addressed the connectivity of LHNs and their role in determining behavioral valence using different approaches. However, we also think that both studies cannot be simply compared because of their different approaches. Dolan et al., (2019) employed specific split-Gal4 lines to label LHINs, LHLNs and LHONs with different neurotransmitter identities and analyzed their connectivity using EM connectomics. In our study we have used a broad line that labels an ensemble of all glutamatergic LHNs that includes both LHLNs and LHONs and characterized their connectivity using GRASP and functional methods, such as laser transection of specific PN tracts. Dolan et al., employed artificial activation of specific subset of LHNs via CsChrimson to determine their role with regard to attractive and aversive behavioral preferences in diverse behavioral assays. According to them, one class of glutamatergic LHLNs (so-called PV4a1:5) makes excitatory synapses with AV1a1 LHONs which mediate aversive behavioral responses. In our study, since we used a generic Gal4-line to label all glutamatergic LHNs, we could not activate or silence specific neuronal subsets to observe their relevance in odor-guided behavior. Therefore, we correlated the odor response strength of LHNs with the olfactory preference and found that they are tuned to attractive odors and might mediate approach. Since the odor responses in our glutamatergic LHNs includes both LHLNs and LHONs it is fairly difficult to dissect the contribution that each neuron has to determine the behavioral valence. We have added a discussion about the comparison of our study to the data published by Dolan et al., (2019) in the Discussion section (pages 16-17).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>I appreciate this study as an important step towards deciphering how odours are represented in the LH and consider this a solid piece of work.

Providing the schematic only with known findings in the beginning would be rather redundant and may not add to much value.</p><p>In one of our previous studies we have observed that the response patterns of mPNs form a valence-specific activation map in the LH (Strutz et al., 2014). Notably, this map corresponds only partly with the response patterns of the glutamatergic LHNs, indicating that the valence code of PNs is not just translated into a valence code at the LH level. We have added this point to our discussion (page 14).</p><p>We have measured the odor-evoked responses of glutamatergic LHNs at three different focal planes.

The neurons have been reconstructed in 3D using the AMIRA software (incorporated now into Figure 1C).

However, in our case the glutamatergic LHN and uPN response amplitudes do not correlate with each other (Figure 3K, Figure 2 Figure Supplement 1B, C) indicating that an increased activity in uPNs does not necessarily evoke an increased activity in LHNs in a linear manner. Hence, it is feasible that a lot of processing is occurring in the LH and that the responses from uPNs are transformed and translated into LHN response patterns in a complex manner. We mention that transformation process in our Discussion.</p></body></sub-article></article>
