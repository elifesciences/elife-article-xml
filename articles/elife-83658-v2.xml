We applied a combination of metabolomics, lipidomics and proteomics to human bones to investigate their combined potential to estimate time elapsed since death (i.e., the postmortem interval [PMI]). This ‘ForensOMICS’ approach has the potential to improve accuracy and precision of PMI estimation of skeletonized human remains, thereby helping forensic investigators to establish the timeline of events surrounding death. Anterior midshaft tibial bone was collected from four female body donors before their placement at the Forensic Anthropology Research Facility owned by the Forensic Anthropological Center at Texas State (FACTS). Bone samples were again collected at selected PMIs (219-790-834-872days). Liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC-MS) was used to obtain untargeted metabolomic, lipidomic, and proteomic profiles from the pre- and post-placement bone samples. The three omics blocks were investigated independently by univariate and multivariate analyses, followed by Data Integration Analysis for Biomarker discovery using Latent variable approaches for Omics studies (DIABLO), to identify the reduced number of markers describing postmortem changes and discriminating the individuals based on their PMI. The resulting model showed that pre-placement metabolome, lipidome and proteome profiles were clearly distinguishable from post-placement ones. Metabolites in the pre-placement samples suggested an extinction of the energetic metabolism and a switch towards another source of fuelling (e.g., structural proteins). We were able to identify certain biomolecules with an excellent potential for PMI estimation, predominantly the biomolecules from the metabolomics block. Our findings suggest that, by targeting a combination of compounds with different postmortem stability, in the future we could be able to estimate both short PMIs, by using metabolites and lipids, and longer PMIs, by using proteins.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>human bone</kwd><kwd>postmortem interval</kwd><kwd>decomposition</kwd><kwd>multi-omics</kwd><kwd>metabolomics</kwd><kwd>lipidomics</kwd><kwd>proteomics</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100014013</institution-id><institution>UK Research and Innovation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MR/S032878/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Procopio</surname><given-names>Noemi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000781</institution-id><institution>European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>319209</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mickleburgh</surname><given-names>Hayley L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001717</institution-id><institution>Leiden University</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>5604/30-4-2015/Byvanck</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mickleburgh</surname><given-names>Hayley L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The integration of multiple omics panels obtained from bone tissue could aid in the evaluation of the postmortem interval in forensic investigations, expanding the boundaries of forensic research.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The modifications that occur to the human body after death are complex and known to be affected by a variety of intrinsic and extrinsic factors. The rate of decomposition can vary significantly depending on the environment and even the manner of death. Nonetheless, the process of decomposition has been demonstrated to be predictable, providing opportunities to estimate the time elapsed since death (also known as postmortem interval [PMI]) based on gross morphological and/or microscopic changes to the body. Precise and accurate estimation of the PMI is crucial to help establishing the timeline of events surrounding death, can support medicolegal investigators with the identification of the deceased and can corroborate or negate other forensic evidence.</p><p>In the first hours after death, the body undergoes several postmortem changes, including progressive cooling (<italic>algor mortis</italic>), increased rigidity associated with muscle stiffness (<italic>rigor mortis</italic>), and pink-purplish discolouration, in light skinned individuals, caused by the lack of blood circulation and the settling of blood in the lowest areas (<italic>livor mortis</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Clark et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Henssge and Madea, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Madea, 2016</xref>). After these stages, as the time since death increases, the breaking down and liquefaction of the organs and other soft tissues will occur: a process referred to as putrefaction. The lack of oxygenated circulation induces cellular hypoxia, leading to swelling of the cells, and subsequent rupture of cell membranes and release of digestive enzymes. This triggers the autolytic digestion of soft tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lee Goff, 2009</xref>). The body becomes fully anaerobic, allowing anoxic (endogenous) bacteria originated from the gut to proliferate and transmigrate throughout the entire body (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Javan et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jans et al., 2004</xref>). The activity of endogenous bacteria results in the accumulation of gases which causes bloating of the soft tissues, starting from the abdomen but also taking place in the face during early decomposition stages, and progressing towards the rest of the body. Colonization of the body by insects and exogenous bacteria, mostly aerobic microorganisms, contributes further to the macroscopic changes and to the reduction of the overall mass of soft tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hyde et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Carter et al., 2017</xref>). Besides these, other extrinsic factors including abiotic environmental conditions (e.g., humidity, temperature, sun exposition, aeration, burial context) and biotic factors, such as the presence and type of microorganisms, insects, and scavengers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cockle and Bell, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Procopio et al., 2017b</xref>), will affect the rate of decomposition of the soft tissues. Intrinsic factors known to affect the rate of decomposition include, among others, body mass index and both antemortem and perimortem pathological conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Mickleburgh et al., 2021</xref>). Completion of the putrefactive stage and the activity of insects consuming the remaining soft tissues will leave the remains completely, or almost completely, skeletonized, and dry.</p><p>The complex nature and interplay of intrinsic and extrinsic variables involved in the process of decomposition makes the development of accurate and precise models for PMI estimation extremely challenging. Traditional methods of PMI estimation include calculating PMI using the body temperature and ambient temperature (which relies on the predictability of <italic>algor mortis</italic>, and works for short PMIs only), or the visual assessment of gross morphological changes to the body to estimate a relatively wide PMI range. Since the rate of gross morphological changes is variable, methods that rely on the visual scoring of decomposition stages suffer from issues of poor accuracy and precision. An additional problem of such methods is the effect of interobserver variations on the scoring of decomposition stages. For all commonly used PMI estimation methods, the accuracy and precision decreases considerably as decomposition progresses, and is particularly problematic when the remains are partially or completely skeletonized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Henssge and Madea, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Madea, 2016</xref>).</p><p>In recent years, the number of studies exploring the use of biomolecular methods for PMI estimation has risen sharply, due to their potential for providing more accurate and precise estimation methods based on the rates of decay of different molecules and compounds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Procopio et al., 2018b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Prieto-Bonete et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Pesko et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Locci et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Zelentsova et al., 2020</xref>). Better understanding of biomolecular decomposition of bone will provide opportunities to develop biomolecular methods for the estimation of longer PMIs (i.e., timeframes in which soft tissues are unlikely to be preserved). Moreover, through the combined analysis of multiple different panels of omics, greater precision and accuracy of PMI estimation can potentially be achieved.</p><p>Biomolecular decomposition is caused by both enzymatic and microbial breakdown of large molecules, resulting in the breakage of proteins into amino acids (AA), of carbohydrates into more simple monosaccharides, and of lipids into simpler fatty acids chains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dent et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Nolan et al., 2020</xref>). In carbohydrate decomposition, the complex polysaccharides are normally broken down via microbial activity into smaller units of monosaccharides. This breakdown can be fully achieved by oxidation, with the production of carbon dioxide and water, or can be partially achieved with the production of organic acids and alcohols. Alternatively, the monosaccharides can be degraded by fungal activity into glucuronic, citric, and oxalic acids, or by bacteria into lactic, butyric, and acetic acids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dent et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Stuart, 2013</xref>). During the decay of lipids, free saturated and unsaturated fatty acids are released due to the hydrolysis mediated by the action of intrinsic lipases released after death. These can then be converted into hydroxyl fatty acids (the main constituent of adipocere) by the action of specific bacterial enzymes in humid environments, or can associate with potassium and sodium ions, resulting in the formation of salts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Stuart, 2013</xref>). Protein degradation is primarily an enzyme-driven process, led by the action of proteases, which occurs at different rates for different proteins and tissues. Proteolytic enzymes induce the hydrolytic breakdown of proteins and the production respectively of proteoses, peptones, polypeptides, and finally AA, which can be further modified via deamination (production of ammonia), decarboxylation (production of cadaverine, putrescine, tyramine, tryptamine, indole, skatole, and carbon dioxide) and desulfhydralation (production of hydrogen sulphide, pyruvic acid, and thiols) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dent et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Stuart, 2013</xref>). Time-dependent non-enzymatic processes can also affect protein degradation and modifications (i.e.,deamidations).</p><p>The analysis of low molecular weight compounds and decomposition by-products is becoming more popular in forensic science, particularly for the purpose of estimating PMI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Locci et al., 2020</xref>). Time since death was recently reported as the main variable driving modifications in the metabolome occurring after death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chighine et al., 2021</xref>) in many soft tissues and fluids, so the metabolomic approach appears ideal to estimate PMI. However, the potential forensic significance of the postmortem bone metabolome is as yet underexplored (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alldritt et al., 2019</xref>). Several studies on soft tissues (vitreous and aqueous humour) have examined metabolomics for the purpose of determining short PMIs. Examining longer PMIs based on metabolomics analysis of humour has not been possible due to evaporation and leakage through the corneal surface as time since death progresses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Locci et al., 2019</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Girela et al., 2008</xref> reported a significant positive correlation between PMI and taurine, glutamate, and aspartate levels found in vitreous humour. These results were partially confirmed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Zelentsova et al., 2020</xref>, who found a correlation between the levels of hypoxanthine, choline, creatine, betaine, glutamate, and glycine and PMI. Another approach employing <sup>1</sup>H-NMR on aqueous humour from pig heads reported taurine, choline, and succinate as major metabolites involved in the postmortem modification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Locci et al., 2019</xref>). The same study also showed an orthogonally constrained PLS2 model showing prediction error of 59 min for PMI &lt;500 min, 104 min for PMI from 500 to 1000 min, and 118 min for PMI &gt;1000 min. Besides humour, muscle is one of the most frequently targeted tissues in metabolomics studies focused on short PMI estimation. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Pesko et al., 2020</xref> recently evaluated rat and human biceps femoris muscles from the same individuals at different PMIs, demonstrating an increase of the abundance of several metabolites, including most of those derived from the breakdown of proteins, and in particular highlighting how threonine, tyrosine and lysine show the most consistent and predictable variations in relatively short PMIs. An untargeted metabolomics study on muscle tissue also indicated the potential of isolating biomarkers associated with age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Wilkinson et al., 2020</xref>), suggesting the potential applications of metabolomics for both age-at-death and PMI estimation.</p><p>To date, only three studies have used lipidomics assays for PMI estimation. Two of them were conducted on muscle tissue and showed, in general, a negative correlation between most lipid classes and PMI, as well as an increment in free fatty acids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Langley et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Wood and Shirley, 2013</xref>). The third study applied lipidomics to trabecular bone samples from calcanei spanning a PMI of approximately 7 years and highlighted the presence of 76 potential <italic>N</italic>-acyl AA that could be employed for PMI estimation, however their correlation with PMI has not yet been fully elucidated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dudzik et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Several studies have tried to quantify the degree of survival of proteins and the accumulation of post-translational modifications (PTMs) of AA in both animal and human models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Procopio et al., 2017b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Mickleburgh et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Prieto-Bonete et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Procopio et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Mizukami et al., 2020</xref>) as well as under different conditions (e.g., in aquatic environments, different types of coffins, buried vs. surface) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Procopio et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Mizukami et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bonicelli et al., 2022</xref>). The premise of these studies is that the protective action of the hydroxyapatite is expected to enhance the survival of proteins, allowing potential estimation of longer PMIs. Results generally showed that blood/plasma and ubiquitous proteins decrease in their abundance constantly starting from the early decomposition stages, whereas proteins more strongly connected to the mineral matrix such as bone-specific proteins are able to survive for longer PMIs and can be useful indicators for PMI estimation also in skeletonized remains. Similarly, also the accumulation of specific non-enzymatic PTMs, such as deamidations, can be used as a biomarker for the evaluation of the PMI in bones.</p><p>While many studies have applied different analytical platforms for proteomics, metabolomics, and lipidomics to several different matrices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Pesko et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Locci et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Zelentsova et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Girela et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Li et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Wu et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hirakawa et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Banaschak et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Li et al., 2017</xref>), relatively little is known about the biomolecular decomposition of bone tissue. Moreover, while clinical studies have applied multi-omics methods with some frequency, their potential for the development of more precise and accurate biomolecular PMI estimation methods has not been explored. The present study applies, for the first time, a multi-omics approach (i.e., combined proteomics, metabolomics and lipidomics, defined here as the ‘ForensOMICS’ approach) to pre- and post-decomposition tibial cortical bone samples from four human female body donors, to identify potential multi-omics biomarkers of time since death. The multi-omics approach uses the natural differences in manner and rate of decomposition between the different biomolecules (proteins, metabolites, lipids) to expand the potential range of PMIs and to cross-correlate results between different sets of biomarkers to narrow down PMI ranges based on the degradation of multiple biomolecules. The use a of a single omics technique would not be suitable to investigate a wide range of potential PMIs. Metabolites and lipids are appropriate for short PMIs while protein has been proved to be stable across longer ones. Therefore, the combination of the three classes of biomolecules aims to obtain an ideal coverage across a wider range of PMIs. Additional advantages of the integration of different biomolecule classes might include greater flexibility in their application across different environments and different postmortem treatments, since it could increase the likelihood of retrieving suitable markers for PMI estimation. The present study provides a proof-of-concept for future validation of the multi-omics approach on a larger number of individuals.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Single omics profile</title><p>The metabolites matrices resulting from the combination of metabolomics ESI+ and ESI- data were combined in a final matrix with a total of 104 identified compounds after the removal of non-endogenous compounds following querying in HMDB. Furthermore, after preliminary inspection via PCA, lipidomics ESI+ results were excluded due to their poor contribution to a potential discriminant model. Each omics block was then evaluated individually via univariate (Kruskal-Wallis and Dunn’s pairwise test) and multivariate (partial least square discriminant analysis [PLS-DA]) analysis. The overall the clustered image map (CIM) and individual plot obtained with metabolomics suggested a clear separation between fresh and decomposed samples and the total variance explained by the model in the first two components taken together was 60% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). More interestingly, increasing PMIs were found to cluster progressively further away from the fresh samples. By observing the clustering of the variables in the CIM, it was clear the presence of three major behaviours: (i) reduction in the intensity of compounds between the pre-deposition samples and the skeletonized ones; (ii) higher intensity of compounds for the 219, 790, 843 days PMI groups; (iii) presence of compounds that specifically were more intense in the 872 days PMI. Examples of these behaviours can be observed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>. These compounds were found to be significant for Kruskal-Wallis but were only visually selected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>) because of their trend with PMI. However, these results were not fully supported by statistical testing, as pairwise analysis mainly showed significant differences between few PMI groups, specifically between baseline vs. more advanced PMIs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). It is interesting to note that D2 appeared to have a specific profile in the pre-deposition state that clearly differed from the other donors, therefore potentially affecting the overall clustering and partially hiding the effect of PMI. In contrast, D4 after decomposition showed a distinct profile, likely associated with the prolonged PMI.</p><p>Lipidomic profiling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>) showed that the closer cluster to the pre-deposition individuals is the 872 days group, followed by 219, 790, and 834 days. This could be related to the fact that a large number of lipids, not highly abundant in the fresh portion of the sample, was found to be higher in intensity for early PMIs to then progressively decrease. However, a large block constituted mostly by ceramides, was here shown to be highly present in the skeletonized D4 compared to the remaining individuals, suggesting a relationship with PMI. The same three behaviours extrapolated for metabolite features were identified for lipids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). The model for this block explains 73% of the variance in the first two components.</p><p>Finally, proteins showed an inferior discriminatory power in comparison with the other classes of molecules according to individual consensus plot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). The variance explained in the model in the first two components was only 35% and, besides the major separation between pre- and post-decomposition, it was not possible to clearly discriminate the various PMIs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). However, with the exception of D3 (834 days PMI), it is clear that the skeletonized samples cluster away from the fresh ones with increasing PMIs. Few proteins evaluated via univariate statistics, however, showed clear visual and significant negative trends in the overall sample (Kruskal-Wallis), although pairwise comparison could not confirm the statistical significance of the difference across PMIs (Dunn’s test, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). These proteins were ASPN_HUMAN, H4_HUMAN, HBB_HUMAN, OSTP_HUMAN, VIME_HUMAN. Moreover, what was clear in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref> is the large variation between replicates that could affect the evaluation of the proteins’ behaviour with PMI.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Omics integration</title><p>All the 24 human bone samples were included in the omics integration model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). We firstly evaluated correlations between the omics block using PLS regression. Results for component 1 showed an R value of 0.94 between metabolomics and lipidomics, 0.96 between metabolomics and proteomics and 0.87 between lipidomics and proteomics. Feature selection using the DIABLO method aimed to identify highly correlated and discriminant variables across the three omics. The arrow plot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) showed the overall separation between fresh and skeletonized samples, which was mainly developed along the first component. However, it was possible to note that the individual with the longest PMI (D4, 872 days) also clustered away from the remaining skeletonized samples along the second component (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). The optimal number of components was set at three by means of threefold cross-validation repeated 100 times (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). The overall balanced error remained below 0.4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>). After tuning the model by attributing the same weight to all the omics blocks, the ideal panel of markers selected in the first component that retained most of the covariance of the system includes 14 metabolites, 5 lipids and 5 proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). These loading plots show that a few metabolite markers have a high loading for different PMIs, whereas both lipid and protein markers have high values particularly for the fresh samples. Considering the individual -omics consensus plots in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5</xref>, metabolite and lipid blocks showed a better segregation between the various PMIs in the skeletonized state in comparison with the protein one.

Most of the compounds selected by the model were highly abundant in the fresh samples and less abundant in the skeletonized ones, although the lower panel of metabolites (in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>) showed an opposite trend. In general, it could be observed that the samples with shorter PMIs (up to 834 days) showed a decline for proteins, lipids, and for eight of the metabolites selected for the PMI model as well as an increase in the remaining six metabolites in comparison with their fresh counterparts. Whereas the decline in the abundance of proteins and lipids in comparison with the fresh samples was similar between all the 12 skeletonized samples, the increase or decrease in the abundance of specific metabolites was more exacerbated in the samples with the longest PMI (872 days) in comparison with the others (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). To conclude, the model was first cross-validated resulting in a mean standard error of the classification error of 9.67. Additionally, after performing permutation test there was still significant difference in the discrimination between the PMIs (p=0.001).</p><p>By evaluating individual markers, it was possible to identify compounds that increased or decreased consistently across the PMI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>).

The remaining metabolites decreased consistently with PMI with a considerable drop between the baseline and 219 days. Lipids and proteins selected for the model, instead, were all characterized by a drastic reduction in their intensity in the skeletonized samples in comparison with the fresh ones. Proteins selected here were two histone proteins (histone H2A type 1H [H2A1H] and histone H4 [H4]), haemoglobin subunit alpha (HBA), vimentin (VIME) and actin (ACTB).</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>DIABLO selected variables correlated with PMI.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Boxplots of the selected variables after tuning that shows variation with postmortem interval (PMI).

To develop and validate multi-omics PMI estimation methods for forensic applications, replication studies in substantial sample sizes of human bones will be necessary. However, the availability of bone samples both before and after decomposition from the same individuals is currently very limited. The work presented here represents a proof-of-concept study on the potential advantages of combining different omics for PMI estimation. The small number of individuals included is consistent with numbers generally used in human decomposition experiments, in which for practical and ethical reasons larger samples, such as used in clinical studies, are very difficult to obtain. While the sample size used here is not suitable for validation purposes, it serves to demonstrate the value and potential of the ‘ForensOMICS’ approach.</p><p>Considering each omics individually, the proteomic profile appears to show quite a considerable overlap between the individuals from three post-decomposition groups (i.e., 219, 790, and 834 days) suggesting that this method on its own does not provide sufficient sensitivity to segregate close PMIs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). This could be due to the nature of these biomolecules; proteins, in fact, are highly stable and may be better suitable for long-term PMI estimation in forensic scenarios (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Procopio et al., 2018b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Prieto-Bonete et al., 2019</xref>) as well as in the investigation of archaeological remains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Wadsworth et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Warinner et al., 2022</xref>). Additionally, other analyses such as post-translational protein modifications may reveal a greater potential for PMI estimation in bones than the evaluation of the abundance of specific markers on their own (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Procopio et al., 2018b</xref>). Employing a system biology approach for PMI estimation for forensic purposes by combining more than one class of biomolecules that have different postmortem stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dent et al., 2004</xref>) provides a more comprehensive biological explanation of the processes under investigation. This is achieved here by combining different layers of omics (i.e., metabolomics, lipidomics, and proteomics) to reconstruct the molecular profile of the overall system. The DIABLO model simultaneously identifies important markers to optimize the classification of a specific variable by combining multiple omics techniques (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Singh et al., 2019</xref>). This is normally used to explain the biological mechanisms that determine a disease and its development, while in our case the main advantage is represented by the potential of selecting a pool of compounds that effectively explains, and could accurately estimate, PMI changes over an extended period of time. One interesting aspect of this approach is the difference in clustering between the metabolite and lipid blocks individually compared to the integration model. It can be seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref> (metabolomics block) that samples with increasing PMIs seem to cluster further away from the pre-deposition sample in a time-dependent manner, with the 219 days PMI being closer to the fresh donors and the 872 days one being the furthest located. However, as suggested, the metabolomics profile of D2 seems to be significantly different from the other donors in the fresh state, and this could suggest that interindividual variation could affect the efficient clustering. This has been already highlighted in the proteomics work conducted on the same samples and was likely caused by the health condition of the donor prior to death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Mickleburgh et al., 2021</xref>). In contrast, the positioning of the PMI in the cluster tree behaves in the opposite way for lipids, where the various profiles seem not to be affected by any apparent interindividual variation in the fresh nor in the decomposed state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). Considering now the clustering of the integrative model, it provides a clear classification of the PMIs obtained by the combination of the three single blocks. Since the approach chosen for this pilot study was discriminant analysis and PMI was provided to the model as a categorical variable, we believe that treating the response variable (PMI) as an ordinal or continuous variable on a larger sample size could improve the interpretation of the results and the forensic applicability of the methodology. Despite acknowledging these limitations, these preliminary results show the possibility of using multi-omics integration to identify different PMI groups. Furthermore, the results for proteomics, that individually does not allow discrimination for these specific time intervals, are integrated in the final model by retaining only the proteins that contribute to PMI identification.</p><p>Additionally, the presence of the two main clusters identified (fresh and skeletonized) has been driven by the greater differences between pre- and post-deposition. Conventionally, when performing method development for PMI estimation on bone samples collections, the baseline time is not available. Therefore, the differences captured with the analysis would be obtained on skeletonized samples only. We believe, however, that due to the uniqueness of the sample it was not ideal to remove the pre-deposition specimens. Despite these issues, we found moderate to high correlation between the omics blocks that allows their integration using the sparse algorithm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Singh et al., 2019</xref>) for PMI estimation.</p><p>Recently, literature has grown on the use of molecular studies via omics platforms, especially for short-term PMIs. Most of the studies involving metabolomics for PMI estimation focused on quickly degradable matrices (e.g., muscle, blood, humour) collected over a short period of time (&lt;1 month) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Pesko et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Locci et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Banaschak et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Ith et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Ith et al., 2002</xref>). As previously mentioned, the analysis of proteins in bone has shown applicability to estimate relatively long PMIs in forensics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Procopio et al., 2018b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Mizukami et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Procopio et al., 2018a</xref>) as well as to address archaeological questions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Ntasi et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Pal Chowdhury et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brandt and Mannering, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Richter et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brown et al., 2016</xref>), due to the prolonged survival of this type of biomolecules. Finally, according to the studies presented so far, it seems that postmortem changes of lipids could provide PMI estimation across several years, although there is great need for validation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dudzik et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dudzik et al., 2020</xref>). The combination of these biomolecules’ classes in a multi-omics model could therefore be beneficial for estimating PMI across a broader range of potential PMIs. Metabolites and lipids offer accuracy in the short to medium term while proteins could be the main markers for longer PMIs due to their greater stability. Furthermore, variable selection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Singh et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Rohart et al., 2017</xref>) would offer the advantage of simplifying experimental procedures and targets those markers that behave consistently with PMI. To limit the potential effects of interindividual variability, we considered variables that showed no outliers among the four body donors and created a model that limits as much as possible the number of predictors without affecting the assessment of the PMI.</p><p>Our results for the metabolomics assay display clear differences between the pre- and post-placement bone metabolomic profiles, suggesting the potential to use these profiles to assess long PMIs. The small sample size in this study does not allow us to make any deep inferences about the biological significance of the metabolomics profiles of the post-placement samples, as these may have been influenced by exogenous factors. With regard to the pre-placement samples, the PMIs ranging between 2 and 10 days at 4°C would have allowed some minimal postmortem modifications in the metabolome to occur (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chighine et al., 2021</xref>). The metabolomic profiles of these samples are characterized by creatine, taurine, hypoxanthine, 3-hydroxybutyrate, creatinine, and phenylaniline. Hypoxanthine is a well-known hallmark of ATP consumption and, consequently, a sign of exhaustion of normal substrates (i.e., glucose and pyruvate) of the tri-carboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. In conjunction with the presence of creatine, taurine, creatinine, phenylalanine, and 3-hydroxybutyrate, we may hypothesize a switch towards TCA cycle anaplerosis through amino acidic and ketonic substrates, in pursuit of a resilient ATP production during the early/mid-PMIs. Not only was the proposed metabolomic approach able to identify the pre- and post-deposition groups according to the bone metabolome modifications, but it was also sensitive enough to detect at very long PMIs. The presence of exogenous compounds (i.e., caffeine, ecgonine, dextromethorphan, tramadol <italic>N</italic>-oxide, penbutolol, salicylic acid) that could reflect lifestyle habits or pharmacological therapies, and thus potentially has major implications in forensic toxicology and personal identification, is consistent with evidence from animal models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alldritt et al., 2019</xref>). Enrichment analysis can be found in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>.</p><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Metabolite set enrichment analysis based on differentially expressed metabolites identified in bone.</title></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-83658-fig3-v2.tif"/></fig><p>Several polar metabolites identified in this study have previously been found in other tissues to show a consistent decay pattern after death. In fact, most of the compounds of interest matched here have already been flagged in other tissues as good potential biomarkers of PMI across shorter timeframes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Uracil, a pyrimidine base of RNA, was previously seen to increase over a 14-day PMI in human muscle tissue when analysed by LC-MS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Pesko et al., 2020</xref>). Similar results for this compound were found in GC-MS analysis of rat’s blood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dai et al., 2019</xref>). In contrast, no clear association between this metabolite and PMI was found in aqueous humour (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Locci et al., 2019</xref>). In the present study, after a drop in normalized intestines between the baseline and first PMI, we detected an increase until 834 days, and a drop towards the longest PMI considered. It is worth mentioning that most metabolites drop significantly after the baseline (‘fresh’) times (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>), suggesting that compound decomposition is driving this first part of the PMI following the stop of human metabolism. It is interesting that with the increase in PMI there is also an increment in several compounds that could be associated with the breakdown of larger biomolecules (e.g., proteins) or with the presence of microbial communities that leave their own metabolic profile on bone surface. Another common marker of interest is hypoxanthine for its association with hypoxia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Locci et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Zelentsova et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kaszynski et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Jawor et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Locci et al., 2021</xref>), which seems to drastically drop between the baseline times and the first PMI timepoint, as well as in the last time interval, showing a good consistency with PMI. In contrast, hypoxanthine was seen to increase until 48 hr and then to decrease at 72 hr in rat blood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Donaldson and Lamont, 2013</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Zelentsova et al., 2020</xref>, showed a positive relation between hypoxanthine and PMI in human serum, aqueous and vitreous humour. To fully understand the behaviour of this compound in bone tissue, a longitudinal study should be performed, also including short PMIs. Leucine has also been reported in short time scale to increase in human muscle tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Pesko et al., 2020</xref>) and this agrees with our results where, after the initial drop, we noticed a consistent increase from the first PMI onwards. What can be clearly seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> is that D2 affects the linearity of the trend, suggesting that there might be some degree of interindividual variability. This is the case for several compounds; this limitation could be mitigated by increasing the number of individuals per timepoint in future studies. Creatinine has previously been reported to be a good marker in both muscle tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Pesko et al., 2020</xref>). Although it has not been mentioned in literature previously, we also found that neopterin<bold>,</bold> a biomarker for immune system activation commonly profiled in blood, serum, and urine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Melichar et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Laudanski et al., 2021</xref>), has a strong negative correlation with PMI. Taurine, also in accordance with studies on vitreous humour (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Locci et al., 2019</xref>), showed a predictable positive behaviour with PMI. Acetamide is a nitrogen-based compound associated with active and advanced decay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dekeirsschieter et al., 2012</xref>) that, not surprisingly, showed the best positive association with PMI, resulting in being the most reliable biomarker within the entire panel considered. Palmitoylethanolamide is a carboximidic acid that was shown to accumulate in relation with cellular stress in pig brains postmortem (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Buczynski and Parsons, 2010</xref>). These findings agree with our study, which revealed a clear increase of this metabolite with increasing PMIs. <italic>N</italic>,<italic>N</italic>-diethylethanolamine, belonging to the class of organic compounds known as 1,2-aminoalcohols, has not yet been highlighted for its potential in PMI estimation. In the current study, this molecule increased in the decomposed samples, although no clear trends were observed across the various PMIs. A proposed mechanism for its accumulation is the partial oxidation driven by bacterial decomposition of monosaccharides into organic alcohols (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dent et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Nolan et al., 2020</xref>). 12-Aminododecanoic acid and 12-hydroxydodecanoic acid are instead medium-chain fatty acids that show a positive relationship with PMI. Previous studies based on skeletal muscle tissue reported a decline in very-long-chain fatty acids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Langley et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Wood and Shirley, 2013</xref>) in very short PMIs. It is not possible to exclude the cleavage of longer chains by the action of lipases or microorganic activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dent et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Stuart, 2013</xref>). The last compound selected in the final model is methylmalonic acid, a carboxylic acid which is an intermediate in the metabolism of fat and proteins. It has been shown that abnormally high levels of organic acids in blood (organic acidaemia), urine (organic aciduria), brain, and other tissues lead to general metabolic acidosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Narayanan et al., 2011</xref>). In this study, even with a postmortem increase in its concentration, it is not possible to identify a clear trend across the decomposed samples; this may be related to interindividual biological differences of the donors involved in this study (e.g., age and health condition).</p><p>From the lipidomic assay, only five markers were selected in the final model. These are three lysophosphatidylcholines (LPCs), one phosphatidylcholine (PC) and one phosphatidylinositol (PI), all showing decreasing intensities in the decomposed samples in comparison with the ‘fresh’ ones. PCs are generally the most abundant neutral phospholipids and represent the main constituent in cellular membranes. LPCs are derived from the hydrolysis of dietary and biliary PCs and are absorbed as such in the intestines, but they become re-esterified before being exported in the lymph (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">McMaster, 2018</xref>). They are present in cell membranes and in blood. Their half-life in vivo is limited because of the quick metabolic reaction that involves lysophospholipases and LPC-acyltransferases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Law et al., 2019</xref>). In contrast, PLS are amphiphilic molecules that are also minorly present in cell membranes, whose role is to modulate the membrane curvature and to have other bioactive functions such as interacting with peripheral proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Falkenburger et al., 2010</xref>) and inhibiting osteoclast formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alhouayek et al., 2018</xref>). After death, these compounds can be converted into fatty acids via hydrolysis to then hydrogenize or oxidase to form saturated and unsaturated fatty acids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dent et al., 2004</xref>). This process is driven by intrinsic tissues lipases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dent et al., 2004</xref>). A very limited number of studies have applied lipidomics for PMI estimation. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Langley et al., 2019</xref>, evaluated human skeletal muscle tissue from 31 donors over a PMI of 2000 accumulated degree days showing consistent extraction of phosphatidylglycerol (PG) 34:0 and phosphatidylethanolamine 36:4, which showed good correlation with PMI. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Wood and Shirley, 2013</xref>, investigated the lipidome of human anterior quadriceps muscle from one donor at 1-, 9-, and 24-day PMIs showing the decline of sterol sulphates, choline plasmalogens, ethanolamine plasmalogens, and PGs and the increase of free fatty acids. Our results lend support to these earlier findings and further confirm the potential of lipidomics for PMI estimation. Nonetheless, direct comparison with these studies is not possible as they considered different tissues for much shorter PMIs. Additionally, lipids profiled from the muscle tissue after decomposition are suggested to derive from cell membrane breakdown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Langley et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Wood and Shirley, 2013</xref>). We suggest that, in bone material, the lipidome under investigation accounts not only for cell membrane decomposition of embedded osteocytes but also for the marrow and fluids embedded in the bone pores.</p><p>The proteomics results revealed that two ubiquitous proteins (histones), haemoglobin, ACTB, and VIME are the best candidates within this multi-omics PMI model. These five proteins selected by the model represent those which were best able to discriminate between the ‘fresh’ bones and the ‘skeletonized’ bones but are therefore not necessarily the best biomarkers to differentiate between the four post-decomposition PMIs. For insights on the most suitable protein biomarkers for differentiating between the longer PMIs, identified by excluding the ‘fresh’ samples, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Mickleburgh et al., 2021</xref>. It is not surprising to see that the proteins highlighted in the model are either ubiquitous proteins or blood or muscle tissue proteins, as their abundance would naturally be higher in ‘fresh’ bone than in ‘skeletonized’ bones. The HBA is found in red blood cells but is often also identified in bone samples with long PMIs from archaeological contexts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Smith and Wilson, 1990</xref>), and its consistent time-dependent degradation has been previously highlighted in skeletal remains using several platforms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Ramsthaler et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Wiley et al., 2009</xref>). Furthermore, it has already been reported in skeletal tissue from controlled decomposition studies of animals, and already highlighted as a potential biomarker for PMI estimation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Procopio et al., 2018b</xref>). VIME was also previously reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Procopio et al., 2018b</xref>, to be associated with PMI. It is a filament protein abundant in muscle tissue, and therefore its association with bone, particularly with the ‘fresh’ samples, is not unexpected. However, we emphasize that this could also be due to interindividual variability, and that further investigation may clarify the usefulness of VIME to estimate PMI. ACTB, similar to VIME, is a structural protein that forms cross-linked networks in the cytoplasmatic compartments and that is strongly connected with the presence of muscle tissue residues. A previous study showed the decrease in myosin contents with increasing PMIs, similarly to what we observed here for ACTB. The remaining two proteins are both components of the nucleosomes, in our study were shown to be drastically reduced in bone tissue also at the first the baseline PMI taken into consideration. In sum, these results allowed the identification of five protein biomarkers which make good candidates for estimation of short PMIs (&lt;900 days) (e.g., considering time points limited to months postmortem) and not for years after death for which structural and functional proteins in bone have been shown better targets to employ for PMI estimation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Mickleburgh et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Prieto-Bonete et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Based on the findings of this exploratory study, we argue that the multi-omic method we adopted here shows considerable potential for the future development of an accurate and precise PMI estimation method for human bone. Further research should focus on increasing the sample size, to ultimately validate the method for application in forensic investigation of skeletonized human remains. Beyond the findings discussed at length above, we emphasize that it is of paramount importance to establish which biomolecules identified here are associated with the human metabolism and degradation, and which are produced by the decomposers’ microbial activity. Controlled taphonomic experiments on human decomposition at human taphonomy facilities provide the opportunity to elucidate biomolecular decomposition of human bone. A comprehensive understanding of the origin of different compounds is key to provide a detailed explanation of the postmortem changes that affect bone and other tissues, ultimately helping to shed a light on biomolecular PMI investigations and on the real potential that multi-omics analyses can have in this direction.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Body donors</title><p>Bone samples were collected from four female human body donors, aged between 61 and 91 years (mean 74±11.6 SD), at the Forensic Anthropology Center at Texas State University (FACTS).

Despite the small sample size used here, this study demonstrates how the approach can discriminate between short and long PMIs. This method can produce classification models including different markers (e.g., protein, metabolites, and lipids) to assess both short- and long-term PMIs, with a high level of accuracy, as the compounds under investigation have complementary decay rates. The use of different biochemical markers that have different postmortem stability offers the advantage of covering both short-term PMIs, by including metabolites and lipids, and long-term PMIs, by implementing in the model more stable proteins that consistently degrade after death. This could not be fully proven based on our results, as the PMI taken into exam is not sufficiently spread along the timeline and more individuals per timepoint are necessary. However, the possibility of selecting only discriminating variables allows the combination of omics that in isolation could not discriminate in a satisfactory way the PMI. In the present study, proteomics did represent the less ideal omics for the estimation of the time elapsed since death, however few protein variables were successfully included in the model. Furthermore, in the present study the order between the various PMIs was voluntarily not considered in data analysis in order to avoid biases in the generation of the discriminant model. We expect that the PMI estimation over extended time periods will be unlikely achieved by employing any of these three omics individually. Furthermore, treating PMI as a continuous variable could be key in providing an optimal approach for the estimation of PMI. Furthermore, this methodology provides new insights on the biological processes that occur after death and will help establishing whether the presence of certain molecules is the result of their molecular degradation or if it is mostly associated with the bacterial metabolism, a central question in forensic science. The proposed ‘ForensOMICS’ approach must be validated by the analysis of substantial sample sizes in future controlled taphonomic experiments conducted in multiple different environments, as this represents the main source of variation in human decomposition, as well as by evaluating a broader PMI with a more comprehensive coverage of data points in the time period taken into consideration.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Software, Formal analysis, Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Conceptualization, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Writing – original draft, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Data curation, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Data curation, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Conceptualization, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Formal analysis, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Validation, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>This study did not involve human living subjects but only human tissues from deceased individuals who gave their consent prior to death.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Mone Zaidi as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in the review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Sharni Collins (Reviewer #1).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Please address the following concerns/points:</p><p>1. Please consider the inclusion of placement periods/seasons of each of the donors.</p><p>Do you collect any environmental/covariate data, like daily temperature, relative humidity, rainfall, etc of the taphonomic field site? Going forward, with future studies, this information could be extremely useful to inform any future conclusions. In addition, it could open the door to linear mixed models where you could investigate the impact of random or fixed effects, alongside the outcomes of the omics results. You could also potentially use this approach to investigate inter-individual variability, as mentioned in your work. This may be more of a long-term goal, but it is definitely something worth looking into.</p><p>2. pg. 5, line 127: &quot;so the metabolomic appears…&quot; suggestion → &quot;so the metabolomic approach appears…&quot;.</p><p>3. pg. 6, line 173: &quot;PMI estimation methods is has not…&quot; suggestion → &quot;PMI estimation methods has not…&quot;.</p><p>4. From a methodological point of view, as a first step of data analysis, each single data set (metabolomics, lipidomics, and proteomics) should be investigated singularly, independently of the other two data sets, to discover the information of each single data set related to PMI and better understand the advantage to integrate the three data sets. The analysis should be performed by multivariate and univariate data analysis. Moreover, the common and unique information of the three data sets should be investigated in order to better understand what happens when the data are integrated.</p><p>5. PMI is a continuous factor, not a categorical factor. I suppose that clustering analysis has been performed in the latent space obtained by modelling the data considering all three data sets and that the discovered groups of similar observations have been characterized by PLS-DA. How many clusters have been obtained? What classes have been used in PLS-DA? If this was the approach, the order between PMI values have not been considered in data analysis. PMI was modeled as a categorical factor instead of a continuous factor or, eventually, an ordinal factor. Moreover, it seems that only two main groups of observations have been discovered and that these two groups correspond to pre- and post-burial. This may be the effect of a different time scale between the three -omics. For example, if metabolomics and lipidomics explain low PMI but not high PMI and proteomics explain only high PMI, only two clusters can be observed by data integration. The analysis suggested at point 1 may clarify the situation. Please, comment on these points and add a brief description of DIABLO in Supplementary Information.</p><p>6. Cross-validation must be performed considering explicitly the biological replicates. All replicates of the same subject at the same time must be excluded during each run of cross-validation, i.e. they must belong to the same group. Please repeat cross-validation if this was not the case.</p><p>7. The model should be tested by randomization test to discover over-fitting. Please, discuss this point or implement a suitable permutation test.</p><p>8. There are garbled codes in the R script file provided by the authors, which seem to be line breaks. Please check the encoding of the script.</p><p>9. It is suggested to use a flow chart to describe the general process of the &quot;ForensOMICS&quot; pipeline, instead of only visually displaying the results of different omics analyses, so that readers can intuitively and clearly understand the main content of the study.</p><p>10. Significance analysis could be performed in figure 3 to test the significant variations of the selected variables between different PMI.</p><p>11. There are still some mistakes in the writing, further revisions and corrections are needed.</p><p>12. Consistent with the well-received transparency of the authors' approach pertaining to different aspects of this study, It would also be beneficial to the readership to comment on weaknesses raised by reviewer #3.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Overall, a very sophisticated paper that has been both written and presented well. It is exciting to see what the future holds as the field moves towards more robust scientific applications, such as those presented in this work. It is great to see the transparency in the work as well, understanding that much work is still yet to be done before this approach is operational. However, this does not detract from the significance of the work at all. What I think would be beneficial to include in the current paper, if you choose to accept, is the inclusion of placement periods/seasons of each of the donors. This is common practice for some laboratories, and can sometimes be really useful in informing my next point.</p><p>Do you collect any environmental/covariate data, like daily temperature, relative humidity, rainfall, etc of the taphonomic field site?

Moreover, it seems that only two main groups of observations have been discovered and that these two groups correspond to pre- and post-burial. This may be the effect of a different time scale between the three -omics. For example, if metabolomics and lipidomics explain low PMI but not high PMI and proteomics explain only high PMI, only two clusters can be observed by data integration.

It is exciting to see what the future holds as the field moves towards more robust scientific applications, such as those presented in this work. It is great to see the transparency in the work as well, understanding that much work is still yet to be done before this approach is operational. However, this does not detract from the significance of the work at all. What I think would be beneficial to include in the current paper, if you choose to accept, is the inclusion of placement periods/seasons of each of the donors. This is common practice for some laboratories, and can sometimes be really useful in informing my next point.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for their opinion on the robustness and novelty of our multi-omics work. We agree that this is a useful information and therefore we included it in the main text of the resubmitted manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Do you collect any environmental/covariate data, like daily temperature, relative humidity, rainfall, etc of the taphonomic field site? Going forward, with future studies, this information could be extremely useful to inform any future conclusions. In addition, it could open the door to linear mixed models where you could investigate the impact of random or fixed effects, alongside the outcomes of the omics results. You could also potentially use this approach to investigate interindividual variability, as mentioned in your work. This may be more of a long-term goal, but it is definitely something worth looking into.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer. We have therefore provided environmental conditions gathered during the experiment in the Supplementary File 2. Unfortunately, it was not possible to include the weather parameters in the statistical analysis (eg linear mixed model) as the number of samples is limited, but this will be taken into consideration for our future studies on a larger sample size.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>The authors should address the following main points.</p><p>1. From a methodological point of view, as a first step of data analysis, each single data set (metabolomics, lipidomics, and proteomics) should be investigated singularly, independently of the other two data sets, to discover the information of each single data set related to PMI and better understand the advantage to integrate the three data sets. The analysis should be performed by multivariate and univariate data analysis. Moreover, the common and unique information of the three data sets should be investigated in order to better understand what happens when the data are integrated.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that analysing each block separately could give a better understanding of their contribution to the final model. Univariate statistics was therefore added for each single omics (based on Kruskal-Wallis and Dunn Pairwise analysis with Holm corrected p-value). Multivariate statistic for each block was added by using PLSDA. Limitations of pairwise univariate analysis were highlighted in the text. We have added three plots and a table in supplementary material to discuss the results for all the individual omics. Univariate analysis for the proteomics is largely discussed in a previous publication (10.1021/acs.jproteome.6b01070). However, due to this not being the main purpose of the manuscript, we only briefly presented these results mostly focusing in comparing them with the integrative model.</p><p>Concerning the performance of each single omics block, we found that metabolomics, at least for this PMI range, is probably a better target for future estimations on relatively short PMIs. However, here we mainly aimed to evaluate the potential of combining blocks and we speculate that, on wider PMIs, the combination of more than one omics could be the best approach, granted the validation of the model. New figures can be found in Figure 1 —figure supplements 1-4.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. PMI is a continuous factor, not a categorical factor. I suppose that clustering analysis has been performed in the latent space obtained by modelling the data considering all three data sets and that the discovered groups of similar observations have been characterised by PLS-DA. How many clusters have been obtained? What classes have been used in PLS-DA? If this was the approach, the order between PMI values have not been considered in data analysis. PMI was modelled as a categorical factor instead of a continuous factor or, eventually, an ordinal factor. Moreover, it seems that only two main groups of observations have been discovered and that these two groups correspond to pre- and post-burial. This may be the effect of a different time scale between the three -omics. For example, if metabolomics and lipidomics explain low PMI but not high PMI and proteomics explain only high PMI, only two clusters can be observed by data integration. The analysis suggested at point 1 may clarify the situation. Please, comment on these points and add a brief description of DIABLO in Supplementary Information.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that the approach could not be ideal for the estimation of a continuous phenomenon such as PMI. Unfortunately, the small sample size and the distribution across different PMIs led us to avoid regression approaches that will be the way to go in future studies. We believe, and specified in the text, that the clustering is mostly driven by the two macro groups (fresh vs. decomposed) and therefore this leads to the loss of some information on the decomposition process. However, the rarity of the sample including pre and post decomposition specimens is such that the fresh ones could not be excluded from the analysis. We believe that, adding the single omics results, has been useful to better address this concern. The rendered and explained version of the DIABLO pipeline and script has been uploaded as a separate supplementary source code file 1. A detailed description of DIABLO is available in the cited work (doi: 10.1093/bioinformatics/bty1054) referenced in the main text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3.

The replicates have now been excluded during each run of cross-validation and the results have been corrected accordingly. This can be verified in the script.
