As an evolutionarily conserved organelle, the centriole, also known as the basal body, fulfills many cellular functions. In cycling cells, a pair of centrioles recruits pericentriolar material (PCM). Together they form the centrosome, the primary microtubule organizing center (MTOC) in animal cells. Related to its function as an MTOC, the centrosome is essential for mitotic spindle formation, spindle orientation and faithful mitotic chromosome segregation and for intracellular transport of cargoes. In non-dividing cells, the centriole functions as basal body to template cilium formation. Based on their structure and functions, the cilia can be further classified into primary or motile cilia. The primary cilium functions as a cell ‘antenna’ that senses diverse signals on both sides of cell membrane. Motile cilia are responsible for cellular swimming and fluid flow. Given the array of diverse functions carried out by centrioles and basal bodies, it is not surprising that mutations affecting centrioles and basal bodies cause diverse human diseases, ranging from tumors to different forms of ciliopathies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Nigg and Raff, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Reiter and Leroux, 2017</xref>)</p><p>Centriole biogenesis is tightly controlled. Recent studies have illuminated the mechanisms that regulate centriole assembly. Genetics and cell biological studies in various model organisms show that centriole biogenesis occurs by a cascade of molecular events performed by evolutionarily conserved components, reviewed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Banterle and Gönczy (2017)</xref>. In vertebrate cells, the sequential recruitment of centriole components during assembly is accompanied by a series of morphological changes at the newly emerging centrioles. First, the nine-fold symmetric structure called the cartwheel forms at the proximal side of the mature centriole (mother centriole). This is followed by assembly of MT triplets at the tip of the nine radial spokes in the cartwheel. Together, they form the procentriole, a precursor of the daughter centriole. The procentriole continue to elongate and develop as the new daughter centriole prior to mitosis. During mitosis, the mother and daughter centrioles are ‘disengaged’ but remain loosely linked. In the next cell cycle, the daughter centriole will completely separate from the mother. Meanwhile, it acquires the appendages and the PCM and becomes fully competent as an MTOC. These mark the completion of the centriole duplication cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kong et al., 2014</xref>). Similar to the centriole duplication in metazoans such as in mammals, the centriole duplication process in the unicellular organism <italic>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</italic> is tightly controlled. The process has been described in a series of seminal studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cavalier-Smith, 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Geimer and Melkonian, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">O'Toole and Dutcher, 2014</xref>). Compared to the vertebrates, despite many morphological and ultrastructural differences in the duplication steps, a number of key components in the <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> centriole assembly have been found conserved in other organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dutcher et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dutcher and Trabuco, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hiraki et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Keller et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Matsuura et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Nakazawa et al., 2007</xref>). In addition, proteomics and bioinformatics studies in several model organisms have identified a list of major structural components of centrioles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Andersen et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Keller et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kilburn et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Li et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Müller et al., 2010</xref>). Together, these studies concur that the centriole is assembled by a series of evolutionarily conserved protein building blocks. The process is tightly controlled spatially and temporally by a set of regulatory proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Carvalho-Santos et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hodges et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>Meanwhile, structural approaches, including super-resolution light microscopy, X-ray crystallography and electron cryo-microscopy, have been applied to put the building blocks into the context of the centriole’s 3D structure. Several crystal structures are now available describing components of the centriole, including Plk4, Spd2, Sas6, Cep135, STIL and CPAP. In addition, there have been cryoET studies on assembly of centriole in several organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Greenan et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Guichard et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Guichard et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Li et al., 2012</xref>). In particular, the events of cartwheel assembly has been studied extensively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Guichard et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Guichard et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hilbert et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kitagawa et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">van Breugel et al., 2011</xref>), leading to a molecular mechanism that at least in part establishes the 9-fold symmetry, reviewed in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Guichard et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Despite the structural and functional study of many centriole components in the past years, a complete picture of the centriole architecture and its assembly mechanism is lacking. Using cryoET and subtomogram averaging, we describe the triplet structure of the <italic>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</italic> procentriole. We identify 11 non-tubulin components in the structure that are associated with the triplet tubules in an asymmetric manner. We further present the structure of the A-C linker that laterally bridges neighboring triplets. Finally, using extensive classification and averaging in image processing, we identified two partially assembled triplets at the growing ends to the procentrioles that shed light on the mechanism of triplet and procentriole assembly. Overall, our work presented here builds a framework for understanding the mechanism of centriole biogenesis in molecular details.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Overall architecture of the procentriole</title><p>To study the structure of both the centriole and procentriole, the nuclear-flagellar-apparatus (NFAp) from the unicellular green algae <italic>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</italic> were isolated and visualized by cryoET. The collected tilt series and the reconstructed tomograms show good conservation of the stereotypical structures of NFAp (<xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>). These include the proximal and distal striated fibers that connect two mature centrioles, a set of rootlet microtubules (rMT), in the distal end of centriole there is transition zone where it connects to flagellum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). At the centriole proximal end, a cartwheel structure, including the central hub and the radial spoke, are visible. In many tomograms, two well-preserved procentrioles are attached to their respective mother centrioles via the rMT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>). Here, we focused our study on both the proximal ~100 nm region of mother centrioles and on the attached procentrioles. Using subtomogram averaging, we obtained an averaged structure of MT triplet at 23.0 Å resolution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). In this structure, all MT protofilaments (PF) can be resolved, as well as the 4 nm repeat of tubulin along the PF. This confirms previous observations from the central core region and from centrioles in other organisms that the A-tubule is composed of 13 PFs as an elliptical ring deviated from the canonical MT structure. Both B- and C-tubules are partial rings with 10 PFs. In additional, a number of non-MT structures are readily visible. These include the pinhead, a structure that connects the A-tubule to the cartwheel, and the A-C linker that bridges A-tubule to the C-tubule of its neighboring triplet. To visualize the structure of the entire procentriole, we took reverse steps of subtomogram averaging and put the averaged triplet into the context of entire procentriole tomogram. The result is a model representing a cross section of the procentriole (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). In the model, without imposing symmetry, the pinhead is about 70 nm away from the central hub. The A-C linker is clearly visible and makes multiple connections to both the neighboring A- and C-tubules, although with blurred details compared to the MTs in the triplet, indicating structural heterogeneity and flexibility in this region.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.43434.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Tomographic Reconstruction and Subtomogram Averaging of the MT Triplet in Centriole and Procentriole.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) A slice from the reconstructed tomogram showing a pair of mother centrioles, also known as basal bodies. The central hub as part of the cartwheel is marked by a yellow asterisk.

This results in two triplet averages at 23.0 Å and 30.1 Å resolution respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). Even though the MT backbones are nearly identical, there are notable differences between these two averages. A number of microtubule inner proteins (MIPs) that are attached to the centriole B-tubule, in particular MIPs present in the inner junction of A-B and B-C tubule, are absent in the procentriole triplet. Conversely, some luminal densities in the procentriole are missing in the centriole. These differences may reflect difference in kinetics or transient association of proteins at various stages of assembly, or incompletion of procentriole assembly (see below for further detailed analysis on the B- and C-tubules in the procentrioles).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Non-tubulin components associated with the procentriole triplet</title><p>Unlike many biological complexes for which the individual components might have rigid and well-defined structures, large organelle-scale assemblages are often intrinsically flexible and heterogeneous, creating challenges for their structure study. To improve resolution, we applied a ‘focused refinement’ strategy widely used in single particle cryoEM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Scheres, 2016</xref>), to align the A-, B- and C-tubules of the triplet separately. These resulted in three averaged tubule structures, with improved resolution at 21.4 Å, 22.3 Å and 22.3 Å, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A–C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Based on the improved structures, we built a MT model for each tubule, allowing us to identify a total of 11 MIPs associated with the MT wall (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A–C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplements 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s11">11</xref>). Among them, two components MIP1 and MIP2 share similar binding pattern as the MIPs previously seen in the core region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Li et al., 2012</xref>). MIP1 is a cone-shaped structure projecting from PF A5 into the lumen of the A-tubule and having an 8 nm longitudinal periodicity. Each MIP1 has two legs that recognize the luminal side of α/β tubulin dimer (arrowheads in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). By contrast, MIP2 is more filamentous, forming a trellis-like meshwork, laterally spanning PFs A11 to A13. It follows the pitch of the 3-start helical MT lattice running along the A-tubule luminal wall (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>), presumably to reinforce the ‘ribbon’ structure that is shared by the A- and B-tubules. Besides MIP1 and MIP2, the overall pattern of the MIPs bound within the procentriole is markedly different from the core region. The procentriole MIP binding patterns are shown in detail in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplements 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s11">11</xref> and their characteristics are summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>. Of interest, 7 of the 11 MIPs (MIPs 3 ~ 6, MIPs 9 ~ 11) are localized at or in the vicinity of the inner junctions of the A-B or B-C tubules. Among them, the MIP9 at the inner B-C tubule junction, is of particular interest. Even though it forms a filament exhibiting 4 nm periodicity, the structure deviates from a canonical MT protofilament (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s12">Figure 2—figure supplement 12</xref>). Therefore, we assigned it as a non-tubulin protein MIP9. Together, these inner junctions MIPs crosslink multiple PFs forming intricate networks. They are likely important in strengthening the overall triplet structure.</p><table-wrap id="table1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.43434.040</object-id><label>Table

The overall structure of the cartwheel can be divided into three parts, the central hub, the radial spoke and the pinhead (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hirono, 2014</xref>). The pinhead connects the cartwheel to the MT triplets. Using local classification to focus on the pinhead, we identified 4763 subtomograms having relatively intact pinhead structures, resulting in an averaged pinhead structure at 23.1 Å resolution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s13">Figure 2—figure supplement 13</xref>). It is a hook-shaped structure anchored to PF A3 of the A-tubule. Consistent with a previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Guichard et al., 2013</xref>), the pinhead can be partitioned into three parts, namely pinbody (PinB), pinfoot 1 (PinF1) and pinfoot 2 (PinF2) where both pinfeet attach to the MT wall. Each PinF1/PinF2 unit forms a ring structure bound to α/β tubulin dimer on PF A3, therefore, the entire pinhead repeats every 8 nm. This is in agreement with a recent triplet structure from the proximal region of mammalian centriole (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Greenan et al., 2018</xref>). The PinB turns 90 degree from the pinfeet, forming an inverted L-shaped structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). There is a longitudinal gap between neighboring PinB every 8 nm without connection. The distal tip of PinB is flexible exhibiting less well-defined structure in the average (arrowheads in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s14">Figure 2—figure supplement 14</xref>). Interestingly, among the 13 PFs that form the elliptical-shaped A-tubule, the PFs A2 and A3 display the highest curvature of the MT wall with a large lateral gap between these two PFs where the MIP4 laterally crosslinks. The high local curvature and the gap may create a unique site for anchoring the pinhead to the A-tubule.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Structure of the A-C linker that connects neighboring triplets</title><p>Procentriole is a cylindrical structure composed of 9 MT triplet blades. Each triplet is laterally connected to its neighboring triplets by a structure called the A-C linker. In the averaged triplet structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), the A-C linker is weaker than the MT triplet, indicating either compositional and/or conformational heterogeneity. By extensive subtomogram classification and alignment using the A-tubule as a reference (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref> and detailed in Materials and Methods), we obtained four classes whose averaged structures showing a more complete and detailed structure of the A-C linker most closely associated with the A-tubule (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplements 2</xref>,<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">3</xref>). Similarly, in a ‘reciprocal classification’ by using the C-tubule as the reference point, we identified 6 classes of subtomograms whose averaged structure shows enhanced detail for the portion of the A-C linker associated with the C-tubule (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplements 3</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s5">5</xref>). The differences in the classes largely reflect the underlying flexibility of the A-C linker about its midpoint. We combined the above two averages by docking them into a lower resolution class-averages, resulting in a structure of the complete A-C linker for each identified class (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s6">Figure 3—figure supplement 6</xref>).</p><p>Overall, the A-C linker forms a crisscross-shaped structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video2">Video 2</xref>) that can be divided into five parts: a central trunk region, from which two arms (Arm A, B) and two legs (Leg A, B), extend out to the C- and A-tubules, respectively. Arm A forms a longitudinal helical filament with 8 nm periodicity and binds to PF C8 of the C-tubule (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). The Arm B inserts into the trough between PFs C9 and C10 of the C-tubule, likely binding to both PFs. Leg A and B fork out from the central trunk towards the A-tubule. The Leg A has a thin rod shape that tilts ~30° towards the proximal end of procentriole and extends about 10 nm to reach and contact PF A6 of A-tubule (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). Leg B tilts ~30° towards the distal end of procentriole. It spans about 22 nm to connect to both PFs A9 and A10 of the A-tubule. It continues to reach as far as to the outer junction of A- and B-tubules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A,B</xref>). Lastly, the central trunk can be further divided into three longitudinal filaments bundled into a spiral: f1, f2, f3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A,C</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.43434.021</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>The Structure of A-C Linker.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) A top view of the A-C linker structure with its linked A- and C-tubules. The A-C linker is highlighted in red.

The averaged diameter of the ring is ~4 nm and they stack longitudinally with 8 nm periodicity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A,B</xref>). Previous studies found the conserved centriole components, POC1, to localize to the centriole proximal ends (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Keller et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Pearson et al., 2009b</xref>). Knockdown or deletion of POC1 in several organisms resulted in defective centrioles or basal bodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Khire et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Pearson et al., 2009a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Venoux et al., 2013</xref>). Human mutations of either paralog, POC1A or POC1B, cause ciliopathy-like pathologies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Beck et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Roosing et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sarig et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Shaheen et al., 2012</xref>). In <italic>Tetrahymena</italic>, POC1 is important for maintaining A-C linker integrity. <italic>poc1</italic> null mutants display basal body defects ranging from missing or disintegrated triplets to disconnected neighboring triplets and aberrant A-C linkers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Meehl et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Pearson et al., 2009a</xref>). Interestingly, one of predicted conserved signatures of POC1 is multiple WD40 repeats at its N-terminus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Woodland and Fry, 2008</xref>), for example, in <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic>, POC1 is predicted to have seven tandem WD40 repeats at its N-terminus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Keller et al., 2009</xref>). A crystal structure of a 7-repeat WD40 β-propeller domain fits remarkably well into the ring density observed on the Leg B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D,E</xref>). Due to relatively modest resolution of our average map, the precise orientation of the WD40 domain could not be defined. Nevertheless, in the docked model, the WD40 β-propeller makes multiple contacts with the rest of Leg B, consistent with the function of WD40 domain as one of the most abundant protein-protein interaction domains that scaffolds multi-protein complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Stirnimann et al., 2010</xref>). Notably, human ciliopathy mutations in POC1A or POC1B map to the WD40 repeats. Thus, combined with these data, our structure suggests that POC1 is likely an integral component of the procentriole A-C linker that bridges neighboring triplets. Its N-terminal WD40 β-propeller domain provides multiple sites for interacting with other A-C linker components. However, in addition to procentriole, POC1 has also been found at other locations in mother centriole and in flagellum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Keller et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Pearson et al., 2009b</xref>).

To identify any assembly intermediates and to study the assembly process, we set out to analyze the triplets from these procentrioles. Among 110 tomograms collected, the length of the procentriole triplet varied substantially, with the A-tubule always being the longest tubule, followed by the B- then the C-tubules. Most of the procentriole MTs are straight with a slightly flared end at the MT tip (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>), consistent with the morphology of slow growing MT and elongating triplets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Guichard et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Höög et al., 2011</xref>). The B- and C-tubules are attached to the middle of A- or B-tubules at different heights, respectively, suggesting that the B- and C-tubules initiate assembly by using the A- and B-tubule wall as a template rather than a minus-end template such as the γ-tubulin ring complex. Once initiated, the B- and C-tubules then extend longitudinally towards both the MT minus and the plus ends. Histograms of the measured tubule length in 110 procentrioles show wide distributions for all three tubules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>), demonstrated by the large standard deviations.

Based on 2083 subtomogram volumes from 110 procentrioles, we obtained eight classes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). Surprisingly, one of the classes, composed of 157 subtomograms, shows partially assembled B-tubules. The average of this class shows three PFs B1, B2 and B3 at outer A-B junction having more prominent density than the other PFs in the B-tubule. We mapped these 157 subtomograms to find their location in the procentriole. Based on their longitudinal positions, we divided them into five classes. These are 1) at the proximal end of the triplet (28.7%), 2) at the distal end (25.5%), 3) a nascent B-tubule where the entire B-tubule is partially assembled (33.8%), 4) extremely short and noisy B-tubule less than 10 nm long (7.0%), 5) partial B-tubule structure found in the midst of complete tubule (5.1%), likely these are defective structures or errors in classification. The first three classes comprise 88% of the 157 subtomograms, and the averages are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>. Interestingly, all three averages show an incomplete B-tubules with strong densities for PFs B1 ~B3. As a check, we directly visualized the identified partial doublets in their procentriole tomograms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>), confirming that they are indeed partially assembled doublets at the longitudinal extremity of the triplet. In summary, based on the classification and the mapping analysis, we identified an intermediate in the B-tubule assembly at both the polar ends of triplet. It shows the B-tubule initiates lateral expansion from PF B1 at the outer A-B junction towards the luminal side.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Intermediate state of the C-tubule during triplet assembly</title><p>We applied a similar analysis to the C-tubule and after two rounds of classification, we identified 208 subtomograms from 110 procentrioles that have partially complete C-tubules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). In contrast to the incomplete doublet, the average of these 208 subtomograms shows PFs at both the inner and the outer B-C junctions with a gap in between. We further mapped these incomplete triplets in their corresponding tomograms. Similar to the B-tubule result, based on the location these triplets can be divided into five classes. Three major classes, including the proximal end, the distal end and the nascent C-tubule where the entire length of the triplet has partially assembled C-tubule, comprise 83% of the 208 subtomograms. Averages from these three major classes shows a consensus structure of incomplete triplet (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>), where the PFs C8 ~C10 along with the MIP9 at the inner B-C junction are clearly visible while the PFs C1 ~C3 are visible at the outer junction. Interestingly, in all three averages, even though the C-tubule is incomplete, the A-C linker is visible albeit with weaker density likely due to its flexible nature or incomplete assembly. This indicates that the linkage between neighboring triplets has been established at this early stage of the triplet assembly. We further confirmed these averages by directly visualizing corresponding structure in the procentriole tomograms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). Taken together, our analysis has identified C-tubule assembly intermediates at either end of the triplet longitudinal extremity, suggesting that the C-tubule assembles laterally from both the inner and the outer junction in a bi-directional fashion. This allows prompt establishing of the A-C linker during the triplet assembly, reinforcing the procentriole as a barrel-shaped structure.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.43434.036</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Detecting the C-tubule Intermediate.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The averages of subset of subtomogram with incomplete triplet at proximal, distal end and from nascent triplet. The images are z-projection of the average where the triplet length is 9.6 nm.

Most were focused on the morphology of these organelles in the context of their life cycles. In recent years, cryoET has been applied to study molecular architecture of centriole and basal body in several organisms, including <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic>, <italic>Drosophila</italic>, <italic>Trichonympha</italic> and mammalian cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Greenan et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Guichard et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Li et al., 2012</xref>). These have provided insights into mechanism of triplet/doublet assembly and centriole biogenesis.</p><p>In <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic>, there are marked differences between the procentriole triplet structure reported here and that in the core region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Li et al., 2012</xref>). First, a Y-shaped structure observed in the luminal side of core region is absent in procentriole, instead, the space is taken in part by the pinhead structure. Second, the A-C linker structures in these two regions are different. Whereas the procentriole has a crisscross shaped A-C linker structure that links PFs A6, A9/A10 and C8, C9/C10 from its neighboring triplets, in the core region, the A-C linker bridges PF A6 to various positions on neighboring C-tubule depending on the longitudinal position (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Li et al., 2012</xref>). Third, the PF C1 in the procentriole is composed of tubulin having a 4 nm periodicity, while the C1 in distal half of the core region exhibits an 8 nm repeat, indicating a non-tubulin protein. Lastly, even though a number of MIPs are shared in both regions, for example a cone-shaped structure MIP1 at PF A5 and a number of MIPs spanning the luminal side of PFs A1-A3, the overall patterns of MIPs decorated on the triplet are different in these two regions. This is particularly noticeable in the inner junctions of A-B and B-C tubules. All these differences suggest that two sets of proteins are enlisted sequentially during the centriole assembly, controlled by as yet unknown mode of spatial and temporal regulation. For example, both pinhead and the Y-shaped structure are near the inner junction of A-B tubules. As part of the cartwheel structure, the pinhead function as a scaffold for initial establishment of nine triplets in the procentriole. Once the procentriole is fully assembled, the Y-shaped structure will follow to further strengthen the central core region. Structural difference between these two regions has also been observed recently in mammalian centriole (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Greenan et al., 2018</xref>), but with details that are distinct from those with <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic>. However, this does suggest that a multiple-step hierarchical spatial and temporal control is likely a common theme of centriole assembly in many eukaryotes.</p><p>The procentriole triplet structure presented in this work also exhibits several notable differences from the triplets from other organisms. For example, in <italic>Trichonympha</italic>, the pinhead exhibits 17 nm periodicity, while in <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic>, it is 8 nm. Interestingly, in both organisms the A-C linker has 8.5 nm or 8 nm periodicity, respectively. This structural difference might reflect the difference in mechanism of length control as the procentriole in <italic>Trichonympha</italic> has an exceptionally long cartwheel.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>The roles of A-C linker in the procentriole assembly</title><p>In addition to serving as a structural linkage between neighboring triplets, our structure has revealed several important roles for the A-C linker during procentriole assembly.</p><p>In a <italic>Sas6</italic> null mutation in <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic>, a circular centriole can still form without the cartwheel, albeit at low efficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Nakazawa et al., 2007</xref>). Among these cartwheel-less centrioles, the majority remains nine-fold symmetric, but other symmetries have been observed as well, suggesting that, at least in some organism, the cartwheel does not fully account for setting up the nine-fold symmetry in the centriole. Interestingly, in vitro assembly of CrSas6 results in cartwheel-like structures with the majority having eight and nine-fold symmetry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Guichard et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hilbert et al., 2016</xref>). Likewise, mammalian cells can form centrioles de novo without the central hub formed by Sas6, although the assembly is less efficient and more error-prone than the wild type (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Wang et al., 2015</xref>). These observations have led to speculation that other factor(s) might be needed for efficient and robust centriole assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gönczy, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hirono, 2014</xref>). Our finding that the A-C tubule linkage is established at an early stage of procentriole assembly while the triplets are still elongating provides direct evidence supporting a model that the A-C linker helps establish the 9-fold symmetry. In our model, A-C linker can accomplish this simply by restricting the angle between neighboring MT triplets to be approximately 140 degree as needed for forming a nonagon. Thus in wild type cells, the combination of both Sas6 oligomerization and a stabilizing linkage between neighboring triplets that has a defined angle will provide a robust mechanism for establishing the nine-fold symmetry. In addition to restricting the angle between neighboring triplets, the A-C linker also plays a structural role that connects nascent incomplete triplets therefore bolstering the nascent procentriole structure during its assembly.</p><p>Instead of being a static structure, the A-C linker displays substantial twist motion along the triplet wall. This can accommodate an apparent left-handed iris diaphragm movement that progresses along the longitudinal direction. The twist observed both in the procentriole and in the core region results in change of angle for each triplet relative to the cylindrical circumference, from the most acute angle at the very proximal side towards more tangential in the distal region. As a result, the inner diameter of the centriole gradually increases. This change may facilitate multiple processes: First, the acute angle of the triplet at the proximal end places the A-tubule including the pinhead close to the cartwheel, likely reflecting its attachment as the earliest stages of biogenesis. Second, the gradual twisting will increase the exposed surface area, facilitating recruitment of other centriole components, such as the subdistal and the distal appendages. Third, the tangential angle of the triplet at the distal end of basal body must match the angle of the axoneme doublets, where the basal body is ready to serve as a template for the flagellum assembly. Lastly, this iris diaphragm motion of the MT triplet might also have impact on controlling the procentriole length by twisting the pinheads away from the hub while the luminal diameter becomes wider. This suggests that the radial spokes will be under strain of pulling force that continually increases along the procentriole. This pinhead movement can be directly visualized in <xref ref-type="video" rid="video5">Video 5</xref>. As part of the radial spoke, the C-terminus of Sas6 and Cep135/Bld10 are predicted to have highly coiled-coil structures with intrinsically elastic properties. It is appealing to envision that this strain and elasticity will reach to a balance point once the MT triplets elongate to certain length, suggesting an intrinsic length control mechanism due to the iris diaphragm motion of the triplet.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>A model for the procentriole triplet assembly</title><p>Previous EM studies on mammalian centriole and basal body showed the triplet assembly was a non-uniform process where the A-tubule assembled first, followed by sequential B- and C-tubule assembly. During the tubule elongation, their lengths varied substantially (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Anderson and Brenner, 1971</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Guichard et al., 2010</xref>). Furthermore, by analyzing the nascent procentrioles, Anderson and Brenner observed the B- and C-tubule first emerged as sheets laterally attached to the A- and B-tubule respectively. Consistent with these findings, by analyzing a population of procentrioles, we found the average length of three tubules in the triplet varies substantially. In addition, we have identified two triplet intermediates, showing that the B-tubule initiates assembly uni-directionally from the outer A-B junction. By contrast, the C-tubule assembles laterally in a bi-directional fashion, from both the inner and the outer B-C junctions. These lateral expansions are concomitant with the longitudinal elongation of the triplets at their extremities. Based on the analysis, we propose a possible model for the triplet assembly during the procentriole biogenesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). In our model, the A-tubule first emerges and anchors to the pinhead of cartwheel. It continues to grow. Then the B-tubule initially assembles at the outer A-B junction by making an unusual tubulin-tubulin lateral interface and branching out at the PF A10. This branch laterally expands from the outer junction to reach the luminal inner junction where the PF B10 and other components including the MIPs 5 ~ 6 seal and complete the B-tubule. Unlike the B-tubule, the C-tubule initiates assembly on both junctions. PFs C1 and C10 branch out from the B-tubule at the outer and the inner junctions, respectively. These two branches expand laterally in a bi-directional fashion. At this point, while the C-tubule is still incomplete, the newly assembled PFs C8 ~C10 are readily available to provide a site for the A-C linker that connects the C-tubule to the A-tubule of its (N-1) neighbor triplet. Equivalently, its A-tubule will connect to the C-tubule of its (N + 1) neighbor triplet. As a result, all nine triplets form an inter-connected barrel even though some triplets are still incomplete. In the last step, the gap is filled by the PFs in the C-tubule. This completes the assembly of all three tubules at this longitudinal point, while the lateral expansion and the longitudinal elongation will continue in both extremities of the triplet.</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.43434.038</object-id><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>A Model for the MT Triplet Assembly in Procentriole.</title><p>In the model, the triplet assembly can be divided into five sequential steps: 1) A-tubule emerges and anchors to the pinhead in the cartwheel.

Although we cannot exclude the possibility that there is a fraction of partial B- or C-tubules that is due to their lability during the purification process, based on the observed tubule length variation, the morphology of the MT ends, the stability of centriole MT compared to the canonical MT and the consistent pattern of the partial B- and C-tubule observed at the growing ends (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5C–D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6A–B</xref>), the identified intermediate structures likely represent two snapshots of an underpinning mechanism for the MT triplet assembly, which is tightly controlled by a set of factors. These include structural components such as MIPs identified in this work or other microtubule associated proteins (MAPs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Sharma et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Zheng et al., 2016</xref>). In addition, other regulatory components such as, acetyltransferase or glutamylase will alter the polymerization properties and stability of the MT triplet as well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Yu et al., 2015</xref>). Interestingly, many MIPs identified in this work and in mammalian centrioles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Greenan et al., 2018</xref>) are localized at the junction of A-B or B-C tubules in the triplet. For example, MIPs 5 ~ 6 are found at the inner A-B junction, while MIPs 9 ~ 11 are at the inner B-C tubules junction. This asymmetric localization of the MIPs will likely modulate the assembly kinetics of the MT PFs. Furthermore, since the association of MIPs to triplet might be concomitant with the MT elongation, the MIPs’ own assembly kinetics on MT will in turn have directly impact on the assembly of the triplet. In the future, with enhanced dataset size and improved algorithm, it is likely that more assembly intermediates will be identified in <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> and in other organisms. This will provide insight into the centriole assembly mechanism with improved spatial and temporal resolution. Our study presented here has paved the way in this direction.</p><p>Finally, like many large and functional biological assemblages, the procentriole structure presented in this work is an example demonstrating the extensive diversity and heterogeneity of a biological system in situ, including composition heterogeneity such as the incomplete B- and C-tubules in triplet and conformation heterogeneity such as the continuous twisting of the A-C linker. CryoET is well poised as a unique and unparalleled tool to reveal this phenomenon and to provide high-resolution insights for many biological mechanisms waiting to be explored.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Sample preparation</title><p>Nucleo-flagellar apparatus (NFAp) from <italic>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</italic> was purified based on previous published method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Wright et al., 1985</xref>).

They were first annotated to find the proximal end of MT triplet. Based on these, the longitudinal spans of the MT triplet were defined. The subtomograms that contained segment of MT triplet were boxed out. Initially the triplet segment length was set to 38 nm with pixel size in 2xbinned format. This was followed by <italic>ab initio</italic> alignment without a reference. The alignment of subtomograms was carried out by the programs MLTOMO implemented in the software package Xmipp (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Scheres et al., 2009</xref>). After generating the initial reference, the subtomograms were re-extracted from the tomogram volumes in unbinned format. The MT triplet length in each subtomogram was gradually decreased. The final triplet length in the averaged structures for triplet, A-, B- and C-tubules was 29 nm, containing more than three repeats as the largest periodicity detected in the procentriole triplet is 8 nm. Since MT triplet is a continuous filament, the neighboring subtomograms should have similar geometric parameters. We have developed a program called RANSAC to impose constraint on the neighboring subtomograms from the same triplet. It was used to detect any alignment outliers and to impose constraint to correct misaligned subtomograms by regression. The program is available upon request. The program MLTOMO was also used in the classification of various structures such as the pinhead, the A-C linker, the A-tubule, B-tubule and C-tubule to detect heterogeneity.

The results are more homogeneous datasets for each tubule that combine procentriole and the proximal region of the mother centriole.

There are several factors that can potentially affect the periodicity in the average. These are, 1) the length of the triplet in subtomogram, 2) the percentage of overlap between neighboring triplet segments, 3) the structural component included in the soft-edge mask that is used in subtomogram alignment, 4) a reference is provided or not during the initial alignment, 5) the structure difference between the triplet in the procentriole and the triplet from the proximal region of the mother centriole. All these factors can potentially introduce errors in the subtomogram alignment. We took these factors into account and did extensive tests. All results consistently show 8 nm periodicity in the pinhead structure. In the final map of the pinhead, the longitudinal length is 19 nm, including more than two repeats of the pinhead.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgement</title><p>We thank Michael Braunfeld and Shawn Zheng for advice on tomography data collection, Matt Harrington for supporting the computational infrastructure, Hiroaki Ishikawa for discussion on the biology of <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic>, centrioles and basal bodies, Tom Goddart for help with UCSF Chimera program.

Your article has been reviewed by Anna Akhmanova as the Senior Editor, Sriram Subramaniam as the Reviewing Editor and three reviewers. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal his identity: Masahide Kikkawa (Reviewer #1).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>All three reviewers agreed that this manuscript provides important new information on the structure of the procentriole microtubule and assembly intermediates using cryo-electron tomography. The use of subtomogram classification and averaging to reveal conformational changes within the <italic>C. reinhardtii</italic> centrioles was also seen as a valuable contribution. However, all reviewers had several significant concerns that need to be addressed in order for the manuscript to be acceptable for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) One major issue is POC1. In subsection “The Twist of A-C linker Results in Iris Diaphragm Motion of the Procentriole” and Figure 3, the authors state that POC1 is an integral component of the A-C linker. The reviewers believe this is an overinterpretation. To claim that &quot;combined with the prevailing data, our structure provides evidence that Poc1 is an integral component of the procentriole A-C linker that bridges neighboring triplets.&quot; (Subsection “The Twist of A-C linker Results in Iris Diaphragm Motion of the Procentriole”), the authors would have to identify the 3D position of POC1 by analyzing POC1 mutant or structural labeling of POC1 using cryo-electron tomography. Alternatively, the author could weaken the statement.</p><p>POC1 localization to the leg B of the A-C linker is inferred based on previous work and its predicted 3D structure. Yet, POC1 has not been definitively identified as a component of linker. Further, POC1 does not appear to be localized only to the proximal ends of the basal bodies in <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic>, as stated. Keller at al. (2009) showed that POC1 also localizes to both inner and outer centriole walls and is present on the entire length of the centriole. Until there is direct evidence for the localization of POC1 to the linker, the conclusion needs to be treated as hypothetical, especially in the Abstract. The Abstract thus should be revised. Furthermore, the reviewers recommend that the authors review the procentriole proteome and itemize possible β-propeller candidates as a supplementary table.</p><p>2) Figure 1C represents the subtomogram average of MT triplets from mother centriole proximal ends and procentrioles. The reviewers would like to see explicit clarification for combining these tomograms, especially given the fact that Figure 1—figure supplement 2 demonstrates structural differences between the proximal end of the mother centriole and procentriole.</p><p>3) One reviewer asks whether the density identified between C10 and B8 protofilaments (MIP9 in the B-C inner junction) could correspond to the eleventh protofilament, taking into account the data in Figure 1D, the density maps in Figure 2—figure supplement 9, and especially the procentriole model in Figure 1C. Is there evidence to rule out the possibility that MIP9 represents a protofilament with some additional associated material? In Figure 1C this density appears indistinguishable from other protofilament densities and it has similar periodicity as tubulin in the density map in Figure 2—figure supplement 9. If the possibility cannot be ruled out, it should be discussed.</p><p>4) The authors propose that the A-C linker in procentrioles during C-tubule assembly is &quot;visible albeit with weaker density due to its flexible nature&quot;. How do they argue against the possibility that it is not visible because it still does not contain all components at this point in procentriole assembly?</p><p>5) The authors state that they &quot;identified two triplet intermediates&quot; and &quot;proposed the model for procentriole triplet assembly&quot;. However, Anderson and Brenner (1971) and Guichard et al. (2010) already proposed the model for lateral tubulin addition to the microtubules. Anderson even provides some evidence for partially assembles microtubules. MT intermediates are here better documented, but the original work must be credited.</p><p>6) Figure 1B does not show two well preserved procentrioles attached to the mother centriole as stated in Results. It is not evident form Figure 1B that the procentriole is attached to the mother centriole. Further what 'attached' means in structural terms is unclear. Procentrioles in Video 1 are adjacent but clearly not attached (See O'Toole and Dutcher work describing basal body duplication cycle and organization).</p><p>7) The Introduction describes the centriole cycle as it appears in vertebrate cells. However, the authors do not offer any introduction about basal body duplication in <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic>. That is indeed perplexing given significant differences in the duplication process and timing between the two organisms. Very limited description of <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> basal body complexes can be found in 'Overall architecture of the procentriole' but there is no reference to address readers to ample published work describing ultrastructural features of <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> basal body complexes. A scheme or a classical TEM illustration of an intact basal body complex would be helpful as well.</p><p>8) One reviewer notes that there is poor citation of prior work on procentriole structure, procentriole formation, and MT linkers, please address this.</p><p>9) Two reviewers seek explicit discussion of why exactly the authors think that MIP9 is not a tubulin protofilament.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.43434.060</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) One major issue is POC1.

More experiments and analysis are needed for conclusive localization of the POC1.

Its N-terminal WD40 β-propeller domain provides multiple sites for interacting with other A-C linker components. However, in addition to procentriole, Poc1 has also been found at other locations in mother centriole and in flagellum (Keller et al., 2009; Pearson et al., 2009). A precise localization of POC1 gene product on the centriole has to wait for future higher resolution structure by cryoET and other studies.”</p><p>3) In the figure legend for Figure 3 (D and E), now we have changed to “Close up views of the Leg B in the A-C linker show a <italic>possible</italic> location of Poc1.”</p><p>Previous study on the <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> basal body proteome has identified at least three major centriole/cilia components that contain predicted WD-40 repeats. These are POC1, POC16 and BUG14 (also known as FAP52) (Keller et al., 2009). Recent studies in <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> have shown that POC16 is likely localized in the central core region of the centriole (Hamel et al., 2017), while FAP52 is a flagellar axoneme component localized to the lumen of the B-tubule (Owa et al., We also agree with reviewer that a thorough re-analysis on the entire centriole proteome and itemizing possible β-propeller or perhaps other motifs/domains candidates will be useful to localize components in the 3D structure, however it will be beyond the scope of this study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Figure 1C represents the subtomogram average of MT triplets from mother centriole proximal ends and procentrioles.

These are from two fractions of the data, the proximal ends of mother centriole (10854 subtomograms from 201 mother centrioles) and procentriole (2083 subtomograms from 110 procentrioles). In order to find possible structure difference between them, we averaged these two fractions separately (Figure 1—figure supplement 2). Comparison of these two averages reveals notable differences that are mainly localized on the B- and C-tubules, as indicated in Figure 1—figure supplement 2. As we have stated in the manuscript (subsection “Overall Architecture of the Procentriole”), we believe these differences are likely due to either transient association of proteins or the defective or incomplete structures, these include the intermediate structures of the B- and C-tubule that we identified and reported in the manuscript.</p><p>We’ve realized that our original statement may cause confusion. Now in subsection “Overall Architecture of the Procentriole” we have revised our statement as: “These differences may reflect difference in kinetics or transient association of proteins at various stages of assembly, or incompletion of procentriole assembly (see below for further detailed analysis on the B- and C-tubules in the procentrioles).”</p><p>In addition, as mentioned in the manuscript, we have carried out extensive focused classification on 2083 subtomograms on the A, B and C tubules from 110 procentrioles. This allowed us to identify 420, 758 and 862 defective or incomplete structure in each tubule respectively. These defective/incomplete subtomograms were excluded from further focused alignment on each tubule, resulting in more homogeneous datasets. Compared to the average of the entire triplet, the improvements are evident in the increased resolutions shown in Figure 1—figure supplement 1 and in Table 1. These averaged tubule structures were used for further segmentation and estimation of the molecular weight of MIPs associated to the tubule.</p><p>Now we have added this detailed description on the Material and methods section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) One reviewer asks whether the density identified between C10 and B8 protofilaments (MIP9 in the B-C inner junction) could correspond to the eleventh protofilament, taking into account the data in Figure 1D, the density maps in Figure 2—figure supplement 9, and especially the procentriole model in Figure 1C. Is there evidence to rule out the possibility that MIP9 represents a protofilament with some additional associated material? In Figure 1C this density appears indistinguishable from other protofilament densities and it has similar periodicity as tubulin in the density map in Figure 2—figure supplement 9. If the possibility cannot be ruled out, it should be discussed.</p></disp-quote><p>Though the filament formed by MIP9 resembles a MT protofilament (pf) from the top view (Figure 1C, Figure 2C and Figure 2—figure supplement 9) and it exhibits 4 nm longitudinal periodicity, when docking a model of MT protofilament into the MIP9 density, it shows substantial deviation from a canonical MT protofilament. Therefore, we concluded this likely is not a canonical MT protofilament and we assigned it as MIP9 that crosslinks C10 to B8 and B9 at the inner junction of B- and C-tubules.</p><p>To make this clear, now we have added an additional supplementary figure as Figure 2—figure supplement 12, showing modeling a MT protofilament into the MIP9 filament density and the structure deviation from a MT protofilament is clear.</p><p>In addition, we add a statement in subsection “Non-tubulin Components Associated with the Procentriole Triplet” in the main text –</p><p>“Among them, the MIP9 at the inner B-C tubule junction, is of particular interest. Even though it forms a filament exhibiting 4 nm periodicity, the structure deviates from a canonical MT protofilament (Figure 2—figure supplement 12). Therefore, we assigned it as a non-tubulin protein MIP9.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The authors propose that the A-C linker in procentrioles during C-tubule assembly is &quot;visible albeit with weaker density due to its flexible nature&quot;. How do they argue against the possibility that it is not visible because it still does not contain all components at this point in procentriole assembly?</p><p>We agree with the reviewer that it is possible that the A-C linker assembly might be incomplete at this point. Now we have modified our statement as “Interestingly, in all three averages, even though the C-tubule is incomplete, the A-C linker is visible albeit with weaker density likely due to its flexible nature or incomplete assembly.”</p><p>5) The authors state that they &quot;identified two triplet intermediates&quot; and &quot;proposed the model for procentriole triplet assembly&quot;. However, Anderson and Brenner (1971) and Guichard et al. (2010) already proposed the model for lateral tubulin addition to the microtubules. Anderson even provides some evidence for partially assembles microtubules. MT intermediates are here better documented, but the original work must be credited.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for pointing out this important reference. Now we have cited Anderson and Brenner’s work, along with Guichard et al. findings. In the Discussion section, we now state –</p><p>“Previous EM studies on mammalian centriole and basal body showed the triplet assembly was a non-uniform process where in each triplet the A-tubule assembled first, followed by sequential B- and C-tubule assembly. During the tubule elongation, their lengths varied substantially (Anderson and Brenner, 1971; Guichard et al., 2010). Furthermore, by analyzing the nascent procentrioles, Anderson and Brenner observed the B- and C-tubule first emerged as sheets laterally attached to the A- and B-tubule respectively. Consistent with these findings, by analyzing a population of procentrioles, we found the average length of three tubules in the triplet varies substantially. In addition, we have identified two triplet intermediates, showing that the B-tubule initiates assembly uni-directionally from the outer A-B junction.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Figure 1B does not show two well preserved procentrioles attached to the mother centriole as stated in Results. It is not evident form Figure 1B that the procentriole is attached to the mother centriole. Further what 'attached' means in structural terms is unclear. Procentrioles in Video 1 are adjacent but clearly not attached (See O'Toole and Dutcher work describing basal body duplication cycle and organization).</p></disp-quote><p>Unlike the centriole in vertebrates where the procentriole is directly linked to the mother centriole, in <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> the attachment of procentriole to the mother centriole is via a set of rootlet microtubules (rMT). This has been well documented and has been observed throughout our reconstructions of the nuclear-flagellar-apparatus (NFAp).</p><p>To make this clear, we have put a label of rootlet MT (rMT) in Figure 1B, indicating the likely attachment point of the procentriole and modified the main text (subsection “Overall Architecture of the Procentriole”) as “…. two well-preserved procentrioles are attached to their respective mother centrioles via the rMT (Figure 1B, Video 1).”</p><p>In addition, we have also modified the figure legend related to Figure 1B as “A slice from the reconstructed tomogram of procentriole attached to the mother centriole via the rMT.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) The Introduction describes the centriole cycle as it appears in vertebrate cells. However, the authors do not offer any introduction about basal body duplication in Chlamydomonas. That is indeed perplexing given significant differences in the duplication process and timing between the two organisms. Very limited description of Chlamydomonas basal body complexes can be found in 'Overall architecture of the procentriole' but there is no reference to address readers to ample published work describing ultrastructural features of Chlamydomonas basal body complexes. A scheme or a classical TEM illustration of an intact basal body complex would be helpful as well.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank reviewer for pointing this out. Indeed, there are significant differences in term of morphology, ultrastructure and timing of the centriole duplication between <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> and the vertebrate cells. As the reviewer said, there exist a large amount of previously published studies documenting the centriole duplication and cell cycle in <italic>Chlamydomonas.</italic> Now we have adapted reviewer’s comment and introduce this point in the Introduction as well as cited several additional references. We now state –</p><p>“…Similar to the centriole duplication in metazoans such as in mammals, the centriole duplication process in the unicellular organism <italic>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</italic> is tightly controlled. The process has been described in a series of seminal studies (Cavalier-Smith, 1974; Geimer and Melkonian, 2004; O'Toole and Dutcher, 2014). Compared to the vertebrates, despite many morphological and ultrastructural differences in the duplication steps, a number of key components in the <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> centriole assembly have been found conserved in other higher eukaryotes (Dutcher et al., 2002; Dutcher and Trabuco, 1998; Hiraki et al., 2007; Keller et al., 2009; Matsuura et al., 2004; Nakazawa et al., 2007).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) One reviewer notes that there is poor citation of prior work on procentriole structure, procentriole formation, and MT linkers, please address this.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now cited more previous works on the procentriole structure, assembly and A-C linker.
