In many organisms from insects to humans, germ cells divide with incomplete cytokinesis that results in interconnected cells with shared cytoplasm, leading to cyst formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Greenbaum et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Haglund et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Pepling et al., 1999</xref>). During oogenesis of many species from flies to mammals, this intercellular connectivity is critical for the process of oocyte specification, allowing only some of the developing germ cells to become oocytes while the others adopt a supportive role (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">de Cuevas et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lei and Spradling, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Pepling et al., 1999</xref>). For example, in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> ovary, four rounds of germ cell divisions with incomplete cytokinesis results in a cyst of 16 interconnected germ cells, where only one becomes an oocyte while the remaining 15 germ cells become nurse cells. During this process, nurse cells support oocyte development by providing their cytoplasmic contents to oocytes via intercellular trafficking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cox and Spradling, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">de Cuevas et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Huynh and St Johnston, 2004</xref>).</p><p>In contrast to oogenesis, where cytoplasmic connectivity has a clear developmental role in oocyte development, spermatogenesis is a process where all germ cells within a cyst are considered to be equivalent and become mature gametes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fuller, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Yoshida, 2016</xref>). Despite the lack of a ‘nursing mechanism’ during spermatogenesis, intercellular connectivity is widely observed in spermatogenesis in a broad range of organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Greenbaum et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Yoshida, 2016</xref>). While a function for this connectivity has been proposed in post-meiotic spermatids in complementing haploid genomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Braun et al., 1989</xref>), the biological significance of male germ cell connectivity during pre-meiotic stages of spermatogenesis remains unknown.</p><p>Another well-known characteristic of the germline is its extreme sensitivity to DNA damage compared to the soma, with clinical interventions such as radiation or chemotherapy often resulting in impaired fertility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Arnon et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Meistrich, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Oakberg, 1955</xref>). Although high DNA damage sensitivity in mammalian female may be explained by its extremely limited pool size, it remains unclear how mammalian male germline is also sensitive to DNA damage. It has been postulated that the high sensitivity of the germline to DNA damage is part of a quality control mechanism for the germ cell genome, which is passed onto the next generation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gunes et al., 2015</xref>). However, the means by which the germline achieves such a high sensitivity to DNA damage remains unclear.</p><p>Here we provide evidence that germ cell connectivity serves as a mechanism to sensitize the spermatogonia (SGs) to DNA damage in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> testis. We show that an entire SG cyst undergoes synchronized cell death as a unit even when only a subset of SGs within the cyst exhibit detectable DNA damage. Disruption of the fusome, a germline-specific organelle that facilitates communication amongst germ cells within a cyst (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">de Cuevas et al., 1997</xref>), compromises synchronized germ cell death within a cyst in response to DNA damage. The sensitivity of a germ cell cyst to DNA damage increases as the number of interconnected germ cells within increases, demonstrating that connectivity serves as a mechanism to confer higher sensitivity to DNA damage. Taken together, we propose that germ cell cyst formation serves as a mechanism to increase the sensitivity of genome surveillance, ensuring the quality of the genome that is passed onto the next generation.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Ionizing radiation induces spermatogonial death preferentially at the 16 cell stage</title><p>The <italic>Drosophila</italic> testis serves as an excellent model to study germ cell development owing to its well-defined spatiotemporal organization, with spermatogenesis proceeding from the apical tip down the length of the testis. Germline stem cells (GSCs) divide to produce gonialblasts (GBs), which undergo transit-amplifying divisions to become a cyst of 16 interconnected spermatogonia (16-SG) before entering the meiotic program as spermatocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). In our previous study we showed that protein starvation induces SG death, predominantly at the early stages (~4 SG stage) of SG development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Yang and Yamashita, 2015</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Starvation-induced SG death, which itself is non-apoptotic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Yacobi-Sharon et al., 2013</xref>), is mediated by apoptosis of somatic cyst cells encapsulating the SGs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Yang and Yamashita, 2015</xref>). Cyst cell apoptosis breaks the ‘blood-testis-barrier’ and leads to SG death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fairchild et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lim and Fuller, 2012</xref>). Though we noted significant SG death at the 16-SG stage in the course of our previous work, it was independent of nutrient conditions and thus was not the focus of the study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Yang and Yamashita, 2015</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.27960.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>A high level of SG death in response to ionizing radiation.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Illustration of SG development and germ cell death in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> testis.

When adult flies were exposed to ionizing radiation that causes DNA double strand breaks (DSBs), a dramatic induction of SG death was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B,C</xref>). Dying SGs induced by ionizing radiation were detected by Lysotracker staining as described by previous studies, showing characteristic acidification of the entire cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chiang et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Yacobi-Sharon et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Yang and Yamashita, 2015</xref>). SG death in control and irradiated flies proceeded in the same manner, where all of the SGs within a cyst die simultaneously by becoming Lysotracker-positive (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Importantly, in contrast to starvation-induced SG death which was dependent on somatic cyst cell apoptosis, radiation-induced SG death was not suppressed by inhibiting cyst cell apoptosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>), suggesting that radiation-induced SG death is a germ cell-intrinsic response.</p><p>The frequency of dying SG cysts peaked around 3 to 6 hr after irradiation and decreased by 24 hr post-irradiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Interestingly, we found that ionizing radiation robustly induces cell death at the 16-SG stage, although death of other stages (2-, 4-, 8 cell SGs) was also induced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> and see below). This pattern of SG death held true regardless of the ionizing radiation dose (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). While testing multiple doses of ionizing radiation, we noticed that exposure to even a very low dose of ionizing radiation could dramatically induce death of 16-SGs. By measuring dose-dependent death of 16-SGs at six hours post-irradiation, we found that the 16-SG death induced by increasing radiation was a distinctly non-linear response, quickly reaching a plateau of ~3 dying 16-SG cysts per testis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). In comparison, cell death in the wing imaginal disc (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>) followed a linear dose-response relationship where an increase in radiation resulted in a proportional increase in cell death (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). These results demonstrate a remarkable sensitivity of 16-SGs to ionizing radiation compared to somatic cells.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>All SGs within a cyst die even when only a subset of cells exhibit detectable DNA damage</title><p>To gain insight into the cause of the unusual sensitivity of 16-SGs to DNA damage, we evaluated the response of SGs to ionizing radiation at a cell biological level.

Using an anti-γ-H2Av antibody (pS137), we confirmed that γ-H2Av can be robustly detected in SGs following a high dose of ionizing radiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). When a low dose of ionizing radiation was used (≤100 rad), we frequently observed 16-SG cysts in which only a subset of cells within the cyst exhibited detectable γ-H2Av signal but all 16 cells were Lysotracker-positive and dying (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.27960.006</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>All SGs within a cyst die even when only a fraction of cells exhibit detectable DNA damage.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) An example of a dying 16-SG cyst (yellow dotted outline) with only a subset of SGs containing detectable DNA damage (arrowhead). γ-H2Av (green), Lysotracker (red), Vasa (white).

However, Lysotracker staining showed that SGs within a cyst were always either all Lysotracker-positive or -negative (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). These results suggest that while DNA damage is induced in individual SGs within a cyst proportional to the dose of radiation, cell death is induced in all of the SGs within the entire cyst, leading to elevated SG death that follows a non-linear response with increasing dose.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>The fusome is required for synchronized all-or-none SG death within the cysts</title><p>The above results led us to hypothesize that all SGs within a cyst might be triggered to die together even when only a subset of SGs within the cyst have detectable DNA damage, explaining the extremely high sensitivity of the germline to DNA damage. In <italic>Drosophila</italic> and other insects, the fusome is a germline-specific membranous organelle that connects the cytoplasm of germ cells within a cyst and mediates intracyst signaling amongst germ cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lilly et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lin et al., 1994</xref>). We speculated that if germ cell cysts undergo synchronized cell death by sharing the decision to die, the fusome might mediate the ‘all-or-none’ mode of SG death upon DNA damage.</p><p>To examine the role of the fusome in all-or-none SG death upon irradiation, we used RNAi-mediated knockdown of <italic>α-spectrin</italic> and a mutant of <italic>hts</italic>, core components of the fusome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">de Cuevas et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hime et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lilly et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lin et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Yue and Spradling, 1992</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). Mutant and control flies were irradiated and their testes were stained with Lysotracker to identify dying SGs in combination with the lipophilic dye FM4–64 to mark cyst cell membranes, demarcating the boundaries of SG cysts (see methods) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chiang et al., 2017</xref>). In control testes, 16-SG cysts were almost always found to be either completely Lysotracker-positive or -negative under all conditions tested as described above (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A,B,E,F</xref>), confirming our observation using fixed samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Of particular importance, even at a lower dose of radiation (e.g. 100 rad) where only a subset of germ cells exhibit visible γ-H2Av staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>), the 16-SG cyst was either entirely Lysotracker-negative or -positive. In contrast, <italic>α-spectrin</italic> RNAi and <italic>hts</italic> mutant testes frequently contained 16-SG cysts with a mixture of individual Lysotracker-positive and -negative SGs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C,D,G,H</xref>), suggesting that the all-or-none mode of SG death was compromised. Importantly, the mean fraction of 16-SG that died in response to radiation exposure at any dose was reduced when the fusome was disrupted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B,D,F,H</xref>, black bars). These data show that the fusome is required for the coordinated death of all SGs within a cyst, and suggests that the intracyst communication increases overall SG death in response to radiation-induced DNA damage. Moreover, the fact that loss of germ cell communication in fusome mutants allows for the survival of some SGs strongly argues against the possibility that SGs without cytologically detectable γ-H2Av are sufficiently damaged to trigger cell death on their own and that SGs are individually dying. Instead, the death of SGs without detectable γ-H2Av in wild type/control can likely be attributed to a shared death signal from other cells, as blockade of intercellular communication in fusome mutants allows for their survival.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.27960.009</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>The fusome is required for synchronized all-or-none SG death within a cyst.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) A Lysotracker-positive 16-SG cyst (green, dotted outline) in unfixed control testes, with cyst borders marked by FM4–64 (red) and SG nuclei marked by Hoechst 33342 (blue).

This sharing of death-promoting signals is mediated by and dependent on the fusome, which facilitates intracyst communication. If this is the case, it would be predicted that increasing the connectivity of a SG cyst (the number of interconnected SGs within the cyst) would increase its sensitivity to DNA damage, because increased SG number per cyst will increase the probability of any cells being sufficiently damaged to trigger death. Indeed, as mentioned above, we observed a trend of 16-SG cysts dying more frequently than 2-, 4-, or 8-SGs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). By plotting cell death frequency of all SG stages as a function of increasing radiation dose (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>), it becomes clear that the sensitivity of SG cysts correlates with their connectivity, where 8-SGs are less sensitive than 16-SGs but more sensitive than 4-SGs and so on. Interestingly, single-celled GBs, the immediate daughter of GSCs that have not formed any intercellular connections, exhibited an essentially linear increase in death in response to radiation dose, which is reminiscent of somatic imaginal disc cells or follicle cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>).

The purpose for germ cell cyst formation outside the meroistic ovary (i.e. nursing mechanism) remained unclear. Our study in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> male germline shows that the connectivity of germ cells can serve as a key mechanism for their ability to robustly induce cell death, providing an explanation for cyst formation outside of the oocyte nursing mechanism. However, there are many cell types that are known to be connected to sibling cells, where synchronized cell death among the connected cells is not observed or does not make any biological sense. For example, early-stage embryos of <italic>Drosophila</italic> develop as syncytia, where all nuclei are within a connected cytoplasm. The <italic>C. elegans</italic> germline is topologically similar to <italic>Drosophila</italic> early embryos in that all cells share the same cytoplasm. In these two examples, damaged nuclei die individually and synchronized cell death is not observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lettre et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Takada et al., 2003</xref>). In <italic>Drosophila</italic> oogenesis, 16 interconnected cystocytes have distinct fates (one oocyte and 15 nurse cells), and it would not be beneficial to kill the oocyte when just one dispensable nurse cell is damaged. Moreover, nurse cells undergo programmed apoptosis later in oogenesis to finalize the cytoplasmic transport into the oocyte, yet this apoptosis does not kill oocytes. These examples have two important implications. First, openness via ring canals/intercellular bridges alone is likely insufficient to mediate synchronized cell death. Second, there are likely additional purposes for intercellular connectivity to be discovered other than the sharing of death-promoting signals.</p><p>Regarding the first point that physical openness alone is likely insufficient to induce cell death in undamaged sibling cells, we speculate that the fusome plays a key role in facilitating intercellular communication of death-promoting signals. Because fusome mutants apparently maintain cytoplasmic openings (ring canals) between SGs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>), it suggests that the intercellular bridges/openings are not sufficient to allow intracyst communication of death-promoting signals. Consistent with this idea, we found that follicle cells of the egg chamber do not exhibit synchronized cell death in response to irradiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3A</xref>), even though these cells are known to maintain intercellular bridges/ring canals among multiple sibling cells, through which molecules (e.g. GFP) can be transported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">McLean and Cooley, 2013a</xref>). The lack of synchronized cell death in the follicle cells coincided with a proportional/linear increase in cell death with the increasing dose of radiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3B,C</xref>). Therefore, we propose that the fusome functions to transmit the death-triggering signals, similar to its known role in cell cycle synchronization within the germ cell cyst (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lilly et al., 2000</xref>)(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>).</p><p>We imagine two possibilities to explain how the signals are shared within a cyst, leading to cell death: when one SG within a cyst decides to die, this ‘decision of death’ might be sent to all the other SGs within the cyst, leading to all-or-none SG death. Alternatively, the signal shared among SGs may be ‘additive’ in nature. In such a scenario, even when none of the individual SGs have sufficient DNA damage to trigger cell death on its own, addition of all damage signaling within the cyst might reach a level sufficient to induce cell death. Either way, such responses would effectively lower the threshold of DNA damage per cell needed to trigger germ cell death. Consequently, the sharing of signals between SGs through intercellular connections increases their likelihood to die following DNA damage, explaining the unusually high sensitivity of the germline to DNA damage.</p><p>According to this model, higher connectivity would confer higher sensitivity to DNA damage: as the connectivity increases, more cells would contribute to detecting any DNA damage the germline may be experiencing. Indeed, our data show a positive correlation between sensitivity to radiation and the increasing connectivity of SG cysts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). Remarkably, the fact that single-celled, unconnected GBs exhibit an essentially linear death response to increasing radiation suggests that individual germ cells do not necessarily have an intrinsically different DNA damage response that accounts for their high sensitivity to DNA damage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>).</p><p>A connectivity-based increase in sensitivity to DNA damage also has an important implication in the development of multicellular organisms. To pass on genomes to the next generation, it is critically important for germ cells to have the most stringent mechanisms to prevent deleterious mutations. However, as genome size increases in multicellular organisms, ubiquitously increasing the stringency of genome quality control could result in a high rate of cell death in all tissues, which could compromise the development or survival of organisms. Thus, a multicellular organism may require differential sensitivities to DNA damage between the soma and the germline: a more sensitive genome surveillance mechanism to protect the germline, whereas the priority of the soma shifting toward survival to support development/maintenance of somatic organs. A connectivity-based increase in sensitivity to DNA damage might be a simple method for multicellular organisms to achieve drastically different sensitivities to DNA damage between the soma and germline without having to alter intrinsic damage response pathways, although additional germline-specific DNA damage response mechanisms cannot be excluded. We speculate that one reason germ cell connectivity has arisen during evolution and been so widely conserved might be to confer higher sensitivity to DNA damage specifically in the germline. It awaits future studies to understand whether germ cells from other organisms exhibit high sensitivity to DNA damage in a manner dependent on intracyst communication.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Fly husbandry and strains</title><p>All fly stocks were raised on standard Bloomington medium at 25°C, and young flies (0 to 2 day old adults) were used for all experiments unless otherwise noted.

The following primary antibodies were used: mouse anti-Adducin-like 1B1 (<italic>hu-li tai shao</italic> – Fly Base) [1:20; Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank (DSHB); developed by H.D. Lipshitz]; mouse anti-alpha-spectrin 3A9 (1:20; DSHB; developed by R. Dubreuil, T. Byers); rat anti-vasa (1:50; DSHB; developed by A.

Images were taken using a Leica TCS SP8 confocal microscope with 63x oil-immersion objectives (NA = 1.4) and processed using Adobe Photoshop software. For detection of germ cell death, testes were stained with Lysotracker Red DND-99 in PBS (1:1000) for 30 min prior to formaldehyde fixation. Stages (GB, 2-, 4-, 8-, and 16-SGs) of dying SGs were identified by counting the number of nuclei within the cyst visualized by Lamin Dm0 and DAPI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chiang et al., 2017</xref>). Note that the number of ‘stageable’ dying SGs underrepresents the total population of dying SGs, because nuclear structures disintegrate during later phases of cell death, making it impossible to count the number of SGs within a dying cyst (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chiang et al., 2017</xref>). Such ‘unstageable’ SGs were not included in the scoring in this study.</p><p>For observation of unfixed samples, testes were dissected directly into PBS and incubated in the dark with the desired dyes for 5 min, mounted on slides with PBS and imaged within 10 min of dissection. The dyes used in live imaging are: Lysotracker Red DND-99 (1:200) or Lysotracker Green DND-26 (1:200) (Thermo Fisher Scientific), Hoechst 33342 (1:200), and FM4-64FX in PBS (1:200) (Thermo Fisher Scientific). SG stage (2-, 4-, 8-, or 16-SG) was assessed by number of Hoechst-stained nuclei. Note that the scoring of dying SGs is not directly comparable between fixed and unfixed samples (for example, results shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> vs. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), due to the difference in the method of SG staging and timing.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Ionizing radiation</title><p>For radiation doses of 25–250 rad, a <sup>137</sup>Cs source was used with a dose rate of approximately 100 rad per minute.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor, Hugo J Bellen, and K VijayRaghavan as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal his identity: Allan C Spradling (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission. The Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments based on the reviewers' reports, which are considered essential concerns that you will need to address in a revised submission.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>In this manuscript, the authors examine a potential link between the extraordinary sensitivity of germ cells to DNA damage and their syncytial mode of development. Using irradiated developing <italic>Drosophila</italic> male germ cells as a model, they show that the presence of damaged spermatogonial cells within a syncytial cyst results in death of all cells within the cyst. They show that this coordinated &quot;all-or-none&quot; germ cell death relies on the presence of the adducin-like protein Hts and spectrin, which are components of the fusome (an ER-like organelle that interconnects developing spermatocytes via stable intercellular bridges), as well as the mitochondrial protease HtrA2/Omi. In addition, the authors argue, based on the presence of higher numbers of dying 16-cell spermatogonial cysts, that higher connectivity leads to greater sensitivity to DNA damage, suggesting a possible evolutionary advantage to syncytial germ cell development. Overall, the manuscript is well written and the experiments are nicely executed.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>This paper presents a fascinating, original idea regarding the origin of germ cell radiation sensitivity. The authors connect DNA damage sensitivity to the intercellular bridges that join sets of male or female germ cells into &quot;germline cysts&quot; for much of gamete development. Their hypothesis is strongly supported in the case of pre-meiotic 2,4,8 and especially 16-cell SG cysts. Disruption of cyst connectivity using fusome mutants or interference with the proposed damage signaling pathway using HtrA2/Omi mutants causes effects predicted by the hypothesis and the signaling mechanism. The existence of a novel group mechanism elevating damage sensitivity at least in pre-meiotic cysts is of strong interest in its own right. Shortly after these stages, during meiosis, extensive DNA damage occurs to stimulate recombination, raising the question of how the propagation of damage signals in avoided. If interconnected pre-meiotic male germ cells can transmit apoptotic signals between cells, how do interconnected female germ cells avoid damaging the oocyte during their own apoptotic process that accompanies &quot;nurse cell dumping? &quot;</p><p>The argument that increased connectivity leads to increased sensitivity to DNA damage is not convincing. The authors find that there are more dying 16-cell cysts than dying gonialblasts or cysts at earlier stages. Surprisingly, they do not take into account the frequency of dying cysts at different stages relative to the abundance of cysts at these stages within the testis. 16-cell spermatocyte cysts are known to persist for ~90 hours prior to undergoing meiotic division. Since the entire period prior to meiotic division is thought to encompass ~5 days (~120 hrs), simple math would dictate that there are likely ~3x more 16-cell cysts than cysts at earlier stages of sperm development. In fact, adult testes clearly contain a preponderance of 16-cell cysts, with smaller numbers of cysts at earlier stages. Thus, the observation that there are more dying cysts at the 16-cell stage could simply be due to the fact that there are more cysts at this stage. The authors' numbers would seem to agree with this. For example, there are approximately 3x more dying 16-cell cysts at 3 and 6 hrs post-irradiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>) than there are dying cysts at earlier stages. I strongly suggest that the authors quantify the numbers of cysts at different stages in wild-type control testes (or find references where this has been quantified), as their conclusions in this regard clearly overstep the data presented (there is no denominator) and in my view do not make sense. Moreover, support for the idea that the degree of connectivity of germ cells and communication of a DNA damage signal are not needed for increased sensitivity of developing germ cells to DNA damage is based on what is known about <italic>C. elegans</italic> germline development: although <italic>C. elegans</italic> germ cells develop within a syncytium, germ cells that are damaged by irradiation cellularize and undergo apoptosis as individual cells; DNA damage does not induce massive cell death within the large syncytium that comprises a major proportion of the <italic>C. elegans</italic> gonad. This further argues that there is no evolutionary requirement for increased connectivity in promoting germ cell death in response to DNA damage. The novelty of what the authors show for the <italic>Drosophila</italic> male germline is that connectivity leads to death of all of the cells within a cyst and that this is apparently due to sharing of a death signal among the syncytial SG cells.</p><p>Is the fusome itself required for the coordinated death of all SGs within a cyst or is it that the interconnectivity between cysts is what is important and that fusome loss compromises interconnectivity? How does knockdown of α-spectrin or mutation of <italic>hts</italic> influence ring canals and the ability of small molecules and proteins to move between cells within a cyst? All this may be well established or known, however, as written it was not clear to us. Please clarify this in the text. Or conduct experiment that demonstrate diffusion or lack thereof within the normal and <italic>hts</italic> mutant cysts.</p><p>The biggest current weakness of the manuscript is the claim that apoptosis signaling within the cyst can explain the &quot;the extreme sensitivity&quot; of germ cells to DNA damage. First, it is not clear that germ cell damage hyper-sensitivity has been rigorously established as what data exist derive heavily from observations of humans treated with chemotherapeutic agents. But even if germ cells are hypersensitive as a group, the authors need to explain how a mechanism that acts at relatively rare stages could strongly affect the bulk sensitivity of germ cells which are not mostly at pre-meiotic cyst stages. Consequently, the authors should more thoroughly investigate how long during meiosis and the remaining time that clusters remain interconnected does sensitivity stay elevated and all or nothing apoptosis patterns persist. If the effects are actually widespread, then this apparent difficulty would be resolved.</p><p>Similarly, if a yet unknown mechanism leads to communication of 'hypothetical death signal' between cells in cysts one would expect that other, somatic syncytia, such as the early embryos or polynucleated muscles, should be similarly sensitive. These experiments may exist in the literature or otherwise should be included.</p><p>Notably, the mechanism described does not apply to germline stem cells, the most important cells for maintaining gamete production long term. One could argue that elevating damage sensitivity of early spermatogonia would be counter-productive. At low levels of radiation, the authors showed that some cyst cells die without an evidence of DNA damage. These cells would be the ideal candidates to replace damaged GSCs. Hence, it would theoretically be more beneficial to preserve undamaged cyst cells and upregulate GSC replacement, rather than killing all cyst cells regardless of their damage level. However, while an interesting subject for speculation, this question does not detract from the interest of the authors finding of a group behavior impacting damage sensitivity.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.27960.023</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>In reading review comments, we realize that there is a major theme that troubled reviewers: there are many examples outside male germ cells where cells are connected, in which connectivity-based increased cell death is not observed and/or such cell death does not make any (biological) sense (certain somatic cells, such as follicle cells, syncytial embryos, <italic>C. elegans</italic> germline, oocytes connected to nurse cells). How should the authors explain these? Many of comments revolve around this issue, and we acknowledge that our writing was misleading/confusing on this point.</p><p>First, we would like to clarify that we did not intend to claim that the only purpose of intercellular connectivity is to increase sensitivity to DNA damage, or intercellular connectivity always leads to increased DNA damage sensitivity. Based on our data as well as information from the literature (detailed in the point-by-point responses below), we speculate that it is likely the fusome instead of ‘openness (between cells)’ that specifically mediates communication between germ cells to induce their death. We acknowledge that ‘connectivity’ was too vague in this regard (can be interpreted as either communication or openness between cells), and in our revised manuscript, we clarify these points by explicitly distinguishing between ‘openness’ vs. ‘communication through the fusome’.</p><p>For example, now the Results section contains the description as following (with added data):</p><p>“It should be noted that the fusome mutants appeared to maintain ring canals, as evidenced by the intact ring shape of Pavarotti-GFP, a marker for ring canals (Minestrini, Máthé, and Glover, 2002) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). […] Additionally, these cells did not exhibit extreme sensitivity to low doses of radiation and displayed an essentially linear dose-response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3B, C</xref>).”</p><p>Related to this issue, the reviewers also commented on other types of connected cells (<italic>Drosophila</italic> embryos, <italic>C. elegans</italic> germline etc.). We included paragraphs on these systems in Discussion as following. Also we ensured that Introduction and Results sections do not leave the wrong impression that the increased DNA damage sensitivity is the only meaning of germ cell connectivity:</p><p>“Our present study may provide a link between two long-standing observations in germ cell biology: 1) the broad conservation of intercellular connectivity (cyst formation) of germ cells and 2) the sensitivity of the germline to DNA damage. The purpose for germ cell cyst formation outside the meroistic ovary (i.e. nursing mechanism) remained unclear. […] Therefore, we propose that the fusome functions to transmit the death-triggering signals, similar to its known role in cell cycle synchronization within the germ cell cyst (Lilly et al., 2000)(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>).”</p><p>After thoroughly revising on these points, as well as adding new data (detailed below), we hope that the manuscript reads better and conveys our message more clearly.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p><italic>This paper presents a fascinating, original idea regarding the origin of germ cell radiation sensitivity.

Indeed, it is a fascinating question to ask how some types of germ cells are interconnected but (likely) do not commit all-or-none cell death. As described above (at the beginning of our response), we did not intend to claim that any connectivity (openness) would lead to all-or-none cell death. Based on our data (and as described above), we speculate that this all-or-none death is mediated by the fusome instead of mere openings. Interestingly, in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> female germline, the fusome disintegrates fairly early (by region 3, soon after oocyte fate determination): thus we speculate that fusome disintegration explains how the female germline might avoid unnecessarily killing all cells within the cyst. These speculations are included in the Discussion.</p><p>Also, we now include the following data, which strengthen the idea of fusome (but not a mere openings) as a mediator of SG death:</p><p>1) Fusome mutants apparently maintains openness (ring canal) as assessed by a ring canal marker Pavarotti-GFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>);</p><p>2) Somatic follicle cells (of the egg chamber) do not die in an all-or-none manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>), although they are known to be connected by ring canals (McLean and Cooley).</p><p><italic>The argument that increased connectivity leads to increased sensitivity to DNA damage is not convincing. The authors find that there are more dying 16-cell cysts than dying gonialblasts or cysts at earlier stages. Surprisingly, they do not take into account the frequency of dying cysts at different stages relative to the abundance of cysts at these stages within the testis. 16-cell spermatocyte cysts are known to persist for ~90 hours prior to undergoing meiotic division.

As implied from the use of the term ‘spermatogonia’ (for which we should have been more explicit), we have limited our scoring to spermatogonial cysts only. Because spermatocytes quickly grow in size, they can be easily distinguished from spermatogonia, and any cysts with larger cytoplasm (i.e. spermatocytes) were excluded from our scoring.</p><p>The reviewers are correct in pointing out that the number of SG death/testis does not make any sense without a denominator. We have previously published that SG cysts are around ~6 per stage in a testis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> from Yang and Yamashita 2015). Counting the number of spermatogonial cysts for each testis, within the same testis stained for SG death (Lysotracker), is not technically feasible. However, our study (Yang and Yamashita, 2015) gives us confidence that this SG cyst number/testis is fairly consistent within the genotype, and we can assume that denominator is consistent across SG stages. We have added this reasoning to the legend of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> as following:</p><p>“It should be noted that the SG death frequency was scored as ‘number of dying SG cysts at each stage per testis’. We have shown that the number of SG cysts is consistently ~5-6 cysts per stage per testis (Yang &amp; Yamashita, 2015), justifying the use of ‘number of dying SG cysts/testis’ as a proxy for frequency of SG cyst death.”</p><p><italic>Moreover, support for the idea that the degree of connectivity of germ cells and communication of a DNA damage signal are not needed for increased sensitivity of developing germ cells to DNA damage is based on what is known about C. elegans germline development: although C. elegans germ cells develop within a syncytium, germ cells that are damaged by irradiation cellularize and undergo apoptosis as individual cells; DNA damage does not induce massive cell death within the large syncytium that comprises a major proportion of the C. elegans gonad. This further argues that there is no evolutionary requirement for increased connectivity in promoting germ cell death in response to DNA damage. The novelty of what the authors show for the Drosophila male germline is that connectivity leads to death of all of the cells within a cyst and that this is apparently due to sharing of a death signal among the syncytial SG cells.</italic> </p><p>Please see our response above.</p><p>Also, regarding this comment, although the <italic>C. elegans</italic> germline develops in syncytium, the cytoplasm of individual germ cells is not connected due to a diffusion barrier (Cinquin et al., 2015). Therefore, it is unlikely that one damaged cell would kill all other cells (in addition to our speculation that cell death signal propagates through the fusome, as described above).</p><p><italic>Is the fusome itself required for the coordinated death of all SGs within a cyst or is it that the interconnectivity between cysts is what is important and that fusome loss compromises interconnectivity? How does knockdown of α-spectrin or mutation of hts influence ring canals and the ability of small molecules and proteins to move between cells within a cyst? All this may be well established or known, however, as written it was not clear to us. Please clarify this in the text. Or conduct experiment that demonstrate diffusion or lack thereof within the normal and hts mutant cysts.</italic> </p><p>Because all-or-none SG death is compromised in fusome mutants, we believe that it is a fusome-mediated process. Ring canals (RCs) were observed to be maintained in fusome mutants, as indicated by the presence of apparently intact rings visualized by Pavarotti-GFP. We have included a figure that shows this (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). From previous literature, it was shown that the fusome both prevents ubiquitous sharing of cytoplasmic contents via RCs (Strassheim and Mahowald 1970, Cox and Spradling 2003) and is specifically necessary for facilitating sharing of certain signals between cyst members (Lilly et al., 2000). We have added these references and clarified our text throughout the manuscript to ensure that we do not mislead the readers by the term of ‘connectivity’. Our understanding is that Dr. Lynn Cooley is studying this aspect (what is shared by male RCs) and planning to submit a manuscript on this soon.</p><p><italic>The biggest current weakness of the manuscript is the claim that apoptosis signaling within the cyst can explain the &quot;the extreme sensitivity&quot; of germ cells to DNA damage. First, it is not clear that germ cell damage hyper-sensitivity has been rigorously established as what data exist derive heavily from observations of humans treated with chemotherapeutic agents.

If the effects are actually widespread, then this apparent difficulty would be resolved.</italic> </p><p>This comment revolves around the fact that our original manuscript left the impression that increased DNA damage sensitivity is the only purpose for germ cell connectivity, and germ cell connectivity is the only means by which high DNA damage sensitivity is achieved. We went through the entire text as described above not to mislead the readers in such a way.</p><p>Whereas we agree that spermatogonia may be only a small fraction of germ cells within a testis, we would like to emphasize that spermatocytes are not renewable: once they become spermatocytes, they cannot amplify in number, and how sensitive or insensitive they may be to DNA damage, they will not be able to contribute to long-term fertility. Therefore, spermatogonia’s sensitivity to DNA damage would determine a significant portion of DNA damage sensitivity of the entire germline. The remaining population to be considered would be GSCs, which will be discussed below, in response to the review comments that specifically raised a question regarding GSCs.</p><p><italic>Similarly, if a yet unknown mechanism leads to communication of 'hypothetical death signal' between cells in cysts one would expect that other, somatic syncytia, such as the early embryos or polynucleated muscles, should be similarly sensitive. These experiments may exist in the literature or otherwise should be included.</italic> </p><p>Please see our response above regarding this point. Now we made it clear that we speculate (with additional supportive data) that the death-promoting signal is specifically shared via the fusome, instead of mere openness. We hope that added data/discussion and the revised text is now acceptable in this regard.</p><p><italic>Notably, the mechanism described does not apply to germline stem cells, the most important cells for maintaining gamete production long term. One could argue that elevating damage sensitivity of early spermatogonia would be counter-productive. At low levels of radiation, the authors showed that some cyst cells die without an evidence of DNA damage. These cells would be the ideal candidates to replace damaged GSCs. Hence, it would theoretically be more beneficial to preserve undamaged cyst cells and upregulate GSC replacement, rather than killing all cyst cells regardless of their damage level. However, while an interesting subject for speculation, this question does not detract from the interest of the authors finding of a group behavior impacting damage sensitivity.</italic> </p><p>We remain agnostic about GSCs. Dr. Erika Matunis’ group and our laboratory independently observed no (very rare) GSC death under any circumstances (including a few stress regimens such as starvation, DNA damage etc.) (Hasan et al., 2015; Yang and Yamashita, 2015). However, this does not conclude anything about the sensitivity of GSCs to DNA damage (or any other stress). It was shown in mammalian systems that stem cells simply differentiate when they are stressed (Inomata et al., 2009). Their threshold to differentiate can be more or less sensitive compared to SG death, but there is no means to compare these two distinct processes. We could speculate that GSCs might simply initiate differentiation upon DNA damage: subsequently, high sensitivity to DNA damage during spermatogonial divisions can serve as an ‘assessment method’ for their genomic integrity, and spermatogonia with any problem may die out. In this manner, spermatogonia with the highest level of genomic integrity would survive, from which GSC population can be regenerated by dedifferentiation as necessary. Of course, this scenario is a pure speculation, and might be an interesting topic for mathematical modeling in a future study. The point we would like to make here is that, our results on increased DNA damage sensitivity in spermatogonia is not necessarily counter-productive as it may seem.</p></body></sub-article></article>
