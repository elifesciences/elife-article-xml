While such capacity deteriorates with age in mammals, it remains intact in species such as salamanders, which have an extensive repertoire of regeneration and can undergo multiple episodes through their lifespan. Here we show that, surprisingly, there is a significant induction of cellular senescence during salamander limb regeneration, but that rapid and effective mechanisms of senescent cell clearance operate in normal and regenerating tissues. Furthermore, the number of senescent cells does not increase upon repetitive amputation or ageing, in contrast to mammals. Finally, we identify the macrophage as a critical player in this efficient senescent cell clearance mechanism. We propose that effective immunosurveillance of senescent cells in salamanders supports their ability to undergo regeneration throughout their lifespan.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>macrophage</kwd><kwd>newt</kwd><kwd>senescence</kwd><kwd>salamander</kwd><kwd>ageing</kwd><kwd>axolotl</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><back><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interest</title><fn fn-type="conflict" id="conf1"><p>The authors declare that no competing interests exist.</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>Animal experimentation: All procedures for care and manipulation of adult newts (Notophthalmus viridescens) and axolotls (Ambystoma mexicanum) were performed in compliance with the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986, approved by the United Kingdom Home Office and University College London (Institutional License: 70-2716).
