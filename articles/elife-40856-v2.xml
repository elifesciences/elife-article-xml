Here we demonstrate that DNA damage activates TFE3 and TFEB in a p53 and mTORC1 dependent manner. RNA-Seq analysis of TFEB/TFE3 double-knockout cells exposed to etoposide reveals a profound dysregulation of the DNA damage response, including upstream regulators and downstream p53 targets. TFE3 and TFEB contribute to sustain p53-dependent response by stabilizing p53 protein levels. In TFEB/TFE3 DKOs, p53 half-life is significantly decreased due to elevated Mdm2 levels. Transcriptional profiles of genes involved in lysosome membrane permeabilization and cell death pathways are dysregulated in TFEB/TFE3-depleted cells. Consequently, prolonged DNA damage results in impaired LMP and apoptosis induction. Finally, expression of multiple genes implicated in cell cycle control is altered in TFEB/TFE3 DKOs, revealing a previously unrecognized role of TFEB and TFE3 in the regulation of cell cycle checkpoints in response to stress.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>TFEB</kwd><kwd>TFE3</kwd><kwd>p53</kwd><kwd>lysosomes</kwd><kwd>DNA Damage</kwd><kwd>cell cycle</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jeong</surname><given-names>Eutteum</given-names></name><name><surname>Brady</surname><given-names>Owen A</given-names></name><name><surname>Martina</surname><given-names>Jose A</given-names></name><name><surname>Pirooznia</surname><given-names>Mehdi</given-names></name><name><surname>Tunc</surname><given-names>Iker</given-names></name><name><surname>Puertollano</surname><given-names>Rosa</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Disruption of TFEB and TFE3 results in diminished p53 signaling capacity and altered cell cycle regulation under genotoxic stress conditions.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>TFEB and TFE3 belong to the MiTF-TFE family of basic helix-loop-helix leucine zipper (bHLH-LZ) transcription factors and have been well characterized as master regulators of the autophagy-lysosome pathway in response to starvation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Martina et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Sardiello et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Settembre et al., 2011</xref>). Under nutrient poor conditions, TFEB and TFE3 translocate to the nucleus where they bind to and promote transcription from consensus 10 bp GTCACGTGAC sequences, termed Coordinated Lysosome Expression and Regulation (CLEAR) elements, in the promoters of autophagic and lysosomal genes, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Martina et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Palmieri et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Sardiello et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Settembre et al., 2011</xref>). Under conditions of adequate nutrient status, TFEB and TFE3 bind to a pair of heterodimeric small GTPases, termed RagA or RagB (RagA/B) and RagC or RagD (RagC/D) on the lysosome surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Martina and Puertollano, 2013</xref>). These Rag GTPases also recruit the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) complex 1 (mTORC1), which phosphorylates TFEB at Ser211 and TFE3 at Ser321, thus creating a binding site for proteins in the 14-3-3 family which sequester TFEB and TFE3 in the cytosol by masking their nuclear localization signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Martina et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Martina et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Powis and De Virgilio, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Roczniak-Ferguson et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Since all cells require the homeostatic functions of the autophagy-lysosome pathway, these nutrient responsive mechanisms of control over TFEB and TFE3 are highly conserved. Recently, other cellular stressors such as inflammatory or pathogenic signals, ER stress, oxidative stress, and high intensity exercise have been implicated in activating TFEB and TFE3 via a variety of mechanisms involving mTORC1 as well as other kinases and phosphatases, including calcineurin and PP2A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chen et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Mansueto et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Martina et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Martina and Puertollano, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Najibi et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Pastore et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Visvikis et al., 2014</xref>). In addition to being regulated by multiple physiological stressors, TFEB and TFE3 exhibit unique cell or tissue type specific responses including pro-inflammatory, chemoattractant, and antimicrobial responses in immune cells such as macrophages and dendritic cells; lipid metabolism in liver and adipose tissue; and mitochondrial biogenesis in muscle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bretou et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Mansueto et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Najibi et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Pastore et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Settembre et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Visvikis et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>The tumor suppressor transcription factor p53 integrates DNA damage signals resulting in transcriptional programs governing the diverse processes of the DNA damage response (DDR) including cell cycle arrest, DNA repair, senescence, and when the stress is severe enough, apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bieging and Attardi, 2012</xref>). Much like TFE3 and TFEB, p53 has been shown to respond to multiple cellular stressors including nutrient deprivation, oxidative stress, and hypoxia. Similarly, p53 has roles controlling transcriptional activity towards processes not canonically associated with the DDR, including autophagy, cell migration, and metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bieging and Attardi, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Nishida et al., 2016</xref>). p53 activity is controlled through an extensive repertoire of posttranslational modifications at approximately 50 residues which include phosphorylation, acetylation, methylation, ubiquitylation, sumoylation, and poly-ADP-ribosylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Meek and Anderson, 2009</xref>). Under baseline conditions, p53 is rapidly ubiquitylated and degraded by the E3 ligase, Mdm2, limiting its activity. In response to DNA damage and other stressors, p53 is rapidly phosphorylated and acetylated by a large variety of kinases and acetyltransferases which serve to stabilize and modulate binding to p53 response elements in the promoters of different classes of genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Meek and Anderson, 2009</xref>).</p><p>Importantly, p53 has critical and multifaceted roles in regulating autophagy, including a suppressive function attributed to its cytosolic form and a more well-established pro-autophagic function owing to its transcriptional activity in the nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kenzelmann Broz et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Tasdemir et al., 2008</xref>). Autophagy itself appears to be induced as part of the DDR. For example, an alternative Atg5 and LC3-independent form of autophagy is induced in mouse embryonic fibroblasts in response to the DNA damaging drug, etoposide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Nishida et al., 2009</xref>). Autophagic functions critical for the DDR include ensuring an adequate supply of NAD<sup>+</sup> and dNTPs for repair functions, maintaining genomic stability through removal of micronuclei containing chromosome fragments, and the assembly of the nucleotide excision repair (NER) complex at sites of DNA damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Eliopoulos et al., 2016</xref>). Finally, many gene products, including the p53 regulated Dram1 and Trp53inp1 are involved in autophagic processes while exhibiting independent or complementary functions in the DDR.</p><p>The role of p53 in cancer has been studied extensively, with approximately half of all human cancers exhibiting mutations at the <italic>TP53</italic> locus, while cancers without p53 mutations frequently have other alterations in the p53 pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Eliopoulos et al., 2016</xref>). While not as widely associated with all cancers, TFE3 and TFEB gene fusions are detected in subsets of renal cell carcinomas (RCC), indicating roles for these transcription factors in oncogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kauffman et al., 2014</xref>). Given the commonalities between TFE3/TFEB and p53 in regard to their activation by diverse cellular stressors and their shared roles in the transcriptional control of autophagy and other cellular stress responses, we wondered if TFE3 and TFEB exhibited any common regulatory mechanisms with p53. In this study, we report that TFE3 and TFEB are indeed activated by DNA damage, albeit with a delayed kinetic profile compared to p53. This response is at least partially dependent upon p53-mediated mTORC1 inhibition. RNA-Seq analysis of MEFs and RAW264.7 cells treated with etoposide reveals a robust DDR with upregulation of canonical p53 regulated transcripts, which is strongly dysregulated in a CRISPR/Cas9 generated TFE3/TFEB double knockout (DKO) background. Conversely, overexpression of constitutively active TFE3 and TFEB mutants increases expression of DDR genes involved in upstream transduction of DDR signals along with downstream DDR effectors, including genes involved in apoptosis and p53 itself. Lastly, we relate defects in TFE3 and TFEB signaling in response to DNA damage to defects in lysosome membrane permeabilization (LMP), regulation of cell death pathways, and cell cycle control. These data are the first reported example of extensive cross-talk between the p53 and TFE3/TFEB pathways showing disruption in expression of DDR genes as well as functional defects in lysosome integrity and cell death pathways in TFE3/TFEB-depleted cells.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>TFE3 and TFEB translocate to the nucleus in response to genotoxic stress</title><p>We and others have previously demonstrated that TFE3 and TFEB are activated in a variety of cell types in response to various physiological stressors. The best described pathway is in response to starvation and is contingent upon mTORC1 inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Martina et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Martina et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Roczniak-Ferguson et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Settembre et al., 2012</xref>). More recently, we have shown that TFE3 and TFEB are activated in response to ER stress and in response to pathogenic signatures in macrophages, both in an mTORC1 independent fashion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Martina et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Pastore et al., 2016</xref>). To determine if genotoxic stress activates TFE3 and TFEB, we exposed wild type mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) to etoposide, a drug which induces both single strand breaks and double strand breaks in DNA which are corrected via a variety of repair pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">de Campos-Nebel et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Pommier et al., 2010</xref>). We observed a time-dependent increase in the levels of TFE3 in the nucleus relative to the cytosol, with noticeable accumulation appearing by 4 hr treatment, and increasing amounts at 8 hr and 16 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). After 8 hr treatment, the nuclear localization of TFE3 is statistically significant compared to control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>; numerical values <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata1">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>). While the proportion of live cells exhibiting nuclear TFE3 increases further by 16 hr treatment, the number of dead cells begin to outnumber the living, hence 8 hr was used as a benchmark for a number of subsequent experiments with etoposide as a compromise between maximal TFE3 activation and minimal cell death.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.40856.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>TFE3 and TFEB translocate to the nucleus in response to genotoxic stress.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Immunofluorescence images of WT MEFs treated with 100 μM etoposide for up to 16 hr.

Unlike etoposide, the chemotherapeutic agent cisplatin damages DNA by forming guanine adducts and intrastrand cross-links, which are preferentially repaired by the nucleotide excision repair (NER) pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">O'Grady et al., 2014</xref>). Despite this mechanistic difference in mode of DNA damage, cisplatin treatment also effectively induced TFE3 nuclear translocation in MEFs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Treatment with ultraviolet light, which primarily damages DNA through the formation of pyrimidine dimers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gentile, 2003</xref>), also induced TFE3 activation in MEFs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). We also confirmed that TFE3 nuclear accumulation in response to genotoxic stress was observed in other cell types, including ARPE-19, HeLa and RAW 264.7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A–C</xref>). Finally, we performed subcellular fractionation experiments following treatment with either etoposide or cisplatin. As seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1H</xref>, we observed a significant increase in the amount of nuclear TFE3 and TFEB following DNA damage.</p><p>Activation of TFE3 requires dephosphorylation of serine 321. Treatment of several cell types with different DNA damaging agents, resulted in a time dependent decrease in S321 phosphorylation that correlated with the degree of TFE3 nuclear translocation observed by immunofluorescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D–G</xref>). Starvation in Earle’s Balanced Salt Solution for 2 hr was used as a positive control for dephosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). TFEB serine 211 (S211) is the equivalent residue to TFE3 S321, however phospho-specific antibodies generated against this residue are not detectable with endogenous TFEB levels. Nonetheless, TFEB exhibits a pronounced gel-shift following DNA damage, which is indicative of dephosphorylation, thus suggesting a similar regulation of both transcription factors in response to DNA damage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D–G</xref>). Furthermore, treatment of a HeLa clone that stably expresses TFEB-FLAG with UV-C light resulted in a rapid dephosphorylation of TFE3 and TFEB at S321 and S211, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>).</p><p>Taken together, these data indicate that TFE3 and TFEB are activated by a wide variety of DNA-damaging stimuli with varying mechanisms of action and preferential DNA repair pathway responses.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Activation of TFE3 and TFEB in response to genotoxic stress is dependent on mTORC1 and p53</title><p>Activation of TFE3 and TFEB in response to starvation is dependent on mTORC1 inactivation and subsequent dephosphorylation of TFE3-S321 and TFEB-S211. Other stressors, such as ER stress, pathogen infection and oxidative stress, result in TFE3 and TFEB activation despite high mTORC1 activity. This mTORC1-independent activation is likely due to activation of specific phosphatases, such as calcineurin and PP2A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Martina and Puertollano, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Martina et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Medina et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Pastore et al., 2016</xref>). To test if mTORC1 activity is affected under DNA damage conditions, we performed western bloting on lysates from cells treated with etoposide or starved with EBSS as a positive control. As expected, EBSS treatment resulted in a near complete inhibition of mTORC1 activity as assessed by phosphorylation of S6K and 4EBP1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). Treatment with etoposide also resulted in a time-dependent decrease in S6K and 4EBP1 phosphorylation levels that mirrors the kinetics of observed TFE3 nuclear translocation, suggesting that mTORC1 inhibition may be a major mechanism by which DNA damage promotes TFE3 and TFEB activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). It is notable that the degree of mTORC1 inhibition after 8 hr etoposide was not as potent as that induced by starvation and closely correlates with the degree of dephosphorylation and nuclear redistribution of TFE3 under etoposide treated and starvation conditions, respectively. The effect of DNA damage on reducing mTORC1 activity was also observed in ARPE-19 cells, which could tolerate extended etoposide treatment past 24 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1I</xref>), as well as in HeLa cells treated with UVC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>).</p><p>Several studies have reported that the activation of the DNA damage response (DDR) leads to p53-dependent mTORC1 inactivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Budanov and Karin, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cam et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Feng et al., 2005</xref>). Given these connections between DNA damage, p53 activity, and mTORC1 inactivation, we hypothesized that the TFE3 and TFEB activation observed in our experiments was dependent on p53 activation. We tested this by repeating mTORC1 activity assays and TFE3 translocation assays in both wild type (WT) and p53<sup>-/-</sup> MEFs. As predicted, etoposide treatment resulted in a time-dependent decrease in mTORC1 activity in WT MEFs, whereas this decrease was virtually absent in p53<sup>-/-</sup> MEFs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Unlike with DNA damage, p53<sup>-/-</sup> MEFs still displayed a strong reduction in mTORC1 signaling in response to starvation, although the levels remained slightly elevated when compared with WT MEFs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>).

For this, we transfected ARPE-19 with a constitutive active version of Rag GTPases, in which RagB and RagD are locked in their GTP-bound and GDP-bound state, respectively, thus becoming insensitive to mTORC1 inactivation by the p53-sestrin-GATOR1 axis. As expected, expression of active Rags, and consequent constitutive mTORC1 activation, prevented translocation of endogenous TFE3 to the nucleus following etoposide treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G and H</xref>; numerical values <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2sdata4">Figure 2—source data 4</xref>). These data corroborate that mTORC1 inactivation is required for TFE3 activation in response to DNA damage.</p><p>We also observed a statistically significant reduction in the nuclear TFE3 population in p53<sup>-/-</sup> MEFs exposed to starvation conditions, suggesting that p53 may play an unexpected role in the regulation of the starvation response with regards to regulation of TFE3 and TFEB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). Accordingly, transcriptional upregulation of several TFEB and TFE3 targets, including Lamp1, Mcoln1, Atp6vc1, and Ctsd, was significantly reduced in p53<sup>-/-</sup> MEFs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>; numerical values <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2s1sdata1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1—source data 1</xref>). Despite its best characterized role as a master transcriptional regulator of the DDR, p53 has a well-established, but complex roles in the regulation of autophagy. Activated p53 is involved in upregulating autophagy in many experimental contexts but has also been implicated in suppressing basal autophagy under other experimental conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Feng et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Tasdemir et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Zeng et al., 2007</xref>). Given the p53 dependence of TFE3 and TFEB activation in response to DNA damage and the fact that these transcription factors are themselves critical transcriptional regulators of the autophagy and lysosomal pathways, an attractive hypothesis is that p53’s effects on these pathways are at least partially dependent on TFE3 and TFEB activity. Nonetheless, direct p53 binding to p53 response elements (PRE) in the promoters of autophagic and lysosomal genes such as cathepsin D have been reported, suggesting a more complex interplay between these transcription factors in these pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Wu et al., 1998</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Alterations in the DNA Damage Response in TFEB/TFE3 knockout cells</title><p>In order to obtain a global view of the effects of TFE3 and TFEB on the DDR transcriptome, we performed RNA-Seq analysis of WT and TFEB/TFE3 DKO MEFs under basal conditions and in response to 8 hr etoposide treatment.

Expression levels of these genes were verified using qRT-PCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). The proximal DDR response genes Rad9a and Chek2 are both involved in p53 activation, either directly, as with the p53 kinase activity of Chek2, or indirectly as in the case of Rad9a in its capacity as a DNA damage sensor as part of the 9-1-1 complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lim et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Zannini et al., 2014</xref>).

Of these genes, Trp53inp1 and Mdm2, exhibit direct p53 regulatory roles on p53 itself. Trp53inp1 encodes a multifunctional protein involved in antioxidant response, autophagy, and cell death pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cano et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Okamura et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Seillier et al., 2012</xref>). Importantly, Trp53inp1 also exhibits positive feedback towards p53 pro-apoptotic function by promoting phosphorylation of p53 at Ser46 by the kinase HIPK2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Okamura et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Tomasini et al., 2003</xref>).

Dram1 is another p53 induced transcript involved in regulation of both autophagy and apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Crighton et al., 2006</xref>). DRAM1 appears to promote apoptosis in a number of physiological contexts at least in part by promoting lysosomal membrane permeabilization (LMP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Guan et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Laforge et al., 2013</xref>).

Sesn1 and Sesn2 were among the strongest downregulated targets in TFEB/TFE3 DKO MEFs in our RNA-Seq experiments.

Indeed, the etoposide induced expression of numerous DDR response genes, including Bbc3, Trp53inp1, Sesn1, Sesn2, Chek2, Rad9a, Foxo3, Mdm2, and Wrap53 were strongly downregulated in TFEB/TFE3 DKO RAW264.7 macrophages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>; numerical values <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig3s1sdata1">Figure 3-figure supplement 1-source data 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>TFE3 and TFEB help sustain p53 protein levels in response to DNA damage</title><p>One possible explanation for the reduced p53-dependent transcription observed in TFEB/TFE3 DKO cells is that TFE3 and TFEB play a role in p53 signaling in response to DNA damage. To test this hypothesis, we compared p53 activation and stabilization in WT vs TFEB/TFE3 DKO RAW264.7 cells. These cells were chosen because they exhibit a clear and highly reproducible p53 induction pattern in response to DNA damage. Additionally, SV40 immortalization of the MEFs used in this study can affect p53 stability, causing confounding effects. As expected, WT RAW264.7 exhibited a rapid and sustained increase in total p53 levels and levels of phosphorylation at serine 15. This was correlated with a concomitant increase in the protein levels of the p53 E3 ubiquitin ligase, Mdm2 starting at 2 hr etoposide treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A and B</xref>, see also Figure 9E). Like the WT cells, TFEB/TFE3 DKO RAW264.7 showed a rapid induction of total and phospho-serine 15 p53 until 2 hr etoposide treatment. At this point, total and phospho-serine 15 p53 levels declined at a steady state until they reached close to baseline levels by 8 hr etoposide treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A and B</xref>; numerical values <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig4sdata1">Figure 4—source data 1</xref>). Furthermore, the levels of Mdm2 were significantly higher in the TFEB/TFE3 DKO cells at 2 and 4 hr etoposide treatment, precisely when the levels of p53 begin to diverge between the two genotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A and C</xref>; numerical values <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig4sdata2">Figure 4—source data 2</xref>). These observations indicate that TFE3 and TFEB are dispensable for the initial activation and stabilization of p53, however their presence is required for a robust and sustained p53 response after prolonged DNA damage, possibly through suppression of Mdm2 protein levels. Given these data, we hypothesized that the presence of TFE3 and TFEB may extend the half-life of p53 under DNA damage conditions. To test this, p53 was induced in both WT and TFEB/TFE3 DKO RAW264.7 cells by treating cells for 2 hr with etoposide, followed by an 8 hr cycloheximide chase, also in the presence of etoposide. As seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D and E</xref>; numerical values <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig4sdata3">Figure 4—source data 3</xref>, p53 protein levels were elevated for a longer time in WT compared to DKO cells, consistent with our hypothesis. In order to test if the decrease in p53 half-life and protein levels observed in DKO cells after extended periods of DNA damage was due to elevated Mdm2 levels, we assessed p53 protein levels in both cell types after 8 hr treatment with etoposide in the presence and absence of the Mdm2 specific inhibitor, nutlin-3. Nutlin-3 treatment modestly increased the levels of p53 observed in WT RAW264.7 cells. In contrast, nutlin-3 drastically increased the levels of p53 in RAW264.7 TFEB/TFE3 DKO cells, bringing its levels on par with those observed in WT cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F and G</xref>; numerical values <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig4sdata4">Figure 4—source data 4</xref>).

HeLa cells were chosen to test this hypothesis due to their extremely low levels of basal p53 expression and their ability to robustly over-express high levels of exogenous protein through adenovirus transduction. Overexpression of the constitutively active forms of TFEB (TFEB-S211A) and TFE3 (TFE3-S321A) dramatically increased the basal levels of p53 observed in whole cell lysates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A and B</xref>; numerical values <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig5sdata1">Figure 5—source data 1</xref>). This elevation in p53 protein level was further increased in the presence of etoposide, suggesting a synergistic effect between activated TFE3 or TFEB in response to DNA damage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A and B</xref>). Under our experimental conditions, endogenous p53 is barely detectable under basal conditions in HeLa cells when assessed via immunofluorescence. However, expression of TFEB-S211A and TFE3-S321A led to a near uniform pattern of p53 expression, predominantly localized in the nuclei of HeLa cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). Given our data in RAW264.7 cells suggesting that loss of TFE3 and TFEB decreases p53 half-life, we performed a complimentary cycloheximide chase experiment to test if expression of TFEB-S211A and TFE3-S321A could increase the half-life of p53. The half-life of endogenous p53 is less than 15 min in HeLa cells under basal conditions. This was extended beyond 60 min in TFEB-S211A expressing cells and 30 min in TFE3-S321A expressing cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D and E</xref>; numerical values <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig5sdata2">Figure 5—source data 2</xref>).

The relatively stronger effect of TFEB-S211A on p53 levels compared to TFE3-S321 may be due to a somewhat higher nuclear localization and stability of the TFEB construct compared to the TFE3 construct.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.40856.021</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Expression of constitutively active TFEB and TFE3 in HeLa cells increases total p53 protein levels and its extends half-life.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Representative Western blot showing elevated p53 protein levels in adenovirus infected HeLa cells expressing constitutively active mutants of TFEB and TFE3.

We also expressed a nuclear localization mutated construct, TFEB-S211A/NLSmut. Transfection of HeLa cells with TFEB-S211A, but not TFEB-S211A/NLSmut increased basal p53 protein levels, despite similar expression levels of both constructs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>). This indicates that TFEB nuclear localization is required for p53 stabilization and this effect is therefore likely due to TFEB transcriptional activity. Immunofluorescence of HeLa cells expressing plasmid encoded TFEB-S211A shows a clear correlation between transfected cells and p53 nuclear accumulation, with untransfected cells exhibiting undetectable p53 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B</xref>).

LMP occurs when the integrity of the lysosomal limiting membrane is disrupted, allowing the release of lysosomal hydrolases into the cytosol and may result in either apoptosis or necrosis, depending on the nature and extent of the lysosomal permeabilizing stimulus and the cell type involved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Repnik et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Given that TFE3 and TFEB have been previously linked to apoptotic regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Martina et al., 2016</xref>) and that expression of Dram1 and Laptm5, two p53-induced genes implicated in LMP and apoptosis, is strongly downregulated in TFEB/TFE3 cells, we hypothesized that TFE3 and TFEB may exert some of their apoptotic activity through LMP. To measure LMP, we used an immunofluorescence galectin puncta assay which measures galectin-1 localization with LAMP1. Under normal conditions, galectin-1, a β-galactoside binding protein, is localized throughout the cytosol and nucleus. After LMP, galectin-1 can pass through the lysosomal limiting membrane and bind to the carbohydrate rich glycocalyx within the lysosomal lumen. In WT MEFs, etoposide treatment resulted in a time dependent increase in LMP, with most cells exhibiting significant LMP by 8 hr, while untreated MEFs exhibit extremely low levels of detectable LMP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A–D</xref>; numerical values <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig6sdata1">Figure 6—source datas 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig6sdata2">2</xref>).

Therefore, we decided to compare expression of DREAM targets between WT and TFEB/TFE3 DKO cells. As seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>, no major differences were observed in the expression of cell cycle regulators between WT and DKOs under control conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>). In contrast, 91% (240 out of 262) of the genes regulated by the DREAM pathway showed a much more significant downregulation in TFEB/TFE3 DKO than in WT cells following etoposide treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>). These results indicate that the DREAM complex remains hyperactive in TFEB/TFE3-depleted cells in response to genotoxic stress.</p><p>The hyperactivation of the DREAM complex may be a consequence of the inability of the TFEB/TFE3 DKO cells to induce apoptosis in response to prolonged DNA damage. Alternatively, TFEB and TFE3 might have a more direct role in the regulation of cell cycle checkpoints in response to stress. We have previously performed ChIP-seq analysis for TFE3 in RAW 264.7 cells subjected to different stress conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Pastore et al., 2016</xref>). To investigate whether TFEB and TFE3 may have a direct role in cell cycle regulation, we reanalyzed our data in search for key cell cycle regulators which expression might be directly regulated by these transcription factors. Interestingly, we observed increased TFE3 binding to the promoter of CDK4 and CDK7 following TFE3 activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A</xref>). CDK4 plays a critical role in Rb inactivation and disassembly of the DREAM complex, while CDK7 functions as a CDK-activating kinase (CAK) by directly phosphorylating several of the CDKs and directly controlling cell-cycle progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Guiley et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Malumbres, 2014</xref>). To confirm that TFEB/TFE3 regulate CDK4 and CDK7 expression, we expressed constitutive active versions of TFEB and TFE3 in HeLa cells. As seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B–C</xref>; numerical values <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig9sdata1">Figure 9—source datas 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig9sdata2">2</xref>, over-expression of either TFEB or TFE3 resulted in a significant increase in CDK4 and CDK7 mRNA and protein levels. Furthermore, phosphorylation of Rb, a CDK4 target, was significantly reduced in TFEB/TEF3 DKO cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9D–F</xref>; numerical values <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig9sdata3">Figure 9—source data 3</xref>). We also observed reduced RBL2 phosphorylation in TFEB/TFE3-depleted cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9D</xref>). It has been recently described that phosphorylation of RBL2 by CDK4 is critical to weaken the activity of the DREAM complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Guiley et al., 2015</xref>), offering a possible explanation for the observed hyperactivation of the DREAM complex in TFEB/TFE3 DKOs. Therefore, these results suggest that TFEB and TFE3 may have an important and previously unrecognized role in the regulation of the cell cycle checkpoints.</p><fig id="fig9" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.40856.034</object-id><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><title>TFEB and TFE3 promote expression of cell cycle regulators.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Profiles of Chip-seq analysis for TFE3 in CDK4 and CDK7 promoters in RAW264.7 cells under stress condition.

However, recent studies have revealed new roles for these transcription factors in the control of a number of diverse biological functions, including the inflammatory process, the unfolded protein response and metabolic regulation. These different functions are often cell type or tissue specific and constitute a response to a variety of physiological stressors. Additionally, there is ample evidence that TFEB and TFE3 directly upregulate the expression of other transcription factors and co-activators involved in stress responsive pathways, such as ATF4 in ER stress and Pgc1a in metabolic stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Martina et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Settembre et al., 2013</xref>). Similarly, the tumor suppressor p53 represents a master transcriptional regulator of the DNA damage response which promotes cell-cycle arrest, DNA repair, and ultimately apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bunz et al., 1998</xref>). Much like TFEB and TFE3, p53 has also been implicated in a number of additional biological processes, including autophagy, angiogenesis, metabolism, and cell migration in response to different stress conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bieging and Attardi, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Tasdemir et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Zhang et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>In this study, we present a two-part model in which p53 and TFE3/TFEB regulate each other’s functions during different phases of the DNA damage response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>). After DNA damage events, p53 is rapidly activated to promote the transcription of numerous downstream targets involved in DNA repair, cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. Some of these targets of p53 transcription, including Sesn1 and Sesn2, inhibit mTORC1 signaling. We propose that in response to DNA damage, p53 activates TFEB and TFE3 through its inhibitory effects on mTORC1 activity. This p53-dependent activation of TFEB and TFE3 further enhances p53 signaling through both feedback and feedforward mechanisms. TFEB and TFE3 activation results in increased p53 stabilization and protein levels, resulting in enhanced expression of a number of transcripts involved in the DNA damage response. We hypothesize that when successful DNA repaired is achieved, activation of TFEB and TFE3 might contribute to cell survival, for example by promoting autophagy and re-initiation of the cell cycle. However, under conditions of prolonged DNA damage, like the ones presented in this study, TFEB and TFE3 ultimately facilitate apoptosis. TFEB/TFE3-mediated upregulation of Dram1, Laptm5 and other regulators of lysosome stability results in increased LMP. This LMP, combined with other pro-apoptotic targets of both p53 and TFEB/TFE3, such as Bbc3, and Bax, ultimately results in apoptotic cell death. In cells lacking TFEB and TFE3, the inability to induce efficient apoptosis in response to prolonged DNA damage results in the hyper-repression of multiple genes implicated in cell cycle and proliferation, a circumstance that may direct cells to senescence or quiescence and have important implications in cellular transformation.</p><fig id="fig10" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.40856.038</object-id><label>Figure 10.</label><caption><title>Schematic representation of a novel p53-mTORC1-TFEB/TFE3 pathway activated by DNA damage stress.</title><p>Following DNA damage stress, p53 rapidly promotes the transcription of numerous downstream targets involved in DNA repair, cell cycle arrest and apoptosis.

This p53-dependent activation of TFEB and TFE3 results in enhanced p53 signaling.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-40856-fig10-v2.tif"/></fig><p>The contribution of TFEB and TFE3 to cancer is probably complex and context dependent. It has long been documented that multiple translocation events, resulting in five described TFE3 gene-fusion products and one TFEB gene fusion product, result in renal cell carcinoma (RCC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kauffman et al., 2014</xref>). The manner in which these gene fusions promote oncogenesis is poorly understood, but it is thought that TFE3 and TFEB gene fusion products may upregulate oncogenic pathways already active in the cell such as the Wnt-beta-catenin and mTORC1 pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Calcagnì et al., 2016</xref>). This is because the fusion products maintain the DNA binding bHLH-LZ zipper domains of TFE3 and TFEB, but are under the transcriptional control of new, stronger promoters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kauffman et al., 2014</xref>). Alternatively, these fusion products may act as loss of function mutations or may otherwise possess some novel transforming activity owing to their altered conformations. One TFE3 fusion, PSF-TFE3, has been reported to sequester both wild type TFE3 and p53 out of the nucleus, resulting in loss of both TFE3 and p53 transcriptional activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Mathur et al., 2003</xref>). We attempted to detect an interaction between TFE3 and p53 using various immunoprecipitation protocols but were unable to do so with endogenous proteins (data not shown).</p><p>Our data suggest that TFEB and TFE3 might have a more direct role in cell cycle regulation than previously anticipated. It has been reported that TFE3 over-expression allows cells to escape from Rb-induced cell cycle arrest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Nijman et al., 2006</xref>). In addition, depletion of TFEB reduces proliferation of pancreatic and prostate cancer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Blessing et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Perera et al., 2015</xref>), further suggesting that these transcription factors function as oncogenes. In agreement with these studies, we found that the Rb and DREAM pathways remain hyperactive in TFEB/TFE3-depleted cells, resulting in reduced expression of multiple genes implicated in cell cycle progression. Importantly, our observations that TFEB and TFE3 directly regulate expression of CDK4 and CDK7 provides mechanistic insight to understand how over-expression of these transcription factors may result in cell cycle progression and abnormal proliferation.</p><p>At the same time, one can envision situations in which TFEB and TFE3 act as antioncogenes. For example, deficient TFEB and TFE3 activation in response to genotoxic stress may lead to an abnormal and inefficient p53 response, facilitating the accumulation of damaged cells. In addition, the inability to induce p53-dependent apoptosis and the sustained cell cycle arrest in response to prolonged stress may facilitate the induction of senescence, a condition that has been linked to metastasis and therapy resistance due to the ability of senescence cells to secrete interleukins and matrix metalloproteinases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gonzalez-Meljem et al., 2018</xref>). Therefore, we propose that TFEB and TFE3 are important contributors to the fine-tune balance between cell cycle arrest/repair/survival, apoptosis, and senescence/quiescence pathways.</p><p>In summary, our data suggest a model in which TFEB/TFE3 and p53 mutually reinforce each other’s transcriptional signaling functions and offers further evidence that disrupting TFEB and TFE3 can result in diminished p53 signaling capacity, with wide-ranging implications for renal cell carcinomas and other cancers. Future studies investigating the p53-dependent transcriptome in renal cell carcinomas caused by TFEB and TFE3 gene fusions may yield important insights for future therapeutic interventions.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Reagent <break/>type (species) <break/>or resource</th><th valign="top">Designation</th><th valign="top">Source <break/>or reference</th><th valign="top">Identifiers</th><th valign="top">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Cell line <break/>(Mus musculus)</td><td valign="top">MEF</td><td valign="top">ATCC</td><td valign="top">Cat. #: CRL-2977</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Cell line <break/>(Mus musculus)</td><td valign="top">MEF p53-/-</td><td valign="top">MEF p53-/-</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">David J.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Kevin Struhl as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The transcription factors TFEB and TFE3 have been well characterized for their functions in regulating the autophagy-lysosome pathway. In this manuscript, Brady and colleagues reported a role of TFEB/TFE3 in DNA-damage response (DDR). They found that TFE3 and TFEB are activated by DNA damage in a p53-mediated mTORC1 inhibition dependent manner. The activated TFEB/TFE3 in turn promotes the stabilization of p53, thus amplifying p53 signaling in DDR. TFEB/TFE3 double KO (DKO) cells show alterations in the DNA damage response. In TFEB/TFE3 DKO cells, genes involved in lysosome membrane permeabilization (LMP) and apoptosis are dysregulated. Prolonged DNA damage causes impaired LMP and apoptosis induction in DKO cells. Finally, the authors demonstrated a previously unrecognized role of TFEB and TFE3 in the regulation of cell cycle checkpoints in response to DNA damage. In general, this is an interesting paper and most of the experiments are convincingly performed. However, several important questions remain to be addressed to establish the role of TFEB/TFE3 in p53-dependent transcriptional program.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The authors switched cell types throughout the manuscript. It is unknown whether the conclusion obtained in one cell line can be applied to other cell lines. Some experiments should be performed in multiple cell lines. For instance, in Figure 1, they should show all read-outs (IF and Western blot) with all forms of DNA damage (etoposide, doxorubicin, UV, etc.) in all cell types (RAW cells, MEFs, etc.). Expression of the genes reported in Figure 3 should also be performed in RAW264.7 cells or HeLa cells.</p><p>2) The dependence of mTORC1 inhibition for TFEB/TFE3 nuclear translocation following DNA damage should be experimentally tested. This can be done in cells in which mTORC1 is constitutively active.</p><p>3) The authors claim that TFEB/TFE3 regulate cell cycle. In light of this claim, the authors need to be careful that the cause of all the other differences they see in TFEB/TFE3 DKO cells is not due to cell cycle changes. For instance, all of the gene expression changes from their RNA-seq reflected in Figure 3 could easily be due to the cells just being in a different phase of the cell cycle. This applies throughout the manuscript. Please address this concern.</p><p>4) The authors examined immunofluorescence images and found an increase in the levels of TFE3 in the nucleus relative to the cytosol in response to genotoxic stress. Cellular fractionation assays should be performed to determine protein levels of nuclear-localized TFE3 and TFEB in response to DNA damage.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.40856.048</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The authors switched cell types throughout the manuscript.

This included Rad9a, Chek2, Trp53inp1, Mdm2, Bbc3, Sesn1, Sesn2, Dram1, Cdkn1a, Laptm5, Ctsd, Wrap53, and Foxo3. To further corroborate these results, we have now performed qRT-PCR in untreated and etoposide treated WT and TFEB/TFE3 DKO RAW264.7 cells, confirming reduced expression of multiple p53 targets in TFEB/TFE3 DKO RAW264.7 cells (Figure 3—figure supplement 1).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The dependence of mTORC1 inhibition for TFEB/TFE3 nuclear translocation following DNA damage should be experimentally tested.

For this, we transfected ARPE-19 cells with a constitutive active version of Rag GTPases, in which RagB and RagD are locked in their GTP-bound and GDP-bound states, respectively, thus becoming insensitive to mTORC1 inactivation by the p53-sestrin-GATOR1 axis. As expected, expression of active Rags, and consequent constitutive mTORC1 activation, prevented translocation of endogenous TFE3 to the nucleus following etoposide treatment. These data corroborate that mTORC1 inactivation is required for TFE3 activation in response to DNA damage. These results are now shown in Figure 2G and 2H.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The authors claim that TFEB/TFE3 regulate cell cycle.

For instance, all of the gene expression changes from their RNA-seq reflected in Figure 3 could easily be due to the cells just being in a different phase of the cell cycle. This applies throughout the manuscript. Please address this concern.</p></disp-quote><p>In order to address the reviewers’ concern, we compared the proliferation rate of WT and TFEB/TFE3-depleted cells in stationary state. For this we used the Click-iT Plus EdU Proliferation Kit (Thermo Fisher) and analyzed the cells by flow cytometry. As seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref>, we did not observe differences in cell cycle progression between WT and TFEB/TFE3 DKO cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1A</xref>). Quantification of three independent experiments revealed that similar percentages of cells were found in G0/G1, S, and G<sub>2</sub>/M phase in both cell types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1B</xref>). Therefore, these results suggest that the different behavior of TFEB/TFE3 DKO cells in response to DNA damage is not due to cell cycle alterations.</p><fig id="respfig1"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Analysis of cell cycle in WT and TFEB/TFE3 DKO RAW 264.7 cells.</title><p>A.WT and TFE3/TFEB DKO Raw264.7 cells were treated with 10 μM EdU for 2 hours, DNA contents were detected with Alexa Flour 488 fluorescence by flow cytometry according to the recommended staining protocol.

Note that there are not significant differences in the expression of cell cycle genes between the two cell types in untreated cells, again arguing against “constitutive” alterations in cell cycle regulation in DKOs. It is only when we treat cells with etoposide for 8h that we detect significant differences between WT and TFEB/TFE3-depleted cells (Figure 8).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The authors examined immunofluorescence images and found an increase in the levels of TFE3 in the nucleus relative to the cytosol in response to genotoxic stress. Cellular fractionation assays should be performed to determine protein levels of nuclear-localized TFE3 and TFEB in response to DNA damage.</p></disp-quote><p>As requested by the reviewers, we have now performed subcellular fractionation in MEFs treated with either etoposide or cisplatin. As seen in Figure 1D and Figure 1—figure supplement 1H, we observed a very clear increase in the amount of nuclear TFEB and TFE3 following genotoxic stress.</p></body></sub-article></article>
