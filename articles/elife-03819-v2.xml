We used optical recording of Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx through TRPV1 to measure activity and mobility of single TRPV1 molecules in isolated dorsal root ganglion neurons and cell lines. The opening of single TRPV1 channels produced sparklets, representing localized regions of elevated Ca<sup>2+</sup>. Unlike sparklets reported for L-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels, TRPV4 channels, and AchR channels, TRPV1 channels diffused laterally in the plasma membrane as they gated. Mobility was highly variable from channel-to-channel and, to a smaller extent, from cell to cell. Most surprisingly, we found that mobility decreased upon channel activation by capsaicin, but only in the presence of extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup>. We propose that decreased mobility of open TRPV1 could act as a diffusion trap to concentrate channels in cell regions with high activity.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.03819.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.03819.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.03819.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Cells rely on proteins called receptors to keep them informed about what is going on around them. These receptors, which are embedded in the surface of the cell, detect and respond to specific chemical signals. It is known that receptors move around the cell surface as they search for particular chemical signals, but these movements have not been widely studied in experiments.</p><p>Senning and Gordon have now investigated the movements of receptors called TRPV1 channels that can detect a chemical called capsaicin. This receptor contains an ion channel that is usually closed. However, when the receptor is activated this channel opens and allows calcium ions to enter the cell.</p><p>In the experiments the receptors were tagged with a fluorescent marker, and a fluorescent calcium dye was used to indicate when the channel had been activated by capsaicin. This allowed the function of the receptors to be followed in real time. The experiments were performed on nerve cells taken from mice and in cell culture lines derived from neurons and kidney cells.</p><p>Senning and Gordon showed that at first the receptors moved around freely on the surface of the cell, with the degree of mobility varying from cell to cell and also from receptor to receptor. However, when a receptor detected a capsaicin molecule and opened, it tended to move more slowly when calcium ions were present outside the cells.</p><p>Further research is needed to explore the mechanism that prevents the receptor from moving. However, since calcium ions are involved in a wide range of processes in the nervous system, it is thought that this mechanism ensures that the receptors concentrate in regions of high neuronal activity.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.03819.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.03819.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>calcium signaling</kwd><kwd>diffusion</kwd><kwd>mobility</kwd><kwd>gating</kwd><kwd>TRPV1</kwd><kwd>sparklet</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd><kwd>Rat</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000053</institution-id><institution>National Eye Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01EY017564</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gordon</surname><given-names>Sharona E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01GM100718</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gordon</surname><given-names>Sharona E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>T32HL007312</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Senning</surname><given-names>Eric N</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Channel activity is a novel regulatory mechanism for channel mobility in the plasma membrane.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The transient receptor potential vanilloid type 1 (TRPV1) ion channel expressed in peripheral sensory neurons may be one of the most heavily regulated ion channels known. Its gating is multimodal, regulated by extracellular protons, phosphorylation by PKC, phosphorylation by PKA, temperature, fatty acids such as lysophosphatidic acid and anandamide, phosphoinositide signaling lipids, eicosanoids, and capsaicin, the pungent extract of hot chili peppers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Caterina et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Zygmunt et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Premkumar and Ahern, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bhave et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hu et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Pomonis et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Klein et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Ufret-Vincenty et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Nieto-Posadas et al., 2012</xref>). Furthermore, it is also subject to indirect regulation by G-protein coupled receptors and intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> and its trafficking can be regulated by receptor tyrosine kinases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chuang et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Zhang et al., 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Stein et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>TRPV1 channels are highly permeable to Ca<sup>2+</sup>, with P<sub>Na</sub>:P<sub>Ca</sub> estimated to be at least 1:10 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Caterina et al., 1997</xref>). Indeed, Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging at the whole-cell level was used in the seminal <italic>tour-de-force</italic> that first identified TRPV1 as the capsaicin-activated ion channel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Caterina et al., 1997</xref>). The high permeability of TRPV1 to Ca<sup>2+</sup> has also been a useful tool in high-throughput screening of regulatory compounds and led to the identification of a family of toxins, first purified from spiders, that act as potent activators of TRPV1 (and have enhanced the survival of the spiders) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Caterina et al., 1997</xref>). In addition, Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx through TRPV1 desensitizes sensory neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cholewinski et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Koplas et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Rosenbaum et al., 2004</xref>). Although multiple pathways are likely involved in neuronal desensitization, depletion of the signaling lipid phosphoinositide 4,5-bisphosphate (PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>) via Ca<sup>2+</sup>-mediated activation of phospholipase C appears to contribute to desensitization of TRPV1 during periods of high channel activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Stein et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lukacs et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>Optical recording of localized Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx through plasma membrane ion channels can be achieved using a combination of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-sensitive fluorescent dyes and non-fluorescent Ca<sup>2+</sup> chelators loaded into cells via a whole-cell patch pipette. When Ca<sup>2+</sup>-permeable channels open, localized Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx produces a fluorescent ‘sparklet’ in the cytosol proximal to the active channel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Wang et al., 2001</xref>). The presence of the nonfluorescent Ca<sup>2+</sup> chelator in the cell acts as a sink for the excess Ca<sup>2+</sup>, enhancing the localization of the source of the influx (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Navedo et al., 2005</xref>). Optical approaches have been used to record the activity of L-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels in urinary bladder smooth muscle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Sidaway and Teramoto, 2014</xref>), arterial smooth muscle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Navedo et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Amberg et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Navedo et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Tajada et al., 2013</xref>), ventricular myocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Wang et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Zhou et al., 2009</xref>), and mammalian cell lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gulia et al., 2013</xref>). More recently, sparklets due to TRPV4 channels have been reported in arterial smooth muscle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Mercado et al., 2014</xref>) and vascular endothelium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bagher et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Sonkusare et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Two aspects of sparklets reported from L-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels and TRPV4 channels are remarkable. First, multiple channels were typically clustered at the sparklet sites. Second, the sparklets remained stationary throughout the observation period. Thus, some mechanism(s) for clustering channels must be operating in these cells. Whether the clustering mechanism(s) and the mechanism(s) eliminating diffusion of the clusters are related is unknown. Most importantly, whether any Ca<sup>2+</sup>-permeable channels have the capability to gate (open and close) as they diffuse laterally in the plasma membrane of a cell has not previously been addressed. It should be noted that the muscle nicotinic aceytylcholine receptors (AChR) expressed in <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocytes have also been studied by optical recording, and the fluorescence signals emanating from these channels did not indicate channel clustering at the fluorescence sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Demuro and Parker, 2005</xref>). Nevertheless, the authors did find that all fluorescence Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals from AChR maintained a constant position for the duration of the optical recordings.</p><p>Regulation of mobility in the plasma membrane has been identified as a key element in signaling for the Orai family of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-release activated channels (CRAC). Orai channels diffuse throughout the plasma membrane in resting cells, but in response to the emptying of Ca<sup>2+</sup> from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) they cluster at sites in the surface membrane that juxtapose to the ER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lioudyno et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Penna et al., 2008</xref>). The interaction of Orai channels with the ER-resident protein STIM1 reduces Orai mobility, acting as a sort of diffusion trap to localize Orai channels to these sites as well as directly gating Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx through the Orai pore (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Yeromin et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Zhang et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Wu et al., 2014</xref>). Although the diffusion trap mechanism has not yet been proposed for other types of ion channels, the addition of regulated mobility to a cell's toolkit for controlling its functions represents a powerful means of increasing the spatial and temporal specificity of cell signaling.</p><p>In the present study we asked whether the mobility of TRPV1 might be regulated and whether any such regulation might be coupled to channel activity. We took advantage of the high Ca<sup>2+</sup> permeability of TRPV1 to record Ca<sup>2+</sup> sparklets that reflected the influx of Ca<sup>2+</sup> through open TRPV1 channels in response to capsaicin in isolated mouse dorsal root ganglion neurons and in immortalized mammalian cell lines. Whole-cell voltage clamp was used to both minimize the signal due to voltage-gated Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels and to introduce a combination of fluorescent and nonfluorescent Ca<sup>2+</sup> chelators. In contrast to L-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels, TRPV4 channels and AChR previously studied, Ca<sup>2+</sup> sparklets from TRPV1 channels in isolated dorsal root ganglion neurons and cultured cell lines were observed with a wide spectrum of mobilities, from immobile to near the diffusion coefficient of a lipid moving through a bilayer. To our knowledge, the opening and closing of a channel as it diffuses through the plasma membrane has not been previously observed. Using TRPV1 fused to GFP expressed in HEK293T/17 cells, we established that each sparklet represented the activity of one and only one TRPV1 channel. Remarkably, we found that the mobility of TRPV1, whether measured using sparklets or by tracking GFP-fused channels, decreased with activity in an extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent manner. We propose that activity-dependent regulation of TRPV1 mobility could, like for Orai, lead to clustering of channels in regions of the cell where they are most needed.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>The intricate regulation of TRPV1 <italic>activity</italic> prompted us to examine whether TRPV1 <italic>mobility</italic> would also be subject to regulation. This question arose, in part, from the recognition that the many signals converging on TRPV1-expressing sensory neurons would be distributed heterogeneously across the cells' receptive fields. In addition, new data from other channels indicates that mobility can be a powerful means by which cell function can be regulated. To examine this question, however, required implementation of new approaches that would allow activity and mobility to be measured in the same preparation and in primary sensory neurons.</p><sec id="s2-1"><title>Capsaicin-activated sparklets in isolated dorsal root ganglion neurons</title><p>To determine the activity of individual TRPV1 channels, we used whole-cell patch clamp of isolated mouse dorsal root ganglion neurons. TRPV1-expressing nociceptors were easily distinguished as the small-diameter (∼50 µm) cells in a 12–24 hr culture. As previously shown, these cells have large, capsaicin-activated currents when studied with whole-cell patch clamp as well as when studied using inside-out patch clamp (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Stein et al., 2006</xref>). The fluorescent Ca<sup>2+</sup> indicator Fluo-4 (200 μM) and the nonfluorescent Ca<sup>2+</sup> chelator EGTA (10 mM) were included in the patch pipette, and cells were held at a potential of −40 mV. This potential was chosen empirically as the potential that minimized Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx in the absence of capsaicin. In addition to the EGTA included in the intracellular pipette solution, 1 μM thapsigargin was included in the bath solution to deplete the endoplasmic reticulum Ca<sup>2+</sup> stores (see ‘Materials and methods’). These solutions allowed us to attribute the capsaicin-induced rise in intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> to influx through TRPV1 channels in the plasma membrane.</p><p>Very little fluorescence was observed upon dialysis of Fluo-4/ EGTA solution into the isolated dorsal root ganglion neurons via the patch pipette. However, subsequent perfusion of 100 nM capsaicin into the bath generated localized bursts of fluorescence, termed sparklets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="other" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>). Sparklets were observed with physiological concentrations of extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> (2 mM). Out of 12 cells that responded to capsaicin and showed a rise in global fluorescence due to Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx, nine cells had easily distinguished local micro-domains of Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx that we classified as sparklets.<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.03819.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Capsaicin induced sparklets in whole-cell voltage clamped dorsal root ganglion cells loaded with Fluo-4.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Images of immobile sparklet (white circle) in dorsal root ganglion cell at time points when inactive (1) and active (2) with corresponding intensity trace below (see <xref ref-type="other" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>).

Examining the dose–response relation for activation by capsaicin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>) shows that the current recorded in the presence of 100 nM capsaicin normalized to the current at a saturating capsaicin concentration was 0.84 ± 0.05 (n = 4). This fractional activation value is slightly greater than the open probability values plotted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, for which the mean was 0.7 ± 0.1 (N = 5). This small discrepancy is expected, because the open probability of TRPV1 in the presence of a saturating capsaicin concentration is somewhat less than 1.0 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Liu et al., 2004</xref>). These data indicate that the sensitivity of single TRPV1 channels as calculated from optical recordings of sparklets is similar to that of the cell population measured using whole-cell patch clamp.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Sparklets are dynamic, moving laterally in the membrane</title><p>The fluorescence intensity of the sparklet shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> was straight forward to quantify because it was immobile, that is it did not move.

To determine the mechanisms involved in controlling TRPV1 mobility we measured the sparklet trajectories, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, inset. Two factors, however, limited our ability to fully characterize these trajectories. The first factor, which is a general limitation of our approach in any cell type, was that our sparklet recording time was limited by the properties of the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-sensitive dye used. We required a dye sensitive enough to show the Ca<sup>2+</sup> flux through just a single channel. The appearance of individual sparklets when capsaicin was added became difficult to discern over time as the fluorescence across the cell footprint increased. The increase in fluorescence ‘background’ was due to the rapid, global increase in intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> that occurs over the course of our experiments. Although the Ca<sup>2+</sup> chelator EGTA (10 mM) in our intracellular solution extended the useful recording time by acting as a Ca<sup>2+</sup> sink, a rise in global Ca<sup>2+</sup> due to continued influx of Ca<sup>2+</sup> through TRPV1 ultimately obscured the sparklet signals once intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels exceeded the upper limit of the Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensitive dye's optimal range (Fluo-4: 1 μM Ca<sup>2+</sup>; Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA).</p><p>The second factor limiting our interpretation of sparklet activity in dorsal root ganglion neurons are the tube-like structures prevalent within the footprint of isolated neurons that brightened markedly when capsaicin was added. These tube-like structures were observed even when the SERCA inhibitor thapsigargin was present (<xref ref-type="other" rid="video3">Video 3</xref>), indicating that they are likely neurite-like processes underneath the cell footprint, rather than endoplasmic reticulum within the cell body. The processes hampered further characterization of capsaicin-activated sparklet activity in isolated dorsal root ganglion cells because in the confined space of the processes, global Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels dominate sparklet signals very rapidly (<xref ref-type="other" rid="video3">Video 3</xref>). We attempted to circumvent this issue by conducting experiments very soon after cell isolation, before processes could form. However, cells studied soon after isolation, before significant processes had formed, showed footprints that were irregularly-adhered to the coverglass, and thus were not evenly within the evanescent TIRF field. Transient transfection of TRPV1 into the F11 cell line, a hybridoma formed between dorsal root ganglion cells and neuroblastoma cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Stein et al., 2006</xref>), were examined as an alternative to primary cell culture. In experiments using the F11 line with the channel expressed as a fluorescent fusion protein, TRPV1-tagRFP, we did observe moving sparklets (<xref ref-type="other" rid="video4">Video 4</xref>). However, processes running under the footprint of F11 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="other" rid="video5">Video 5</xref>) interfered with sparklet characterization as they did in isolated dorsal root ganglion neurons. To study sparklet mobility we therefore turned to expressing tagRFP- and GFP-tagged TRPV1 (TRPV1-tagRFP and TRPV1-GFP) in transiently transfected HEK293T/17 cells, in which the neurite-like processes were not observed.<media content-type="glencoe play-in-place height-250 width-310" id="video4" mime-subtype="mov" mimetype="video" xlink:href="elife-03819-media4-v2.mov"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.03819.010</object-id><label>Video 4.</label><caption><title>Immobile and mobile sparklets in TRPV1-tagRFP transfected F11 cell after addition of capsaicin (100 nM).</title><p>Arrow indicates the site where a moving sparklet appears in a process at 7.75 s.

For these experiments we used Fluo-5F (200 μM) together with 10 mM EGTA in the pipette solution and 20 mM Ca<sup>2+</sup> in the extracellular buffer to closely mimic the experiments of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Navedo et al. (2005)</xref>, who report on immobile sparklets from L-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels (see ‘Materials and methods’). Interestingly, the amplitude of fluorescence intensity in the sparklets was comparable in isolated dorsal root ganglion neurons and HEK293T/17 cells (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref> to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). However, differences in the dye (Fluo-5F vs Fluo-4) and extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentrations (20 mM vs 2 mM) make it difficult to draw any conclusions from this similarity. The open probability for sparklets in HEK293T/17 cells was significantly less than for sparklets in isolated dorsal root ganglion neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). This difference is consistent with the higher K<sub>1/2</sub> for activation of TRPV1 expressed in HEK293T/17 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Collins and Gordon, 2013</xref>). Interestingly, capsaicin-independent increases in local Ca<sup>2+</sup> were observed in untransfected as well as TRPV1-transfected HEK293T/17 cells. These could be easily distinguished from sparklets due to TRPV1 as their open times were very brief and their amplitude was spikey (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>), rather than showing two states like TRPV1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B,C</xref>).

TRPV1 is a homomeric tetramer structurally similar to the voltage-gated superfamily of ion channels that includes voltage-gated K<sup>+</sup> channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Liao et al., 2013</xref>). Each TRPV1-GFP channel should thus have four copies of GFP per functional channel. If each fluorescent spot represents one TRPV1-GFP channel, four photobleaching steps should be observed. However, if each spot represents several TRPV1-GFP channels, &gt;4 photobleaching steps should be observed. Because measuring the GFP fluorescence intensity of mobile TRPV1 channels proved difficult, paraformaldehyde-fixed cells were used in these photobleaching experiments.</p><p>As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, using a high-intensity laser to image the fluorescence from individual TRPV1-GFP features produced sudden decreases in fluorescence intensity, each of which is presumed to represent photobleaching of a single GFP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Ulbrich and Isacoff, 2007</xref>).

We used circles representing the size of the uncertainty (1/10<sup>th</sup> scale) to indicate both which points were observed as sparklets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>, cyan circles) and which as GFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>, red circles). The uncertainty for all the points (GFP and sparklet) ranged from 0.13 μm to 0.33 μm, allowing us to determine the positions of the fluorescent feature along the full track length. Two interpretations of these data stand out. First, the co-localization between TRPV1-GFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>, red circles) and the Ca<sup>2+</sup> sparklets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>, cyan circles) confirmed that mobile sparklets co-diffuse with mobile TRPV1-GFP channels. Second, the higher fluorescence intensity of sparklets compared to TRPV1-GFP did not impede our ability to localize sparklets as compared to TRPV1-GFP. The simplest interpretation of our data is that sparklets represent Ca<sup>2+</sup> flux through the labeled TRPV1-GFP as it gates. The mobility of actively gating TRPV1 is somewhat surprising, as Ca<sup>2+</sup> sparklets from TRPV4 were previously reported to be immobile (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Mercado et al., 2014</xref>) as have sparklets attributed to L-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Navedo et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Navedo et al., 2006</xref>) and AchR channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Demuro and Parker, 2005</xref>). In addition, in a search of the literature we did not find any reports of simultaneous observations of ion channel activity and mobility in living cells. However, the mobility of capsaicin-activated TRPV1 sparklets in three different cell types (isolated dorsal root ganglion neurons, F11 cells, and HEK293T/17 cells) raises the question of whether the mobility of other types of active channels should be reexamined.</p></sec><sec id="s2-9"><title>Interplay between TRPV1 mobility and function</title><p>Does the heterogeneity of effective diffusion coefficients measured for the population of TRPV1-GFP reflect a functional heterogeneity of the channels?

Regulation of channel mobility by its activity was accessible because: 1) experiments were not truncated by saturation of a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-sensitive dye; 2) the recording of hundreds of channels per cell was possible when tracking mobility with GFP, whereas a much lower channel density was necessary for studying sparklets, 3) the HEK293T/17 cells were not voltage-clamped, allowing higher throughput imaging; and, most importantly, 4) unlike the Ca<sup>2+</sup> dyes used to image sparklets, the fluorophore used for tracking the channels, GFP, could be imaged even when the channels were closed and even in the absence of extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup>. The differences in experimental conditions between these experiments and those in which we measured the mobility of sparklets raised the question of whether an activity-dependent decrease in mobility would be observed for capsaicin-activated sparklets.</p></sec><sec id="s2-10"><title>Sparklet mobility decreases over time</title><p>Sparklets could be imaged only when channels were open and conditions were permissive of Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx. Thus, the mobility of sparklets due to TRPV1 could not be measured before the addition of capsaicin to the bath. We therefore designed experiments to look at the trend in mobility for individual sparklets that took advantage of the relatively slow perfusion time of our chamber (estimated flow of five-times chamber volume in 30 s) using voltage-clamped HEK293T/17 cells as described in ‘Materials and methods’. The open probability of the channels would be expected to increase from near zero in the absence of capsaicin to ∼0.3–0.4 when the bath solution had equilibrated. By measuring the time dependence of mobility under these conditions, we accumulated a set of trajectories on mobile and active TRPV1-GFP or TRPV1-tagRFP channels in which the concentration of capsaicin, and thus their open probability, increased over time. Our hypothesis predicts that the mobility of these sparklets will decrease over the course of the experiment.</p><p>We found that 13 out of 16 sparklets analyzed during a period when they remained open and observable showed a capsaicin-dependent decrease in mobility (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>).

The red, blue, and green segments of the track represent the location of the sparklet during three consecutive epochs of equal duration. The first, red epoch was one of high mobility.

A fluorescent Ca<sup>2+</sup> indicator (Fluo-4 or Fluo-5F) was introduced, along with the nonfluorescent Ca<sup>2+</sup> chelater EGTA, into cells via a patch pipette, which also served to clamp the voltage at a potential empirically determined to minimize Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx in the absence of capsaicin. Capsaicin and extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> were required for sparklet formation in isolated dorsal root ganglion neurons and HEK293T/17 cells transiently transfected with TRPV1-tagRFP. TRPV1 sparklets are a new tool to address critical gaps in our knowledge concerning the function of TRPV1 in its native plasma membrane environment and opens the door to further exploration into how plasma membrane dynamics and cell signaling regulate TRPV1 function.</p><p>Synchronous recording of localization and activity of native TRPV1 channels in isolated dorsal root ganglion neurons and of TRPV1-GFP or TRPV1-tagRFP channels in transiently-transfected HEK293T/17 cells revealed a surprising range of mobilities in the plasma membrane. Like the L-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Navedo et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Navedo et al., 2006</xref>), AchR channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Demuro and Parker, 2005</xref>), and TRPV4 channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Mercado et al., 2014</xref>) discussed above, some sparklets were immobile, whereas others diffused at a rate comparable to that expected for an individual lipid (∼1 µm<sup>2</sup>/s) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Golebiewska et al., 2008</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1 fig2 fig5 fig7">Figures 1, 2, 5 and 7</xref>). To our knowledge, gating of channels as they diffuse in the plasma membrane has not been previously reported, although synchronous gating and diffusion may well represent the ‘natural’ behavior of many channels and transporters.</p><p>We combined our studies of capsaicin-induced sparklets in isolated dorsal root ganglion neurons and transiently-transfected HEK293T/17 cells with imaging studies of TRPV1-GFP in HEK293T/17 cells to determine the number of TRPV1 channels underlying the sparklets. Sparklets have been used previously by Navedo et al. to report on the gating of L-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels as single channels or in clusters of up to seven channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Navedo et al., 2005</xref>), or assemblies of TRPV4 channels in arterial myocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Mercado et al., 2014</xref>). The immobile TRPV1-tagRFP sparklets allowed us to measure the fluorescence intensity of capsaicin-induced sparklets and determine the number of channels at each sparklet site. The two-state fluorescence signature of the TRPV1-tagRFP sparklets could arise from single-channel openings or from multiple channels at each sparklet site with very high gating cooperativity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Analysis of the photobleaching steps attributed to TRPV1-GFP channels in fixed HEK293T/17 cells provided further confirmation that the channel assembles as a tetramer of TRPV1-GFP subunits without forming higher order oligomeric assemblies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Importantly, laterally mobile TRPV1-GFP in live cells could be tracked via both their fluorescent protein label and their sparklet activity, and switching from a lower fluorescence emission of the fluorescent protein label to the higher intensity sparklet fluorescence within the same feature demonstrated that the mobile sparklets emanated from mobile TRPV1-GFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="other" rid="video9">Video 9</xref> and <xref ref-type="other" rid="video10">Video 10</xref>). Together, these data indicate that each capsaicin-induced sparklet is due to the activation of one, and only one, TRPV1 ion channel. This doesn't preclude higher number assemblies from forming, but these were never observed in our transiently transfected cells. Our data on dorsal root ganglion sparklets activated by capsaicin recapitulates our observations in TRPV1-GFP and TRPV1-tagRFP expressing HEK293T/17 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>Our investigation into the lateral mobility of TRPV1 as it is influenced by the channel's activity has barely begun to scratch the surface of what may be an important new mode of functional regulation. However, our finding that Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx is required for the capsaicin-induced decrease in TRPV1 mobility may hint at the mechanism by which the change in mobility occurs. Changes in the cytoskeleton upon upregulation of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-sensitive effectors such as α-actinin, gelsolin or scinderin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Rodriguez Del Castillo et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Witke et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kinosian et al., 1998</xref>) can be easily imagined to regulate membrane protein mobility. The formation of local Ca<sup>2+</sup> domains has previously been linked to regulation of cell architecture and remodeling of the cytoskeleton. A recent study looking at the influence of TRPM7 elicited Ca<sup>2+</sup> micro-domains in migrating fibroblasts identified this process as part of the mechanism by which the cell steers towards a chemoattractant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Wei et al., 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">2012</xref>). Thus, the involvement of cytoskeleton in the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-influx mediated regulation of TRPV1 mobility is a subject of interest for future studies.</p><p>We and others have shown that TRPV1 binds to several proteins important to cell signaling, including the p85β subunit of PI3-kinase and the TrkA receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chuang et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Stein et al., 2006</xref>). These interactions are likely related to a physiological response facilitated by nerve growth factor (NGF) that increases cell surface expression of TRPV1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Zhang et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Stein et al., 2006</xref>). Biochemical and electrophysiological experiments also point to a complex formed between AKAP79/150 and TRPV1 to alter sensitization of TRPV1 in response to inflammatory agents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Zhang et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Por et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Efendiev et al., 2013</xref>). Differential properties of a signaling complex involving TRPV1 could be determined by the mobility of the channel, which makes its activity dependent mobility a point of interest. One can imagine that the activity of TRPV1 will confine the channel to a specific region of the cell, where it may (or may not) be more likely to encounter its binding partners in the PI3-kinase/ TrkA receptor complex. It is further possible that the binding of TRPV1 to a complex with a consequent change to the channel's mobility also feeds back on its function.</p><p>At this point, we can only speculate on the physiological role of activity-regulated changes in TRPV1 mobility. Perhaps decreased mobility in regions of locally elevated channel activity serves as a sort of diffusion trap, concentrating TRPV1 channels in parts of the cell where they are most needed. Sensory neurons with cell bodies in the dorsal root ganglia are not very polarized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dubin and Patapoutian, 2010</xref>). Indeed, in culture without other types of neurons they do not form synapses; in their role as sensory receptors they are not postsynaptic to other cells types and appear to have lost the signaling required to form postsynaptic structures. Other mechanisms for protein targeting might thus be prominent in these types of cells.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>Molecular Cloning—The C-terminal GFP-labeled and tagRFP-labeled TRPV1 were made by subcloning the relevant fragments into the pCDNA3 vector, as previously described for our TRPV1-CFP (cyan fluorescent protein) construct (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Ufret-Vincenty et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>Cell Culture and Electrophysiology—Mouse dorsal root ganglia cells were isolated as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Stein et al., 2006</xref>).

Both Fluo-4 and Fluo-5F were purchased from Life Technologies. Although Fluo-4 was used in dorsal root ganglion cell experiments and moving sparklet experiments in HEK293T/17 cells because of its increased affinity for Ca<sup>2+</sup> and improved fluorescence signal in physiological solutions (2 mM Ca<sup>2+</sup>), we used Fluo-5F dye for the immobile sparklet experiments in HEK293T/17 because we wished to more closely follow the methods of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Navedo et al.

For F-11 cell sparklet experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="other" rid="video4 video5">Videos 4 and 5</xref>), we used standard HBSS buffer and 0.2 mM Fluo-4 pipette solution, as described above. TRPV1 activation was induced by perfusion with either of the previously mentioned NMDG bath solutions supplemented with 100 nM capsaicin (from DMSO stock).

The 488 nm line of a 100 mW argon laser (Melles Griot, Albuquerque, NM) was used for all fluorophores except tagRFP, for which a 40 mW 561 nm solid state laser (Coherent, Santa Clara, CA) was used.

In the case of immobile sparklet intensity analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1 fig2">Figures 1A and 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>), all points histograms of the normalized intensity were generated in Igor Pro (Wavemetrics, Lake Oswego, OR), with baseline subtraction to account for rising global Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal in background and (ΔF/F<sub>0</sub>) collected in a 12 × 12 (6 × 6 for dorsal root ganglion neuron experiments) pixel region-of-interest (ROI) centered on each sparklet. In the case of sparklet movement analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1 fig5 fig7">Figures 1B, 5, 7</xref>) five frames were averaged in time with the frequency cut-off set to 0.1 using the Windowed-sinc filter plug-in (ImageJ). Tracking of individual sparklets was then semi-autonomously performed with the ImageJ Spot Tracker 2D plug-in (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://bigwww.epfl.ch/sage/soft/spottracker/">http://bigwww.epfl.ch/sage/soft/spottracker/</ext-link>). In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, the TRPV1-GFP fluorescent feature was tracked at an early stage of sparklet activity so that longer segments of the track represented contiguous positions of the GFP fluorescence followed by segments of sparklet fluorescence. Spot Tracker 2D does not provide the uncertainty for each position in the track, and we wished to compare the precision in measuring sparklet to GFP single molecule positions. We used Matlab (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.mathworks.com/">www.Mathworks.com</ext-link>) to calculate the standard deviations (x- and y-direction) of a 2D bivariate Gaussian function fit to an ROI centered on each fluoroescent peak recovered by ImageJ Spot Tracker 2D (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Schmidt et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cheezum et al., 2001</xref>). A bivariate Gaussian was used because time averaging of the frames could stretch the feature by a small degree, and the uncertainty for the precision was calculated as the average of the two standard deviations. The region we ascribed to the feature (5 × 5 pixels) was chosen as a compromise between isolating the feature of interest from surrounding unrelated signals and recovering the full shape of the GFP or sparklet feature. As TRPV1 channels opened, the background fluorescence levels gradually increased during the course of the video. Although most single particle detection methods rely on a background offset in their fitting function to accommodate a slowly varying and evenly distributed background level, we found that the highly variable and changing background levels of sparklet videos necessitated a background subtraction and additional fitting constraints in the tails of the 2D Gaussian fit. To suppress any effect that the background fluorescence had on our fits, an additional two layers of pixels surrounding the 5 × 5 pixel region were used to calculate a mean background level. This mean background was subtracted from the pixels in our 5 × 5 feature region, and the two layers of pixels were padded onto our feature region as zero-valued to extend the total fitted ROI to a 9 × 9 region. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>, tracks were selected based on their contiguous sparklet fluorescence signals for ease of tracking. Fluorescence from GFP was not observed in the course of these videos due to the high background fluorescence (for example, see <xref ref-type="other" rid="video6">Video 6</xref>). This allowed us to pool displacement data from TRPV1-GFP and TRPV1-tagRFP in our analysis. Displacements of sparklet positions in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref> were determined for time points that are 10 steps apart (i.e., frame <italic>i</italic> to <italic>i</italic> + 10) to: 1) minimize the random noise contribution and 2) have greater confidence in the precision of the displacement calculation.</p><p>Quantification used to assess the effects of capsaicin on TRPV1-GFP mobility in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref> was based on the trajectories acquired through the u-track program as described above with the following additional steps: 1) A mask to exclude regions of high channel densities is used when deemed necessary and consistently applied to all videos made on the same cell. 2) The MSD was calculated for time points 90 msec (3 frames) apart in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> and 120 msec (4 frames) apart in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>. 3) An MSD difference metric to compare the mobility of channels in the same cell before and after capsaicin treatment was implemented to emphasize trajectory differences due to TRPV1-GFP movements and to minimize changes over time caused by photobleaching. The number of tracks contributing to each average MSD in a video ranged from ∼80-600. The MSD difference ratio (R<sub>ΔMSD</sub>) reduced the impact of photobleaching on a particular cell by normalizing to the MSD measured in the first part of each video (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>Single Molecule Photobleaching—HEK293T/17 cells, transiently transfected for low expression levels of TRPV1-GFP, were transferred to uncoated coverslips and allowed to recover in HBSS for 2 hr before being fixed with a 12 min incubation in a 4% paraformaldehyde solution prepared in HBSS. HBSS buffer was also used for the rinses and for imaging. Imaging with TIRF microscopy on the previously described Nikon instrument was performed at 100% 488 nm laser power, 10 Hz acquisition speed, and with 2 × 2 binning of the pixels using the QuantEM camera. Post-acquisition processing of the images entailed subtracting off a 7 × 7 pixel smoothed image from each frame and identifying potential bleach steps in the temporal fluorescence intensity traces of 3 × 3 ROIs centered on individual channel sites as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Demuro et al., 2011</xref>).

The authors succeed in imaging the real–time activity of the channel by imaging calcium “sparklets” that occur as the moving channel gates. The authors should be commended in pioneering and accomplishing this difficult experiment. In general, I think this paper is interesting and opens up new and exciting directions for ion channel research. The main question of the paper is summarized in the authors’ own words: “whether actively gating channels can be mobile and whether their mobility is linked to their activity.” This has been an unanswered question. How mobility changes in a channel might affect signaling, however, is still unknown. The data in the paper is well presented and the findings are clear. The paper is well written. I have several comments that the authors should address.</p><p>1) As far as I can tell from the data the majority of the imaging was done in patch-clamped cells in the presence of cytosolic calcium chelator and thapsigargin. Did the authors observe the same diffusional behavior and change in diffusion with the addition of calcium and ligand in intact (non–patched) cells expressing TRPV1–GFP (or RED)? I am concerned that the chemical manipulations that aided in imaging sparklets could change the “wild–type” diffusional behavior of the channel? You could imagine that if the cytoskeleton is altered by calcium (which it is) and the channel's movements are dependent on the cytoskeleton then these manipulations which buffer calcium could have non–physiological consequences on the channel's behavior. Showing data of TRPV1–GFP in intact cells (with and without ligand) would be a helpful control for this concern.</p><p>2) Does every channel gate (have a sparklet) or is there only a subset of channels that do? Do all channels slow down or just a subset? For example, do only channels with sparklets slow or do all channels slow regardless of their activity? It is difficult to see this from the way the data is presented. Specifically, the data is plotted as means from individual cells but in this format I cannot tell if all the channels slow or just a few have massive changes in diffusion. A supplement with histograms of diffusions for all tracked channels or box–and–whisker plots of the full data set would be nice. Is the behavior homogeneous across the cell or are there regional differences in diffusion across the foot–print?</p><p>3) Is this a general phenomenon for all membrane proteins (or ion channels) or is this specific for TRPV1? Do other ion channels show this behavior in these cells under these conditions? Is this effect due to a global change in the cell, membrane, or cytoskeleton?</p><p>4) How does the duration of the sparklet (visible open time) compare to single channel recordings of TRPV1? The open times seem very long (∼10 sec). Is this seen in electrophysiology data? The authors should discuss in more detail how their data compares to past recordings of TRPV1 under similar conditions?</p><p>5) How does the diffusion coefficient of TRPV1 compare to other membrane proteins or lipids? Could the authors please discuss this in more detail the paper?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3</italic>:</p><p>The authors provide the first measurements of elementary calcium fluxes through TRPV1 channels, and perform measurements of TRPV1 motility with single particle tracking. These are very demanding experiments, and individually intrinsically difficult to analyze. Together, it presents an exceptionally difficult challenge. The authors present evidence that TRPV1 channel activity may affect channel motility. The current work lacks a coherent rationale, experimental structure, mechanistic basis, and physiological relevance. The study seems to be an assortment of different control experiments with some superficial analysis.</p><p>Concerns with Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging:</p><p>Experiments were performed similar to how Santana and colleagues performed their L–type Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel sparklets. With fluo–4 and EGTA (10 mM) delivered through a patch pipette, and cells held at a negative holding potential. The only difference is that they held at –40 mV (compared to –70 mV for L–type sparklets). They argued that this was so “to minimize the activity of voltage–gated Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels while also limiting the driving force of Ca<sup>2+</sup> into the cell, which would reduce the duration of our experiments as the global rise in Ca<sup>2+</sup> obscures the signal due to single TRPV1”. So it isn't clear why –40 mV was chosen, L–type calcium channel activity would likely be greater at –40 mV than –70 mV. Also –40 mV does not minimize the driving force when the calcium equilibrium potential is +120 mV. In addition, the 10 mM EGTA should be capable of buffering global changes in cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup>. Furthermore, these recordings represent the first measurements of TRPV1 sparklets, and therefore a number of criteria should be fulfilled, e.g., quantal levels should depend on the calcium electrochemical gradient and not on the nature of the agonist or antagonist. TRPV1 agonists and antagonists should affect the probability of a sparklet but not the quantal level.</p><p>Concerns with single particle tracking:</p><p>The power of single particle tracking analysis relies on the algorithms used to define and measure the displacement of a fluorescent pixel pattern (which needs to better explained in the manuscript). Typically, the location of an individual particle is defined by the fitting a 2D Gaussian function with a set standard deviation that encompasses the pixel pattern. These algorithms work well with single fluorescent particles due to the high signal–to–noise ratio between the particle and the surrounding environment (i.e., small standard deviation of the 2D Gaussian fit that equal the relative size of the particle). Like any statistical analysis, the smaller the variability, the higher the confidence in the calculated mean value, or in this case the 2D location of the particle. Attempts to apply these methods of analysis to larger more variable and dynamic “particle” like Ca<sup>2+</sup> release events would be extremely difficult. The relative size, or spatial spread of Ca<sup>2+</sup>, would increase the standard deviation of the 2D Gaussian fit, and therefore decrease the confidence of the location of the particle. To strengthen these data, the authors would need to perform several control experiments to show that this is not true. With the ability to simultaneous record Ca<sup>2+</sup> events and GFP tagged channel, do the MSD's for the Ca<sup>2+</sup> event match up with the trajectory of individual tagged channels?</p><p>Concerns with final interpretation:</p><p>How do the authors resolve the movement of a single particle of GFP during a Ca<sup>2+</sup> event when the fluorescence signal of a given area is saturated with the underlying fluo–4 signal? I would predict the standard deviation of 2D Gaussian fit would increase, therefore decreasing the confidence of the 2D mean placement. This may lead to the interpretation that the mobility of the channel to be slower (or no not moving at all).</p><p>What is the density of TRPV1 sparklet sites for a given cell? It is apparent from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, that the number of channels on the plasma membrane is high (Methods: ∼80–600 channels), yet not all of those channels may be actively conducting Ca<sup>2+</sup> to elicit a sparklet (it would be hard spatially resolve 80–600 individual sparklet sites). Therefore, the analysis performed of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref> may not accurately characterize the Ca<sup>2+</sup> dependency of channel mobility as it cannot separate the active from the inactive channels.</p><p>In the Results section, the authors conclude that TRPV1 channels exhibited a decrease in mobility following that activation of Ca<sup>2+</sup> sparklets by capsaicin. With the current data, it would be difficult to conclude whether the slower mobility occurs before or after the influx of Ca<sup>2+</sup>. This is the old chicken versus the egg conundrum. One possible way to address this would be to plot the Ca<sup>2+</sup> event (<italic>F/F</italic><sub><italic>0</italic></sub>) and time–averaged MSDs on the same time scale, and see whether the Ca<sup>2+</sup> event coincides with a change in the MSD for a given site.</p><p>As indicated in the Discussion, there is evidence that TRPV1 and AKAP79/150 form a complex which presumably would affect motility as well as the activation of associated calcineurin. Does either of the cell types used here (DRG or HEK cells) express AKAP150, and is it related to motility?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.03819.029</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>The reviewers expressed considerable enthusiasm for the work, but noted that extensive changes would be required.

I have several comments that the authors should address</italic>.</p><p><italic>1) As far as I can tell from the data the majority of the imaging was done in patch-clamped cells in the presence of cytosolic calcium chelator and thapsigargin. Did the authors observe the same diffusional behavior and change in diffusion with the addition of calcium and ligand in intact (non–patched) cells expressing TRPV1–GFP (or RED)? I am concerned that the chemical manipulations that aided in imaging sparklets could change the “wild–type” diffusional behavior of the channel? You could imagine that if the cytoskeleton is altered by calcium (which it is) and the channel's movements are dependent on the cytoskeleton then these manipulations which buffer calcium could have non–physiological consequences on the channel's behavior. Showing data of TRPV1–GFP in intact cells (with and without ligand) would be a helpful control for this concern</italic>.</p><p>The reviewer’s comments brought to our attention a serious problem with the clarity of our presentation. We had exactly the concerns raised by the reviewer, and we included the appropriate controls in the original submission of the manuscript. We have significantly improved the presentation by reorganizing the order of the presentation, more clearly stating experimental conditions in the text, and adding needed information to the figure legends. The requested studies of TRPV1–GFP mobility in non-patch clamped cells allowed to regulate their Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels without interference of experimentally added Ca<sup>2+</sup> buffers are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> and discussed in their own section of the text. In addition, we have new analysis that demonstrates parallel behavior by TRPV1–GFP in non-patched cells and TRPV1–GFP with sparklets in cells dialyzed with EGTA and a Ca<sup>2+</sup> dye and studied under voltage-clamped conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>).</p><p><italic>2) Does every channel gate (have a sparklet) or is there only a subset of channels that do? Do all channels slow down or just a subset? For example, do only channels with sparklets slow or do all channels slow regardless of their activity? It is difficult to see this from the way the data is presented. Specifically, the data is plotted as means from individual cells but in this format I cannot tell if all the channels slow or just a few have massive changes in diffusion. A supplement with histograms of diffusions for all tracked channels or box–and–whisker plots of the full data set would be nice. Is the behavior homogeneous across the cell or are there regional differences in diffusion across the foot–print</italic>?</p><p>The relationship between activity and mobility for single TRPV1 molecules is not a question that would have been raised prior to this study. We agree with the reviewer that, in light of our new work, this relationship begs to be addressed. We are currently developing the technology that will be required to address the reviewer’s questions, but we believe that the set of required experiments represents a full R01 proposal, well beyond the scope of the current study. Independent color channels will have to be used for sparklets and TRPV1, so that mobility and activity can be independently measured. Nonetheless, we provide new analysis in new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref> to move as close to this question as possible using existing methods. We have also included new experiments to allow the behavior of individual sparklets to be compared across different types of cells, and show these data in new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref> and new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>.</p><p><italic>3) Is this a general phenomenon for all membrane proteins (or ion channels) or is this specific for TRPV1? Do other ion channels show this behavior in these cells under these conditions? Is this effect due to a global change in the cell, membrane, or cytoskeleton</italic>?</p><p>We share the reviewer’s excitement to learn whether the new phenomenon we present here represents a general cellular strategy for controlling activity and mobility. Although a survey of many membrane proteins using our approach would be useful, the literature already provides us with a partial answer. Sparklets have been reported for L–type Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels, AchR channels, and TRPV4 channels. In all reported cases, the sparklets were not mobile. Yet TRPV1 is mobile in at least three cell types: isolated dorsal root ganglion neurons, HEK293T/17 cells, and F11 cells. We believe mobile gating channels are likely to be the rule, rather than the exception, but it will take many studies by a number of groups to establish whether this is the case.</p><p><italic>4) How does the duration of the sparklet (visible open time) compare to single channel recordings of TRPV1? The open times seem very long (∼10 sec). Is this seen in electrophysiology data? The authors should discuss in more detail how their data compares to past recordings of TRPV1 under similar conditions</italic>?</p><p>We have performed the requested analysis and include the results in new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1–figure supplement 2</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>. We have used these figures as the basis for new discussion in the main text.</p><p><italic>5) How does the diffusion coefficient of TRPV1 compare to other membrane proteins or lipids? Could the authors please discuss this in more detail the paper</italic>?</p><p>We now show that the variance of TRPV1 mobility within a given cell is at least an order of magnitude greater than that seen between cells. We have improved the Discussion to put the effective diffusion constants measured for TRPV1 in a broader context.</p><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p><italic>The authors provide the first measurements of elementary calcium fluxes through TRPV1 channels, and perform measurements of TRPV1 motility with single particle tracking. These are very demanding experiments, and individually intrinsically difficult to analyze. Together, it presents an exceptionally difficult challenge. The authors present evidence that TRPV1 channel activity may affect channel motility. The current work lacks a coherent rationale, experimental structure, mechanistic basis, and physiological relevance. The study seems to be an assortment of different control experiments with some superficial analysis</italic>.</p><p><italic>Concerns with Ca</italic><sup><italic>2+</italic></sup> <italic>imaging</italic>:</p><p><italic>Experiments were performed similar to how Santana and colleagues performed their L–type Ca</italic><sup><italic>2+</italic></sup> <italic>channel sparklets. With fluo–4 and EGTA (10 mM) delivered through a patch pipette, and cells held at a negative holding potential. The only difference is that they held at –40 mV (compared to –70 mV for L–type sparklets). They argued that this was so “to minimize the activity of voltage–gated Ca</italic><sup><italic>2+</italic></sup> <italic>channels while also limiting the driving force of Ca</italic><sup><italic>2+</italic></sup> <italic>into the cell, which would reduce the duration of our experiments as the global rise in Ca</italic><sup><italic>2+</italic></sup> <italic>obscures the signal due to single TRPV1”. So it isn't clear why –40 mV was chosen, L–type calcium channel activity would likely be greater at –40 mV than –70 mV. Also –40 mV does not minimize the driving force when the calcium equilibrium potential is +120 mV</italic>.</p><p>We thank the reviewer for alerting us to difficult-to-follow explanation in the original manuscript. We chose the holding potential for our experiments empirically, based on our recordings of isolated mouse dorsal root ganglion neurons. Using the same recording conditions as those used to examine TRPV1, we imaged Fluo–4 with 10 mM EGTA, but no capsaicin, at a number of different holding potentials. We found that holding at –40 mV produced the smallest rise in intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> over the ten-or-so minutes needed for our experiments. We have now explained that more clearly in the text. Because isolated neurons have a host of natively expressed channels and we were able to identify conditions in which the Ca<sup>2+</sup> leak was minimal, we did not attempt to assign the background rise in Ca<sup>2+</sup> to any particular type of channel.</p><p><italic>In addition, the 10 mM EGTA should be capable of buffering global changes in cytosolic Ca</italic><sup><italic>2+</italic></sup><italic>. Furthermore, these recordings represent the first measurements of TRPV1 sparklets, and therefore a number of criteria should be fulfilled, e.g., quantal levels should depend on the calcium electrochemical gradient and not on the nature of the agonist or antagonist. TRPV1 agonists and antagonists should affect the probability of a sparklet but not the quantal level</italic>.</p><p>We found that 10 mM EGTA was indeed very effective at increasing the duration of our experiments, and it is critical to observing micro-domains of Ca<sup>2+</sup> sparklets since the on rate of Fluo–4 is higher than the on rate of EGTA, resulting in a localization and improved kinetic resolution of Ca<sup>2+</sup> sparklet signal (Shuai and Parker, 2005). However, with extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> at 2 mM, the high Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx through TRPV1 will continue to saturate available EGTA and a Ca<sup>2+</sup> gradient will form between the plasma membrane (where we collect our signal in TIRF) and the opening of the pipette (where Ca<sup>2+</sup>-bound EGTA diffuses out of the cell as Ca<sup>2+</sup> –free EGTA diffuses in). This increases the free Ca<sup>2+</sup> available to bind Fluo–4 or Fluo-5F, making it harder to resolve additional sparklets. In response to the reviewer’s question about quantal level, we now show collected data for sparklets from both dorsal root ganglion neurons and HEK293T/17 cells in new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>. The results of this analysis surprised us, because we expected the uneven position of the bilayer in the evanescent field would produce more variability than observed. The reviewer’s reasoning is sound, and now discussed in the text.</p><p><italic>Concerns with single particle tracking</italic>:</p><p><italic>The power of single particle tracking analysis relies on the algorithms used to define and measure the displacement of a fluorescent pixel pattern (which needs to better explained in the manuscript). Typically, the location of an individual particle is defined by the fitting a 2D Gaussian function with a set standard deviation that encompasses the pixel pattern. These algorithms work well with single fluorescent particles due to the high signal–to–noise ratio between the particle and the surrounding environment (i.e., small standard deviation of the 2D Gaussian fit that equal the relative size of the particle). Like any statistical analysis, the smaller the variability, the higher the confidence in the calculated mean value, or in this case the 2D location of the particle. Attempts to apply these methods of analysis to larger more variable and dynamic “particle” like Ca</italic><sup><italic>2+</italic></sup> <italic>release events would be extremely difficult. The relative size, or spatial spread of Ca</italic><sup><italic>2+</italic></sup><italic>, would increase the standard deviation of the 2D Gaussian fit, and therefore decrease the confidence of the location of the particle. To strengthen these data, the authors would need to perform several control experiments to show that this is not true. With the ability to simultaneous record Ca</italic><sup><italic>2+</italic></sup> <italic>events and GFP tagged channel, do the MSD's for the Ca</italic><sup><italic>2+</italic></sup> <italic>event match up with the trajectory of individual tagged channels</italic>?</p><p><italic>Concerns with final interpretation</italic>:</p><p><italic>How do the authors resolve the movement of a single particle of GFP during a Ca</italic><sup><italic>2+</italic></sup> <italic>event when the fluorescence signal of a given area is saturated with the underlying fluo–4 signal? I would predict the standard deviation of 2D Gaussian fit would increase, therefore decreasing the confidence of the 2D mean placement. This may lead to the interpretation that the mobility of the channel to be slower (or no not moving at all)</italic>.</p><p>We have done as the reviewer requested and improved the explanation of the tracking algorithm used in the text. Furthermore, we have analyzed the width of the Gaussian used to fit the sparklet/GFP position at each point, and used this value as a scaling factor for the size of the circles shown in new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>. This new analysis shows that the brighter fluorescence observed with sparklets compared to GFP did not reduce our ability to precisely determine the position of sparklets (uncertainty of ∼200-300 nm) within the context of a, relatively speaking, larger TRPV1 sparklet track ( ∼5-10 μm length). Thus, although the width of sparklet Gaussians was generally larger than that of Gaussians used to localize TRPV1- GFP, we were nonetheless able to combine GFP and sparklet localizations to plot single channel trajectories. Moreover, the mobility of sparklets analyzed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> relies on the fluorescence of sparklets and not the fluorescent protein, which permits us to determine the change in displacements over the course of the movie. We believe this new analysis significantly strengthens the manuscript, and we thank the reviewer for his/her suggestion.</p><p><italic>What is the density of TRPV1 sparklet sites for a given cell? It is apparent from</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2"><italic>Figure 2</italic></xref><italic>, that the number of channels on the plasma membrane is high (Methods: ∼80–600 channels), yet not all of those channels may be actively conducting Ca</italic><sup><italic>2+</italic></sup> <italic>to elicit a sparklet (it would be hard spatially resolve 80–600 individual sparklet sites). Therefore, the analysis performed of</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7"><italic>Figure 7A</italic></xref> <italic>may not accurately characterize the Ca</italic><sup><italic>2+</italic></sup> <italic>dependency of channel mobility as it cannot separate the active from the inactive channels</italic>.</p><p>See the response to Reviewer #2, question 2. Also, the activity- and Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent reduction in TRPV1 mobility was observed by following TRPV1–GFP in (new) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref> as well as by following sparklets in (new) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>.</p><p><italic>In the Results section, the authors conclude that TRPV1 channels exhibited a decrease in mobility following that activation of Ca</italic><sup><italic>2+</italic></sup> <italic>sparklets by capsaicin.

One possible way to address this would be to plot the Ca</italic><sup><italic>2+</italic></sup> <italic>event (</italic>F/F<sub>0</sub><italic>) and time–averaged MSDs on the same time scale, and see whether the Ca</italic><sup><italic>2+</italic></sup> <italic>event coincides with a change in the MSD for a given site</italic>.</p><p>How well the mobility of a single TRPV1 channel tracks its activity is indeed a question of great importance. Although current methods do not allow us to directly address the mechanism by which Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx through TRPV1 decreases TRPV1 mobility, we can answer the specific question posed by this reviewer. By recording the mobility of TRPV1-GFP in cells that are not voltage clamped and in which no Ca<sup>2+</sup> dye is used, we can compare capsaicin in the absence of Ca<sup>2+</sup> to capsaicin in the presence of Ca<sup>2+</sup>. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>, capsaicin only causes a decrease in TRPV1 mobility in the presence of extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> (2 mM).</p></body></sub-article></article>
