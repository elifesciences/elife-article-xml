This is particularly true for visual physiology that is directly affected by changing light conditions. Here we investigate the influence of the circadian rhythm on the expression and function of visual transduction cascade regulators in diurnal zebrafish and nocturnal mice. We focused on regulators of shut-off kinetics such as Recoverins<italic>,</italic> Arrestins<italic>,</italic> Opsin kinases<italic>,</italic> and Regulator of G-protein signaling that have direct effects on temporal vision. Transcript as well as protein levels of most analyzed genes show a robust circadian rhythm-dependent regulation, which correlates with changes in photoresponse kinetics. Electroretinography demonstrates that photoresponse recovery in zebrafish is delayed in the evening and accelerated in the morning. Functional rhythmicity persists in continuous darkness, and it is reversed by an inverted light cycle and disrupted by constant light. This is in line with our finding that orthologous gene transcripts from diurnal zebrafish and nocturnal mice are often expressed in an anti-phasic daily rhythm.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>circadian rhythm</kwd><kwd>visual transduction cascade</kwd><kwd>retina</kwd><kwd>electroretinography</kwd><kwd>visual behavior</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd><kwd>Zebrafish</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001711</institution-id><institution>Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Förderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>310030_200376</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Samardzija</surname><given-names>Marijana</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Circadian expression of cone visual transduction genes and corresponding proteins correlates with circadian changes in photoresponse kinetics and visual behavior, linking circadian gene expression with physiological and behavioral rhythmicity.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Circadian rhythms serve as endogenous clocks that molecularly support the daily occurring oscillations of physiology and ensuing behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Brown et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cahill, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Frøland Steindal and Whitmore, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Golombek et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Idda et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Ukai and Ueda, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Vatine et al., 2011</xref>). It has long been recognized that the central pacemaker of circadian rhythms resides in dedicated brain regions, either the suprachiasmatic nucleus in mammals or the pineal gland in non-mammalian vertebrates. The rhythm is entrained by external stimuli (eg, light) that directly act on the core circadian transcriptional feedback loop. Multiple studies have shown that autonomous circadian clocks also exist in other brain regions and in peripheral tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Frøland Steindal and Whitmore, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Idda et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Vatine et al., 2011</xref>). This is particularly true for the retina, which generates its own circadian rhythm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gladys, 2020</xref>). In zebrafish, this rhythmicity is reflected in a number of circadian adaptations, such as a higher response threshold in the morning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Li and Dowling, 1998</xref>), photoreceptor retinomotor movement in constant darkness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Menger et al., 2005</xref>), and cone photoreceptor synaptic ribbon disassembly at night (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Emran et al., 2010</xref>). Such adaptations are also found in other animals such as mice, where stronger electrical retinal coupling during the night (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jin et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Li et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Ribelayga et al., 2008</xref>), as well as slower dark adaptation of rods during the day, was observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Xue et al., 2015</xref>). The molecular mechanisms underlying these circadian-dependent retinal regulations are still largely unknown.</p><p>In the vertebrate retina, there are two different types of photoreceptors, namely rods and cones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Burns and Baylor, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fu and Yau, 2007</xref>). Rods function mainly during dim light conditions, whereas cones are characterized by lower sensitivity but faster response kinetics, being important for daylight and color vision. About 92% of larval and 60% of adult photoreceptors in the zebrafish retina are cones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Allison et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Fadool, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Zimmermann et al., 2018</xref>). Although rods and cones generally use the same visual transduction cascade components, the individual reactions are typically mediated by photoreceptor type-specific proteins.</p><p>Visual transduction commences by an opsin chromophore-mediated absorption of photons, which triggers the activation of a second messenger cascade including the trimeric G-protein transducin. Activated transducin stimulates the effector enzyme phosphodiesterase (PDE), which leads to a reduction in intracellular cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) levels, subsequently leading to the closure of cyclic nucleotide -gated (CNG) cation channels, resulting in a membrane potential change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fain et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lamb and Pugh, 2006</xref>).</p><p>High-temporal resolution requires a tightly regulated termination of visual transduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chen et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Matthews and Sampath, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Zang and Matthews, 2012</xref>). This depends on the highly effective quenching of both the activated visual pigment (R*) and the PDE-transducin complex (PDE*). R* is phosphorylated by a G-protein receptor kinase (GRK) before being completely deactivated by binding to arrestin. While GRK activity itself is controlled by recoverin (RCV) in a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Zang and Neuhauss, 2018</xref>), the quenching of PDE* depends on the GTPase activity of its γ-subunit that is regulated by activator protein RGS9 (Regulator of G-protein Signaling 9) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Krispel et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>We now show that the expression levels of these important regulators of cone visual transduction decay are modulated by the circadian clock. Moreover, these periodic fluctuations are reflected in oscillating protein levels that correlate with the rhythmicity in visual physiology and behavior observed in zebrafish. Interestingly, we have found that the expression of a selection of mouse orthologs of the investigated regulatory genes is also modulated by the circadian clock. However, the periodicity was opposite to that of zebrafish, fitting the nocturnal lifestyle of mice.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Expression levels of key genes involved in shaping visual transduction decay are regulated by the circadian clock</title><p>To determine the influence of the circadian clock on visual behavior, we analyzed gene expression levels of key visual transduction regulators over a 24 hr period using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reacion (qRT-PCR).

The protein products of the genes analyzed in our study are known to affect photoresponse recovery in zebrafish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Renninger et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Rinner et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Zang et al., 2015</xref>). Therefore, we assessed their function by using the ERG double-flash paradigm. In this experimental setup, the retina receives a conditioning flash, followed by a probing flash of the same light intensity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A1</xref>). The b-wave amplitude ratio of probing to conditioning response in relation to the interstimulus interval is a normalized read-out for the visual transduction recovery time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A2</xref>; full example in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). Photoreceptor recovery is complete when the two flashes evoke responses of equal amplitudes. ERG responses are predicted to be contributed by all cone subtypes, given the light source spectrum.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Larval cone photoresponse recovery is accelerated in the morning.</title><p>(<bold>A1</bold>) Examples of normal light/dark (LD) larval electroretinogram (ERG) b-wave recordings.

In line with our hypothesis, we found that the normalized power at each stimulus frequency was significantly weaker in the evening compared with the power in the morning. This clearly indicates that the cone visual temporal resolution is under circadian control.

An early study demonstrated that zebrafish visual sensitivity is lower before light on and higher prior to light off (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Li and Dowling, 1998</xref>). Later, another study linked the rhythmic expression of long-wavelength cone opsin to the core clock component CLOCK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Li et al., 2008</xref>). A particularly striking finding showed that synaptic ribbons of larval zebrafish photoreceptors disassemble at night. This peculiar phenomenon may save energy in fast-growing larvae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Emran et al., 2010</xref>). Our study now demonstrates that regulators of photoresponse decay are not only influenced by the circadian clock but in addition have a clear effect on the varying visual performances throughout a 24 hr cycle. Moreover, kinetics of cone visual transduction quenching is under the control of the circadian clock, which allows the fish to see with better temporal resolution in the morning than in the evening.</p><p>It is commonly assumed that circadian gene regulation helps the organism to optimally adapt to its preferential lifestyle and/or environment. Therefore, one would expect that the circadian systems of diurnal and nocturnal animals adapt differently. Our study indeed demonstrates that orthologous zebrafish and mouse genes involved in regulating cone visual transduction decay display an anti-phasic circadian expression pattern, supporting the functional relevance of the oscillating gene expression. While the visual temporal resolution of diurnal species is reduced in the evening, the visual system of nocturnal species is tuned to be most effective during these hours. Zebrafish, therefore, is an interesting model to study the physiology of circadian rhythms of diurnal animals, such as humans.</p><p>We would like to point out several additional interesting observations. Although many ohnologs (paralogs generated in a whole-genome duplication event), such as <italic>grk7a</italic> and <italic>grk7b</italic>, share a similar circadian phase or oscillatory amplitude, others, such as <italic>rcv1a</italic> and <italic>rcv1b</italic>, show an almost anti-phasic relationship. This is remarkable, since these ohnologs have been generated by a teleost-specific whole-genome duplication event (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Glasauer and Neuhauss, 2014</xref>), implying that initially all ohnologs should have been in synchronicity. Interestingly, these ohnologs also adapted different expression profiles, with <italic>rcv1a</italic> being expressed in rods and UV cones, while <italic>rcv1b</italic> being expressed in all cone types in the adult retina (UV, blue, red, and green) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Zang et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>While the circadian rhythmicity of most genes persists throughout all developmental stages, some genes do show markedly different expression profiles between larval and adult stages. This may be related to the fact that the larval retina is functionally cone dominant, while the adult retina is a duplex retina with rod and cone contribution. In the case of <italic>rcv2</italic> ohnologs, <italic>rcv2b</italic> displays an in-phase cyclic expression pattern throughout all stages. Conversely, <italic>rcv2a</italic> did not show an overt cyclic expression pattern at larval stages, but being clearly under circadian control at adult stages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). In contrast to the <italic>rcv1</italic> ohnologs, both <italic>rcv2</italic> genes are expressed in all cone subtypes, and depletion of either one acts to speed up the photoresponse termination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Zang et al., 2015</xref>). Other examples of ohnolog-specific cycling have been found for <italic>arrs</italic> and <italic>rgs</italic> genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>). These observations strongly indicate that the transcription of clock-controlled genes (CCGs) is not uniformly regulated.</p><p>Interestingly, it has been previously demonstrated that the circadian clock seems to be desynchronized in larvae raised in darkness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dekens and Whitmore, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kaneko and Cahill, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kazimi and Cahill, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lahiri et al., 2014</xref>). The circadian expression of some core clock genes and melatonin rhythms are lost when whole larvae were used as the experimental material in the absence of environmental entrainments. We did not observe this phenomenon in our study of visual transduction genes when only eye tissue was used, consistent with an inheritable maternal clock in the eye. We took care to avoid inadvertent environmental entrainment as described in detail in the ‘Materials and methods’ section. The different experimental results may come from the fact that different experiment materials were used. For example, all the analyzed genes in our study are also expressed in the photoreceptors of the pineal gland, but the transcript fluctuations may not necessarily be synchronized between the eye and pineal gland (eg, <italic>rcv1a</italic> in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). The use of whole larvae in our qRT-PCR study may have masked the cycling of retinal genes.</p><p>Furthermore, in many cases, the DD cycling is in phase with the fluctuations of the transcripts under the LD cycle. Endogenous circadian periods are around, but not exactly, 24 hr, and within 5 days in constant darkness, the peaks may shift relative to the LD cycle. In our experiments, the tissue was collected every 3 hr, and the shift within 5 days may be too small to be visible in the current experimental setting. The observation that the cycle of other genes (<italic>arr3a</italic>, <italic>arr3b,</italic> and <italic>rcv1a</italic>) in DD condition did diverge from LD condition indicates that these genes may be driven by different transcription factors. Furthermore, the DD condition led to the overall upregulation of some (eg, <italic>rcv1a</italic>, <italic>rgs9a</italic>) while caused downregulation of other (eg, <italic>arr3a</italic>, <italic>arr3b</italic>) genes as calculated from data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>. This strongly argues against a systematic error.</p><p>Among the studied genes in zebrafish, <italic>grk7a</italic> expression level increased by around 50 times in 1 day (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), whereas Grk7a protein level increased by about two times in a 24 hr period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). <italic>arr3a</italic> transcript increased about 10 times (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), while its protein level only grew less than 50% throughout the day (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Therefore, these mRNA expression levels reflect proportionally to protein levels, indicative of a rather fast turnover rate for these proteins.</p><p>In the end, we asked whether the observed ERG adaptations between morning and evening directly influence visual behavior. Therefore, we measured the optokinetic response (OKR)(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>) and the visual motor response (VMR)(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2</xref>) . Both behavioral assays showed some changes between the different recording time points, but the direct contribution by visual transduction is hard to assign. Confounding factors, not related to vision, may for instance be circadian regulation of overall activity.</p><p>In conclusion, we have shown that key regulators of cone visual transduction at both the mRNA and protein level are under circadian control. Moreover, expression levels of these regulators in diurnal and nocturnal species are anti-phasic, suggesting that circadian changes influencing physiological and behavioral properties of vision are reflected in adaptation to different visual ecologies.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Zebrafish care</title><p>Zebrafish (<italic>Danio rerio</italic>) were maintained at a standard 14 hr light:10 hr dark cycle (LD) with light on at 8 am and light off at 10 pm.

revisions, shown below. We also include an acceptance summary that explains what the editors found interesting or important about the work.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Circadian Regulation of Vertebrate Cone Photoreceptor Function&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Didier Stainier as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Tom Baden (Reviewer #1); Pamela Menegazzi (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission. While we believe that your manuscript is in principle a very exciting advancement of the understanding of sensory perception, and thus likely well suited for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>, there were several critical comments and questions raised by the reviewers. Upon discussing the different reviewers' responses, we would ask you to address the following seven points below with particular importance. It is essential to properly address these points in order for us to consider your work for publication:</p><p>(1.) The finding that of the experiments examining retinal gene expression in larvae raised under constant darkness is at odds with several previous studies that show that robust circadian clock entrainment occurs only during the first days of zebrafish development and requires LD cycles for it. The finding of a maternal effect is (moderately phrased) &quot;debated&quot;. The authors are aware of this, as they discuss this aspect in their own discussion:</p><p>line 7-9, page 22, &quot;We did not observe this phenomenon in our study of visual transduction genes in the retina, suggesting the existence of an inheritable maternal clock in the eye (Delaunay et al., 2000).&quot;. At present their statement is a serious overinterpretation of their data, as it appears that they did not perform the controls to ensure constant environmental conditions. How was the DD collection really done? How about possible temperature changes the larvae might have been exposed to? Even small temperature changes can serve as entrainment cues.</p><p>Furthermore, it is actually rather suspicious that the DD cycling is pretty much in phase with the fluctuations of the transcripts under the LD cycle. Endogenous circadian periods are not exactly 24hrs and within 5days the peaks should have shifted relative to the LD cycle- which is not the case.</p><p>This point needs to be very carefully clarified.</p><p>(2.) Statistics and data presentation</p><p>The information on replicates is insufficient. Clearly define in all cases what &quot;independent measurements&quot; refer to and how many these are exactly in each case. Wherever n is below 10, please provide supplementary plots of the data with individual datapoints shown and refer to this in the respective figure legends.</p><p>Please also more carefully fill the transparent reporting form (e.g. information on group allocation (such as if masking was used?) is stated to be in the figure legends: Where is it?) Metadata can be downloaded from DRYAD, please add this as a statement to the Materials and methods section and below each Figure.</p><p>Importantly: In several cases these metadata are however NOT really self-explanatory and in part a little odd, e.g. Figure 5B- how do the metadata match with what is actually shown in the figure? (Also be aware that there are sometimes different labels in the Excel file itself versus its name. Or file names that could be interpreted as if the same fish and condition was tested twice, e.g. am: folder fish2: fish2_15_2 and fish2_15).</p><p>Statistics: Some stats are using tests that assume a normal distribution (e.g. t-test), but normality is not demonstrated (nor can it be in some cases as the n is too low). Please either verify such analyses with more robust statistical measures or explain why this would not be necessary.</p><p>(3.) Please improve the data presentation in Figure 5, which will likely benefit from a less binary analysis strategy. Why not compute FFTs of each response trace, and extract the power at stimulus frequency? This could be normalised if useful, for example against power at another frequency, or total power in the signal. This would allow plotting some consistent measure of response over circadian time for each stimulus frequency (yielding 5 curves). Presumably, there are also repeats in this data (n = 10 fish per condition? How many stimulus repeats?), which then would again allow quantifying variance as well.</p><p>(4.) The VMR experiments need to be much more carefully interpreted and discussed.</p><p>Firstly, it is not clear at all which of these aspects is due to visual sensation. In fact, zebrafish has 42 opsins, expressed at all kind of places. It has already been shown that eye-independent effects contribute significantly to the movement changes in response to sudden light changes (photokinesis).</p><p>Furthermore, the main difference (perhaps unsurprisingly) is that during the day larvae move more (i.e. higher baseline). When the light changes they presumably &quot;twitch&quot; which gives the peak, but since they are already moving, the relative peak is smaller than for fish at night, which move less as a baseline. Presumably, if fish use the same sort of motor programme in both conditions, they would, perhaps independent of baseline activity, move to a similar degree. This could be the simplest explanation of the fact that the two peaks are almost the same height. The subtle difference could then be explained by all kinds of other things (&quot;warmed up&quot; muscles in the light, possible circadian regulation of central circuits etc?). The OKR differences (Figure S7) are also quite subtle.</p><p>Taking these points together, it appears to be rather unclear how much of the differences can actually be linked to photoreceptor transduction differences in the eyes. The authors need to take all these points into consideration when interpreting their experiment and tone down their claims. The authors might consider to either remove Figure 7 entirely or to shift it into the Supplemental and instead consider a modelling approach. Numerous past phototransduction modelling studies provided amazingly functional frameworks that can be readily explored by &quot;plugging in&quot; some numbers of relative concentrations to see how this affects the photoreceptors. The authors have a beautiful collection of such numbers, for two ages in zebrafish and one in mice. What is the expected functional consequence for the photoresponse, based on all these cycling regulators? Something along these lines (not for a circadian context) was recently used e.g. for Figure 7 in Yoshimatsu et al., 2020 Neuron.</p><p>(5.) The presentation of the bioinformatics analysis for clock-regulated enhancer elements in the retinal gene promoters needs improvement. The data should be expanded significantly to show in detail, for each zebrafish gene, which enhancers have been identified and with which confidence (e.g. divergence from a consensus).</p><p>(6.) The graphical plots in Figures 1 and 2 are misleading. At first glance, they give the impression that samples have been collected over a 48 hours time course, which is incorrect. &quot;Double plotting&quot; of circadian data sets is often used in behavioural actograms, since it makes it easier to see trends in rhythmicity over longer time frames. However, in that situation the data is collected over multiple days and so rhythmicity is clearly demonstrated. In the case of gene expression reported here, a more honest way to present the data is, how it was done in Figure 3. One cycle has been sampled, NOT two, and so rhythmicity has not been directly visualised. However, given the amplitude of the changes in expression that have been observed during the 24 hours cycle, the sound statistical basis and the known regulatory input of the clock in the retina, it is acceptable to claim evidence for rhythmicity.</p><p>Furthermore, the authors should consider to use a more appropriate analysis to test for oscillations, for instance RAIN (Thaben and Westermark, J Biol Rhythms 2014). Given that RAIN does not make assumption on the waveform on the rhythms, it allows for testing of oscillation even under a light regimes that deviates from the standard LD12:12, as in this case. It should be possible to use the independent measurements as repetitions of the time series.</p><p>(7.) In 5 dpf larval zebrafish rods are non-functional. This should be mentioned somewhere, especially since results are to be compared to adults, or to mice, both of which have functional rods.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.68903.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(1.)

We have detailed the procedure of sample collection and light treatment in the Material and Methods section and have added a paragraph to the discussion. Briefly, we detailed that our experimental conditions showed no evidence of inadvertent entrainment signals. The 5 day survey window is probably not enough to significantly deviate from the external rhythm for some genes. Indeed we found some that did shift, one even reversed the cycle. Hence, a systematic error is unlikely since genes are affected differently. Additionally, overall gene expression levels are also differently affected. Some genes were upregulated, while others showed a downregulation under DD conditions.</p><p>One important difference between our study and most published is that we collected eyes, while most studies used whole larvae, which includes other cycling tissues. We argued in the discussion that taking the whole larva may mask cycling of genes that show different expression cycling in different tissues. We show the example of rcv1a in the supplement (Figure 1, supplement Figure 1) where the transcript clearly cycles in the eye but is steady in the pineal.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2.)

The statistics of all figures have been completely redone according current point (Figures 4 to 6) and according to point 6 (applying to Figure 1 to 3). The statistic information is now provided in supplement files 1 to 3 (Figure 1 to 3) and the rest in the metadata set.</p><p>We would like to add that this has really improved the manuscript and forced us to finally get more familiar with R.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3.)

At first glance, they give the impression that samples have been collected over a 48 hours time course, which is incorrect. &quot;Double plotting&quot; of circadian data sets is often used in behavioural actograms, since it makes it easier to see trends in rhythmicity over longer time frames. However, in that situation the data is collected over multiple days and so rhythmicity is clearly demonstrated. In the case of gene expression reported here, a more honest way to present the data is, how it was done in Figure 3. One cycle has been sampled, NOT two, and so rhythmicity has not been directly visualised. However, given the amplitude of the changes in expression that have been observed during the 24 hours cycle, the sound statistical basis and the known regulatory input of the clock in the retina, it is acceptable to claim evidence for rhythmicity.</p><p>Furthermore, the authors should consider to use a more appropriate analysis to test for oscillations, for instance RAIN (Thaben and Westermark, J Biol Rhythms 2014). Given that RAIN does not make assumption on the waveform on the rhythms, it allows for testing of oscillation even under a light regimes that deviates from the standard LD12:12, as in this case. It should be possible to use the independent measurements as repetitions of the time series.</p></disp-quote><p>We performed the statistics and adjusted the plots accordingly (see also response to point 2).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(7.) In 5 dpf larval zebrafish rods are non-functional.

We have now referenced the functional cone only zebrafish retina and specified in each experiment which cone subtype contributes.
