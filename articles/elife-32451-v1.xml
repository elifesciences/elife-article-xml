Here, we describe a new recessive neurodevelopmental syndrome with global developmental delay, seizures and intellectual disability. Using linkage analysis and exome sequencing, we found that this disease maps to chromosome 5q31.1-q34 and is caused by a biallelic germline mutation in <italic>CAMK2A</italic>. The missense mutation, p.His477Tyr is located in the CAMK2A association domain that is critical for its function and localization. Biochemically, the p.His477Tyr mutant is defective in self-oligomerization and unable to assemble into the multimeric holoenzyme.<italic>In vivo</italic>, CAMK2A<sup>H477Y</sup> failed to rescue neuronal defects in <italic>C. elegans</italic> lacking <italic>unc-43</italic>, the ortholog of human <italic>CAMK2A. In vitro</italic>, neurons derived from patient iPSCs displayed profound synaptic defects. Together, our data demonstrate that a recessive germline mutation in <italic>CAMK2A</italic> leads to neurodevelopmental defects in humans and suggest that dysfunctional CAMK2 paralogs may contribute to other neurological disorders.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.32451.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Each year, some children are born with developmental disorders and intellectual disabilities. These conditions are often caused by mutations in specific genes. Sometimes both copies of a gene – one inherited from each parent – need to be mutated for the symptoms to develop. These mutations are known as recessive mutations.</p><p>Here, Chia, Zhong, Niwa et al. diagnosed two siblings in their clinical care with a new form of neurological disease that affects the development of the brain and leads to frequent seizures. To test whether the young patients shared a genetic mutation that could explain their condition, the researchers analyzed the DNA of the children and compared the results with the DNA from their parents and healthy siblings. The results showed that the two children with the condition had inherited a recessive mutation in a gene called <italic>CAMK2A</italic>. The protein this gene encodes helps nerve cells to form connections and communicate with each other, and it has been shown to be essential for learning and memory.</p><p>The CAMK2A enzyme is made up of several identical subunits that form a complex. Chia et al. discovered that the mutation prevented these subunits from joining together properly, resulting in a faulty protein. <italic>CAMK2A</italic> and other related proteins are crucial for the health of the brain in a wide range of animals. Indeed, experiments in <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>, a roundworm commonly used to study neurons, confirmed that the mutation inherited by the children indeed caused similar neurological defects in the worms. Taken together, these experiments suggest that the children’s condition is caused by the mutation in both copies of the <italic>CAMK2A</italic> gene.</p><p>For patients born with inherited diseases, it is often difficult to pinpoint exactly which mutation is responsible for the specific disorder. These findings could therefore help pediatric geneticists recognize this newly defined syndrome and reach the correct diagnoses. These results could also be the starting point for studies that look into restoring the activity of the defective CAMK2A protein.More broadly, identifying genes that are critical for the healthy development of the brain could shed light on common neurological conditions, such as epilepsy and autism.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>neurological disease</kwd><kwd>Mendelian disorder</kwd><kwd>oligomerization</kwd><kwd>intellectual disability</kwd><kwd>seizures</kwd><kwd>CAMK2</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>C. elegans</italic></kwd><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001348</institution-id><institution>Agency for Science, Technology and Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GODAFIT Strategic Positioning Fund</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Reversade</surname><given-names>Bruno</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A biallelic missense mutation in the highly conserved, neuron-specific kinase CAMK2A abrogates holoenzyme assembly and causes a new inherited neurodevelopmental disease.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CAMK2) is a calcium-activated serine/threonine kinase that is extremely abundant in the brain, comprising as much as 0.3% of the total brain protein content (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bennett et al., 1983</xref>). CAMK2 is highly enriched at the synapses and is necessary for the process of long-term potentiation (LTP), the activity-dependent strengthening and modulation of synaptic activity that is thought to be the molecular basis of some forms of learning and memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Kandel et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Lisman et al., 2002</xref>). In humans, there are four genes encoding distinct CAMK2 iso-enzymes. CAMK2A and CAMK2B are the predominant isoforms in the nervous system, with CAMK2A being expressed 3–4 times higher than CAMK2B (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Hanson and Schulman, 1992</xref>). Each enzyme comprises a kinase domain, a regulatory domain and an association domain. Structurally CAMK2 holoenzymes are homo- or hetero-oligomers, consisting of 12 or 14 CAMK2 subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Hudmon and Schulman, 2002b</xref>). The holoenzyme assembly requires the carboxy-terminal association domain, which forms stacked pairs of hexameric or heptameric rings with the regulatory and kinase domain projecting radially to interact with other essential proteins for CAMK2 function and localization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bhattacharyya et al., 2016</xref>). In the absence of calcium signalling, CAMK2 is inactive, as the regulatory domain inhibits kinase function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Yang and Schulman, 1999</xref>). This auto-inhibition is relieved when calcium-loaded calmodulin binds to the regulatory domain, thereby exposing the kinase domain and allowing it to phosphorylate target substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Meador et al., 1993</xref>). Ca<sup>2+</sup>-Calmodulin binding also exposes Thr286 on the regulatory domain of CAMK2A, which becomes phosphorylated in trans by adjacent subunits. Once this residue is phosphorylated, the enzyme is persistently active, even in the absence of continual Ca<sup>2+</sup>-Calmodulin signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Rich and Schulman, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Stratton et al., 2013</xref>). This switch from auto-inhibition to autonomous, persistent activity is thought to constitute a biochemical form of memory, which marks the neuron for having experienced a previous calcium influx (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bhattacharyya et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Stratton et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Stratton et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Mice that are homozygous null for <italic>CAMK2A</italic> are viable and display impaired spatial memory and reduced LTP in the hippocampus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Silva et al., 1992a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">1992b</xref>). The heterozygous mutant (<italic>Camk2a<sup>+/-</sup></italic>) show a significant deficit in spatial working memory and contextual fear memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Frankland et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Matsuo et al., 2009</xref>). More recently, it was demonstrated that mice with neuron-specific conditional knock-out of <italic>CAMK2A</italic> similarly displayed learning deficits and defects in LTP that were comparable to the complete knockout mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Achterberg et al., 2014</xref>). These findings suggest that neuron-intrinsic CAMK2A function is indispensable during the period of learning for memory formation. CAMK2 is conserved in invertebrates, such as <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> and <italic>C. elegans</italic>, where the kinase also plays critical roles in behavioral and cognitive traits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cho et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Hudmon and Schulman, 2002a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Reiner et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Rongo and Kaplan, 1999</xref>). In <italic>C. elegans</italic>, the only CAMK2 is encoded by the <italic>unc-43</italic> gene, which is essential for synaptic function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Rongo and Kaplan, 1999</xref>). Loss of <italic>unc-43</italic> causes worms to have flaccid muscle tone, locomotion defects and spontaneous body contractions that resemble seizures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Reiner et al., 1999</xref>).</p><p>In pediatric care, global developmental delay in infants is defined as a significant functional delay in two or more developmental domains including gross and fine motor function, speech and language, cognition, social development and personal skills (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Quality Standards Subcommittee of the American Academy of Neurology et al., 2003</xref>). These defects are detected at an early age in children age five years or under, and can persist throughout life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Shevell, 2008</xref>). About 25–50% of identified case are caused by germline genetic changes, including chromosomal abnormalities, copy number variants and monogenic mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Srour and Shevell, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">van Bokhoven, 2011</xref>).

Only one candidate locus greater than 5 cM on chromosome 5 spanning 28 Mb was delineated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>). Whole-exome sequencing was subsequently performed on index case II:1. After filtering for variants with low quality and low sequencing coverage, 72 homozygous variants were identified, out of which four lie within the Chr. 5 IBD region (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). Three of the homozygous variants had been previously annotated as known polymorphisms with minor allele frequencies &gt; 0.0001. In addition, healthy individuals who are homozygous for the minor alleles had been identified in genomic sequencing databases such as dbSNP and gnomAD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E</xref>). We therefore filtered out these variants as non-pathogenic. The fourth homozygous variant within the IBD region mapped to the <italic>CAMK2A</italic> gene (MIM: 114078), resulting in a missense mutation p.His477Tyr that has never been observed in previous large-scale sequencing databases and our in-house ethnically-matched cohort (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E</xref>).

To understand how neuronal function is affected due to the mutation in CAMK2A, we reprogrammed primary dermal fibroblasts from patient II.4 into iPSCs, differentiated them into neurons and measured population-level neuronal activity using a multi-electrode array (MEA) system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>).

When these differentiated neurons were plated on MEA plates to measure spontaneous action potentials, we observed a significant reduction in both the total number of spontaneous spikes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, left) and the mean firing rate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, right) in the patient-derived neurons harboring the p.H477Y mutation compared to the wild-type controls, suggesting that CAMK2A<sup>H477Y</sup> causes a profound functional defect in cultured neurons.</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.32451.008</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title><italic>CAMK2A</italic> mutant iPSC-derived neurons are functionally less active.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic of the hPSC-derived neuronal activity assay with representative image of iPSC-derived neurons plated on a multi-electrode array (<bold>B</bold>) Representative confocal images of immunofluorescence staining of neuronal lineage markers TUJ1 (green) and MAP2 (red) show efficient differentiation of iPSCs into neurons.

The identified mutation, p.H477Y is located in the association domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>) and affects a histidine residue that is invariant across all vertebrate and invertebrate CAMK2A homologues.

A third mutant CAMK2A<sup>H477X</sup>, which lacks amino acids 477–489 and thus encodes a truncated association domain, was used as an additional control. Using native lysis conditions that preserve non-covalent macromolecular interactions, we found that wild-type CAMK2A forms a prominent complex with an apparent molecular weight ~1 MDa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, Native-PAGE, lane 2), which is consistent with the 12- or 14- subunit CAMK2A holoenzyme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bhattacharyya et al., 2016</xref>). As compared to wild-type CAMK2A, the ~1 MDa, putatively oligomeric species was drastically reduced for the p.H477Y mutant and was undetectable for the p.H477X mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, Native-PAGE, lane 3 and 4 vs. lane 2). Next, we examined the ability of <italic>in vitro</italic> translated CAMK2A to self-oligomerize in a cell-free system. In contrast to the negative control protein GFP, wild-type FLAG-CAMK2A efficiently co-immunoprecipitated with HA-CAMK2A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>, Lane 10 vs 11). This self-association was preserved between CAMK2A<sup>WT</sup> and CAMK2A<sup>H477Y</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>, lanes 12 and 15), but was completely lost between wild-type CAMK2A and the p.H477X mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>, lane 13). In contrast, we could not detect any self-association between FLAG- CAMK2A<sup>H477Y</sup> and HA- CAMK2A<sup>H477Y</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>, Lane 16). Taken together, these results suggest that the missense p.H477Y partially disrupts the self-association between identical CAMK2A molecules, which had been shown to be required for holoenzyme assembly. The partial loss of function of the p.H477Y mutant, as compared to a more severe mutation p.H477X, is consistent with the observed autosomal recessive inheritance of the disease in the family, where the heterozygous carriers do not display apparent neuro-developmental symptoms.</p><p>During the course of this analysis, we noticed that both p.H477Y and p.H477X mutants had reduced protein abundance. This effect on the p.H477Y mutant was, however, subtle and could not readily explain the difference in the CAMK2A oligomer observed in the native gel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, SDS-PAGE). As it is known that in general fully assembled oligomeric complexes have enhanced stability <italic>in vivo</italic> compared to partially assembled complexes with disrupted folding like CAMK2A<sup>H477Y</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Lord, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Oromendia et al., 2012</xref>), we hypothesized that the p.H477Y mutant may exhibit reduced stability and undergo proteasomal degradation. To test this, 293T cells were transfected with reporter constructs that encode GFP tagged wild-type and mutant CAMK2A followed by a self-cleaving peptide T2A and mCherry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). The intensity of GFP fluorescence was used as a direct quantitative measure of CAMK2A stability with the mCherry as an internal control for transfection and translational efficiency. We observed a significant reduction in GFP intensity in cells expressing CAMK2A<sup>H477Y</sup> and CAMK2A<sup>H477X</sup> as compared to wild-type CAMK2A or GFP alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>) despite comparable mCherry fluorescence levels. This reduction was rescued when we treated the cells with MG132, which blocked proteasomal degradation. MG132 treamentled to enhanced accumulation of the p.H477Y and p.H477X mutant, with a greater effect on p.H477X (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>, lane 3, 4 vs lane 7, 8, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>). By contrast, the level of the wild-type protein was reduced, likely due to the toxic effects of MG132 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>, lane 2 vs. lane 6). These results suggest that in addition to causing reduced holoenzyme assembly, the p.H477Y mutation might also directly or indirectly reduce the overall CAMK2A levels by compromising its half-life.</p><p>To unequivocally demonstrate the pathogenicity of the p.H477Y allele <italic>in vivo</italic>, we performed rescue experiments using <italic>C. elegans</italic>. A single ortholog of CAMK2, encoded by <italic>unc-43</italic>, is present in the worm genome and its functions in the nervous system are welldocumented (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Reiner et al., 1999</xref>). To study the neuronal defects caused by loss of <italic>unc-43</italic>, we focused on motor neuron, DA9, which has its cell body located in the pre-anal ganglion with a dendrite that extends anteriorly and a posteriorly oriented axon extending via a commissure into the dorsal nerve cord, where it proceeds anteriorly to form approximately 25 <italic>en passant</italic> synapses onto body wall muscles and reciprocal inhibitory neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Klassen and Shen, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Maeder et al., 2014</xref>). Using mCherry-tagged UNC-43, we observed that UNC-43 could be found along the entire DA9 neuron but concentrated at synaptic boutons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). The homologous patient-specific mutation p.H466Y in UNC-43 (homologous to p.H477Y in human CAMK2A) significantly disrupted the synaptic localization of UNC-43 and caused the protein to be dispersed throughout the entire axon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). To test the consequence of UNC-43 mutation on DA9 synaptic function, we used the <italic>itr-1 pB</italic> promoter to express the fluorescently conjugated synaptic vesicle marker RAB-3 (RAB3::GFP) within DA9 in both the wild-type and <italic>unc-43</italic> mutant background. In wild-type animals, RAB-3::GFP accumulated in discrete puncta along the axon of DA9 at stereotyped synaptic locations. In the canonical <italic>unc-43(e408)</italic> loss-of-function mutant, we observed a reduction in individual pre-synaptic puncta fluorescence intensity as compared to wild-type animals. This phenotype could be rescued by cell-autonomous expression of wild-type <italic>unc-43</italic> in DA9. However, expression of <italic>unc-43</italic> harboring the homologous patient mutation UNC-43<sup>H466Y</sup> failed to rescue this defect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C,D</xref>). In addition, transgenic expression of human wild-type CAMK2A fully rescued this defect, confirming the high degree of functional conservation between CAMK2A homologs, while the patient-derived human CAMK2A<sup>H477Y</sup> failed to do so (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>, bottom panels).

Mechanistically this mutation disrupts CAMK2A self-oligomerization and holoenzyme assembly via its association domain. Our functional results are consistent with the high degree of evolutionary conservation of the affected residue H477 in CAMK2A orthologs, as well as previous structural data demonstrating that His477 is located in the interface between two stacked CAMK2A subunits, which together form the basic repeat unit of the ring-shaped holoenzyme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bhattacharyya et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Stratton et al., 2014</xref>).

Notably, a de novo p.E183V mutation in the CAMK2A catalytic domain was shown to cause autism spectrum disorder (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Stephenson et al., 2017</xref>). This mutation was shown to act in a dominant-negative manner to reduce wild-type CAMK2A auto-phosphorylation and localization to dendritic spines. While this manuscript was under revision, S. Küry <italic>et al</italic>. reported multiple families with intellectual disability caused by de novo, heterozygous mutations in both CAMK2A and CAMK2B kinase and auto-regulatory domains, which disrupted CAMK2 phosphorylation and caused neuronal migratory defects in murine models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Küry et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Our discovery of a novel neuro-developmental syndrome caused by biallelic CAMK2A mutations further broadens the spectrum of human neurological disorders caused by the CAMK2 family of kinases. To the best of our knowledge, this represents the first Mendelian human disease caused by biallelic CAMK2A mutations. Our functional characterization of the novel mutation p.H477Y <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> also reveal novel insights on how the CAMK2A holoenzyme regulates neuronal function. In contrast to all previously reported mutations in CAMK2A in intellectual disability syndromes, the p.H477Y is located within the C-terminal association domain and results in a partial but significant disruption of self-oligomerization, suggesting that the assembly of CAMK2A oligomers, in addition to its kinase function is required for neuronal function. Interestingly, the CAMK2A<sup>H477Y</sup> mutant retains the ability to interact with wild-type CAMK2A but not with itself (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). CAMK2A displays very specific cellular and subcellular expression patterns that is important for regulating substrate phosphorylation in cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Liu and Murray, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Tsui et al., 2005</xref>). The p.H477Y missense affects the subcellular localization in neurons and this may affect its ability to function efficiently. These biochemical results provide a mechanistic basis for the autosomal recessive nature of the disease in our family: the p.H477Y allele is hypomorphic and becomes pathogenic when recessively inherited in the homozygous state. We speculate that heterozygous carriers retain sufficient CAMK2A activity for proper neuronal function. As compared to the milder disease phenotypes reported by Kury et. al., the symptoms afflicting the p.H477Y patients likely represent the most severe manifestation of the CAMK2A dysfunction in humans.</p><p>Due to the high degree of conservation of CAMK2A across evolution, we employed the established <italic>C. elegans unc-43</italic> mutant to prove the pathogenicity of the p.H477Y mutation. UNC-43 is the worm homologue of vertebrate CAMK2. We demonstrated wild-type human CAMK2A could rescue the locomotive defects of the <italic>unc-43</italic> mutants, while the p.H477Y mutant failed to do so, likely due to its inability to localize into neuronal synapses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). We anticipate this <italic>in vivo</italic> functional assay in <italic>C. elegans</italic> to be widely applicable to assess the pathogenicity of newly discovered CAMK2 alleles found in human diseases.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type (species) <break/>or resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="bottom">Gene (human)</td><td valign="bottom">CAMK2A Calcium/Calmodulin Dependent Protein Kinase II Alpha</td><td valign="bottom">Uniprot: Isoform B (identifier: Q9UQM7-2)</td><td valign="bottom">Q9UQM7-2</td><td valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td valign="bottom">Gene (<italic>C. elegans</italic>)</td><td valign="bottom">unc-43 Calcium/Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinase type II</td><td valign="bottom">Protein UNC-43 isoform d (Wormbase CDS K11E8.1d)</td><td valign="bottom">K11E8.1d</td><td valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td valign="bottom">Strain, strain background (<italic>C. elegans</italic>)</td><td valign="bottom">Worm (C. elegans) N2 Bristol Strain;unc-43(e408)</td><td valign="bottom">Caenorhabditis Genetics Center (CGC) PMID: 17941711</td><td valign="bottom">17941711</td><td valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td valign="bottom">Recombinant DNA</td><td valign="bottom">pCDH-CMV-MCS-EF1α-Neo</td><td valign="bottom">Systems Biosciences (SBI)</td><td valign="bottom">CD514B-1</td><td valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td valign="bottom">Recombinant DNA</td><td valign="bottom">pSM vector (a derivative of pPD49.26 with additional cloning sites)</td><td valign="bottom">Modified for this paper</td><td valign="bottom">NA</td><td>ADDGENE <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://media.addgene.org/cms/files/Vec95.pdf">https://media.addgene.org/cms/files/Vec95.pdf</ext-link></td></tr><tr><td valign="bottom">Recombinant DNA</td><td valign="bottom">pCDH-CMV-CAMK2A-T2A-mCherry</td><td valign="bottom">This paper;

The strength of the manuscript is that a family is described where two children are homozygous for a missense mutation in CaMKIIalpha. Biochemical characterisation of the missense mutation strongly suggests that this mutation causes loss-of function, by not only preventing oligomerisation of CaMKIIalpha subunits, but also mislocalising CaMKIIalpha to the nucleus and enhancing the proteasomal dedragation of the kinase subunits. I think that this work is important that it deserves to be published in <italic>eLife</italic>. I have some suggestions that can further strengthen the manuscript:</p><p>1) I could not find any data regarding impaired intellectual disability. If possible, could such data be included?</p><p>2) Regarding the table in Figure 1—figure supplement 1, it would be amazing if data for heterozygous and wild-type children could be included. This would provide very strong evidence that specifically the missense mutation causes the observed phenotypes. Would you have patient consent to include such information?</p><p>3) The authors found that the identified missense mutation mislocalizes CaMKIIalpha to nucleus in a non-neuronal cell line. If possible, it would be good to show that this also happens in primary neurons. This would suggest that CaMKIIalpha with the missense mutation is not delivered to synapses, substantially blocking synaptic plasticity.</p><p>4) Unfortunately, the presented in vivo studies with <italic>C. elegans</italic> focus on the wrong neuronal cell type. In mammals CaMKIIalpha is expressed exclusively in glutamatergic neurons (not cholinergic motoneurons). Therefore, I think that Figure 2 must be removed from the manuscript, as the findings are misleading. -- In my opinion, for this manuscript it is not necessary to include in vivo data. However, if authors wish to include in vivo data, then they should focus on the correct neuronal cell type in any in vivo system.</p><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>Chia and colleagues have authored a potentially important manuscript identifying an association between a novel homozygous missense mutation in CAMK2A and global neurodevelopmental delay with severe intellectual disability, seizures, and delayed growth. Although interesting, a number of major issues need to be addressed:</p><p>1) Substantially more details are required regarding the genetic analysis, in order to better establish the likely causality of the candidate CAMK2A mutation. In particular, the workflow by which the proposed causative variant has been identified needs to be much better clarified.</p><p>a) Can the authors provide additional pedigree data regarding the parental consanguineous relationship? If not, then on what basis are the parents reported as consanguineous?</p><p>b) The authors should provide the genome-wide results of the homozygosity mapping prior to filtering out homozygous segments found in the unaffected family members, and prior to filtering for regions of homozygosity &gt;5cM.</p><p>c) On what basis have the authors established the &quot;confidence criteria to identify IBD blocks were a minimum of 5 cM&quot;?</p><p>d) Regarding the variants identified by exome sequencing, the authors should minimally provide a list of all 72 homozygous protein-coding variants with MAF&lt;1%, and sufficient information to determine their localization within the regions of homozygosity in all of the genotyped family members.</p><p>2) Functional experiments: a) The authors convincingly establish that the H477Y mutation blocks oligomerization of the CAMK2A holoenzyme. However, they subsequently attempt to evaluate protein stability using MG132. I have some difficulties with this experiment.</p><p>Specifically, how can it be that in the DMSO treated lysates (Figure 2—figure supplement 2C), such big differences are found between the different CAMK2A construct expression levels, whereas in Figure 1H the expression levels are similar?</p><p>Was each experiment done at different time points after transfection?</p><p>How do the authors control for transfection efficiency? Based on the results shown here, in the absence of a demonstration that the transfection efficiency was equal across the various constructs, it is difficult to reach a firm conclusion regarding the stability or expression levels of CAMK2A [H477Y].</p><p>b) Figure 2C and 2E: The images provided are consistent with a rescue of the synaptic phenotype when expressing either Unc-43 or wild-type human CAMK2, but not with the H477Y mutant. However, the experimental design is unclear.</p><p>The legend reports n&gt;80 (Figure 2C) and n=100 (Figure 2E). But what does 'n' represent (e.g., is this the number of puncta, images, or worms measured)? For Figure 2C, why is it not possible to provide an exact value?</p><p>c) Figure 2C: Why do the authors use a Student's t-test for these data? If they want to compare the different conditions, a one-way ANOVA with post-hoc correction should be applied.</p><p>d) Figure 2D: By what criteria have the authors defined the asynaptic region?</p><p>e) The Unc-43 worm has clear phenotypes, as the authors themselves describe in the Results section: &quot;Null mutants for unc-43 are flaccid in posture and move with a flattened uncoordinated waveform.&quot; These phenotypes are very clear. Why didn't they try rescuing these phenotypes? This would have provided a much stronger opportunity to assess the functional relevance of the rescue experiments.</p><p>f) What is the relevance of examining the localization of the association domain? The authors reason that since the mutation blocks oligomerization, it is more likely to diffuse through the nuclear pore, thereby reducing cytosolic accumulation. But does the association domain itself oligomerize in HEK293T cells?</p><p>The authors seem to infer on the basis of these experiments that CAMK2A is likely to be mislocalized in the homozygous H477Y carriers. However, they would need to show the same experiment using full-length reference and mutant CAMK2A in order to establish more definitive evidence.</p><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>The manuscript &quot;A homozygous loss-of-function CaAMK2A mutation causes loss of growth, frequent seizures, and severe intellectual disability&quot; uses sequencing of patient DNA, biochemistry, and <italic>C. elegans</italic> phenotyping to characterize a novel coding mutation preventing holoenzyme formation in CaMKIIalpha protein in humans. The authors demonstrate that an autosomal recessive mutation in a histidine residue critical for association domain interactions is associated with disease state in a human family, then go on to use traditional biochemistry to show that this mutant kinase forms interactions with WT but not with itself, a finding beautifully consistent with the recessive nature of the disease state. Further, they use a rescue strategy in a <italic>C. elegans</italic> model lacking expression of the CaMKII homolog to show that neither the human nor the worm kinase with this mutation can rescue worm phenotype, while either WT kinase does so. Because CaMKII has long been associated with cognition through mostly mouse studies but has never before been directly and causally tied to a human cognitive disorder, this is a very exciting finding that will help to validate and reinvigorate study of this essential molecule. The paper is clear and well-written, the experiments directly address the hypotheses and are appropriately interpreted (for the most part – see below), and the findings are certain to strongly impact the field. I have some minor concerns below about interpretation and mechanism, and one somewhat larger concern:</p><p>The <italic>C. elegans</italic> experiments are very convincing. However, I wonder whether the mutant and WT CaMKII proteins used in the rescue experiments have the same localization. This ought to be very easy to determine by immunofluorescence, even if the constructs aren't tagged. Does the mutant accumulate in the nucleus of the <italic>C. elegans</italic> neurons as it does in HEK cells? Does the WT adopt a postsynaptic localization? Data such as these would greatly strengthen the manuscript.</p><p>Overall, I am highly enthusiastic about this manuscript.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.32451.018</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>This manuscript is of fundamental importance for the CaMKII field, as for the first time it makes a convincing case that CaMKII dysfunction is relevant for brain diseases.

In the initial submission, the nuclear localization was shown using GFP-tagged to the CAMK2A association domain, but not with the full length CAMK2A protein.

In vertebrates, CAMKII isoforms are encoded by at least four genes (⍺, β, γ, δ). In the worm, the <italic>unc-43</italic> gene encodes only one CaMKII orthologue which is found in all neurons. Mutations in <italic>unc-43</italic> cause multiple behavioral defects in locomotory activity, in the clock control of defecation, in the regulation of body-wall muscle excitation and spontaneous activity (David et al., 1999). Thus in <italic>C. elegans, unc-43</italic> can perform all these functions regardless of the neuronal cell type in which it is expressed.</p><p>CAMK2 is highly conserved from humans to worm. We show in Figure 4C and 4F that the human CAMK2A orthologue is able to fully rescue synaptic defects due to the loss of <italic>unc-43</italic> in the DA9 neuron. This indicates that the human CAMK2A functions similarly in cholinergic neurons of <italic>C. elegans</italic>. More importantly, the identified patient mutation p.H477Y when introduced in either UNC-43 or CAMK2A, is unable to rescue the <italic>unc-43</italic> synaptic defects.</p><p>To further strengthen this data, we have performed behavioural rescue experiments by expressing either wildtype or H466Y mutated UNC-43 protein in worms defective for <italic>unc-43.</italic> We have used a pan-neuronal promoter to express UNC-43 in all neurons and scored the phenotype in a double-blind experimental setup. Consistently, we observe that the wildtype UNC-43, but not UNC-43<sup>H466Y</sup>, is able to fully rescue all behavioral defects of <italic>unc-43</italic> worms. This is providing further evidence that the patient identified mutation renders CAMK2A non-functional in multiple in vivo assays.</p><p>We believe the <italic>C. elegans</italic> data are key to prove the pathogenicity of this human allele. They are now complemented by functional assays using patient IPSCs-derived neurons (Figure 2).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>Chia and colleagues have authored a potentially important manuscript identifying an association between a novel homozygous missense mutation in CAMK2A and global neurodevelopmental delay with severe intellectual disability, seizures, and delayed growth. Although interesting, a number of major issues need to be addressed:</p><p>1) Substantially more details are required regarding the genetic analysis, in order to better establish the likely causality of the candidate CAMK2A mutation. In particular, the workflow by which the proposed causative variant has been identified needs to be much better clarified.</p></disp-quote><p>We have included in this revised manuscript, a more detailed description of the pipeline, including IBD mapping, whole-exome sequencing and data filtering. We are adhering to our standard operating procedures which have allowed us to genetically diagnose numerous Mendelian disorders over the years (Reversade et al., 2009; Bonnard et al., 2012; Hu and Pomp, 2014; Cetinkaya and Xiong, 2016; Zhong et al., 2016; Gordon and Xue, 2017).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>a) Can the authors provide additional pedigree data regarding the parental consanguineous relationship? If not, then on what basis are the parents reported as consanguineous?</p></disp-quote><p>We could not obtain additional medical record from members of the extended family. We confirm that parents are first cousins as stated by them during several clinical visits. This is independently verified from the SNP genotyping analysis of their 5 children. On average, 10% of the children’s genomes are homozygous- proving that their parents are at least first cousins.</p><p><table-wrap id="inlinetable2" position="anchor"><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><tbody><tr><td colspan="3" valign="top">% of homozygosity in all children from family</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Child</td><td valign="top">Mb</td><td valign="top">% homozygous</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">II-1</td><td valign="top">309.4</td><td valign="top">10.3</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">II-2</td><td valign="top">319.2</td><td valign="top">10.6</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">II-3</td><td valign="top">378.2</td><td valign="top">12.6</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">II-4</td><td valign="top">310.2</td><td valign="top">10.3</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">II-5</td><td valign="top">183.1</td><td valign="top">6.1</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>b) The authors should provide the genome-wide results of the homozygosity mapping prior to filtering out homozygous segments found in the unaffected family members, and prior to filtering for regions of homozygosity &gt;5cM.</p></disp-quote><p>These data are now provided in Supplemental file 1 and Figure 1—figure supplement 1D.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>c) On what basis have the authors established the &quot;confidence criteria to identify IBD blocks were a minimum of 5 cM&quot;?</p></disp-quote><p>IBD regions &lt;5 cM are likely to be false positives.

Briefly, four homozygous variants from the proband’s exome were identified within the chromosome 5 IBD candidate block. Notably, homozygotes for these variants, except the CAMK2A<sup>H477Y</sup> allele, have been identified in public sequencing databases, such as ExAC and GnomAD, and therefore can be ruled out.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Functional experiments: a) The authors convincingly establish that the H477Y mutation blocks oligomerization of the CAMK2A holoenzyme. However, they subsequently attempt to evaluate protein stability using MG132. I have some difficulties with this experiment.</p><p>Specifically, how can it be that in the DMSO treated lysates (Figure S2C), such big differences are found between the different CAMK2A construct expression levels, whereas in Figure 1H the expression levels are similar?</p><p>Was each experiment done at different time points after transfection?</p><p>How do the authors control for transfection efficiency? Based on the results shown here, in the absence of a demonstration that the transfection efficiency was equal across the various constructs, it is difficult to reach a firm conclusion regarding the stability or expression levels of CAMK2A [H477Y].</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for encouraging us to improve these results. These experiments have been significantly revised with improved constructs consisting of a single cistronic T2A-mCherry cassette to control for both transfection and translation efficiency. These results are described in Figure 3E, 3F and Figure 2—figure supplement 2B.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>b) Figure 2C and 2E: The images provided are consistent with a rescue of the synaptic phenotype when expressing either Unc-43 or wild-type human CAMK2, but not with the H477Y mutant. However, the experimental design is unclear.</p><p>The legend reports n&gt;80 (Figure 2C) and n=100 (Figure 2E). But what does 'n' represent (e.g., is this the number of puncta, images, or worms measured)? For Figure 2C, why is it not possible to provide an exact value?</p></disp-quote><p>We have made changes in the legend text to clarify the exact parameter of measurement for each experiment. For instance, “error bars represent SEM with number of synaptic puncta quantified n&gt; 80” and “Graph shows the percentage of animals with the WT and <italic>unc-43</italic> mutant phenotypes with n=100 animals scored for each line”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>c) Figure 2C: Why do the authors use a Student's t-test for these data? If they want to compare the different conditions, a one-way ANOVA with post-hoc correction should be applied.</p></disp-quote><p>The statistics for experiments comparing multiple conditions has been revised according to your suggestions. We have implemented a one-way ANOVA test with either Bonferroni post-hoc test or two-way ANOVA with Tukey post-hoc test.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>d) Figure 2D: By what criteria have the authors defined the asynaptic region?</p></disp-quote><p>The asynaptic region is the defined as the part of the axon extending out from the DA9 cell body to the first <italic>en passant</italic> synapse located on the dorsal part of the axon. It has been shown that the positional information required to define this asynaptic region is controlled by <italic>lin-44</italic>/Wnt secreted by four hypodermal cells in the tail of the worm (Klassen and Shen, (2007). This asynaptic region of the axon is also defined by different synaptic vesicle transport dynamics as compared to the dendrite and distal axon of DA9 (Maeder et al., (2014).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>e) The Unc-43 worm has clear phenotypes, as the authors themselves describe in the Results section: &quot;Null mutants for unc-43 are flaccid in posture and move with a flattened uncoordinated waveform.&quot; These phenotypes are very clear. Why didn't they try rescuing these phenotypes? This would have provided a much stronger opportunity to assess the functional relevance of the rescue experiments.</p></disp-quote><p>We have carried out a behavioral rescue as shown Figure 3G: in contrast to UNC-43<sup>wild-type</sup>, UNC-43<sup>H466Y</sup> which is homologous to CAMK2A<sup>H477Y</sup>, completely failed to rescue the uncoordinated and convulsive phenotype of the mutant <italic>unc-43</italic> worms. Thank you for suggesting this crucial experiment which provides further support to our initial observation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>f) What is the relevance of examining the localization of the association domain? The authors reason that since the mutation blocks oligomerization, it is more likely to diffuse through the nuclear pore, thereby reducing cytosolic accumulation. But does the association domain itself oligomerize in HEK293T cells?</p></disp-quote><p>We have removed these data to avoid any confusion. Our biochemical data using native PAGE and co-immunoprecipitation (Figure 3C,D) support the oligomerization defect when CAMK2A was expressed in 293T cells as well as when translated in vitro.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors seem to infer on the basis of these experiments that CAMK2A is likely to be mislocalized in the homozygous H477Y carriers. However, they would need to show the same experiment using full-length reference and mutant CAMK2A in order to establish more definitive evidence.</p></disp-quote><p>These experiments are now shown in Figure 3E and Figure 2—figure supplement 2B, with full length CAMK2A. We focused on the most striking difference, which was the reduction in overall level in mutant CAMK2A.</p></body></sub-article></article>
