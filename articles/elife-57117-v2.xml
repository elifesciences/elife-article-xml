formation of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) at specific genomic locations that correspond to PRDM9-binding sites. The molecular steps occurring from PRDM9 binding to DSB formation are unknown. Using proteomic approaches to find PRDM9 partners, we identified HELLS, a member of the SNF2-like family of chromatin remodelers. Upon functional analyses during mouse male meiosis, we demonstrated that HELLS is required for PRDM9 binding and DSB activity at PRDM9 sites. However, HELLS is not required for DSB activity at PRDM9-independent sites. HELLS is also essential for 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) enrichment at PRDM9 sites. Analyses of 5hmC in mice deficient for SPO11, which catalyzes DSB formation, and in PRDM9 methyltransferase deficient mice reveal that 5hmC is triggered at DSB-prone sites upon PRDM9 binding and histone modification, but independent of DSB activity. These findings highlight the complex regulation of the chromatin and epigenetic environments at PRDM9-specified hotspots.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>PRDM9</kwd><kwd>HELLS</kwd><kwd>lsh</kwd><kwd>5hmC</kwd><kwd>recombination</kwd><kwd>meiosis</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000781</institution-id><institution>European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>322788</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>de Massy</surname><given-names>Bernard</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>MSDAVenir</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Gene-IGH</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>de Massy</surname><given-names>Bernard</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100007492</institution-id><institution>Fondation Bettencourt Schueller</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>de Massy</surname><given-names>Bernard</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002915</institution-id><institution>Fondation pour la Recherche Médicale</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Biot</surname><given-names>Mathilde</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Biochemical and genetic approaches uncover a chromatin remodeler for PRDM9 binding and the parallel local epigenetic modification of cytosines in mouse spermatocytes.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>In sexual reproduction, genetic information from both parental genomes is reassorted through chromosome segregation during meiosis. Additional genetic diversity is generated by recombination events between parental homologous chromosomes (homologs) that take place during the first meiotic prophase. Meiotic recombination leads to reciprocal (crossover) and non-reciprocal (gene conversion) transfer of genetic information. Crossovers establish physical links between homologs that are maintained until the end of prophase of the first meiotic division and are essential for the proper segregation of homologs at the first meiotic division. Gene conversion without crossovers promotes interactions between homologs, thus mechanistically contributing to the proper execution of the crossover pathway. Gene conversion also leads locally to the replacement of small regions (typically, from a few to a few hundred base pairs) from one parental genome to the other (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chen et al., 2007</xref>). Therefore, meiotic homologous recombination enhances genetic diversity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Coop and Przeworski, 2007</xref>) and is essential for fertility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Hunter, 2015</xref>). Homologous recombination events are generated by the programmed induction of DNA double- strand breaks (DSBs) followed by their repair, as a crossover or not, with a chromatid from the homolog (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Baudat and de Massy, 2007</xref>). Meiotic DSBs are tightly controlled in time, space, and frequency to drive the homologous recombination pathway while keeping genome integrity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">de Massy, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Keeney et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Sasaki et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>Remarkably, two distinct pathways control DSB localization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Lichten and de Massy, 2011</xref>). In several species, including plants and fungi, DSBs occur at promoter regions or regions of accessible chromatin without detectable sequence specificity. This pattern of DSB localization has been thoroughly analyzed in <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Pan et al., 2011</xref>). The DSB machinery, which involves several proteins including Spo11 that carries the catalytic activity for DNA cleavage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">de Massy, 2013</xref>), is somehow directed to such accessible chromatin sites. Several factors that act locally, such as chromatin structure, but also higher order chromosome organization features are important for DSB formation at these accessible regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Lam and Keeney, 2015</xref>). In contrast, in humans and mice, and possibly in some non-mammalian species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baker et al., 2017</xref>), DSBs occur at sites bound by PRDM9 and not at promoters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Pratto et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Smagulova et al., 2011</xref>). The <italic>Prdm9</italic> gene, which is present in a wide range of metazoans, is expressed specifically in meiocytes, at the stage of meiotic DSB formation. It encodes a protein that has a sequence-specific DNA- binding domain with multiple potential targets in the genome. PRDM9 also has a PR-SET domain with methyltransferase activity and promotes the tri-methylation of lysine 4 (H3K4me3) and of lysine 36 (H3K36me3) of histone H3 on nucleosomes adjacent to PRDM9-binding sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Grey et al., 2018</xref>). This methyltransferase activity is essential for DSB formation at PRDM9 sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Diagouraga et al., 2018</xref>). In mice lacking PRDM9, DSBs form at promoters and enhancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Brick et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Mihola et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>The various steps that take place from PRDM9 binding to DSB formation are still poorly understood. Specifically, it is not known how the DSB machinery is recruited or activated, and how the different molecular steps proceed in a local chromatin environment that is a priori not specified before PRDM9 binding. Moreover, upon binding, PRDM9 promotes chromatin modifications with the deposition of H3K4me3 and H3K36me3 on adjacent nucleosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Baker et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Grey et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Powers et al., 2016</xref>). One or both of these modifications are predicted to be required for DSB activity, because PRDM9 methyltransferase is essential for DSB activity at PRDM9 sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Diagouraga et al., 2018</xref>), unless another substrate of PRDM9 methyltransferase is involved. In addition, these histone modifications may play a role in DSB repair. Indeed, ZCWPW1, a protein reader of H3K4me3 and H3K36me3, is required for efficient DSB repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Huang et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Li et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Mahgoub et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Wells et al., 2019</xref>). Whatever their exact role, the presence of both histone modifications leads to a unique chromatin landscape at PRDM9 sites that is not present at promoters, where H3K36me3 is depleted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Grey et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Lam et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Powers et al., 2016</xref>). Therefore, the specific chromatin environment at PRDM9 sites may be important for DSB activity and repair. In mice lacking PRDM9, where DSBs form mainly at promoters and enhancers, an inefficient DSB repair is observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Brick et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Hayashi and Matsui, 2006</xref>), which could be due to the chromatin environment at those sites, and/or alternatively to improper regulation of DSB formation.</p><p>Other histone modifications have been identified at PRDM9 sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Buard et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Davies et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Lam et al., 2019</xref>). It has been proposed that epigenetic features at DSB hotspots are also responsible for some of the observed DSB activity differences in male and female mouse meiosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Brick et al., 2018</xref>). Indeed, besides chromatin, the global cytosine methylation level is different between sexes: low in prophase oocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Kagiwada et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Seisenberger et al., 2012</xref>) and high in spermatocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Gaysinskaya et al., 2018</xref>). Cytosine methylation is a dynamic epigenetic modification that can be removed by the actions of ten-eleven-translocation (TET) enzymes, the first product of which is 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Tahiliani et al., 2009</xref>). Interestingly, a local increase in 5hmC has been detected at PRDM9 sites in mouse spermatocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Brick et al., 2018</xref>), indicative of another potential layer of modification at DSB sites.</p><p>To gain insights into these molecular steps and to identify proteins involved at PRDM9-binding sites, we developed a proteomic approach to identify PRDM9 partners. We found that HELLS, a member of the SNF2-like family of chromatin remodelers, interacts with PRDM9. This interaction has also been recently shown by Spruce and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Spruce et al., 2020</xref>). Interestingly, HELLS was previously implicated in the regulation of DNA methylation, transposable element expression, heterochromatin dynamics, and DSB repair in somatic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Burrage et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Dennis et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Kollárovič et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Lungu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Yu et al., 2014b</xref>). HELLS is also required for female and male meiosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">De La Fuente et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Zeng et al., 2011</xref>). A recent study showed that HELLS is needed for proper meiotic DSB localization and acts as a PRDM9-dependent chromatin remodeler of meiotic hotspots (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Spruce et al., 2020</xref>). Here, we found that in mouse male meiosis, HELLS is directly involved in the control of DSB activity by ensuring PRDM9 binding and thus DSB formation at PRDM9-dependent sites, consistent with the results obtained by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Spruce et al., 2020</xref>. This HELLS activity appears to solve the challenge of chromatin accessibility for PRDM9 binding. We also show that HELLS-dependent PRDM9 binding and PRDM9 methyltransferase activity are required for efficient 5hmC enrichment at PRDM9-binding sites. This epigenetic modification is a feature of PRDM9-specified hotspots that is not dependent on DSB formation.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>HELLS interacts with PRDM9</title><p>To identify proteins that interact with PRDM9 we first chose to express a tagged version of human PRDM9 in HeLa S3 cells, which do not express PRDM9 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Morin et al., 2008</xref>), and performed immunoprecipitation (IP) followed by mass spectrometry analysis allowing us to identify candidates that are not germline-specific.

PRDM9 peptides were the first and the third most abundant peptides for Nt- and Ct-tagged PRDM9, respectively, only in the 70–80 kD size range (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). Although the predicted molecular weight (MW) of tagged PRDM9 is 103 kD, its detection in the 70–80 kD size range is compatible with its faster than predicted migration during denaturing gel electrophoresis (see western blots in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="table1sdata1">Table 1—source data 1</xref>). HELLS peptides were the first and the second most abundant peptides for Nt- and Ct-tagged PRDM9, respectively, only in the 95–120 kD size range, in agreement with HELLS predicted MW (97 kD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Jarvis et al., 1996</xref>). Then, we repeated the experiments, but without size selection and by analyzing the full protein content after affinity purification. This analysis confirmed the pilot experiment findings, and highlighted HELLS as a major PRDM9 partner. In this condition, with both Nt- and Ct-tagged PRDM9, HELLS was the first in the list of proteins identified by mass spectrometry and ranked by peptide abundance. We did not detect HELLS peptides in IP experiments from HeLa S3 cells without the PRDM9-expressing vector. The PRDM9 and HELLS peptide counts, and protein coverages are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref> (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref> for the full list of proteins). We did not perform any other analysis or quantification of the proteome present in these samples for this study.</p><p>As HELLS is expressed in gonads and is essential for gametogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">De La Fuente et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Zeng et al., 2011</xref>), we then tried but failed to detect any interaction between HELLS and PRDM9 by western blotting after IP of mouse testis protein extracts. This could be due to technical problems linked to the used antibodies since this interaction was recently detected in mouse testis extracts by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Spruce et al., 2020</xref>. Therefore, we used mass spectrometry after IP with a polyclonal antibody against PRDM9 or normal rabbit serum (mock) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="table1sdata1">Table 1—source data 1</xref>). The relative abundance of HELLS peptides was lower in the assays with mouse testis extracts compared with HeLa S3 cell extracts, partly due to higher noise. Nevertheless, HELLS peptides were enriched in extracts purified with the anti-PRDM9 antibody, compared with mock control. In three independent experiments, 14, 6, and 7 HELLS peptides were obtained after IP with the anti-PRDM9 antibody, and 6, 5, and one in the mock controls (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). HELLS enrichment in IP experiments with the anti-PRDM9 antibody was also revealed by quantification based on the Label-Free-Quantification ranks (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>).</p><p>As a complementary approach to proteomics, we searched for PRDM9 partners by yeast two-hybrid screening. Using mouse PRDM9 without zinc fingers as bait and a mouse juvenile testis cDNA bank, we identified six clones that corresponded to HELLS, indicating a direct interaction between PRDM9 and HELLS. All six clones shared a domain that included residues 30 to 448 of HELLS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). To better map the HELLS region involved in the interaction with PRDM9, we generated different HELLS constructs and found that the C-terminal region (569-821) of HELLS was dispensable for this interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). We could not detect any interaction with PRDM9 upon deletions at the N-terminus or C-terminus of the 1–569 region, such as in the HELLS constructs 193–569 and 1–408, respectively. This suggests the potential involvement of the N-terminal (1-193) and of the central (408-569) regions of HELLS in the interaction with PRDM9 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>HELLS interacts with PRDM9.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Domains of PRDM9 and HELLS PRDM9 includes a Krüppel-associated box domain (KRAB), a synovial sarcoma-X break point-repression domain (SSXRD), a Su(var)3–9, Polycomb-group protein enhancer of zeste and trithorax-group protein TRX domain (PR/SET) that is preceded and followed by zinc-finger domains (ZK and ZF, respectively), and a C2H2-type zinc-finger array (C2H2 ZF array).

A previous study where HELLS-deficient testes were analyzed by allografting embryonic tissues showed that HELLS is required for meiotic progression during spermatogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Zeng et al., 2011</xref>). A potential interpretation for this meiotic defect was that alterations of DNA methylation in the absence of HELLS may affect, directly or indirectly, some properties of meiotic prophase and synapsis between homologous chromosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Zeng et al., 2011</xref>).

In testis nuclear extracts from 22 dpp <italic>Hells</italic> cKO animals, HELLS level was greatly reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>), but not the nuclear PRDM9 protein level. The residual HELLS protein expression in testis nuclear extracts from <italic>Hells</italic> cKO mice might be due to incomplete CRE-induced deletion of <italic>Hells</italic> in some spermatocytes, as suggested by the cytological analysis presented below. We analyzed HELLS staining by immunofluorescence on spread spermatocytes of adult <italic>Hells</italic> CTRL and <italic>Hells</italic> cKO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>).

The presence of 11% of tubules with some haploid cells might be explained by incomplete HELLS depletion in some spermatocytes. Moreover, the percentage of tubules with one or more TUNEL-positive cells was increased, indicative of apoptotic cells undergoing massive genomic DNA breakage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Meiotic prophase is defective in <italic>Hells</italic> cKO spermatocytes.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Detection of PRDM9, HELLS and SYCP3 expression in nuclear fractions of testes from <italic>Hells</italic> CTRL (<italic>Hells<sup>fl/+</sup></italic> and <italic>Hells<sup>fl/-</sup></italic>) and <italic>Hells</italic> cKO mice at 22 dpp.<italic> Hells</italic> alleles are presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>.

We detected chromosome axes by the presence of the axial protein SYCP3, and synapses by the presence of the central element protein SYCP1. Ninety three percent of <italic>Hells</italic> CTRL nuclei that showed full-length axes were at the pachytene stage with 19 fully synapsed autosomes and a γH2AFX-positive chromatin domain containing the X and Y-chromosomes, called sex body. In contrast, only 13% of <italic>Hells</italic> cKO nuclei with full-length axes were similar to wild-type looking pachytene nuclei. This population of wild-type pachytene nuclei in <italic>Hells</italic> cKO mice could be due to incomplete depletion of HELLS in some spermatocytes, as discussed above.</p><p>Interestingly, in most <italic>Hells</italic> cKO spermatocytes, despite the normal level of nuclear PRDM9 detected by western blotting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>), the PRDM9 signal detected by immunostaining was much reduced compared with wild-type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5">Figure 2—figure supplement 5</xref>). As in nuclear spreads proteins that are not tightly bound to chromatin can be partially lost, this low PRDM9 signal in <italic>Hells</italic> cKO samples could indicate that in the absence of HELLS, PRDM9 localizes in the nucleus, but does not bind to chromatin efficiently. Overall, the DSB activity did not seem to be affected because we detected a large number of DMC1 foci. Conversely, DSB repair appeared to be defective, as indicated by the persistence of DMC1 and γH2AFX foci, and the absence of a normal XY sex body at the pachytene-like stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>).</p><p>To directly test DSB activity and localization in the absence of HELLS, we performed chromatin IP with an anti-DMC1 antibody followed by single-strand DNA sequencing (DMC1 ChIP-SSDS). DMC1 ChIP-SSDS allows recovering single-strand DNA bound by the strand exchange protein DMC1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Khil et al., 2012</xref>). We performed these experiments in two wild-type (<italic>Hells</italic> CTRL) and two <italic>Hells</italic> cKO mice.

We detected 11133 and 17117 peaks of DMC1 enrichment in the <italic>Hells</italic> CTRL and <italic>Hells</italic> cKO samples, respectively. This indicated the presence of DSB activity in both genetic contexts, as observed by immunofluorescence. However, only 1129 peaks were common, representing 10% of <italic>Hells</italic> CTRL peaks, and 6.6% of <italic>Hells</italic> cKO peaks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>).

Indeed, an enrichment for H3K4me3 at these sites was observed specifically in the B6 strain that expresses PRDM9<sup>Dom2</sup>, but not in the congenic RJ2 strain that expresses PRDM9<sup>Cst</sup>, which binds to distinct genomic sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2B</xref>). This suggests that these 898 peaks with stronger DMC1 intensity (in the cell population) in <italic>Hells</italic> CTRL may have a lower DSB level in <italic>Hells</italic> cKO, or may be active only in a smaller cell fraction in <italic>Hells</italic> cKO mice. We favor the second hypothesis, because our cytological analyses showed that HELLS is still detected in a small fraction of <italic>Hells</italic> cKO spermatocytes. The group of 154 peaks with higher DMC1 enrichment in <italic>Hells</italic> cKO were in regions with PRDM9-independent H3K4me3 enrichment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2B</xref>), suggesting a specific induction of DSB activity at these sites in the absence of HELLS. The group of 77 peaks with similar DMC1 intensity in <italic>Hells</italic> CTRL and <italic>Hells</italic> cKO showed a weak PRDM9-independent H3K4me3 enrichment. A low level of DSB activity at PRDM9-independent sites has been detected in mice that express PRDM9, and could account for these peaks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Smagulova et al., 2016</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>HELLS is required for the formation of meiotic DSBs at sites of PRDM9-dependent DSB formation; DSBs are directed at default sites in the absence of HELLS.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Limited overlapping between DSB hotspots from <italic>Hells</italic> CTRL and <italic>Hells</italic> cKO testis samples. Only hotspot centers (DMC1-SSDS peaks) that overlapped within a 400bp-window were considered as common.

When PRDM9 is defective (such as in <italic>Prdm9</italic> KO mice) DSBs are formed at a different set of genomic sites, also called default sites. These sites overlap mainly with promoters and enhancers and are enriched in H3K4me3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Brick et al., 2012</xref>). Remarkably, 85% of <italic>Hells</italic> cKO peaks overlapped with peaks detected in <italic>Prdm9</italic> KO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C and E</xref>). This demonstrated that in the absence of HELLS, DSBs are no longer formed at PRDM9 sites, but are induced at default sites, similarly to what observed in <italic>Prdm9</italic> KO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). The lower number of peaks detected in <italic>Hells</italic> cKO samples (17117) compared with <italic>Prdm9</italic> KO mice (27732) could be due to a lower signal in <italic>Hells</italic> cKO samples.

This indicates that HELLS is required for efficient PRDM9 binding to its sites, consistent with the strong reduction in PRDM9 signal detected by immunofluorescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>).

Upon oxidation, the activity of TET enzymes on methylated cytosines (5mC) leads to a first product, 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC). It has been proposed that 5mC conversion to 5hmC allows regulating 5mC levels for proper gene expression (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Williams et al., 2012</xref>). Unlike 5mC, 5hmC is globally associated with euchromatin and is depleted on heterochromatin in somatic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Ficz et al., 2011</xref>).

We obtained similar results when the heatmaps were generated based on sites defined by PRDM9 ChIP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>). We also noted that the mean 5hmC signal at hotspots was higher in RJ2 than in B6 samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>). This correlated with the greater occupancy of the PRDM9<sup>Cst</sup> variant (expressed in RJ2 mice) compared with the PRDM9<sup>Dom2</sup> variant (expressed in B6 mice) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Grey et al., 2017</xref>). The 5hmC enrichment analysis and specifically the average enrichment plots showed a narrow distribution of the 5hmC enrichment that extended about +/- 250 bp from the peak center and overlapped closely with the enrichment profile of PRDM9 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). Peak centers were defined based on the DMC1 ChIP-SSDS signal and have been previously shown to overlap with PRDM9 DNA-binding motifs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Smagulova et al., 2011</xref>). However, 5hmC distribution was narrower than DMC1 distribution, which extends to the single-stranded DNA generated upon DSB end processing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Moreover, the 5hmC maximum intensity was between the H3K4me3 peaks that delineate the positioned nucleosomes flanking the PRDM9 -binding sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Baker et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Thus, 5hmC was predominantly taking place in the nucleosome-depleted region at and around PRDM9-binding sites.</p><p>Altogether, these findings suggest that 5hmC enrichment is functionally linked to PRDM9-binding activity. To directly test this hypothesis, we analyzed 5hmC in <italic>Hells</italic> cKO spermatocytes where PRDM9 binding to hotspots is defective (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3F</xref>). Strikingly, 5hmC enrichment at hotspots was lost in <italic>Hells</italic> cKO spermatocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). This suggests that 5hmC enrichment at meiotic hotspots is promoted by HELLS and/or PRDM9 binding, or by one of the subsequent steps depending on HELLS and PRDM9. Therefore, we tested whether PRDM9 methyltransferase activity was required, using a mouse strain (named B6-Tg(YF)) where two PRDM9 variants of distinct DNA- binding specificities are produced: the PRDM9<sup>Dom2</sup> variant with wild-type methyltransferase activity, and the PRDM9<sup>Cst-YF</sup> variant with defective methyltransferase activity due to a point mutation (Y357F) in the SET domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Diagouraga et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Wu et al., 2013</xref>). Our previous study established that the PRDM9<sup>Cst-YF</sup> variant binds to the binding sites of PRDM9<sup>Cst</sup>, but cannot catalyze the methylation of the surrounding histones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Diagouraga et al., 2018</xref>). In B6-Tg(YF) mice, 5hmC was enriched at the B6 DMC1 sites (bound by PRDM9<sup>Dom2</sup>), as expected, but not at the RJ2 DMC1 sites bound by PRDM9<sup>Cst-YF</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). We conclude that PRDM9 binding is not sufficient and that its methyltransferase activity is also required for 5hmC enrichment. Then, to test whether 5hmC enrichment required also DSB activity (or downstream events), we analyzed 5hmC enrichment at hotspots in <italic>Spo11</italic> KO mice in which DSB formation is defective. In these mice, 5hmC levels were identical to wild-type mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). This result indicates that DSB formation is not required for 5hmC, and that a step between PRDM9 histone modification and DSB formation leads to 5hmC enrichment at meiotic hotspots.</p><p>We then analyzed the correlation of 5hmC enrichment with the strength of PRDM9, H3K4me3, SPO11-oligos and DMC1 enrichment. SPO11-oligos are the molecular intermediates generated after DSB formation by endonucleolytic cleavage of the strand to which SPO11 is covalently bound (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Neale et al., 2005</xref>). SPO11-oligos data are available only for the B6 genotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Lange et al., 2016</xref>). DMC1 enrichment reflects DSB formation, but is also influenced by features of DSB repair, and is not directly proportional to SPO11-oligos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Hinch et al., 2019</xref>). The correlation plots revealed that in the RJ2 strain, 5hmC was best correlated with PRDM9 and H3K4me3 enrichment, and in the B6 strain, with SPO11-oligo enrichment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1C</xref>). In both strains, the weakest correlation was between 5hmC and DMC1. This suggests that 5hmC enrichment at hotspots is better correlated with events directly linked to PRDM9 binding and DSB activity, rather than to DSB repair, which is consistent with the functional dependency reported above.</p><p>As 5hmC level at hotspots may depend on the density of CpG dinucleotides and of 5mC, it was important to examine the same correlations in function of the CpG content within hotspots (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Over a +/- 250 bp window around hotspot centers, the mean number of CpG was 4.4 (0.88 CpG/100b) in B6, and 4.3 (0.86 CpG/100b) in RJ2. Of note, the consensus motif for PRDM9<sup>Dom2</sup> and PRDM9<sup>Cst</sup> does not include CpGs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Baker et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Grey et al., 2017</xref>). The slight increase in CpG density around PRDM9<sup>Dom2</sup> hotspot was expected due to the process of GC-biased gene conversion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Duret and Galtier, 2009</xref>) that leads to higher GC content at meiotic recombination hotspots (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Clément and Arndt, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Grey et al., 2017</xref>). We then examined the methylation level at CpGs within +/- 250 bp from B6 and RJ2 hotspot centers that contained at least one CpG using published sodium bisulfite data from B6 samples (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Gaysinskaya et al., 2018</xref>). As control, we analyzed the methylation level at four different types of genomic sites: (i) two families of transposable elements (LINE and IAP), and (ii) two sets of imprinted control regions (ICRs): one set methylated only in females (female-specific) and the other methylated only in males (male-specific). As shown before (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Ferguson-Smith, 2011</xref>), we observed low cytosine methylation levels at female-specific ICRs and high methylation levels at male-specific ICRs and the transposable elements LINE and IAP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Meiotic hotspots specific for each strain (B6 and RJ2) showed a similar median methylation level of at least 90% at all stages analyzed (B type spermatogonia, leptotene and pachytene spermatocytes), with a level comparable to what observed in the genome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Note that B6 hotspots, but not RJ2 hotspots, were active in the strain where methylation was monitored. This suggests that overall, in the cell population, the level of hotspot methylation is high already before they are bound by PRDM9, with no further detectable local increase of cytosine modification upon PRDM9 binding. This property was also mentioned in a recent study where the methylation level at DSB sites was measured by Nucleosome Occupancy and Methylome sequencing (NOMe-seq) at different stages during spermatogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Chen et al., 2020</xref>). As sodium bisulfite sequencing allows detecting both 5mC and 5hmC, we propose that the 5hmC enrichment we detected at active hotspots results from the conversion of pre-existing 5mC at these sites rather than de novo modification of unmodified cytosines.</p><p>We then evaluated the correlation between CpG content and 5hmC enrichment, by clustering hotspots according to their number of CpG dinucleotides within a region of +/- 250 bp around the center. We defined four groups of sites: (i) no CpG, (ii) 1–2 CpG, (iii) 3–5 CpG, and (iv)≥6 CpG dinucleotides. The average plots revealed that sites with higher numbers of CpGs tended to have higher 5hmC enrichment, in agreement with the fact that CpGs are the substrates for this modification (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A–B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1C</xref>). In contrast, the number of CpGs was not correlated with hotspot activity. This is shown by the overlapping curves of average plots for the four groups of CpG content of PRDM9, H3K4me3, and DMC1 enrichment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1D</xref>). Heatmaps within each group of hotspots with similar numbers of CpGs revealed also that for a given CpG content, the 5hmC level correlated with the PRDM9, H3K4me3, and DMC1 site intensity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1D</xref>), an observation coherent with the functional dependency on PRDM9 binding and methyltransferase activity reported above.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>5hmC enrichment at DSB sites sorted by CpG content and model.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Average read enrichment and heatmaps showing 5hmC enrichment at DMC1-SSDS B6 sites. (<bold>B</bold>) Average read enrichment and heatmaps showing 5hmC enrichment at DMC1-SSDS RJ2 sites.

One of them was how the zinc- finger domain of PRDM9 gains access to its DNA-binding motifs. These DNA sites have no other reported function than being bound by PRDM9, and this occurs specifically in meiotic cells where <italic>Prdm9</italic> is expressed. These sites are located throughout the genome, in genic and intergenic regions, and they do not appear to have any intrinsic feature beyond their DNA sequence. The only identified landmark is their higher GC content relative to their flanking regions that appears progressively over generations due to the process of GC-biased gene conversion during meiotic DSB repair at these sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Clément and Arndt, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Grey et al., 2017</xref>). Moreover, PRDM9-binding sites can differ between mouse strains because the PRDM9 DNA-binding domain is highly mutable, and multiple variants with distinct DNA-binding specificity are present in <italic>Mus musculus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Buard et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Kono et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Vara et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>One of the major advances of this study, together with the parallel study from C. Baker’s group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Spruce et al., 2020</xref>), is the identification of the interaction between PRDM9 and HELLS, and the evidence of its essential role in allowing PRDM9 to access and stably bind to its binding sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). The interaction between PRDM9 and HELLS was detected by IP-mass spectrometry and by yeast two-hybrid assays (this study) and by co-IPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Spruce et al., 2020</xref>). In addition, and consistent with these interactions, ChIP experiments showed that HELLS is enriched at least at a fraction of PRDM9 sites, presumably the ones with the most efficient PRDM9 binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Spruce et al., 2020</xref>). The chromatin configuration of PRDM9-binding sites has been analyzed by accessibility to MNase and to the transposase Tn5 (ATAC-seq). Before PRDM9 expression (in spermatogonia), most PRDM9-binding sites do not reveal specific accessibility compared with flanking genomic sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Chen et al., 2020</xref>). Conversely, when PRDM9 is expressed (leptonema), the binding sites show increased chromatin accessibility along few hundred base pairs on both sides of the PRDM9-binding site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Baker et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Yamada et al., 2020</xref>). The footprint of PRDM9 binding is not detected by ATAC-seq, suggesting a short residency time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Spruce et al., 2020</xref>). As PRDM9 promotes H3K4me3 and H3K36me3 deposition on flanking nucleosomes, the chromatin organization at these sites can be examined and reveals a well-positioned arrangement of modified nucleosomes around PRDM9-binding sites. Overall, a striking change of chromatin configuration is observed upon PRDM9 binding, and HELLS plays an essential role in this process. This conclusion is based on the observation that in <italic>Hells</italic> cKO spermatocytes, PRDM9 binding (this study), PRDM9 dependent-H3K4me3 deposition, and chromatin accessibility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Spruce et al., 2020</xref>) cannot be detected at PRDM9-binding sites.</p><p>HELLS belongs to the SNF2-like family of chromatin remodelers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Flaus et al., 2006</xref>), but unlike other members of this family no ATP-dependent nucleosome remodeling activity could be detected in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Burrage et al., 2012</xref>). However, in <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic> extracts, HELLS promotes nucleosome remodeling when forming a complex with CDCA7 that contains a 4-CXXC zinc-finger domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Jenness et al., 2018</xref>). Therefore, it could be anticipated that in meiotic cells, HELLS is brought to PRDM9-binding sites by interacting with PRDM9. HELLS-dependent steps, such as nucleosome repositioning and/or stabilization and the subsequent opening of chromatin, could further stabilize the interaction of the PRDM9 zinc-finger domain with these sites, in a process partly similar to the one described for pioneer transcription factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Mayran and Drouin, 2018</xref>). Functionally, HELLS absence leads to a phenotype comparable to the one observed upon <italic>Prdm9</italic> genetic ablation. Indeed, in <italic>Hells</italic> cKO mice, meiotic DSB activity is undetectable at PRDM9 sites and is redirected to sites of open chromatin, such as promoters and enhancers (this study; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Spruce et al., 2020</xref>), which are called default sites, like in <italic>Prdm9</italic> KO mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Brick et al., 2012</xref>). Therefore, HELLS is an essential determinant of meiotic DSB localization in mice.</p><p>Could HELLS have additional role(s) beyond promoting PRDM9 binding? As observed in <italic>Prdm9</italic> KO mice, <italic>Hells</italic> cKO mice show a partial defect in DSB repair and homologous synapsis. By promoting nucleosome reorganization at PRDM9-binding sites, HELLS may contribute to DNA repair. This contribution may concern the chromatin of the broken and also the uncut chromatid because it has been proposed that PRDM9 binds not only to the chromatid where DSBs will occur but also to the intact template (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Davies et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Hinch et al., 2019</xref>). Such ‘symmetric binding’ might enhance interhomolog repair. In theory, HELLS activity could participate in DSB repair by regulating chromatin organization on the broken chromatid (for instance for strand resection), and on the uncut chromatid (for strand invasion). In support of this hypothesis, it has been shown that in somatic cells, HELLS is involved in and facilitates DSB repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Burrage et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Kollárovič et al., 2020</xref>). In somatic cells, HELLS might facilitate end-resection by interacting with and recruiting C-terminal interacting protein (CtIP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Kollárovič et al., 2020</xref>). HELLS implication in genome integrity has also been detected in <italic>Neurospora crassa</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Basenko et al., 2016</xref>) and <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Litwin et al., 2017</xref>). In <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, the HELLS orthologue Irc5 is required for DNA damage tolerance, and this function implies the loading of the cohesin complex at replication forks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Litwin et al., 2018</xref>). In <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, cohesin recruitment facilitates DSB repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Ström et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Unal et al., 2004</xref>). The hypothesis of a role for HELLS in meiotic DSB repair through enhancing end-resection and/or cohesin loading remains to be tested.</p><p>In other cellular contexts, HELLS is a major regulator of DNA methylation, specifically for the silencing of repeated DNA elements, and through the recruitment of the DNA methyltransferase DNMT3B (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Myant and Stancheva, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Zhu et al., 2006</xref>). This has an impact on DNA methylation genome-wide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Ren et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Yu et al., 2014a</xref>). Besides altering epigenetic features and the expression of transposable elements (TE), HELLS absence in mouse tissues (brain and liver) and in fibroblasts has very limited consequences on gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Huang et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Yu et al., 2014b</xref>). In <italic>Hells</italic> KO mouse oocytes, the DNA methylation level of some TE families is reduced and their expression is increased; however, the expression of several meiotic genes is not affected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">De La Fuente et al., 2006</xref>). The consequences of <italic>Hells</italic> deficiency on DNA methylation and expression have not been tested in spermatocytes. However, in the absence of HELLS, major epigenomic alterations in non-repeated DNA are not expected during meiosis, and consistently, H3K4me3 level at promoters is not altered in <italic>Hells</italic> cKO spermatocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Spruce et al., 2020</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>The implication of 5-hydroxymethylcytosine at meiotic DSB sites</title><p>The presence of 5hmC at DSB hotspots was first reported by Brick and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Brick et al., 2018</xref>) using genome-wide data on cytosine methylation and hydroxyl-methylation patterns in mouse spermatocytes, mainly at the pachytene stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Hammoud et al., 2014</xref>). Here, we found that this DNA modification is also present at hotspots earlier in meiosis, at leptotene-zygotene stages, when DSB formation takes place. By assessing 5hmC in mouse strains that carry different <italic>Prdm9</italic> alleles (<italic>Prdm9<sup>Dom2</sup></italic> and <italic>Prdm9<sup>Cst</sup></italic>), we found that 5hmC deposition depends on PRDM9 DNA-binding specificity. Moreover, we detected 5hmC enrichment in a narrow window of about +/- 250bp around the center of PRDM9-binding sites. Remarkably, PRDM9 binding is not sufficient and PRDM9 methyltransferase activity also is required for 5hmC enrichment. As we showed that 5hmC presence at hotspots does not require SPO11, we propose that 5hmC is promoted by a PRDM9-dependent chromatin modification step before DSB formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). Therefore, 5hmC is a new feature of the local signature of active hotspots, like the histone modifications H3K4me3, H3K4me36 and H3K9ac (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Buard et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Davies et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Grey et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Lam et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Powers et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>The next question concerns the mechanism of the 5hmC enrichment at PRDM9-dependent hotspots. This enrichment is not observed in somatic tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Brick et al., 2018</xref>), which is consistent with the PRDM9 dependency we observed and with the PRDM9-specific expression at the leptotene stage of the meiotic prophase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Jung et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Spruce et al., 2020</xref>). In the mouse male germline, a high level of DNA methylation is induced genome-wide during germline development in spermatogonia before meiosis entry and is maintained during meiotic prophase with a transient reduction at preleptonema (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Gaysinskaya et al., 2018</xref>). A similar high DNA methylation level is observed at meiotic DSB sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1D</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Chen et al., 2020</xref>). Therefore, it could be hypothesized that a TET enzyme promoting the conversion of 5mC to 5hmC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Ito et al., 2010</xref>) is recruited upon or concomitantly with PRDM9 binding to its sites. One possible scenario could be that TET recruitment involves HELLS. Indeed, HELLS can interact with one, two, or all three TET enzymes, depending on the cell type (MCF-7 cells, HEK293T, mouse embryonic stem cells) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">de Dieuleveult et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Jia et al., 2017</xref>), and co-localize with 5hmC when stably expressed in HK1 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Jia et al., 2017</xref>). As no evidence of HELLS/TET interaction in meiotic cells is available, a PRDM9-dependent chromatin modification might be implicated in recruiting the putative TET activity. ZCWPW1, a reader of H3K4me3 and H3K36me3 that is required for efficient DSB repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Huang et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Mahgoub et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Wells et al., 2019</xref>), might be directly or indirectly involved in this recruitment.</p><p>The function of 5hmC at meiotic hotspots is unknown. At least two non-exclusive consequences of 5hmC can be envisioned. First, as 5hmC has been associated with sites of open chromatin, such as active and poised enhancers, in several cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Sérandour et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Stroud et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Szulwach et al., 2011</xref>), it could have an active role in recruiting partners or stabilizing interactions, similarly to the recruitment of factors described in neuronal progenitor cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Spruijt et al., 2013</xref>). Second, it has been shown that 5hmC prevents the binding of several methyl-CpG-binding proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Jin et al., 2010</xref>). One or both of these consequences of the conversion of 5mC to 5hmC could have a positive effect on DSB repair at meiotic hotspots in male meiosis. We favor the second scenario, in which the conversion of 5mC to 5hmC allows antagonizing the binding of factors with affinity for 5mC and which could interfere with meiotic recombination. Indeed, it is difficult to reconcile a positive role for 5hmC with the observation that DSB formation and repair is efficient at hotspots without CpGs in spermatocytes, and at all hotspots in oocytes, which have a low global level of cytosine methylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Seisenberger et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>The control of initiation sites of meiotic recombination by PRDM9 underlies a sophisticated regulation that goes beyond the simple binding to specific DNA motifs in the genome. Clearly, our findings and those from Baker’s laboratory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Spruce et al., 2020</xref>) indicate that the control of chromatin is an important step for DSB formation and repair. PRDM9 and HELLS drive epigenetic modifications before and independently of DSB formation, setting the stage for downstream steps. Not only histone modifications but also DNA methylation appears to be a potential additional level of regulation of meiotic recombination, with potential distinct consequences during male and female meiosis where some differences in hotspot activity have been detected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Brick et al., 2018</xref>) and from the analysis of 5hmC in the male germ line presented in this study. These observations also highlight the need of understanding the sex-specific features of meiotic recombination in general.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and

The data outputs include the intensity-based absolute quantification (iBAQ) and label-free quantification (LFQ) intensities for each protein. The iBAQ value is the sum of the intensities of all tryptic peptides for each protein. Therefore, iBAQ values are proportional to the protein molar quantities. LFQ intensities are based on the intensities of each protein and are normalized at multiple levels to ensure that the LFQ intensity profiles across samples accurately reflect the protein relative amounts.

Hence, the proportion of cells at leptotene/zygotene is 55%, 41% and 26% at these three ages, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Goetz et al., 1984</xref>). To obtain a more enriched proportion of leptotene/zygotene spermatocytes, germ cell development was synchronized <italic>in vivo</italic> by manipulating the retinoic acid metabolism, as described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Romer et al., 2018</xref>. Briefly, at day two post-partum, mice were treated daily (by pipette feeding) with WIN 18,446 (100µg/gram of body weight), an inhibitor of retinoic acid synthesis that blocks the differentiation of spermatogonia and thus meiosis entry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Hogarth et al., 2013</xref>). After 8 to 10 days of treatment, meiosis was initiated synchronously by a single intraperitoneal injection of 100 µg of retinoic acid in 10 µL of DMSO. Between 8 and 9 days after the injection, mice were sacrificed and testes were harvested. At this time point, about 80–85% of spermatocytes were at leptotene/zygotene stage, as assessed by SYCP3, SYCP1 and γH2AFX staining on spermatocyte spreads performed using a small proportion of testis tissue. The remaining testis tissue was processed for nuclei purification and FACS sorting.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Purification of spermatocyte nuclei and FACS sorting</title><p>Synchronized decapsulated testes were fixed in 1% formaldehyde for 10 min. After quenching the reaction, tissues were homogenized and cells were lysed by homogenization with a tight fit homogenizer in homogenizing buffer (50 mM sucrose, 25mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 50 mM NH<sub>4</sub>Cl, 120 mM Tris pH7.4). After centrifugation, cells were resuspended in iodixanol-based Optiprep density gradient solution (Sigma-Aldrich D1556). First, a 50% iodixanol working solution was prepared by diluting the Optiprep density gradient solution in working solution (150 mM KCl, 30 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 120 mM Tris pH 7.4) at a ration 1:5. Then, the 50% iodixanol working solution was diluted to a final concentration of 27% in diluent solution (250 mM sucrose, 25 mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 20 mM Tris pH7.4). Resuspended cells were centrifuged at 10,000 g at 4°C for 30 min. After discarding the supernatants, isolated nuclei were labeled in labeling solution (1x Sytox green (Thermo Fisher Scientific, S70020) in 250 mM sucrose, 25 mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 20 mM tris pH7.4, 1% BSA) at room temperature for 2 hr. Labeled nuclei were filtered through a 70 µm cell strainer and FACS-sorted with a BD FACS Melody sorter (100 µm sort nozzle, 2,000–4,000 events/sec, 34 kHz). First, single nuclei were gated based on their light scatter (forward and reverse side scatter) properties. Second, 4C nuclei were gated based on their DNA content assessed through the fluorescence emitted by the Sytox green fixed on DNA observed with the 488 nm laser. Third, 4C nuclei were separated based on light scatter to gate leptotene-zygotene nuclei. Then, about 10 000 sorted nuclei were deposited on each poly-lysine-coated slide and immunostained with anti-SYCP3, -γH2AFX and -SYCP1 antibodies to verify the prophase I stage. Staining conditions and dilutions are the same as described above.

Then, Illumina adaptors were added using the NEB Next Ultra Library Preparation Kit (NEB7370S), without the final PCR step. Finally, hMeDIP was performed with the Active Motif hMeDIP Kit (AM, 55010), according to the manufacturers’ manual.

This method was developed for ChIP-seq analysis and extensively used in the ENCODE and modENCODE projects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Landt et al., 2012</xref>). The framework developed by Qunhua Li and Peter Bickel's group (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://sites.google.com/site/anshulkundaje/projects/idr">https://sites.google.com/site/anshulkundaje/projects/idr</ext-link>) was followed. Briefly, this method allows testing the reproducibility within and between replicates by using the IDR statistics. Following their pipeline, peak calling was performed using MACS version 2.0.10 with relaxed conditions (<monospace>--pvalue</monospace>=0.1 <monospace>--bw1000</monospace> <monospace>--nomodel</monospace> <monospace>--shift400</monospace>) for each of the two replicates, the pooled dataset, and pseudo-replicates that were artificially generated by randomly sampling half of the reads twice for each replicate and the pooled dataset. Then IDR analyses were performed, and reproducibility was checked. Final peak sets were built by selecting the top N peaks from pooled datasets (ranked by increasing p values), with N defined as the highest value between N1 (the number of overlapping peaks with an IDR &lt; 0.01, when comparing pseudo-replicates from pooled datasets) and N2 (the number of overlapping peaks with an IDR &lt; 0.05 when comparing the true replicates), as recommended for the mouse genome. Reproducibility between DMC1 replicates was double-checked by testing their peak strength correlation calculated on the peaks recovered after IDR (Pearson’s correlation coefficients were: 0.99 and 0.96 for <italic>Hells</italic> CTRL and <italic>Hells</italic> cKO; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-17-3"><title>Comparisons of DSB hotspot maps</title><p>All DSB hotspot maps were compared by identifying overlapping (and non-overlapping) peak centers ± 200 bp.

DMC1 ChIP-SSDS signal at DSB hotspots was calculated after peak re-centering, and fragment count was normalized to the local background, as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Brick et al., 2012</xref>), then normalized to the library size (estimated as the sum of type1-ssDNA, type2-ssDNA and dsDNA). As we previously stated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Papanikos et al., 2019</xref>), normalization between <italic>Hells</italic> CTRL and <italic>Hells</italic> cKO samples could not be computed because of altered DMC1 dynamics in the <italic>Hells</italic> cKO. The 5hMeDIP-seq signal was calculated at different genomic regions (the region type and size are detailed in the figure legends) by subtracting the library-normalized input signal from the library-normalized 5hMeDIP-seq signal. For <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1C and D</xref>, DMC1-SSDS B6 or RJ2 sites were divided in four groups, containing an increasing number of CpGs (0, 1–2, 3–5, and ≥ 6) within a window of +/- 250 bp around the peak center. Besides the group without CpGs, groups were defined to have similar numbers of DMC1-SSDS sites, as follows: 0 CpGs (812 and 821 for the B6 and RJ2 strains respectively); 1–2 CpGs (3915 and 4126 for the B6 and RJ2 strains, respectively); 3–5 CpGs (5649 and 5851 for the B6 and RJ2 strains, respectively);≥6 CpGs (4384 and 4377 for the B6 and RJ2 strains, respectively). The 5mC signal at whole-genome scale, at DSB sites, in LINE, IAPs and ICRs was calculated from whole-genome bisulfite sequencing data from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Gaysinskaya et al., 2018</xref>. (PRJNA326117). After removing adapter contamination and low-quality reads using trim galore, bisulfite-converted reads were mapped to the UCSC mouse genome assembly build GRCm38/mm10. Mapping in a paired-end mode and methylation call was done using Bismark. Duplicates were not discarded. For the subsequent analysis, only regions with at least one CpG and one informative read were considered. Using the Bedtools suite, the DNA methylation ratio was averaged in 1 kb sliding, non-overlapping windows at the whole genome scale and in the whole interval at DSB sites, in LINE, IAP and ICRs. Median values of 5mC were higher than those reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Gaysinskaya et al., 2018</xref> and by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Chen et al., 2020</xref>. For instance, at leptonema, we obtained a genome-wide median DNA methylation level of 91% compared to 77% and 81% respectively in these two studies. These differences, which do not alter the conclusions could be due to the procedures used for reads selection and/or quantification.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-18"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>The statistical analysis of cytological observations was done with GrapPad Prism 7.

This work demonstrates that PDRM9 is recruited by the chromatin remodeller, HELLS. HELLS is required for double strand break formation, and the enrichment of 5-hydroxymethylcytosine at PDRM9 sites. These findings illustrate the complexity of the chromatin environment that influences recombination hotspots.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;PRDM9 activity depends on HELLS and promotes local 5-hydroxymethylcytosine enrichment&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Jessica Tyler as the Senior Editor The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Francesca Cole (Reviewer #1); Saadi Khochbin (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>We would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). Specifically, we are asking editors to accept without delay manuscripts, like yours, that they judge can stand as <italic>eLife</italic> papers without additional data, even if they feel that they would make the manuscript stronger. Thus the revisions requested below only address clarity and presentation.</p><p>The laboratory of Bernard de Massy first discovered PRDM9 as a meiotic factor that initiates recombination at particular locations in the genome. A series of important publications from this laboratory then revealed the major characteristics of PRDM9 as a regulator of DSB and repair. Among various findings, this team showed that chromatin environment mostly induced by PRDM9 could play an important role in DSB formation and repair. However, why PRDM9-dependent DSBs can promote pairing and progression through meiotic prophase in mouse and PRDM9-independent breaks cannot is a mystery. Here the authors take a proteomic approach to identify PRDM9 partners. They identify that HELLS, a SNF2-like family protein, interacts directly with PRDM9. Using a knockout mouse model, evidence is provided indicating that HELLS seems to be required for the binding of PRDM9 to specific PRDM9 DNA binding sites as well as chromatin in spermatocyte nuclei. They also show that HELLS and PRDM9 are required for accumulation of 5-hydroxymethylcytosine at meiotic hotspots, but SPO11 is not required, suggesting a potential role for this modification in subsequent steps of meiotic DSB repair. This is an important piece of work, that confirms and extends previous studies, however a few points need to be addressed before publication.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) This manuscript was prepared and submitted under particular circumstances, since some major reported findings and conclusions have been recently published by another group (Spruce et al., 2020). It is of note that the major findings of the two reports, the identification of HELLS as a PRDM9 partner and the functional consequences of the complex formation, are concordant. The authors should take advantage of the situation to deeply discuss their data with respect to the data published by Spruce and colleagues. Currently, this comparison is limited to only several brief statements. The recommendation is that in the Discussion section the authors fully develop a discussion on both works, which would increase the interest of this manuscript to the readers. The authors should also give proper credit to this work at appropriate points in the text.</p><p>2) The fact that the interaction between HELLS and PRDM9 takes place in mouse testes is critical for the conclusions in this manuscript. However, the authors cite technical difficulties in detecting interaction between HELLS and PRDM9 by western blots after IP in mouse testis. Additional explanation is required here. What kind of technical problems are being alluded to? Since this was demonstrated in the published work (Spruce et al., 2020), their findings should be emphasized here. In addition, the authors claim that DNA is not required for the interaction may need to be revised (subsection “HELLS interacts with PRDM9”, third paragraph) In the PRDM9 IP, HELLS peptides were measured with Mass-spec from two replicates. HELLS peptide counts from PRDM9 IP were 6 and 7, compared to 5 and 1 in the Mock. Is this difference significant? Peptide number may not be a quantitative measurement.</p><p>3) The work reported here presents important specific aspects which had not been investigated and reported previously. More specifically, the interesting finding of a role for HELLS in the enrichment of 5hmC at PRDM9 genomic sites is of high interest.</p><p>The authors' investigations suggest that a step between PRDM9 binding and DSB formation leads to 5hmC establishment. However, this rather obscure statement needs a deeper and a better discussion. For instance, what do the authors think about a role for DNA methylation at these PRDM9-binding sites? Indeed, a plausible scenario would be that HELLS would mediate a de novo DNA methylation at these sites, which could then be converted into 5hmC by the TET enzymes. Interestingly HELLs is known to interact with members of both TETs and de novo DNA methyltransferases, supporting the above idea. One prediction of this scenario is that the PRDM9-binding sites would be under-methylated at stages preceding the expression and activities of HELLS-PRDM9. Are there publicly available genome methylation data for the authors to test this prediction? If not, it would be interesting that at least the authors fully develop a discussion regarding the origin of the establishment of 5hmC at these sites.</p><p>4) HELLS is a generalist chromatin remodelling factor that is required for a variety of chromatin-templated mechanisms, including transcription factor binding and transcription. Therefore, the question arises on how much of the effects observed in <italic>HellscKO</italic> meiotic cells could be indirectly linked to the action of HELLS on genome organization and transcription. Do the authors have an idea on the impact of HELLS on the expression of critical meiotic genes? At least a discussion on this point could be interesting. With respect to this point, DAPI staining seems to show some alteration of DNA staining in the <italic>HellscKO</italic> spermatocytes compared to their control counterparts (i.e., Figure 2B, Figure 2—figure supplement 3B), suggesting the occurrence of global genome organization alterations in the absence of Hells. Is this consistently observed? If yes, could the authors at least highlight and discuss these alterations?</p><p>5) The manuscript should be streamlined and data more clearly presented throughout. The Discussion section reads more like a review. Authors should focus more on their own results and evidence and limit speculation of additional functions that have been shown in somatic cells or model organisms.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.57117.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) This manuscript was prepared and submitted under particular circumstances, since some major reported findings and conclusions have been recently published by another group (Spruce et al., 2020).

(subsection “HELLS interacts with PRDM9”).</p><p>We have done several immunoprecipitation assays using anti-PRDM9 and anti-HELLS antibodies (three different antibodies tested) without convincing results. Our protocol (Dignam protocol) for protein extraction is different from that used by Spruce et al., but has the advantage of being nuclear, and is recognized for its quality of protein complex purification. Note that we used this extraction protocol to prepare HeLa cell extracts that allowed identifying HELLS/PRDM9 interaction in the Co-IP mass spec experiments. Another difference is the anti-HELLS antibodies. However, it is unclear why the anti-HELLS antibodies we tested should be responsible because they work in IP and western blot experiments. Possibly, our conditions were not sensitive enough to detect the signal.</p><p>We provide in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref>, an example of one of our negative results of the co-IP, despite efficient immunoprecipitations.</p><fig id="respfig1"><label>Author response image 1.</label><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-57117-resp-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In addition, the authors claim that DNA is not required for the interaction may need to be revised (subsection “HELLS interacts with PRDM9”, third paragraph) In the PRDM9 IP, HELLS peptides were measured with Mass-spec from two replicates. HELLS peptide counts from PRDM9 IP were 6 and 7, compared to 5 and 1 in the Mock. Is this difference significant? Peptide number may not be a quantitative measurement.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now included the label-free quantification (LFQ) rank difference derived from the LFQ intensity, which is a more quantitative evaluation of the presence of a protein than peptide counts. LFQ is a normalized score indicating the relative amount of the proteins. From the intensity, a rank is deduced both in the PRDM9 IP and in the mock (IP with IgG). Then the rank difference (rank in IP PRDM9 – rank in IP mock) is calculated. A positive value indicates an enrichment in the PRDM9 IP. No statistical test would be informative on these semi-quantitative analyses. The reproducibility is the best tool we have to validate the conclusion of the interaction between PRDM9 and HELLS. In our study, we performed three independent IPs (mouse testis rep1 and two duplicates in mouse testis rep2). In all three experiments, the LFQ rank difference values of HELLS were positive.</p><p>Thus, this is our best validation for the co-immunoprecipitation between PRDM9 and HELLS.</p><p>We added the LFQ rank difference in Table 1 because it provides a complementary view of the data in addition to peptide counts.</p><p>Concerning the benzonase treatment and its interpretation, we agree with the reviewer and removed the conclusion about the claim of a DNA-independent interaction, but for a different reason. We now think that the interpretation of the results obtained with co-IP experiments treated with benzonase is not straightforward. First, we did not measure how extensive the benzonase treatment was when added to the nuclear extracts. Second, benzonase can digest genomic DNA, but it is not possible to know whether it might also cleave DNA bound by the PRDM9 zinc finger domain; for instance, this DNA may be inaccessible. This is actually often overlooked in studies using benzonase.</p><p>Therefore, we deleted the sentence: “The detection of HELLS peptides in the “Mouse testis rep 2”, protein extracts incubated with benzonase prior to IP suggests that DNA or RNA components are not required for the detection of the interaction between PRDM9 and HELLS”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The work reported here presents important specific aspects which had not been investigated and reported previously. More specifically, the interesting finding of a role for HELLS in the enrichment of 5hmC at PRDM9 genomic sites is of high interest.</p><p>The authors' investigations suggest that a step between PRDM9 binding and DSB formation leads to 5hmC establishment. However, this rather obscure statement needs a deeper and a better discussion. For instance, what do the authors think about a role for DNA methylation at these PRDM9 binding sites? Indeed, a plausible scenario would be that HELLS would mediate a de novo DNA methylation at these sites, which could then be converted into 5hmC by the TET enzymes. Interestingly HELLs is known to interact with members of both TETs and de novo DNA methyltransferases, supporting the above idea. One prediction of this scenario is that the PRDM9-binding sites would be under-methylated at stages preceding the expression and activities of HELLS-PRDM9. Are there publicly available genome methylation data for the authors to test this prediction? If not, it would be interesting that at least the authors fully develop a discussion regarding the origin of the establishment of 5hmC at these sites.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with these comments and our data certainly raises many questions, particularly how a TET enzyme may be recruited, and what is the status of DNA methylation.</p><p>We discussed several possibilities, based on literature data about TET recruitment and interactions (in somatic cells); however, in the context of meiosis, we can only speculate (see Discussion).</p><p>Concerning DNA methylation, we can analyse DNA methylation and we did it. This new analysis is now included in Figure 5—figure supplement 1B. We took advantage of the 5-methyl cytosine (5mC) kinetics data during spermatogenesis, before, and during meiosis, published by Gaysinskaya et al., 2018. From the GEO datasets, we aligned the reads obtained after sequencing of bisulphite-treated samples using specific alignment tools and computed 5mC enrichment within several regions (protocol described in the Materials and methods). As controls, we monitored genome-wide LINE, IAP and imprinted control regions (male and female imprints).</p><p>We then monitored DSB hotspots, the set of hotspots from B6 (PRDM9<sup>Dom2</sup>) and from RJ2 (Prdm9<sup>Cst</sup>). Note that all DNA methylation data are from B6. We observed that before (spermatogonia) and during meiosis (leptotene and pachytene), 5mC methylation level was as high at hotspots (either active: PRDM9<sup>Dom2</sup>, or not: Prdm9<sup>Cst</sup>) as in the genome (around 90%). This high cytosine methylation level at hotspots was also reported in a recent study using a different technique to monitor methylation (Chen et al., 2020). We cite this data (Results and Discussion).</p><p>Therefore, in the Discussion, we propose that hotspots with CpGs have high 5mC levels, and thus the substrate for TET to act is potentially available (of course with the caveat that all this is based on population average, and that we do not have information on single cells).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) HELLS is a generalist chromatin remodelling factor that is required for a variety of chromatin-templated mechanisms, including transcription factor binding and transcription. Therefore, the question arises on how much of the effects observed in HellscKO meiotic cells could be indirectly linked to the action of HELLS on genome organization and transcription. Do the authors have an idea on the impact of HELLS on the expression of critical meiotic genes? At least a discussion on this point could be interesting.</p></disp-quote><p>As pointed out by the reviewers, we agree that HELLS might have other functions during meiosis that could affect genome organization and in turn alter transcription. Therefore, it is an important point to consider. The question whether transcription levels are altered in the absence of HELLS has already been partially addressed by previous works:</p><p>In somatic cells</p><p>Yu and colleagues reported that Hells-deficient murine embryonic fibroblasts show a widespread loss of CG methylation at uniquely mapped genomic regions, including TSSs of protein-coding genes and non-coding RNA genes. However, despite the dramatic changes in methylation at some promoter regions, the relative transcript steady-state levels remain unchanged and silent regions are not de-repressed, as assessed by RNA-seq. Only 2.2% of genes are up- or down-regulated. Genes with a differential expression are involved in cell adhesion and the defence response, the inflammatory response, cell adhesion, chemotaxis, and leukocyte differentiation. Non-coding RNA expression is not affected, but the expression of some repetitive elements, such as satellite sequences, endogenous retroviral elements, and about 60 subclasses of repeat elements including IAP and MMERVK sequences, is increased (Yu at al., 2014).</p><p>In meiotic cells</p><p>Spruce and colleagues showed that H3K4me3 levels, assessed by ChIP-seq at PRDM9-independent sites, are not significantly different in HELLS-deficient spermatocytes compared with wild-type ells (Spruce et al., 2020).</p><p>De La Fuente and colleagues showed that the lack of HELLS in oocytes induces no change in the transcription levels of a subset of meiosis-associated genes (such as Sycp1, Sycp3, Mlh1 and Prdm9), as assessed by RT-qPCR. However, they observed substantial changes in the methylation levels of the minor and major satellites and of the IAP family of transposable elements. They also showed that in the absence of HELLS, IAP elements are de-repressed (De la Fuente et al., 2006).</p><p>It should be noted that male meiocytes have unique mechanisms to repress transposable elements (piRNA pathway), which makes it difficult to transfer these conclusions directly from female to male gametocytes.</p><p>Our experimental observations (PRDM9-HELLS interaction, lack of PRDM9 binding in absence of HELLS, and displacement of DSBs to default sites) make us favour the hypothesis of a rather direct role of HELLS in the observed phenotype that phenocopies the absence of PRDM9 binding at DSB hotspots. Nevertheless, we agree with the reviewers that on the basis of the observations cited above, it would be very interesting to look at the expression levels of genes and repetitive elements in our <italic>HellscKO</italic> mice. Unfortunately, due to the current Covid19-related situation, we had to stop the breeding of all our mouse strains. We had one frozen sample from the correct genotype, but at least two duplicates are required. Gathering enough material for a well-performed RNA-seq experiment would have taken not less than 6 months, because two mouse generations are needed to get enough mice because in the progenies from the crosses required for these experiments only one in sixteen mice has the correct genotype (male, Hells fl/- with transgene). We are sorry of not being able to provide this RNA-seq analysis for the current manuscript.</p><p>However, we discuss the other potential consequences of Hells depletion in the Discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>With respect to this point, DAPI staining seems to show some alteration of DNA staining in the HellscKO spermatocytes compared to their control counterparts (i.e., Figure 2B, Figure 2—figure supplement 3B), suggesting the occurrence of global genome organization alterations in the absence of Hells. Is this consistently observed? If yes, could the authors at least highlight and discuss these alterations?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewers that the selected images could raise such question. The alteration in DAPI-staining in <italic>HellscKO</italic> spermatocytes noted by the reviewers is most likely due to a weaker DAPI staining on one slide (wild-type) during the experimental procedure.</p><p>We evaluated this point by examining the DAPI-staining on <italic>Hellsctrl</italic> and <italic>HellscKO</italic> spermatocytes from other experiments (different mice and different slide preparations), and we do not confirm this difference between wt and HellscKO mice.
