that Synaptotagmin-1 and Complexin synergistically clamp the SNARE assembly process to generate and maintain a pool of docked vesicles that fuse rapidly and synchronously upon Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx (Ramakrishnan et al., 2020). Here, using the same in vitro single-vesicle fusion assay, we determine the molecular details of the Complexin-mediated fusion clamp and its role in Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activation. We find that a delay in fusion kinetics, likely imparted by Synaptotagmin-1, is needed for Complexin to block fusion. Systematic truncation/mutational analyses reveal that continuous alpha-helical accessory-central domains of Complexin are essential for its inhibitory function and specific interaction of the accessory helix with the SNAREpins enhances this functionality. The C-terminal domain promotes clamping by locally elevating Complexin concentration through interactions with the membrane. Independent of their clamping functions, the accessory-central helical domains of Complexin also contribute to rapid Ca<sup>2+</sup>-synchronized vesicle release by increasing the probability of fusion from the clamped state.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>synaptic vesicle</kwd><kwd>membrane fusion</kwd><kwd>calcium regulation</kwd><kwd>complexin</kwd><kwd>synaptotagmin</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>E. coli</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000062</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DK027044</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Krishnakumar</surname><given-names>Shyam S</given-names></name><name><surname>Rothman</surname><given-names>James E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Complexin, in conjunction with Synaptotagmin, clamps the SNARE-assembly process under resting conditions and promote vesicle fusion in response to calcium signal.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Neurons communicate with each other at synaptic contacts by releasing neurotransmitters from synaptic vesicles (SVs). This process is tightly controlled by activity-dependent changes in the presynaptic Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration and can occur in less than a millisecond after the neuronal spike (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Südhof, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Kaeser and Regehr, 2014</xref>). SV fusion is catalyzed by presynaptic SNARE proteins. The SNAREs on the opposing membranes (VAMP2 on the synaptic vesicle membrane; Syntaxin and SNAP25 on the presynaptic plasma membrane) assemble into a four-helix bundle that catalyzes fusion by forcing the two membranes together (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Söllner et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Weber et al., 1998</xref>). Related SNARE proteins are universally involved in intracellular transport pathways and by themselves can constitutively catalyze fusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Weber et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">McNew et al., 2000</xref>). As such, Ca<sup>2+</sup>-evoked neurotransmitter release occurs from the readily releasable pool (RRP) of vesicles docked/primed at the presynaptic active zone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Südhof, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Kaeser and Regehr, 2014</xref>). The current view is that at a single RRP vesicle, the SNARE complexes are firmly held (‘clamped’) in a partially assembled state (SNAREpins) close to the point of triggering fusion. Upon Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx, multiple SNAREpins are synchronously activated to drive ultrafast SV fusion and neurotransmitter release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Südhof and Rothman, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Südhof, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Rizo and Xu, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Rothman et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Brunger et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>It is well-established that the late stages of SV fusion are tightly regulated by two synaptic proteins – the presynaptic Ca<sup>2+</sup> release sensor Synaptotagmin-1 (Syt1) and Complexin (CPX) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Südhof, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Südhof and Rothman, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Rizo and Xu, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Brunger et al., 2019</xref>). CPX is an evolutionarily conserved cytosolic protein that bind and regulate synaptic SNARE complex assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">McMahon et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Huntwork and Littleton, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Martin et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Trimbuch and Rosenmund, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Mohrmann et al., 2015</xref>). Biochemical and biophysical analyses show that CPX promotes the initial stages of SNARE assembly but then blocks complete assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Li et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kümmel et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Lai et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Krishnakumar et al., 2015</xref>). Thus, it can both facilitate and subsequently inhibit SV fusion. CPX contain distinct domains that mediate the dual clamp/activator function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Xue et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Giraudo et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Trimbuch and Rosenmund, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Mohrmann et al., 2015</xref>). The largely unstructured N-terminal domain (residues 1–26 of mammalian CPX1) activates Ca<sup>2+</sup>-regulated vesicular release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Xue et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lai et al., 2016</xref>) while the α-helical accessory domain (CPX<sub>acc</sub>, residues 26–48) serves as the primary clamping domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Xue et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Giraudo et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Maximov et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Yang et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kümmel et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cho et al., 2014</xref>). A central helical sequence within CPX (CPX<sub>cen</sub>, residues 48–70) binds the groove between pre-assembled Syntaxin and VAMP2 and is essential for both function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chen et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Xue et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Giraudo et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Maximov et al., 2009</xref>). The remainder c-terminal portion (residues 71–134) has been shown to preferentially associate with curved lipid membrane via an amphipathic helical region and promotes the clamping function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Kaeser-Woo et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Wragg et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gong et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>The relative strength of CPX facilitatory vs inhibitory activities differs across species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Yang et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Trimbuch and Rosenmund, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Mohrmann et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Xue et al., 2009</xref>). As a result of this intricate balance, genetic perturbations of CPX can produce apparently contradictory effects in different systems. For example, knockout (KO) of CPX in neuromuscular synapses of <italic>C. elegans</italic> and <italic>Drosophila</italic> results in increased spontaneous release, decreased evoked release with overall reduction in the RPP size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Huntwork and Littleton, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cho et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Martin et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hobson et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Wragg et al., 2013</xref>). In model mammalian synapses, CPX KO abates both spontaneous and evoked release with no significant change in the RRP size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Reim et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Xue et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">López-Murcia et al., 2019</xref>) but acute CPX knockdown (KD) reduces synaptic strength, but also increases spontaneous release with a concomitant reduction in the number of primed vesicles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Maximov et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Yang et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Kaeser-Woo et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Yang et al., 2013</xref>). Some of the apparent discrepancies might be related to the perturbation method used (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Yang et al., 2013</xref>); nonetheless, the physiological role of mammalian CPX in regulating SV fusion and the underlying mechanisms remains in the center of debate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Mohrmann et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Trimbuch and Rosenmund, 2016</xref>).</p><p>The interpretation of the physiological experiments can be limited by presence of the different CPX isoforms and possible compensatory homeostatic mechanisms. As such, the experiments in live synapses need to be complemented with a reductionist approach where the variables are limited, and the components can be rigorously controlled or altered. It is our hypothesis that the most direct mechanistic insight can be obtained from fully controlled cell-free systems. We have described a biochemically defined fusion setup based on a pore-spanning lipid bilayer setup that is well-suited for this purpose (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Ramakrishnan et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Ramakrishnan et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Ramakrishnan et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>Using this in vitro setup, which allows for precision study of the single-vesicle fusion kinetics, we recently demonstrated that mammalian CPX (mCPX), along with Syt1 and SNAREs, are essential and sufficient to achieve Ca<sup>2+</sup>-regulated fusion under physiologically relevant conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Ramakrishnan et al., 2020</xref>). Our data revealed that mCPX and Syt1 act co-operatively to clamp the SNARE assembly process and produce a pool of docked vesicles. The study also revealed that there are at least two types of clamped SNAREpins under a docked vesicle – a small subset that are reversibly clamped by binding to Syt1 (which we termed ‘<italic>central</italic>’) and a larger population that are thought to be free of Syt1 and require mCPX for clamping (termed ‘<italic>peripheral</italic>’). We further established that Syt1s’ ability to oligomerize and bind SNAREpins via the ‘primary’ binding site on SNAP25 is key to its ability to clamp <italic>central</italic> SNAREpins and that the activation of these Syt1-associated SNAREpins is sufficient to elicit rapid, Ca<sup>2+</sup>-synchronized vesicle fusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Ramakrishnan et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>Building on this work, here we use a systematic in vitro reconstitution strategy to obtain new and direct insights into the molecular basis of mCPX clamping function and its role in establishing Ca<sup>2+</sup>-regulated release. We report that mCPX inhibitory function requires a delay in overall fusion kinetics and involves well-defined interaction of the accessory-central helical fragments with the SNAREpins. The accessory-central helical domains also stimulate Ca<sup>2+</sup>-triggered vesicle fusion from the clamped state. Overall, we find that under physiologically-relevant conditions, mCPX is essential to generate/maintain a pool of docked vesicles and to promote Ca<sup>2+</sup>-triggered rapid ( &lt; 10ms) and synchronous fusion of the docked vesicles.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>To dissect the mCPX clamping functionality, we used physiologically relevant reconstitution conditions similar to our previous work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Ramakrishnan et al., 2020</xref>). Typically, we used small unilamellar vesicles (SUV) with ~70 copies (outward facing) of VAMP2 (vSUV) without or with ~25 copies Syt1 (Syt1-vSUV) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). We employed pre-formed t-SNAREs (1:1 complex of Syntaxin1 and SNAP-25) in the planar bilayers (containing 15% PS and 3% PIP2) to both simplify the experimental approach and to bypass the requirement of SNARE-assembling chaperones, Munc18 and Munc13 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Baker and Hughson, 2016</xref>). Mammalian CPX1 (wild type or variants) was included in solution, typically at 2 μM unless noted otherwise (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). We used fluorescently labeled lipid (2% ATTO647N-PE) to track docking, clamping and spontaneous fusion of individual vesicles and a content dye (sulforhodamine B) to study Ca<sup>2+</sup>-triggered fusion of docked vesicles from the clamped state.</p><p>To focus on the ‘clamping’ of constitutive fusion events, we monitored large ensembles of vesicles to determine the percent remaining unfused as a function of time elapsed after docking and quantified as ‘survival percentages’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Ramakrishnan et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Ramakrishnan et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Ramakrishnan et al., 2018</xref>). Docked immobile vesicles that remained un-fused during the initial 10-min observation period were defined as ‘clamped’ and the ‘docking-to-fusion’ delay enabled us to quantify the strength of the fusion clamp (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Ramakrishnan et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Ramakrishnan et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Ramakrishnan et al., 2018</xref>). Since we track the fate of single vesicles, this analysis allowed us to examine the ‘clamping’ mechanism, independent of any alteration in the preceding docking sub-step.</p><p>Our earlier results showed that Syt1 alone can meaningfully delay but not stably clamp SNARE-mediated fusion. Similarly, mCPX, on its own, is ineffective in clamping SNARE-driven vesicle fusion. In fact, both Syt1 and mCPX are needed to produce a stably ‘clamped’ state which can then be reversed by Ca<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Ramakrishnan et al., 2020</xref>). It is possible that Syt1 and mCPX1 either act jointly to generate a new intermediate state in the SNARE assembly pathway or operate sequentially, with the kinetic delay introduced by Syt1 enabling mCPX to arrest SNARE assembly. To distinguish between these possibilities, we developed a mimic for the Syt1 clamp – a lipid-conjugated ssDNA that is capable of regulating SNARE-driven fusion in situ. Without directly interacting with the SNAREs, the specific base-pair hybridization of the complementary ssDNA reconstituted into the SUVs and the planar bilayer introduces a steric barrier which is expected to, and indeed does delay fusion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). Moreover, this docking-to-fusion delay could be varied by adjusting the number of ssDNA molecules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Syt1 and mCPX act sequentially to arrest SNARE-driven fusion.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic of the programmable DNA-based mimetic used to simulate the Syt1 clamp on the SNARE-driven fusion. Annealing of the complementary ssDNA reconstituted into the SUV and the bilayer in dsDNA sterically counters the polarized SNARE assembly process and introduces a docking-to-fusion delay reminiscent of Syt1 (<bold>B</bold>) Survival analysis (Kaplan-Meier plot) curve shows that a nominal dock-to-fusion delay introduced by 20 copies of ssDNA (purple) allows mCPX to arrest spontaneous fusion of vSUVs. In contrast, no clamping was observed with 5 copies of ssDNA (yellow) which created no appreciable delay in the fusion kinetics. This suggests a sequentially mode of action for Syt1 and mCPX, wherein the kinetic delay introduced by Syt1 enables mCPX to block SNARE-driven fusion. Data was obtained from a minimum of three independent experiments, with at least 100 vesicles analyzed for each condition. A representative survival curve is shown for clarity.</p><p><supplementary-material id="fig1sdata1"><label>Figure 1—source data 1.</label><caption><title>Data and summary statistics for DNA-regulated fusion assay.</title></caption><media mime-subtype="xlsx" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-71938-fig1-data1-v1.xlsx"/></supplementary-material></p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-71938-fig1-v1.tif"/></fig><fig id="fig1s1" position="float" specific-use="child-fig"><label>Figure 1—figure supplement 1.</label><caption><title>Coomassie-stained SDS-PAGE analysis of the proteins used in this study.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Gel image of the Syt1-VAMP2 containing SUVs and t-SNAREs complex (1:1 Syntaxin1A and SNAP25) reconstituted into the free-standing bilayer.

Thus, our data indicates that Syt1 and mCPX likely act sequentially to produce a synergistic clamp, with the delay introduced by Syt1 meta-stable clamp enabling CPX to bind and block the full assembly of the SNARE complex.</p><p>Next, we investigated the role of the distinct domains of mCPX in establishing the fusion block using Syt1 containing vSUV (Syt1-vSUVs). On their own, a majority (~80%) Syt1-vSUVs that docked to the t-SNARE containing bilayer surface were mobile and fused on an average 5–6 s after docking, while a small fraction (~20%) were immobile and stably clamped (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A and B</xref>).

This is consistent with our earlier findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Ramakrishnan et al., 2020</xref>). A truncation mutant (mCPX<sup>26-134</sup>) lacking the unstructured N-terminal domain had very little or no effect on the vesicle docking rate or the fusion clamp, with vesicle behavior near identical to CPX<sup>WT</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A and B</xref>). Deletion of the CPX<sub>acc</sub> in addition to N-terminal domain (mCPX<sup>48-134</sup>) increased the number of docked vesicles (~ two-fold) but abrogated the inhibitory function with majority of the docked vesicles proceeding to fuse spontaneously (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A and B</xref>). Targeted mutations in CPX<sub>cen</sub> (R48A Y52A K69A Y70A; mCPX<sup>4A</sup>) that disrupt its interaction with the SNAREpins completely abolished both the stimulatory effect on vesicle docking and the fusion clamp (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A and B</xref>).

Nonetheless, cross-species rescue experiments have been largely successful, and in fact, CPX<sub>acc</sub> could be exchanged without impairing function in mammalian, fly and nematode synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Xue et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cho et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Radoff et al., 2014</xref>). This raises the question whether the distinct CPX<sub>acc</sub>-SNARE interactions that are vital for mCPX inhibitory functionality in our in vitro assays are physiologically relevant. To address this, we examined the clamping ability of the <italic>C. elegans</italic> (ceCPX) and <italic>Drosophila</italic> (dmCPX) orthologs of mCPX in our in vitro reconstituted assay. Under standard experimental conditions (2 μM CPX), both ceCPX and dmCPX were able to promote vesicle docking (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>) but were considerably less efficient (~15% and ~ 30%, respectively) in preventing spontaneous fusion of Syt1-vSUV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>) as compared near-complete ( &gt; 95%) fusion clamp observed with mCPX (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B and C</xref>). Interestingly, simply increasing the concentrations improved the clamping efficacy of both dmCPX and ceCPX, with ~60–70% of docked vesicles stably-clamped at 20 μM concentration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>) and remained Ca<sup>2+</sup>-sensitive (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4</xref>).</p><p>This suggests that specific molecular interactions of CPX<sub>acc</sub> with SNAREs likely increase the potency of the mCPX inhibitory function and that this effect may be occluded at high concentrations of CPX. To verify this, we examined the effect of the mCPX mutant wherein the endogenous CPX<sub>acc</sub> domain (residues 26–48) is replaced with an artificial alpha helix based on a Glu-Ala-Ala-Lys (EAAK) motif repeated seven times (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Radoff et al., 2014</xref>). Noteworthy, this construct (mCPX<sup>EAAK</sup>) was able to fully-restore CPX inhibitory functionality in <italic>C. elegans</italic> neuromuscular synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Radoff et al., 2014</xref>). In our in vitro assay, CPX<sup>EAAK</sup> enhanced initial docking (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>) but failed to clamp spontaneous fusion (~10% efficiency) under standard experimental conditions (2 μM CPX) and was moderately effective (~50% efficiency) at higher (20 μM CPX) concentration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4</xref>). We note that the accessory helix of mCPX<sup>EAAK</sup> is more hydrophobic in nature and interestingly resembles couple of the gain-of-function ‘super-clamp’ mutations with residue Asp-27 and Glu-34 replaced with Ala (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>). This could potentially explain mCPX<sup>EAAK</sup> ability to partially clamp vesicle fusion at high (20 μM) CPX concentration. Overall, our data supports the notion the specific CPX<sub>acc</sub>-SNARE interaction is functionally relevant and likely enhances CPX inhibitory function.</p><p>Finally, we evaluated the probability and rate of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-triggered fusion from the clamped state in the presence and absence of mCPX. We used Syt1-vSUV loaded with Sulforhodamine B (fluorescent content marker) to track full-fusion events and lipid-conjugated Ca<sup>2+</sup> indicator (Calcium green C24) attached to the planar bilayer to estimate the time of arrival of Ca<sup>2+</sup> at/near the docked vesicles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Consistent with our previous study, the influx of free Ca<sup>2+</sup> (100 μM) triggered simultaneous fusion of &gt;90% of the Syt1/mCPX-clamped vesicles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). These vesicles fused rapidly and synchronously, with a characteristic time-constant (τ) of ~11 msec following the arrival of Ca<sup>2+</sup> locally (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). Considering that the majority of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-triggered fusion occurs within a single frame (13 ms), we suspect that the true Ca<sup>2+</sup>-driven fusion rate is likely &lt;10 ms.</p><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Complexin increases the probability of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-triggered vesicular release.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The effect of mCPX on Ca<sup>2+</sup>-triggered fusion was assessed using a content-release assay with Sulforhodamine-B loaded vesicles. Sulforhodamine-B is largely self-quenched when encapsulated inside an SUV. Fusion of the vesicle results in dilution of the probe, which is accompanied by increasing fluorescence. The Ca<sup>2+</sup>-sensor dye, Calcium Green, introduced in the suspended bilayer (via a lipophilic 24-carbon alkyl chain) was used to monitor the arrival of Ca<sup>2+</sup> at/near the docked vesicles. A representative fluorescence trace before and after the addition of 100 μM Ca<sup>2+</sup> shows that the rise in Sulforhodamine-B (red curve) fluorescence intensity occurs within a single frame (13 ms) of Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding to local Calcium green (green curve) (<bold>B</bold>) End-point analysis at 1 min post Ca<sup>2+</sup>-addition shows that &gt;90% of all Syt1/mCPX-clamped vesicles (~70 copies of VAMP2 and ~25 copies of Syt1) fuse following Ca<sup>2+</sup> addition as compared to ~70% of Syt1-clamped vesicles (~13 copies of VAMP2 and ~25 copies of Syt1). Inclusion of mCPX enhances the fusion probability even under the low-VAMP2 condition suggesting that mCPX promote Ca<sup>2+</sup>-triggered fusion independent of its clamping function. (<bold>C</bold>) Kinetic analysis shows that the clamped vesicles with or without mCPX fuse rapidly following Ca<sup>2+</sup>-addition with near identical time constant of ~11 ms. This represents the temporal resolution limit of our recordings (13 ms frame rate) and the true Ca<sup>2+</sup>-triggered fusion rate may well be below 10 ms. (<bold>D</bold>) Deletion and mutational analysis under low-VAMP2 conditions (SUVs with ~13 copies of VAMP2 and ~25 copies of Syt1) show that the deletion of CPX<sub>acc</sub> (CPX<sup>48-134</sup>, blue bar) or disruption of CPX<sub>cen</sub>-SNARE interaction (CPX<sup>4A</sup>, green bar) abrogate the stimulatory function, but deletion of the N-terminal portion (CPX<sup>26-134</sup>, yellow bar) or the c-terminal domain (CPX<sup>26-83</sup>, purple bar) has no effect. The stimulatory function does not require rigid CPX<sub>acc</sub>-CPX<sub>cen</sub> helix (mCPX<sup>GP</sup>, orange bar) nor clamping specific CPX<sub>acc</sub>-SNARE interaction as non-clamping CPX<sup>EAAK</sup> mutant (cyan bar) and <italic>C. elegans</italic> ortholog (ceCPX, brown bar) retain stimulatory function.

Hence, to obtain stably docked vesicles without mCPX, we used low VAMP2 conditions that is, SUVs containing ~13 copies of VAMP2 and ~25 copies of Syt1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). We have previously demonstrated that under these conditions, Syt1 alone is sufficient to produce stably-clamped vesicles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Ramakrishnan et al., 2019</xref>) and that is what we observe, with &gt;95% of docked vesicles immobile post-docking. Addition of Ca<sup>2+</sup> (100 μM) triggered rapid and synchronous fusion of ~70% of these Syt1-clamped vesicles (with <italic>τ</italic> ~ 11 msec) as compared to &gt;90% fusion of Syt1/mCPX-clamped vesicles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B and C</xref>). Besides mCPX, the number of SNAREpins available on a given vesicle is also different between the two conditions (~13 VAMP2 in Syt1-alone vs. ~70 VAMP2 in Syt1/CPX). Hence, to verify that the observed effect is directly attributable to mCPX, we tested and confirmed that the inclusion of mCPX under low VAMP2 conditions increased the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-triggered fusion probability (~90%) from the clamped state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). This indicated that besides clamping vesicle fusion, mCPX also promotes Ca<sup>2+</sup>-triggered vesicle fusion from the clamped state.</p><p>To identify the molecular aspects underlying mCPX stimulatory function, we examined the effect of mCPX mutants on Ca<sup>2+</sup>-triggered release under low VAMP2 conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). Deletion of the N-terminal alone (mCPX<sup>26-134</sup>) or the N- and C-terminal domains (mCPX<sup>26-83</sup>) had very little or no effect on the mCPX stimulatory function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). However, deletion of the CPX<sub>acc</sub> in addition to N-terminal domain (mCPX<sup>48-134</sup>) or disrupting the CPX<sub>cen</sub>-SNARE interaction (mCPX<sup>4A</sup>) abrogated the mCPX activation function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>) suggesting that the CPX<sub>cen</sub> and CPX<sub>acc</sub> domains are crucial for mCPX’s stimulatory function. In contrast to their clamping function, disrupting the rigidity and continuity of the CPX<sub>cen</sub>-CPX<sub>acc</sub> helix with the GPGP insert (mCPX<sup>GP</sup>) had no effect on the activation function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). Furthermore, the mCPX mutant with a randomized CPX<sub>acc</sub> (CPX<sup>EAAK</sup>) and the <italic>C. elegans</italic> ortholog (ceCPX), both of which lack the clamping functionality under the experimental conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>), retained the ability to promote Ca<sup>2+</sup>-triggered fusion of the docked vesicles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>).

In addition, we find that the stimulatory and clamping functionality of mCPX are mechanistically separable. There is a long-standing debate over the role of CPX in establishing a fusion clamp and perhaps the best evidence in support has come from biochemical analyses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Giraudo et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Giraudo et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kümmel et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Lai et al., 2014</xref>) and physiological studies in invertebrate synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Huntwork and Littleton, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cho et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Martin et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hobson et al., 2011</xref>). In the case of mammalian synapses, a role for CPX in blocking spontaneous release events remains controversial because KD/KO manipulations yield seemingly contradictory results and show neuron-specific differences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Xue et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">López-Murcia et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Maximov et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Yang et al., 2013</xref>). Here, using a fully defined albeit simplified cell-free system we provide compelling evidence that mCPX is an integral part of the overall clamping mechanism and delineate the molecular mechanism of mCPX inhibitory function. The distinct effects of different CPX truncation and targeted mutations match with data obtained from other reductionist or even physiological systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Giraudo et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Giraudo et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kümmel et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cho et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Lai et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gong et al., 2016</xref>) forcefully arguing for the physiological relevance of results obtained from our in vitro reconstituted assay.</p><p>Our experiments indicate that mCPX inhibitory function entails distinct and specific interactions of the CPX<sub>cen</sub> and CPX<sub>acc</sub> domains with assembling SNAREpins, and that the c-terminal domain augments clamping function by increasing the local concentration and/or by proper orientation of CPX via interactions with the vesicle membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Our results indicate that CPX<sub>cen</sub> binds in the groove between assembling Syntaxin and VAMP2 helices at the early stages of vesicle docking to stabilize the partially-zippered SNAREpins, consequently promote vesicle docking. This in turn positions CPX<sub>acc</sub> to block further zippering of SNARE complex both by directly capturing the VAMP2 c-terminus and by simultaneously occupying its binding pocket on the t-SNARE. In line with earlier reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chen et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Xue et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Radoff et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cho et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kümmel et al., 2011</xref>), we find that a continuous, rigid CPX helix is essential for a stable fusion clamp. However, the precise configuration of this clamped state under the docked vesicles has been unclear. This is in large part due to the observed variability in the positioning of the CPX<sub>acc</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Choi et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Malsam et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Zhou et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kümmel et al., 2011</xref>).

However, the divergence in clamping ability among the mammalian, fly, and nematode CPXs is diminished at higher concentrations of CPX. This might explain the puzzling observation that in physiological analyses, when CPX is over-expressed, cross-species rescue experiments are largely successful yet CPX<sub>acc</sub>-SNARE disrupting mutants’ exhibit limited effect on the CPX clamping ability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Yang et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cho et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Radoff et al., 2014</xref>). Considering that the CPX<sub>acc</sub> is highly divergent across different species, it is conceivable that CPX<sub>acc</sub> has distinctively evolved to optimally bind and clamp the species-specific SNARE partners. Additional biochemical/structural studies are needed to address this question.</p><p>Overall, our data strongly argues that mCPX has an intrinsic capacity to inhibit SNARE-dependent fusion and under minimal conditions is required (along with Syt1) to generate and maintain a pool of release-ready vesicles. Indeed, functionality of mCPX observed in our in vitro system perfectly matches with physiological studies in model invertebrate systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Martin et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hobson et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Huntwork and Littleton, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cho et al., 2014</xref>). However, recent physiological studies in mammalian synapses reported that acute CPX loss reduces SV fusion probability but does not unclamp spontaneous fusion. Hence, they conclude that CPX is dispensable for ‘fusion clamping’ in mammalian neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">López-Murcia et al., 2019</xref>). It is worth noting that under these conditions CPX removal abates both spontaneous and evoked neurotransmitter release without changing the number of docked vesicles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">López-Murcia et al., 2019</xref>). This suggests that acute CPX loss likely affects the late-stage vesicle priming process, and it is possible this ‘loss-of-fusion’ phenotype occludes CPX role in regulating spontaneous fusion events. Indeed, rescue experiments in CPX1/2/3 triple-knockout mouse background show that the CPX<sub>acc</sub> mutants enhances the spontaneous fusion events without altering evoked release, revealing that mCPX has a strong suppressive clamping function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Malsam et al., 2020</xref>). It is feasible mCPX also plays a more specialized role in mammalian synapses and is primarily involved in stabilizing newly primed synaptic vesicles and prevents their premature fusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Dhara et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Chang et al., 2015</xref>). In doing so, mCPX may function as a fusion clamp in an activity-dependent manner and is critical to blocking spontaneous/tonic and asynchronous vesicular release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Dhara et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Chang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Yang et al., 2010</xref>) and indirectly promoting synchronous SV exocytosis.</p><p>mCPX on its own is ineffective in clamping SNARE-driven vesicle fusion, as the c-terminal portion of VAMP2 assembles into the SNARE complex far faster than free CPX can bind to prevent its zippering (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Gao et al., 2012</xref>). As such, a delay in SNARE zippering is required for the CPX to bind and thereby block fusion. The fact that sufficient delay can be artificially provided by ~20 copies of DNA duplexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) suggest that under physiological conditions, Syt1 (and perhaps other proteins on the SV) might hinder the SNARE assembly by a simple steric mechanism, enabling mCPX to function as a fusion clamp. This is supported by the observation that the Syt1 clamp or the formation of the <italic>central</italic> SNAREpins are not strictly required for mCPX clamping function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Ramakrishnan et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activation studies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>) show that mCPX also contributes to Ca<sup>2+</sup>-triggered vesicle fusion from the clamped state. Reinforcing our earlier reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Ramakrishnan et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Ramakrishnan et al., 2020</xref>), we find that Syt1 and a small number of SNAREs are largely sufficient to get Ca<sup>2+</sup>-evoked fusion with ~70% of vesicles fusing in response to 100 μM Ca<sup>2+</sup>. Inclusion of mCPX increases the fusion probability with &gt;90% Ca<sup>2+</sup>-triggered fusion from the clamped state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). We do not observe any change in the fusion kinetics (<italic>τ</italic>~11ms) without or with mCPX (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>), at least with our current time resolution of ~13 ms and persistent high Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels as opposed to Ca<sup>2+</sup>-transients in the synapse.</p><p>Deletion/mutational analyses reveal that the α-helical CPX<sub>cen</sub> and CPX<sub>acc</sub> are the minimal domain required for the activation function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Specifically, the well-defined CPX<sub>cen</sub>-SNARE interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chen et al., 2002</xref>) was found to be critical for the stimulatory function and this effect is observed even low VAMP2 conditions that is with vesicles containing Syt1-clamped <italic>central</italic> SNAREpins only (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>).

Our data shows that CPX<sub>acc</sub> also contributes to the activation function, but the underlying mechanism is unclear. CPX<sub>acc</sub> could act indirectly by promoting CPX<sub>cen</sub> binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Radoff et al., 2014</xref>) <italic>or</italic> directly by interacting with the SNARE complex albeit in a manner different from the clamping interactions.</p><p>The data presented here, taken together with our earlier report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Ramakrishnan et al., 2020</xref>), suggests a parsimonious model of how Syt1 and CPX could regulate SNARE-mediated fusion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>). We posit that under every docked vesicle, there are two types of SNAREpins – the <italic>central</italic> SNAREpins which are bound to Syt1 and are responsible for Ca<sup>2+</sup>-triggered release and <italic>peripheral</italic> SNAREpins which are not bound to Syt1 and thus, not directly regulated by Ca<sup>2<italic>+</italic></sup>. We further suggest that the <italic>central</italic> and <italic>peripheral</italic> SNAREpins are equal in number and are assembled as a pair via a common, bridging molecule of CPX (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). At the early stages of SV docking, Syt1 oligomers bind and clamp sub-set of <italic>central</italic> SNAREpins via the ‘primary’ interface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Ramakrishnan et al., 2020</xref>). CPX bind the Syt1-associated <italic>central</italic> SNAREpins via the CPX<sub>cen</sub> which positions the CPX<sub>acc</sub> helix to bind the t-SNAREs an oppositely-oriented SNAREpin occupying the space where the C-terminal half of VAMP2 would ordinarily zipper to drive fusion. In this way, CPX<sub>acc</sub> acts to clamp the <italic>peripheral</italic> SNAREpin. This ‘bridging model’ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>) is based on the known ‘trans-clamping’ interaction observed in the pre-fusion CPX/SNAREpin crystal structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kümmel et al., 2011</xref>) and is validated by biochemical and functional analyses both previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cho et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Krishnakumar et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Krishnakumar et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kümmel et al., 2011</xref>) and in the current work. In addition, CPX<sub>acc</sub> might also directly interact with the <italic>peripheral</italic> VAMP2 c-terminus to prevent its assembly (not shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>).</p><p>As evidenced in the recent crystal structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Zhou et al., 2017</xref>), CPX<sub>cen</sub> binding to the <italic>central</italic> SNAREpins likely creates a new binding interface for second Syt1 to bind the same SNAREpins. Thus, mCPX could regulate Ca<sup>2+</sup> triggered vesicle fusion via the ‘tripartite’ interface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>). Supporting this proposition, we have previously shown the ‘tripartite’ interface is not necessary to produce stably docked vesicles but is required for efficient Ca<sup>2+</sup>-triggered fusion from the clamped state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Ramakrishnan et al., 2020</xref>). In fact, disrupting binding of Syt1 to the tripartite interface lowers the fusion probability (~25%) similar to that observed with the removal of mCPX (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Ramakrishnan et al., 2020</xref>). Furthermore, as the tripartite binding motif is largely conserved among different Synaptotagmin isoforms, so it is possible that mCPX binding could enable synergistically regulation of vesicular release by different calcium sensors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Volynski and Krishnakumar, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Zhou et al., 2017</xref>). In addition to creating the ‘tripartite’ interface, mCPX binding might also promote vesicle fusion by stabilizing the full zippering SNARE complex. Obviously, this model is highly speculative and further functional studies (with higher temporal resolution, physiological Ca<sup>2+</sup> dynamics and different calcium sensors) as well as high-resolution structural data of vesicle-membrane junctions are needed to dissect the precise role of mCPX and its synergistic action with Syt1 in regulating Ca<sup>2+</sup>-triggered vesicular fusion from the clamped state.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Proteins and materials</title><p>The following cDNA constructs, which have been previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Krishnakumar et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Ramakrishnan et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Ramakrishnan et al., 2020</xref>), were used in this study: full-length VAMP2 (VAMP2-His<sup>6</sup>, residues 1–116); full-length VAMP2<sup>4X</sup> (VAMP2-His<sup>6</sup>, residues 1–116 with L70D, A74R, A81D, L84D mutations), full-length t-SNARE complex (mouse His<sup>6</sup>-SNAP25B, residues 1–206 and rat Syntaxin1A, residues 1–288); Synaptotagmin (rat Synaptotagmin1-His<sup>6</sup>, residues 57–421); Complexins (human His<sup>6</sup>-Complexin 1, residues 1–134; <italic>C. elegans</italic> His<sup>6</sup>-Complexin, residues 1–143; <italic>Drosophila</italic> His<sup>6</sup>-Complexin1, residues 1–139).

All the lipids used in this study were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, AL).

The proteo-SUVs were further purified via float-up using discontinuous Nycodenz gradient. The lipid composition was 88 (mole) % DOPC, 10% PS and 2% ATTO647-PE for VAMP2 ( ± Syt1) SUVs and we used protein: lipid (input) ratio of 1:100 for VAMP2 for physiological density, 1: 500 for VAMP2 at low copy number, and 1: 250 for Syt1. Based on the densitometry analysis of Coomassie-stained SDS gels and assuming the standard reconstitution efficiency, we estimated the vesicles contain 73 ± 6 (normal physiological-density) or 13 ± 3 (low-density) and 25 ± 4 copies of outward-facing VAMP2 and Syt1 respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Single-vesicle fusion assay</title><p>All the single-vesicle fusion measurements were carried out with suspended lipid bilayers as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Ramakrishnan et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Ramakrishnan et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Ramakrishnan et al., 2020</xref>). Briefly, t-SNARE-containing giant unilamellar vesicles (80% DOPC, 15% DOPS, 3% PIP2 and 2% NBD-PE) were prepared using the osmotic shock protocol and busted onto Si/SiO<sub>2</sub> chips containing 5 µm diameter holes in presence of HEPES buffer (25 mM HEPES, 140 mM KCl, 1 mM DTT) supplemented with 5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>. The free-standing lipid bilayers were extensively washed with HEPES buffer containing 1 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub> and the fluidity of the t-SNARE containing bilayers was verified using fluorescence recovery after photo-bleaching using the NBD fluorescence.</p><p>Vesicles (100 nM lipids) were added from the top and allowed to interact with the bilayer for 10 min. The ATTO647N-PE fluorescence introduced in the vesicles were used to track vesicle docking, post-docking diffusion, docking-to-fusion delays and spontaneous fusion events. The time between docking and fusion corresponded to the fusion clamp and was quantified using a ‘survival curve’ whereby delays are pooled together, and their distribution is plotted in the form of a survival function (Kaplan-Meier plots). For the end-point analysis, the number of un-fused vesicles (survival percentage) was estimated ~10 s post-docking. After the initial 10 min, the excess vesicles were removed by buffer exchange (3 x buffer wash) and 1 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub> was added from the top to monitor the effect of Ca<sup>2+</sup> on the docked vesicles. The number of fused (and the remaining un-fused) vesicles was estimated (end-point analysis) ~ 1 min after Ca<sup>2+</sup>-addition. CPX protein (at the indicated final concentration) were added to the experimental chamber and incubated for 5 min prior to the addition of the vesicles. Note: Pre-incubation with either the bilayer or the vesicle does not affect the clamping ability of mCPX and we chose to use pre-incubation with the bilayer (prior to adding SUVs) for the sake of convenience (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>).

We used the lipid: DNA-TEG-Chol input ratios of 1:2000, 1:1000, 1:500, and 1: 200 produce vSUVs with approximately 5, 10, 20, 50 copies of ssDNA per vesicles respectively.

Correspondingly, in the single-vesicle fusion setup, vSUV with 5, 10, and 20 copies of ssDNA docked and fused spontaneously with progressive docking-to-fusion delays, but the majority of 50 ssDNA-vSUV remained docked and un-fused (Data not shown).

To estimate the arrival of Ca<sup>2+</sup> at or near the docked vesicle precisely, as indicated by increased in Calcium green fluorescence at 532 nm, we used resonant scanner to acquire movies at a speed of up to 13 ms per frame with 512 × 32 resolution. For each vesicle fusion kinetics, calcium arrival was monitored over area of an individual hole (5 μm diameter) to get the high signal-to-noise ratio and vesicle fusion was monitored with 0.5 μm ROI around the docked vesicle. In these experiments, we used Sulforhodamine-B loaded Syt1-vSUV and tracked full-fusion events using increase in fluorescence signal due to dequenching of Sulforhodamine-B.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec id="s5" sec-type="additional-information"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf2"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Conceptualization, Formal analysis, Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Methodology, Resources</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Conceptualization, Formal analysis, Investigation, Supervision, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Conceptualization, Investigation, Supervision, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec id="s6" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="transrepform"><label>Transparent reporting form</label><media mime-subtype="pdf" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-71938-transrepform1-v1.pdf"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="sdata1"><label>Source data 1.</label><caption><title>Combined data and summary statistics for all figures and figure supplements.</title></caption><media mime-subtype="zip" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-71938-data1-v1.zip"/></supplementary-material></sec><sec id="s7" sec-type="data-availability"><title>Data availability</title><p>All data generated or analyzed during this study are included in the manuscript and supporting files.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Vivek Malhotra as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>While we find the work potentially interesting, there are 3 concerns (see below) that should be addressed .</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1. The authors report that Cpx can clamp fusion in the presence of 20 ssDNAs, while no clamping was observed with 5 ssDNAs. Since ssDNA is an synthetic factor, conclusions about the copy number of ssDNAs should be drawn with caution. Please perform titration experiments with various ratios of SNAREs and Cpx to demonstrate the clamping kinetics at a variety of protein ratios and concentrations.</p><p>2. The calcium concentration used in the experiments presented in Figure 4 is very high (1 millimolar). Thus, the &quot;activating&quot; effect of Cpx (established in several previous studies in neuronal cultures and in reconstitution experiments) could may have been masked by the high calcium concentration. Please repeat these experiments at a more physiological relevant calcium concentration (e.g., 10-100 μM).</p><p>3. For adding Cpx, the authors used the protocol listed as: &quot;CPX protein (at the indicated final concentration) were added to the experimental chamber and incubated for 5 minutes prior to the addition of the vesicles.&quot; Thus, Cpx was incubated with plasma membrane mimicking bilayers. However, previous work has shown that Cpx also interacts with synaptic vesicles and that this interaction may be essential for its function. Moreover, since Cpx is a curvature sensor, as washed by the injection flow of the vesicles, the effective Cpx concentration used in the present experiments may be much lower than claimed. Moreover, as shown in their previous publication [Ramakrishnan 2020 <italic>eLife</italic>], Cpx can be washed off. Please co-incubate Cpx with vesicles, and then inject calcium to trigger fusion.</p><p>4. The authors utilize several past lines of evidence to support the fusion clamp view of Cpx function including older studies of RNAi knock-down of mouse Cpx1/2, studies from model invertebrates such as worm and fly, as well as the authors' own earlier in vitro work. In general, work on Cpx in cultured mammalian neurons has failed to observe large increases in spontaneous SV fusion rates over the past ~8 years and the field has moved away from relying on RNAi knock down of Cpx1/2 due to artefacts associated with Cpx3 expression. Thus, the authors are advised to be cautious about using the older siRNA KD data as an argument supporting an inhibitory role for Cpx of spontaneous release in neurons. Regardless, the inhibitory role of Cpx is well established in reconstituted systems where calcium-independent fusion is monitored (which is potentially distinct from spontaneous release in neurons that actually depends on low levels of calcium and may depend on other fusion sensors than synaptotagmin1/2). Please comment and discuss.</p><p>5. Conclusions from the lack of an observed Cpx effect on the speed of calcium-triggered fusion may be a bit overstated. There could be changes that are not being detected but are nonetheless physiologically relevant. Synapses display a variety of kinetics with distinct speeds ranging from 100 seconds of microseconds to milliseconds, so there is room for interesting kinetics well below the current 13 milliseconds cutoff of these experiments. Perhaps there are interesting Cpx effects in that physiological range. Please comment and discuss.</p><p>6. The temporal resolution for fast fusion experiments is 13 milliseconds. Thus, it is questionable to use a 7 millisecond time interval for the plots shown in Figure 4C. Moreover, in Figure 4A, the dotted lines to indicate the half-maximum of Sulforhodamine B jump between two time points. However, the signal of Sulforhodamine B reaches its maximum at the next time point. Therefore, the definition of &quot;fusion time&quot; is unclear. The single vesicle fusion assay used in this manuscript is based on the previous <italic>eLife</italic> article where the authors stated that &quot;We typically observed the fluorescence signal increase at the bilayer surface between about three frames (~ 100 milliseconds) after calcium addition (Figure 2—figure supplement 1). We therefore used 100 milliseconds as the benchmark to accurately estimate the time-constants for the ca<sup>2+</sup>-triggered fusion reaction.&quot; Why the authors used the much shorter 7 millisecond time interval in this study? Please clarify and discuss.</p><p>7. For the purpose of delaying fusion long enough to allow the complexin clamp to form, the authors replace synaptotagmin with duplex DNA. Unlike the complexin/synaptotagmin machine, however, this system once clamped cannot proceed to fusion, so it is unclear if the duplex DNA clamped state resembles the physiologically clamped state. Since no physiological experiments are performed, the claims drawn by the present studied should be qualified.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1. The authors utilize several past lines of evidence to support the fusion clamp view of Cpx function including older studies of RNAi knock-down of mouse Cpx1/2, studies from model invertebrates such as worm and fly, as well as the authors' own earlier in vitro work. In general, work on Cpx in cultured mammalian neurons has failed to observe large increases in spontaneous SV fusion rates over the past ~8 years and the field has moved away from relying on RNAi knock down of Cpx1/2 due to artefacts associated with Cpx3 expression. I believe that continued use of the older siRNA KD data as an argument supporting an inhibitory role for Cpx doesn't seem like a constructive way forward when aiming for the mammalian Cpx research community to digest and assimilate this new in vitro data.</p><p>2. There were no mentions of fly or worm Cpx constructs in the Methods section. For instance, was fly Cpx a CAAX box variant? Could that explain its poor clamping? And there was no description of the Cpx(EAAK) construct. The current lack of relevant Materials documentation is not acceptable for publication.</p><p>3. Conclusions from the lack of an observed Cpx effect on the speed of calcium-triggered fusion may be a bit overstated. There could be changes that are not being detected but are nonetheless physiologically relevant. Synapses display a variety of kinetics with distinct speeds ranging from 100s of microseconds to milliseconds, so there's room for interesting kinetics well below the current 13 msec cutoff of these experiments. Perhaps there are interesting Cpx effects in that physiological range.</p><p>4. For the helix-breaking experiments performed in this manuscript using the GPGP insertion (Results section lines 194-200), there is a long history of past work on precisely this concept for Cpx clamping, but these were not directly mentioned or referenced. I would suggest including references to Chen 2002, Xue 2007, Cho 2014 and Radoff 2014 for their past work on destabilizing the propagation of secondary structure from the accessory to central helix and its requirement for Cpx inhibitory function.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1. The authors report that Cpx can clamp fusion in the presence of 20 ssDNAs, while no clamping was observed with 5 ssDNAs. Since ssDNA is an artificial factor, one cannot get any useful information from the copy number ssDNAs. Therefore, a titration experiment with various ratios of SNAREs and Cpx should be performed to demonstrate clamping kinetics.</p><p>2. The Cpx truncations and 4A mutant used in Figure 2 have been shown to reduce spontaneous release before Ca++. What hasn't been shown is the difference on clamping kinetics for these Cpx variants. Therefore, a titration experiment is necessary.</p><p>3. The Ca++ concentration in Figure 4 is too high to test the effect of Cpx. At that high Ca++ concentration, the activation effect of Cpx could be overridden by Ca++. Since effective Ca++-triggered fusion has been observed with 10-100uM Ca++ by many in vitro proteoliposome assays, they have to test 10-100uM Ca++ with much more physiological relevance.</p><p>4. For adding Cpx, the authors used the protocol listed as: &quot;CPX protein (at the indicated final concentration) were added to the experimental chamber and incubated for 5 min prior to the addition of the vesicles.&quot; Basically, Cpx was incubated with plasma membrane mimicking bilayers. However, many papers have shown that Cpx should interact with synaptic vesicles for its function. Moreover, since Cpx is a curvature sensor, as washed by the injection flow of the vesicles, their effective Cpx concentration would be much lower than what has been claimed. As shown in their previous publication [Ramakrishnan 2020 <italic>eLife</italic>], Cpx can be washed off. Therefore, the authors should co-incubate Cpx with vesicles, and then inject Ca++ to trigger fusion.</p><p>5. The temporal resolution for fast fusion experiments is 13msec. The foundation of using a 7 msec time interval for their plots shown in Figure 4C is not clear. No explanation was provided. There is another unclear definition about fusion time. In the Figure 4A, the authors tried to use dotted lines to indicate the half-maximum of Sulforhodamine B jump between two time points. However, the signal of Sulforhodamine B reaches its maximum at the next time point. Therefore, it's not clear about their definition on &quot;fusion time&quot;. The single vesicle fusion assay used in this manuscript is based on their previous publications [Ramakrishnan 2019 Langmuir; Ramakrishnan 2020 <italic>eLife</italic>]. In the method section of their 2020 <italic>eLife</italic> paper, the authors stated that &quot;We typically observed the fluorescence signal increase at the bilayer surface between about three frames (~100 msec) after ca<sup>2+</sup> addition (Figure 2—figure supplement 1). We therefore used 100 msec as the benchmark to accurately estimate the time-constants for the ca<sup>2+</sup>-triggered fusion reaction.&quot; It would be good to learn why the authors start to use 7 msec to estimate fusion in this paper.</p><p><italic>Reviewer # 3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>There are many typographical and/or grammatical errors that the authors should fix. In Figure 2, the color-coding scheme should be consistent. That is, mCPX(48-134) should not be blue in panels A and C and yellow in panel B.

The authors report that Cpx can clamp fusion in the presence of 20 ssDNAs, while no clamping was observed with 5 ssDNAs. Since ssDNA is an synthetic factor, conclusions about the copy number of ssDNAs should be drawn with caution. Please perform titration experiments with various ratios of SNAREs and Cpx to demonstrate the clamping kinetics at a variety of protein ratios and concentrations.</p></disp-quote><p>We have examined the clamping function of mCPX under different reconstitution conditions in the DNA-regulated fusion experiments. Specifically, we assessed the effect of varying the mCPX concentration, VAMP2 density, ssDNA numbers and select mCPX mutants (both individually and in combination). This data, included as Figure 1 Supplement 4 in the revised manuscript, is consistent with our conclusions regarding the need for delay in fusion kinetics for mCPX to arrest SNARE-driven fusion and the underlying molecular mechanisms.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. The calcium concentration used in the experiments presented in Figure 4 is very high (1 millimolar). Thus, the &quot;activating&quot; effect of Cpx (established in several previous studies in neuronal cultures and in reconstitution experiments) could may have been masked by the high calcium concentration. Please repeat these experiments at a more physiological relevant calcium concentration (e.g., 10-100 μM).</p></disp-quote><p>As recommended, we have repeated the ca<sup>2+</sup>-triggered fusion experiments with 100 µM ca<sup>2+</sup> and find that mCPX increases the probability of fusion from the clamped state (~90% with mCPX vs. ~70% without mCPX) but does not alter the kinetics of release (t~11 ms under all conditions). We further carried out deletion/mutation analysis to identify that the CPX<sub>cen</sub> + CPX<sub>acc</sub> constitute the minimal domain for the stimulatory function. Interestingly, we find that neither the continuous, rigid helical domain nor the CPX<sub>acc</sub>-SNARE clamping interaction are required for the activation function. This data is included as Figure 4 in the revised manuscript and the Title/Abstract/Result/Discussion section have been revised accordingly.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. For adding Cpx, the authors used the protocol listed as: &quot;CPX protein (at the indicated final concentration) were added to the experimental chamber and incubated for 5 minutes prior to the addition of the vesicles.&quot; Thus, Cpx was incubated with plasma membrane mimicking bilayers. However, previous work has shown that Cpx also interacts with synaptic vesicles and that this interaction may be essential for its function. Moreover, since Cpx is a curvature sensor, as washed by the injection flow of the vesicles, the effective Cpx concentration used in the present experiments may be much lower than claimed. Moreover, as shown in their previous publication [Ramakrishnan 2020 eLife], Cpx can be washed off. Please co-incubate Cpx with vesicles, and then inject calcium to trigger fusion.</p></disp-quote><p>In the development of the in vitro assay, we systematically tested the effect of pre-incubation of CPX with the bilayer or SUVs and found no difference in the kinetics or clamping ability. We chose to use pre-incubation with the bilayer (prior to adding SUVs) for the sake of convenience. We have additionally tested and confirmed this proposition by using mCPX mutants lacking the c-terminal domain (mCPX<sup>26-83</sup>) or carrying L117W mutation that enhances its interaction with lipid bilayer (mCPX<sup>L117W</sup>). This data is included as Figure 1 Supplement 2 in the revised manuscript and explicated in the Methods section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. The authors utilize several past lines of evidence to support the fusion clamp view of Cpx function including older studies of RNAi knock-down of mouse Cpx1/2, studies from model invertebrates such as worm and fly, as well as the authors' own earlier in vitro work. In general, work on Cpx in cultured mammalian neurons has failed to observe large increases in spontaneous SV fusion rates over the past ~8 years and the field has moved away from relying on RNAi knock down of Cpx1/2 due to artefacts associated with Cpx3 expression. Thus, the authors are advised to be cautious about using the older siRNA KD data as an argument supporting an inhibitory role for Cpx of spontaneous release in neurons. Regardless, the inhibitory role of Cpx is well established in reconstituted systems where calcium-independent fusion is monitored (which is potentially distinct from spontaneous release in neurons that actually depends on low levels of calcium and may depend on other fusion sensors than synaptotagmin1/2). Please comment and discuss.</p></disp-quote><p>Our intent is to provide necessary background and highlight the ongoing debate on the clamping function of CPX, particularly in mammalian synapses. Thus, emphasizing the need for an in vitro reconstituted system to investigate the mechanistic details and complement the physiological studies. Indeed, we have clearly noted (in the same paragraph) that the observed differences in physiological studies could be due to perturbation method used and homeostatic compensatory mechanisms. We believe that we have adequately addressed this issue within the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. Conclusions from the lack of an observed Cpx effect on the speed of calcium-triggered fusion may be a bit overstated. There could be changes that are not being detected but are nonetheless physiologically relevant. Synapses display a variety of kinetics with distinct speeds ranging from 100 seconds of microseconds to milliseconds, so there is room for interesting kinetics well below the current 13 milliseconds cutoff of these experiments. Perhaps there are interesting Cpx effects in that physiological range. Please comment and discuss.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now repeated the experiment with physiologically-relevant ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration (100 µM) and find that CPX increases the probability, but not the kinetics of fusion (See response to Q2 for details). It is possible that effect of CPX on kinetics of ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated fusion might be occluded by the time-resolution (13 ms) of our current experimental setup. We have mentioned this caveat in the Discussion section of the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. The temporal resolution for fast fusion experiments is 13 milliseconds. Thus, it is questionable to use a 7 millisecond time interval for the plots shown in Figure 4C. Moreover, in Figure 4A, the dotted lines to indicate the half-maximum of Sulforhodamine B jump between two time points. However, the signal of Sulforhodamine B reaches its maximum at the next time point. Therefore, the definition of &quot;fusion time&quot; is unclear.</p></disp-quote><p>We use the initial jump in Sulforhodamine-B and Calcium-green signal (marked by dashed lines) rather the peak fluorescence to define the fusion time as this likely correlate to earliest instance of fusion pore opening. Since this occurs within a single frame of recording, we used t<sub>1/2</sub> (~7 msec) of our single frame (13 msec) for the plots in Figure 4C. We strongly believe that the fusion occurs &lt;10 msec in these conditions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7. The single vesicle fusion assay used in this manuscript is based on the previous eLife article where the authors stated that &quot;We typically observed the fluorescence signal increase at the bilayer surface between about three frames (~ 100 milliseconds) after calcium addition (Figure 2—figure supplement 1). We therefore used 100 milliseconds as the benchmark to accurately estimate the time-constants for the ca<sup>2+</sup>-triggered fusion reaction.&quot; Why the authors used the much shorter 7 millisecond time interval in this study? Please clarify and discuss.</p></disp-quote><p>Consistent with our previous report, we observe the ca<sup>2+</sup> fluorescence signal at the bilayer surface ~100 msec after addition. The ca<sup>2+</sup>-addition to the top of the chamber is denoted by arrow in Figure 4A in the revised manuscript (Note: This arrow was inadvertently placed at the 100 msec mark in our older version of the Figure 4A. We apologize for the confusion)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8. For the purpose of delaying fusion long enough to allow the complexin clamp to form, the authors replace synaptotagmin with duplex DNA. Unlike the complexin/synaptotagmin machine, however, this system once clamped cannot proceed to fusion, so it is unclear if the duplex DNA clamped state resembles the physiologically clamped state. Since no physiological experiments are performed, the claims drawn by the present studied should be qualified.</p></disp-quote><p>We used DNA-regulated fusion assay to assess and confirm that the delay in fusion is necessary for mCPX to arrest SNARE assembly. We have now carried out systematic titration of VAMP2, ssDNA and CPX concentration (including CPX mutants) to establish that the clamping mechanisms observed under DNA-regulated fusion reaction is identical to those observed in the presence of Syt1 (see response to Q1 for details). This allows us to directly infer that under physiologically-relevant conditions delay in fusion kinetics, likely imparted by Syt1 or other SV proteins, is required for CPX to clamp SNARE-mediated fusion.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The manuscript has been much improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below:</p><p>It is gratifying that the activating effect of Cpx becomes apparent at 100 μm ca<sup>2+</sup>.

Furthermore, we observe that the mutations in Syt1 or CPX alter the probability of fusion, but not the fusion kinetics. This suggests that the fusion rate is likely much faster than the temporal resolution (13 msec) of our experimental setup. As such, any alterations in fusion kinetics, even at lower (25 mM) ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration, might not be resolved in the current setup. We are working to increase the temporal resolution (1-2 ms) of our fusion system and to include better ca<sup>2+</sup> control. Our future work is focused on using the upgraded fusion setup to dissect the role of Syt1/CPX in modulating vesicle fusion kinetics and as such, is beyond the scope of the current work.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Lines 150-169: how were some of the numbers presented in this paragraph (~80%, ~20%, ~5-fold, etc.) derived from the figures cited?</p></disp-quote><p>The fusion data for Syt1-vSUVs (black curve) is derived from the survival analysis shown in Figure 2B. Consistent with our previous reports (Ramakrishnan et al. 2019 and 2020), we observe that ~80% of Syt1-vSUVs fuse within 4-5 sec and remainder (~20%) stay ‘clamped’ and remain ca<sup>2+</sup>-sensitive up to 2-3 hours.</p><p>The fold changes in the number of docked vesicles are derived from the docking analysis shown in Figure 2A. We inadvertently included the wrong data for the no CPX condition in Figure 2A. We have corrected this mistake and have revised the fold-increase values in the manuscript. For example, we observe ~2-3 docked vesicles per 5 mm hole for Syt1-vSUVs (grey bar) and the inclusion of mCPX<sup>WT</sup> (red bar) increases the number of docked vesicles to ~7-8 vesicles per 5 mm hole, i.e. ~3-fold increase in the number of docked vesicles.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Lines 239-250: the discussion of the mCPX(EAAK) construct is unclear.

Indeed, if the central helix region is included (mCPX residues 26-70) in the sequence alignment, then the mCPX<sup>EAAK</sup> accessory helix region has low-degree sequence similarity with the mCPX<sub>acc</sub> (Figure 3 Supplement 3). Nonetheless, we find that the mCPX<sup>EAAK</sup> accessory helix is more hydrophobic in nature and in fact, resemble couple of gain-of-function ‘super-clamp’ mutations (residues Asp-27 and Glu-34 replaced by Ala) that has been shown to increase the overall clamping efficiency (Figure 3 Supplement 3). This could possibly explain mCPX<sup>EAAK</sup> ability to partially rescue clamping at 20 mM, similar to dmCPX and ceCPX, even though it was an artificial accessory helix sequence.</p><p>We have included the sequence alignment data as Figure 3 Supplement 3 in the revised manuscript. We have also revised the relevant section (Page 8) to remove the reference to 30% sequence identity and included the following language “We note that the accessory helix of mCPX<sup>EAAK</sup> is more hydrophobic in nature and indeed, resembles couple of the gain-of-function ‘super-clamp’ mutations, with residue Asp-27 and Glu-34 replaced with Ala (Figure 3 Supplement 3).
