with an intricate composition of multiple segments. Here, we performed a chemical genetic screen using zebrafish and discovered that prostaglandins, lipid mediators involved in many physiological functions, influenced pronephros segmentation. Modulating levels of prostaglandin E2 (PGE<sub>2</sub>) or PGB<sub>2</sub> restricted distal segment formation and expanded a proximal segment lineage. Perturbation of prostaglandin synthesis by manipulating Cox1 or Cox2 activity altered distal segment formation and was rescued by exogenous PGE<sub>2</sub>. Disruption of the PGE<sub>2</sub> receptors Ptger2a and Ptger4a similarly affected the distal segments. Further, changes in Cox activity or PGE<sub>2</sub> levels affected expression of the transcription factors <italic>irx3b</italic> and <italic>sim1a</italic> that mitigate pronephros segment patterning. These findings show for the first time that PGE<sub>2</sub> is a regulator of nephron formation in the zebrafish embryonic kidney, thus revealing that prostaglandin signaling may have implications for renal birth defects and other diseases.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.17551.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.17551.001</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>kidney</kwd><kwd>nephron</kwd><kwd>nephrogenesis</kwd><kwd>prostaglandins</kwd><kwd>chemical genetics</kwd><kwd>zebrafish</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Zebrafish</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Graduate Research Fellowship - DGE-1313583</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Drummond</surname><given-names>Bridgette E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01DK100237</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wingert</surname><given-names>Rebecca A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Prostaglandin synthesis and PGE2 receptor activity are essential for mediating segmentation of renal progenitors during pronephros formation in the zebrafish.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The kidney serves central functions in metabolic waste excretion, osmoregulation, and electrolyte homeostasis. Vertebrate kidney organogenesis is a dynamic process involving the generation of up to three distinct structures that originate from the intermediate mesoderm (IM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Saxen, 1987</xref>). In mammals, a pronephros, mesonephros, and metanephros develop in succession. Of these structures, the pronephros and mesonephros both eventually disintegrate, leaving the metanephros as the adult kidney. In contrast, lower vertebrates such as fish and amphibians only form a pronephros and mesonephros, which are active during embryogenesis and larval stages, respectively, and the mesonephros subsequently serves as the adult organ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dressler, 2006</xref>).</p><p>During the progression of vertebrate kidney ontogeny, composition of the basic renal functional unit, termed the nephron, remains largely similar across species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Desgrange and Cereghini, 2015</xref>). Nephrons contain a renal corpuscle that filters the blood, a tubule that modifies the filtrate solution, and a collecting duct (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Romagnani et al., 2013</xref>). The tubule portion of the nephron is configured along its proximo-distal axis with specific groupings of cells, termed segments, which possess unique physiological roles in solute reabsorption and secretion. While the organization of proximal and distal nephron segments is broadly conserved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Romagnani et al., 2013</xref>), the genetic and molecular mechanisms that regulate formation of each segment lineage have yet to be fully described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Costantini and Kopan, 2010</xref>).</p><p>The zebrafish embryonic pronephros is a useful model to delineate the processes that regulate vertebrate nephron segmentation because it is anatomically simple, being comprised of only two nephrons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gerlach and Wingert, 2013</xref>). Further, the transparent nature of zebrafish embryos, their <italic>ex utero</italic> development, and the ease at which large numbers can be obtained and managed, are all features that readily facilitate renal development and disease studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Pickart and Klee, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Poureetezadi and Wingert, 2016</xref>). The zebrafish pronephric tubule has four discrete tubule segments: a proximal convoluted tubule (PCT), proximal straight tubule (PST), distal early (DE), and distal late (DL) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Wingert et al., 2007</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). The proximal segments are homologous to the PCT and PST in mammals, while the distal segments are homologous to the mammalian thick ascending limb (TAL) and distal convoluted tubule (DCT), respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Wingert et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Wingert and Davidson, 2008</xref>).<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.17551.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>A novel small molecule screen reveals that prostaglandins alter nephron patterning.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) A diagram detailing the segmentation of the pronephros in relation to somites within the zebrafish embryo.

Prior to this, the renal progenitors undergo complex segment lineage patterning events, beginning with their segregation into rostral and caudal subdomains, a process that is orchestrated by the morphogen retinoic acid (RA) which is locally secreted by the adjacent paraxial mesoderm (PM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Wingert et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Wingert and Davidson, 2011</xref>). Modulating levels of RA affects the specification of renal progenitors, inducing proximal segment lineage formation over distal, which can be accentuated by the addition of exogenous all-trans RA, while distal fates are induced over proximal by inhibiting endogenous production of RA through the application of the biosynthesis inhibitor N,N-diethlyaminobenzaldehyde (DEAB) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Wingert et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Wingert and Davidson, 2011</xref>).

Despite these advances, the identity of the other essential signals that control renal progenitor fate decisions has remained elusive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cheng et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Historically, prostaglandins have been defined as functionally diverse molecules that regulate an array of biological tasks, including inflammation and vasoregulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Funk, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Tootle, 2013</xref>). With regard to the adult kidney, prostaglandins regulate many aspects of renal physiology, ranging from tubular transport processes to hemodynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Nasrallah et al., 2007</xref>). Prostaglandins are lipid mediators produced by the sequential actions of a series of enzymes, and exert their effects by paracrine or autocrine signaling through distinct G-protein coupled receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Funk, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Tootle, 2013</xref>). More specifically, there are five major prostaglandins produced from the precursor arachidonic acid (AA) by the enzymes Prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase one or Prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase 2a (Ptgs1 and Ptgs2a in zebrafish, also known as cyclooxygenases COX-1 and COX-2 in mammals) followed by subsequent processing by particular synthases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Funk, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Tootle, 2013</xref>). Each bioactive prostanoid interacts with one or more G-protein coupled membrane receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Funk, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Tootle, 2013</xref>). For example, COX activity on AA can generate the intermediate PGH<sub>2</sub>, from which the PGE<sub>2</sub> bioactive can be produced by the prostaglandin E synthase (Ptges) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). PGE<sub>2</sub> will signal by subsequent interactions with Ptger G-protein coupled receptors including EP1, EP2, EP3 and EP4 (known as Ptger1-4 in zebrafish) on receiving cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Funk, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Tootle, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Yang et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>While prostaglandin biosynthesis and signal transduction have been extensively studied in both healthy and diseased adult tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Matsuoka and Narumiya, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Smyth et al., 2009</xref>), knowledge of their roles in development have been more challenging to ascertain for several reasons. Firstly, although it is thought that various factors that produce prostaglandins are broadly expressed during ontogeny, precise knowledge about the spatiotemporal progression of particular pathway components is incomplete. Secondly, there is a substantial void in our understanding due to the results of murine loss of function studies where genetic disruptions of components within the prostaglandin pathway was associated with observably normal development. This led to the hypothesis that maternal prostaglandin sources had rescued embryogenesis, thereby complicating the use of mammalian models to study prostaglandin requirements during ontogeny. The importance of reevaluating prostaglandin signaling in kidney formation has been emphasized by a recent report that COX-2 dosage is critical for murine metanephros development, though it is presently enigmatic whether there are requirement(s) for discrete stages of nephrogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Slattery et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>In lieu of the challenges of using mammalian systems to delineate the roles of prostaglandin signaling during development, considerable insights in vertebrates have nevertheless been achieved recently through research using the zebrafish model. Most notably, there have been transformative revelations regarding the conserved roles of prostaglandin signaling during definitive blood formation, where PGE<sub>2</sub> was found to regulate hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) development and function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">North et al., 2007</xref>). A chemical genetic screen in zebrafish also identified the prostaglandin pathway as a modifier of endoderm organogenesis, where in subsequent work it was found that PGE<sub>2</sub> activity controls opposing cell fate decisions in the developing pancreas and liver through the <italic>ep4a</italic> receptor (also known as <italic>ptger4a</italic>), which derive from a bipotential endoderm progenitor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Garnaas et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Nissim et al., 2014</xref>). Other than these studies, there is little known about how prostaglandin signaling may affect cell fate decisions during the emergence of other vertebrate tissues.</p><p>Here, we report the discovery that PGE<sub>2</sub> signaling has potent effects in regulating proximal and distal segment formation during nephrogenesis in the developing zebrafish kidney. Using the zebrafish embryo for gain and loss of function studies, in addition to whole mount <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization (WISH) to profile gene expression, we uncovered that the Cox enzymes Ptgs1 and Ptgs2a, as well as the PGE<sub>2</sub> receptors Ptger2a and Ptger4a, are necessary to properly establish distal nephron segment boundaries during pronephros genesis. Further, we found that addition of PGE<sub>2</sub> was sufficient to rescue distal segmentation in Ptgs1 and Ptgs2a deficient zebrafish. Interestingly, treatment with exogenous PGE<sub>2</sub> or PGB<sub>2</sub> during nephrogenesis induced a striking expansion of a proximal tubule segment lineage in a dosage-dependent manner. Taken together, this work reveals for the first time that alterations in PGE<sub>2</sub> signaling, and possibly other prostaglandins as well, has important consequences for the developing nephron.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Chemical genetic screen reveals that prostaglandin levels affect nephron development</title><p>To date, much remains unknown concerning the factors that control nephron segment development and cell fate decisions. The zebrafish pronephros is an experimentally tractable system to interrogate the genetic factors that regulate nephrogenesis because of its simple, conserved tubule structure, with two proximal segments and two distal segments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Ebarasi et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Drummond and Wingert, 2016</xref>). The nephrons share a blood filter comprised of podocyte cells (P), followed by a neck (N) segment that transports fluid into the tubule, and finally a pronephric duct (PD) that drains caudally at the cloaca (C), a common exit for the kidney and gut in the embryo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, middle panel). Nephron segment fates are established by the 24 hpf stage, based on the expression of unique solute transporters, and each segment has been mapped to a precise axial location relative to the somites that comprise the embryonic trunk (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, bottom panel), which facilitates the analysis of pattern formation within the renal progenitor field (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Wingert et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>Chemical genetics is a powerful approach to study developmental events in the context of the whole organism, and the application of chemical genetics in the zebrafish has led to a number of valuable discoveries about the mechanisms of organogenesis in diverse tissues, including derivatives of the mesoderm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lessman, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Poureetezadi and Wingert, 2013</xref>). Therefore, we hypothesized that a chemical genetic screen could provide new insights about the identity of nephrogenesis regulators. To this end, we performed a chemical genetic screen using the Screen-Well ICCB Known Bioactives Library (Enzo Life Sciences), a collection that includes 480 compounds with known biological activities. Zebrafish embryos were collected from timed matings of wild-type (WT) adults, and then arrayed in 96-well plates for control (dimethyl sulfoxide, DMSO) or experimental treatment between 4 and 24 hpf (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). At the 24 hpf stage, embryos were fixed for multiplex WISH analysis, during which they were assessed for expression of a set of genetic markers that distinguished alternating nephron segments within the pronephros, namely <italic>wt1b</italic> to directly label the P, <italic>slc20a1a</italic> to label the PCT, and <italic>slc12a1</italic> to label the DE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Because these riboprobes stain alternating nephron segments, they enabled precise scoring as to whether exposure to each chemical led to an expansion or restriction of these distinct cell types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>).</p><p>In total, 16.25% (78/480) of ICCB bioactives were associated with nephron phenotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>). The effect of each compound was annotated as to whether the experimental dosage was associated with WT development, an expansion in segment(s) (P+, PCT+, DE+) or a restriction in segment(s) (P-, PCT-, DE-) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>). The compounds that led to alterations in nephrogenesis included numerous RA pathway agonists and antagonists, such as 4-hydroxyphenylretinamide (4-HPR), a synthetic analog of all-trans RA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Poureetezadi et al., 2014</xref>). Compared to WTs, exposure to 1 mM 4-HPR led to an expansion of the PCT, caudal shift of the DE, and a dramatic expansion of the interval between these segments where the PST normally emerges, suggestive of an expanded PST segment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Poureetezadi et al., 2014</xref>). The observation that molecules which impact the RA pathway were flagged as hits in the screen provided an important positive control for our experimental system, given the well-established effects of RA levels on renal progenitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Wingert et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Wingert and Davidson, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Li et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cheng and Wingert, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Marra and Wingert, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Drummond et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>In further surveying the identities and respective classifications of the small molecules that impacted nephrogenesis, we noted a striking trend with regard to prostaglandin pathway agonists and tubule segmentation. Among the screen hits, a series of prostaglandin cytokine moieties were independently flagged as modifiers of tubule segment formation, including PGD<sub>2</sub>, PGA<sub>1</sub>, PGJ<sub>2</sub>, and PGB<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>). Exposure to these bioactive prostaglandins was associated with changes in the pronephros whereby there was a reduced PCT segment length and a posterior shift in the position of the DE, such that there was a noticeably longer domain between these segment regions compared to WT control embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). The discovery that exposure to exogenous prostaglandins was linked with several segmentation changes was particularly fascinating to us because PGE<sub>2</sub> signaling has been associated recently with the development of several tissues, including HSCs and fate choice in endoderm derivatives between the liver and pancreas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">North et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Nissim et al., 2014</xref>).

Further, there was a caudal shift in the position of the DE segment though its absolute length was unchanged, based on expression of the DE-specific marker <italic>slc12a1</italic>, which resides between the domains of the PST and DL segments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplements 1</xref>,<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">2</xref>). Overall, these results recapitulated the phenotypes observed following treatment with various bioactive prostaglandins during the chemical screen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). To determine if embryo dimensions were a factor in pronephros segment domain changes, we measured control and treated embryos from tip to tail as well as their pronephric domain (somite 3 to somite 18). We found no statistical differences in the body axis length or pronephric domain between WT controls and dmPGE<sub>2</sub> treated embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>). To further gauge the possible side effects of dmPGE<sub>2</sub> treatment on surrounding tissues, we assessed development of specific tissues using WISH. We noted no significant changes in the vascular marker <italic>flk1</italic> or primitive blood precursors using the marker <italic>gata1</italic> between WT controls and 100 μM dmPGE<sub>2</sub> treated embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4A,B</xref>). Furthermore, we performed o-dianisidine staining, which labels hemoglobinized erythrocytes and thereby provides a sensitive assessment of defects in circulation or vascular integrity that can be undetected by live imaging with stereomicroscopy. o-dianisidine staining showed that blood flow in WTs and 100 μM dmPGE<sub>2</sub> treated embryos was equivalent through the 48–55 hpf stage, as we did not observe compromised vessel integrity or hematomas (e.g. bleeding, blood pooling) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4C</xref>). This suggests that PGE<sub>2</sub> exposure did not cause major aberrations in tissues surrounding the pronephros. In sum, these observations confirmed the finding from the chemical screen that exogenous PGB<sub>2</sub> had profound effects on nephron segment formation, and revealed that alterations in PGE<sub>2</sub> had similar consequences.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Expression of Ptges enzymes is required for normal distal pronephros segment development</title><p>Next, we determined whether endogenous prostaglandin biosynthesis mediated by the Ptges (e.g. Cox1, Cox2) enzymes was necessary for normal nephron segmentation. To test this, we incubated WT embryos with the compound indomethacin, a nonselective Cox1 and Cox2 enzyme inhibitor, which inhibits the first stage of prostanoid biosynthesis, and has been shown to suppress PGE<sub>2</sub> production in zebrafish by mass spectrometry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Grosser et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Cha et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">North et al., 2007</xref>).

To test this, we treated WT embryos with either the nonselective Cox1/2 antagonist indomethacin (30 µM) to block Ptgs activity or the agonist dmPGE<sub>2</sub> (100 µM) from the 12 ss through to the 24 hpf time point, and then performed WISH to assess the pronephros segments.

Further, dmPGE<sub>2</sub> treatment from the 12 ss to 24 hpf was sufficient to induce an expansion of the PST and a reduction of the DL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). Absolute measurements of these segments changes in indomethacin and dmPGE<sub>2</sub> treated embryos revealed that they were significant compared to controls and were similar to pharmacological exposures performed between the 4 hpf and 24 hpf time period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). Interestingly, we also found that treatments with either of two different Ptger2 small molecule antagonists, PF04418948 or AH6809, from the 12 ss to 24 hpf was likewise sufficient to induce a statistically significant expansion of the DE segment and reduction of the DL segment compared to WT controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>).

By conducting a chemical genetic screen in zebrafish embryos to identify factors that affect nephron development, we found that several prostaglandin moieties were capable of modulating proximal-distal segmentation, first validating PGB<sub>2</sub> and then subsequently identifying PGE<sub>2</sub> as well (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). Specifically, we demonstrated that the addition of exogenous PGE<sub>2</sub> or PGB<sub>2</sub> was sufficient to increase PST segment size in a dosage-dependent manner. Using several chemical and genetic approaches, we demonstrated that abrogated prostaglandin activity alters formation of the DE and DL nephron tubule segments, where deficiencies in <italic>ptgs1</italic>, <italic>ptgs2a</italic>, or the PGE<sub>2</sub> receptors encoded by <italic>ptger2a</italic> and <italic>ptger4a</italic> led to an expanded DE and reduced DL segment, and that PGE<sub>2</sub> could specifically rescue the loss of Ptgs1 or Ptgs2a. We also determined that changes in Cox-mediated prostaglandin synthesis or PGE<sub>2</sub> correlated with alterations in the expression domains of essential segmentation transcription factors in renal progenitors, suggesting some mechanisms by which prostaglandin signaling acts to influence segmentation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>).

Based on this and our ability to rescue Cox1/2 deficiency with dmPGE<sub>2</sub> treatment alone, we theorize that PGE<sub>2</sub> is the central endogenous signaling component that affects pronephros development. Further, the localization of <italic>ptger2a</italic> and <italic>ptger4a</italic> expression in renal progenitors suggests that these cells directly receive and respond to prostaglandin signals. Since prostaglandins are known to act in an autocrine or paracrine fashion with short half-lives, we speculate that the IM renal precursors themselves or nearby tissues like the paraxial mesoderm are the local source(s) of prostanoids. Based on the results of several epistasis experiments, we currently hypothesize that PGE<sub>2</sub> signaling restricts the DE fate in part by negatively regulating <italic>irx3b</italic>, and that elevated PGE<sub>2</sub> levels expand the PST segment through positive regulation of <italic>sim1a</italic>, though future studies are needed to delineate if these interactions are direct or indirect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>).

In alignment with these data, exposure to COX inhibitors like indomethacin during human development is associated with renal failure, where the histological aspects include small glomeruli and microcystic lesions among other defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gloor et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">van der Heijden et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kaplan et al., 1994</xref>).</p><p>In light of these recent observations along with our findings, we propose that prostaglandin signaling, likely through PGE<sub>2</sub>, has critical roles in nephrogenesis, which warrant further investigation. However, there are significant challenges of studying nephron formation in mammalian models due to their <italic>in utero</italic> development, and while metanephric organ culture has been informative for branding morphogenesis studies, it is not conducive to studying nephrogenesis. Therefore, the zebrafish pronephric model provides an alternative for continued genetic dissection of the cellular and molecular effects in nephron development due to alterations in prostaglandin levels. Based on the requirement for PGE<sub>2</sub> during pronephros development, it will be interesting to explore its effects on renal progenitors in other stages of zebrafish kidney ontogeny, and during new nephron formation and epithelial regeneration events in adults as well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">McCampbell et al., 2015</xref>).

In addition, prostaglandins have been shown to initiate transcription through either interacting with cognate Ptger (EP) receptors or alternatively, passing through the cell membrane and binding with peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Guan and Breyer, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Berger and Moller, 2002</xref>). Interestingly, PPARs can heterodimerize with Retinoid X Receptors (RXRs), a nuclear receptor for RA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Guan and Breyer, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Berger and Moller, 2002</xref>). Also, it has been shown that different prostaglandins can interact interchangeably, at the right concentration, with the various Ptger receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Tootle, 2013</xref>). This might explain why different prostaglandins could induce an expansion of the PST.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Understanding the broader roles of PGE<sub>2</sub> signaling in development</title><p>Prostaglandins have only just started to become recognized as important factors and determinants of cell fate decisions and growth during development. These new roles for prostaglandins have been revealed in part through a study showing that PGE<sub>2</sub> activity has a conserved function to expand the domain of HSCs in development and enhance their ability to home to the bone marrow in transplants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">North et al., 2007</xref>). PGE<sub>2</sub> is currently in phase two clinical trials for increasing the efficiency of bone marrow transplants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hagedorn et al., 2014</xref>). Furthermore, PGE<sub>2</sub> was shown to be a regulator of bipotential endoderm cell fate decisions in development for zebrafish and mouse endodermal cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Nissim et al., 2014</xref>). Curiously, it was also shown that PGE<sub>2</sub> activity later in organ formation induced proliferation of both the liver and pancreas buds. This change in the function of PGE<sub>2</sub> is explained by the spatial and temporal expression of <italic>ptger2a</italic> and <italic>ptger4a,</italic> where blocking <italic>ptger2a</italic> promoted liver versus pancreas specification and blocking <italic>ptger4a</italic> promoted the outgrowth of the liver and pancreas buds. These cornerstone studies, along with the present report, give credence to the notion that PGE<sub>2</sub> is a key regulator of progenitor populations during embryogenesis and set the stage for further inquiry into how prostaglandin signaling affects developing cell populations. As more knowledge comes to light about how PGE<sub>2</sub> and other prostaglandins influence ontogeny, they are likely to become an increasingly intriguing option for clinical therapeutic applications.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Zebrafish husbandry</title><p>Zebrafish were cared for and maintained in the Center for Zebrafish Research at the University of Notre Dame using experiments approved under protocol 16–025.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor (Tanya Whitfield) and Sean Morrison as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Dirk Meyer (Reviewer #1); Lilianna Solnica-Krezel (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This is an interesting study on that addresses the factors that influence cell fate decisions in the developing vertebrate kidney, using the embryonic zebrafish pronephros as a model system. The authors have used a chemical genetic approach to identify prostaglandins as mediators that influence cell fate choice during development of the proximal and distal nephron segments. Results from the pharmacological screen have been validated through the use of morpholino-based gene knockdown to inhibit prostaglandin synthesis. The authors propose that the prostaglandin pathway acts upstream of the previously-identified transcriptional regulators Irx3b and Sim1a in the developing pronephros. The reviewers and editors agreed that the work was interesting and potentially significant. However, they also had some concerns that should be addressed to strengthen the manuscript, as outlined below.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Title: as suggested by reviewer 1, please change the word 'vertebrate' to 'zebrafish'. (Please note, however, that it is not essential to extend the work to other vertebrate species or different stages of kidney development.)</p><p>2) Given the known interactions between prostaglandin and other pathways such as Wnt signalling, there are concerns over the relevance of the phenotypes resulting from long-term treatment (4-22 hpf) with PG agonists for a nephron-specific patterning role of prostaglandins. These concerns are exacerbated by the rather mild nephric phenotypes described for prostaglandin pathway morphants. The option of indirect phenotypes therefore needs further discussion. In addition, experiments with later onset of agonist treatment are also required to exclude interference with general early embryonic patterning, for example by Wnt signalling. See comments from reviewer 1.</p><p>3) Following discussion between the reviewers, it was felt that a full analysis of any connection with Wnt signalling was not essential, but might be an interesting extension of the work in the future.</p><p>4) Measurements. There were concerns over the measurements and quantitation of the data, in particular, in the way that the extent of expression domains was measured (by a horizontal bar in terms of somite length, vs the actual length of the curved domain of gene expression shown). It was felt that more accurate measurements should be provided. In addition, n numbers should always accompany percentage values, wherever shown.</p><p>5) Effects on surrounding tissues. Please provide some assessment of the extent to which surrounding tissues are affected by the treatments shown.</p><p>6) The text needs tightening up in places, especially with reference to the distinction between PGs in general and PGE2 (see comments from reviewer 2).</p><p>7) For the experiments using morpholinos, it is important that these were done as rigorously as possible. Further supporting evidence is needed here (see comments from reviewer 3).</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>In their manuscript Poureetezadi et al. use the zebrafish pronephros as a model to study functions of the prostaglandin pathway on nephron formation and patterning. Prostaglandins and in particular PGE2 have well documented functions in postnatal mammalian kidney development and renal physiology. In contrast, very little is known about activities in early kidney formation, mainly as genetic studies in mouse provided no major evidence for such requirements. In a screen for small compounds affecting zebrafish pronephron formation Poureetezadi et al. identified several prostaglandin agonists as agents causing caudally shifted or expanded tubule segments upon treatment of embryos between 4-24hpf. Detailed pharmacological analyses confirmed dose-dependent activities of PGE2 and the PGE2-derived PGB2 in tubule segmentation, and provided hints for a requirement of prostaglandin synthesizing enzymes COX1/2 and the PGE2 receptors Ptger2a/4a in the precise positioning of caudal segments. The pharmacological loss-of-function data were further confirmed by knockdown studies using morpholinos that supposedly prevent expression of COX1/2 and Ptger2a/4a proteins. Further, the authors show that nephric phenotypes seen after early embryonic interference with prostaglandin signaling correlate with changed expression of key transcriptional regulators of tubule segmentation and they provided evidence for a genetic role of prostaglandin signaling upstream of these factors. This interesting work is the first one demonstrating prostaglandin activities in nephric tubule patterning.</p><p>Unfortunately, the authors had addressed neither the underlying molecular mechanism nor the relevance for other vertebrate model systems or the metanephric kidney.</p><p>As pointed out by the authors, prostaglandins only recently became recognized as developmentally import fate determinants. In this context interference with canonical wnt-signaling had been identified as one of the most critical prostaglandin activities. Considering the importance of Wnt-signaling in kidney formation and patterning it is surprising that this connection had not been further analyzed.</p><p>The word 'vertebrate' in the title is not justified as the zebrafish is the only vertebrate that had been analyzed. Slattery et al. (2016) recently suggested a role of COX2 not only in postnatal but also in embryonic metanephric kidney development. While these mouse data support a possibly conserved requirement for prostaglandins, it should be noted that the phenotypic analyses of COX2 mutants was restricted to the glomerulus and no tubule data were provided.</p><p>The authors suggest a direct connection between the proposed nephron specific expression of ptger2a/4a (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>—figure supplement.4) and the nephric loss and gain of function phenotypes. Expression of prostaglandin pathways components is not well documented and the experimental settings leave space for various alternative explanations. The images shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>—figure supplement.4 suggest a restricted expression of ptger2a/4a in proximal tubule of 12-24ss embryos. In case of a direct function, pharmacological treatments starting at 12ss rather than at 4hpf should be sufficient to induce relevant gain and loss of function phenotypes. Additional data should be provided to confirm nephron specificity and to give details on the posterior-anterior extent of ptger2a/4a expression (for example sections and co-stains with nephric markers). Further, studies should be performed to determine the critical time-window of prostaglandin responsiveness.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>In the manuscript entitled &quot;Prostaglandin signaling regulates nephron segment patterning of renal progenitors during vertebrate kidney development&quot; by Poureetezadi et al., stemming from a chemical screening approach, the authors uncover a role for prostaglandin activity which impacts distal vs. proximal segment development of the pronephric tubules in the kidney. Specifically they found that exposure to prostaglandin agonists expanded the proximal segment (slc20a1a+) lineage and inhibited distal fate (slc12a1a+). In contrast inhibition of PG synthesis altered the distribution of specific distal fates. The authors also identified downstream consequences on key segment associated genes (irx3b and sim1a) that appeared to be influenced, directly or indirectly by PG modulation. The data presented throughout the paper strongly support the authors claims, however, descriptions of prostaglandin synthesis and signaling cascades are over-simplified, and general claims are made for &quot;prostaglandins&quot; when only PGE2-specific components are thoroughly investigated. As several types of prostaglandins were isolated in the screen, which can act in methods different from that investigated here (thromboxane receptor and PPARg), more precise language and a rationale for selecting PGE2 (not hit in the screen) would aid the reader. Similarly, while the data is nicely presented and logically organized to support the authors conclusions, the paper would benefit from addition of quantitative evaluations to aid appreciation by those outside of the field.</p><p>1) The authors over-simplify prostaglandin synthesis and signaling pathways, applying terminology and biological function relevant to PGE2 under the broad headline of &quot;prostaglandins&quot;. This occurs as early as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, where they identify PGD2, PGA2, PGB2, and PGJ2 in the screen, which are known to stimulate thromboxane receptors (PGA2, B2) and PPARg (PGJ2), yet follow PGE2 (not a hit) and its relevant machinery. Similarly, Ptges is the enzyme for prostaglandin E2 synthesis (hence the &quot;e&quot; in its name, not general secondary processing), and Ptgers are the receptors for PGE2, not all of the PGs. While PTGS inhibition (Cox enzymes), could indeed broadly impact PG synthesis, the rest is quite specific to PGE2 and should not be generalized in the text, particularly when the screen hit several other potential modifiers as relevant to kidney biogenesis. This is not to say the data for PGE2 modification is wrong, it is just over generalized to &quot;prostaglandins&quot; and as such could cause issues for future investigations.</p><p>2) Given the independent signaling cascades associated with PGB2 and PGE2, it is surprising that exposure to both enzymes elicited the same biological effect. While receptor modulation is examined for 2 of the 4 PGE2 receptors, similar studies should be done in the context of exogenous PGE2 and PGB2 addition, as well as with the thromboxane receptors to confirm that addition of exogenous levels of each prostanoid doesn't cause errant signaling.</p><p>3) The doses utilized for dmPGE2 and Indomethacin are substantially higher than that found in other zebrafish or mouse papers, and well above physiological concentrations in humans. While the embryos appear grossly normal in whole mount images, it is important to document that alterations in kidney associated expression patterns are not simply due to gross morphological development issues or off target effects. Assessment of vascular markers by in situ or with a reporter line (Grosser et al) should be a quick way to test toxicity; receptor blocking analysis should confirm specificity.</p><p>4) While the overall conclusions seem well supported by the data shown, to make the paper more accessible to a general audience, the authors should use a more precise way to quantify the alterations in expression observed, or at least confirm the relevant ones, using ImageJ and/or a reporter line. The assays are currently very observational (with straight bars correlated with expression drawn on curvy embryos) and it is unclear how definitive statements like &quot;50% reduction&quot; are made when no quantification is shown.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>Starting with a chemical screen in developing zebrafish embryos, the Wingert and collaborators, identify components of prostaglandin signaling pathway as regulators of proximo-distal patterning of developing kidney. Using treatments with the pathway agonists (dmPGE2, PGB2) or inhibitors, and antisense morpholino oligonucleotides to impair expression of the PG synthetizing enzymes and their receptors (Ptger2a, Ptger4a), the authors provide evidence that prostaglandin signaling limits distal segment formation while promoting the proximal pronephric fates, acting upstream of Irx3b and Sim1a transcription factors, which have been previously implicated in this process. This is a very interesting work that expands our appreciation of the roles of prostaglandin signaling in cell fate specification during vertebrate embryogenesis. These roles were difficult to discern in the murine model, but recent studies in mouse and human point to PG involvement in kidney development and function. The authors leverage the experimental strengths of the zebrafish model, in which prostaglandin signaling can be easily manipulated during kidney development and the resulting effects can be monitored.</p><p>Whereas the proposed conclusions are significant and would be of interest to the developmental biology and renal research communities, they are not sufficiently supported by the presented data. Addressing the following questions and concerns would significantly strengthen the manuscript and make it suitable for publication.</p><p>One of the major concerns about the current manuscript is that there are many quantifications presented but without sufficient experimental detail to evaluate their statistical or biological significance. For several experiments (e.g. treatment of antagonists), there is insufficient experimental detail to evaluate the results and their interpretation. The quantifications of the phenotypes (reduction or expansion) of segments in various experimental regimens is given throughout the manuscript as% of embryos with altered expression (expanded or reduced). This shows that the fraction of affected embryos increases in a dose dependent manner but does not address whether the expressivity (degree of reduction or expansion) of the phenotype is also dose dependent. This is important given the overall conclusion that prostaglandins regulate segment patterning.</p><p>Were the measurements carried in a blinded fashion?</p><p>The number of embryos in individual experiments showing% of phenotype should be provided.</p><p>For Indomethacin treated embryos, the authors conclude that they &quot;developed a 50% larger DE segment domain and a 20% smaller DL segment domain&quot; referring to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> and its supplement. It is not clear where the data are presented on which this conclusion has been reached given that <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> shows fractions of affected embryos and not dimensions of pronephric segments in control and treated embryos. Such conclusions need to be supported by clearly presented morphometric data, with the method of measurement clearly described, as well as the numbers of analyzed embryos.</p><p>The authors conclude that the changes in the dimensions of the pronephros proximo-distal segments represent the specific effects of prostaglandin signaling. However, the possibility of broader effects of prostaglandin signaling on embryonic dimensions and thus indirectly on pronephros is not sufficiently addressed. In the Methods the authors state &quot;Gene domains were measured with respect to somite boundaries to assess pattern formation&quot;. However, the somitic staining that should provide such a reference is not clear in most of the figures. Given that earlier reports implicated prostaglandin signaling in morphogenetic movements of gastrulation (Gasser et al., PNAS, 2002; Cha et al., Genes &amp; Dev, 2006; Speirs et al., Development, 2011), this needs to be carefully analyzed. Anteroposterior dimensions of the treated embryos should be measured as well as the relative size of pronephric segments to the neighboring somites for a reviewer/reader to evaluate.</p><p>In experiments in which PG signaling was inhibited with various agents, it is not clear at what developmental stages was this done? Given the previous work implicating PG signaling in gastrulation movements the timing of the treatment is important. It would be also of interest to identify when during embryogenesis PG signaling is required for segment patterning and when it can affect it.</p><p>Injection into 1 cell stage embryos of translation and splicing morpholinos targeting ptgs1 (cox1) and ptgs2a (cox2) enzymes is reported to affect pronephros patterning. However, it has been previously reported that ptgs1 morpholino injections caused severe epiboly defects (Gasser et al., 2002). In this work the morpholino experiments are insufficiently described. There is no information on the dosage of morpholinos per embryos (only stock concentration is given in methods), no dose response, no experiments describing the degree of loss of function. Yet, the authors conclude &quot;these data indicate that endogenous levels of prostaglandins are critical for specification of the DE and DL segments&quot;. This conclusion is given before dmPGE2 rescue experiments are described.</p><p>Similar lack of detail and controls is a concern for the experiments in which two genes encoding the prostaglandin receptors, ptger2a and ptger4a are targeted using morpholinos. There are no data on the effectiveness of these reagents to downregulate expression of these genes and encoded proteins, or to lower the levels of prostaglandins. Since in recent years, significant concerns have been raised about the specificity of morpholinos (e.g. Kok et al., Dev Cell, 2015), the sparse details and controls for the experiments presented raise concerns.</p><p>In epistasis experiments presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A, B</xref> it would be important to see the effect of SC-580 alone.

These concerns are exacerbated by the rather mild nephric phenotypes described for prostaglandin pathway morphants. The option of indirect phenotypes therefore needs further discussion. In addition, experiments with later onset of agonist treatment are also required to exclude interference with general early embryonic patterning, for example by Wnt signalling. See comments from reviewer 1.</italic> </p><p>We performed additional studies to address the time window when changes in PG levels affect nephron segment development. First, we treated embryos with either the antagonist indomethacin or agonist dmPGE<sub>2</sub> starting at 12 ss with exposure lasting through to the 24 hpf time point. This indomethacin treatment elicited an expansion of the DE domain and reduction of the DL similar to that seen after the treatment lasting from 4 hpf to 24 hpf (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). dmPGE<sub>2</sub> treatment between 12 ss and 24 hpf induced an expansion of the PST and a DL reduction similar to the long dmPGE<sub>2</sub> exposure time (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). To quantify and further analyze these changes, we determined the absolute segment lengths and found the phenotypes following each PG alteration to be significant compared to controls, while the segment changes were indistinguishable from the corresponding drug exposure over the longer interval (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). Further, we found that treatment with Ptger2 antagonists from the 12 ss to 24 hpf was also sufficient to induce a statistically significant DE expansion and DL reduction (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>), similar to the 4-24 hpf exposure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s6">Figure 4—figure supplement 6</xref>; new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s9">Figure 4—figure supplement 9</xref>).</p><p><italic>3) Following discussion between the reviewers, it was felt that a full analysis of any connection with Wnt signalling was not essential, but might be an interesting extension of the work in the future.</italic> </p><p>We have not pursued the connection to Wnt signaling in the current revision but agree that it will be an interesting extension for our future research.</p><p><italic>4) Measurements. There were concerns over the measurements and quantitation of the data, in particular, in the way that the extent of expression domains was measured (by a horizontal bar in terms of somite length, vs the actual length of the curved domain of gene expression shown). It was felt that more accurate measurements should be provided. In addition, n numbers should always accompany percentage values, wherever shown.</italic> </p><p>We now provide absolute length measurements for all nephron segment phenotypes (Please see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2E, F</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B, C</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1E, F</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s9">Figure 4—figure supplement 9</xref>).

Blood flow in these drug treated embryos was equivalent to wild-type control embryos through the 48-55 hpf stage, and we did not observe compromised vessel integrity or hematomas (e.g. bleeding, blood pooling) with o-dianisidine staining (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4C</xref>).</p><p><italic>6) The text needs tightening up in places, especially with reference to the distinction between PGs in general and PGE2 (see comments from reviewer 2).</italic> </p><p>We have revised the manuscript extensively to address this weakness and to be more specific throughout.</p><p><italic>7) For the experiments using morpholinos, it is important that these were done as rigorously as possible.

To address this, we treated embryos with dmPgE2, indomethacin, and 1% DMSO between the 12 ss to 24 hpf. In all cases, we observed that these treatments phenocopied their corresponding treatments from 4 hpf to 24 hpf (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Additionally, we treated embryos with the ptger2a antagonists (AH6809 and PF04418948) from the 12ss to 24hpf and saw a similar increase of the DE and decrease of the DL as seen in treatments from 4hpf to 24hpf (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p><italic>Injection into 1 cell stage embryos of translation and splicing morpholinos targeting ptgs1 (cox1) and ptgs2a (cox2) enzymes is reported to affect pronephros patterning. However, it has been previously reported that ptgs1 morpholino injections caused severe epiboly defects (Gasser et al., 2002). In this work the morpholino experiments are insufficiently described. There is no information on the dosage of morpholinos per embryos (only stock concentration is given in methods), no dose response, no experiments describing the degree of loss of function. Yet, the authors conclude &quot;these data indicate that endogenous levels of prostaglandins are critical for specification of the DE and DL segments&quot;. This conclusion is given before dmPGE2 rescue experiments are described.</italic> </p><p><italic>Similar lack of detail and controls is a concern for the experiments in which two genes encoding the prostaglandin receptors, ptger2a and ptger4a are targeted using morpholinos. There are no data on the effectiveness of these reagents to downregulate expression of these genes and encoded proteins, or to lower the levels of prostaglandins. Since in recent years, significant concerns have been raised about the specificity of morpholinos (e.g. Kok et al., Dev Cell, 2015), the sparse details and controls for the experiments presented raise concerns.</italic> </p><p>We have modified our Methods and figures/figure legends to more clearly describe our morpholino related experiments. While most of morpholinos described in the present work have been used in a number of other published studies (Grosser et al., 2002, Cha et al., 2006, North et al., 2008, Nissim et al., 2014), we do recognize the need for morpholino work to be verified. Indeed, part of our rationale for extensive parallel studies with chemical genetics and use of multiple knockdown reagents was to study these factors with independent tools. Unfortunately, we are unable at the present time to assess the consequential protein levels of the genes targeted by morpholinos that interact with 5’UTR or translational start site due to the lack of appropriate specific antibodies. However, in the revision, we provide a thorough transcriptional analysis to document the effects of splice morpholinos used for knockdown of <italic>ptgs1, ptgs2a, ptger2a,</italic> and <italic>ptger4a</italic> using RT-PCR (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s10">Figure 4—figure supplement 10</xref>). In all cases, we were able to confirm that incorrect splicing occurred as a product of each splice morpholino or combination (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s10">Figure 4—figure supplement 10</xref>). In fact, for each gene, we found that the morpholino microinjection eliminated the presence of wild-type transcripts. In the case of <italic>ptger2a</italic> and <italic>ptger4a</italic>, we needed to obtained splice targeting morpholinos and we have validated their phenotypic effects on the pronephros (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s10">Figure 4—figure supplement 10, E, F</xref>).</p><p><italic>In epistasis experiments presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A, B</xref> it would be important to see the effect of SC-580 alone.</italic> </p><p>We provide data on the effect of the selective Cox1 inhibitor in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, with the absolute segment length changes documented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s9">Figure 4—figure supplement 9</xref>. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref> we provide a representative image to remind readers of the DE phenotype from exposure to this compound.</p><p><italic>From the perspective of the model of PG – irx3b pathway proposed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>, the effect of dmPGE2 treatment that affect PST and DL but do not affect DE are confusing.</italic> </p><p>The working models depict the effects of PGE<sub>2</sub> on segment size, where (A) PGE<sub>2</sub> biosynthesis is required to restrict the DE by inhibiting the domain of <italic>irx3b</italic> expression and to promote the DL, and (B) PGE<sub>2</sub> applied exogenous is capable of positively modulating the size PST segment by promoting <italic>sim1a</italic> expression, and meanwhile inhibiting the DL. In the case of (B), the DE segment develops at a normal size but the position is altered along the anterior-posterior axis, likely due to the PST expansion and the shifted domain of <italic>irx3b</italic> expression, and thus we thought that drawing an arrow between PGE<sub>2</sub> and the DE in this case would be misleading compared to the other arrows and phenotypes because the DE segment size in this case is normal. We edited the figure legend to remind readers that we correlated a change in the <italic>irx3b</italic> domain to the shift in the DE location, and that changes in the <italic>mecom</italic> expression domain correlate with the DL reduction in both (A) and (B).</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p><italic>[…] The manuscript has been substantially improved and all reviewers' comments have been addressed well. The additional experimental data help to strengthen and support the findings, and the writing is now clear and precise. Overall, this is a very interesting study and should be of wide interest.</italic> </p><p><italic>One concern remains: the quantification has been improved but there was very little information about the statistical tests used for analysis of the data. t-tests are mentioned in the Materials and methods section, but these will not be suitable for analysis of some of the datasets, where there are multiple conditions and comparisons. Here, a test such as ANOVA, with appropriate post-test correction for multiple samples, would be preferred. Alternatively, the authors should clarify and justify the tests they have used. The tests that are used should be stated in each of the figure legends where appropriate, in addition to the statement in the Materials and methods.</italic> </p><p>We have revised the Materials and methods as requested, and we have edited each figure legend to state which statistical analysis was used.</p><p>With regard to our statistical tests: In many figures, we utilized unpaired t-tests to compare nephron segment lengths between two samples. However, in cases of 3 or more samples, we now report the outcome of ANOVA tests rather than t-tests, as ANOVA is preferred for comparisons across multiple samples. We have now revised the following figures with ANOVA results: <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3A, B</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s8">Figure 4—figure supplement 8C</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s10">Figure 4—figure supplement 10F</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B, C</xref>; and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>. These revisions provide a more appropriate statistical analysis for numerous aspects of the work.</p><p>In contrast, however, in the graphs reporting the percentage phenotype following drug or morpholino treatments, we focused on the key comparison of each individual phenotype to the corresponding wild-type control. For this, we utilized unpaired t-tests, and have revised the figure legends to clearly indicate our analysis. While it might be interesting to look across groups in some cases, our primary goal of these statistical analyses was to determine whether PGE<sub>2</sub> treatment or alterations of endogenous prostaglandin biosynthesis significantly altered nephron segments compared to wild-type control embryos, as opposed to delving into the cross-treatment comparisons.</p></body></sub-article></article>
