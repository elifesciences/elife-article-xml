Here, we study the relatively unexplored <italic>epigenetic</italic> impacts of TEs and provide the first genome-wide quantification of such effects in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> and <italic>D. simulans</italic>. Surprisingly, the spread of repressive epigenetic marks (histone H3K9me2) to nearby DNA occurs at &gt;50% of euchromatic TEs, and can extend up to 20 kb. This results in differential epigenetic states of genic alleles and, in turn, selection against TEs. Interestingly, the lower TE content in <italic>D. simulans</italic> compared to <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> correlates with stronger epigenetic effects of TEs and higher levels of host genetic factors known to promote epigenetic silencing. Our study demonstrates that the epigenetic effects of euchromatic TEs, and host genetic factors modulating such effects, play a critical role in the evolution of TEs both within and between species.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.25762.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.25762.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.25762.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>The DNA inside an organism encodes all the instructions needed for the organism to develop and work properly. Organisms carefully organize and maintain their DNA (collectively known as the genome) so that the genetic information remains intact and the cell can understand the instructions. However, there are some pieces of DNA that are capable of moving around the genome. For example, pieces known as transposable elements can make new copies of themselves and jump into new locations in the genome. Most transposons do not appear to have any important roles, and in fact they are usually harmful to organisms. Despite this, transposons are present in the genomes of almost all species. The number of transposons in a genome varies greatly between individuals and species, but it is not clear why this is the case.</p><p>Organisms have evolved ways to limit the damage caused by transposons. For example, many cells package regions of DNA containing transposons into a tightly packed structure known as heterochromatin. However, this type of DNA packaging sometimes spreads to neighboring sections of DNA. This is a problem because cells are not usually able to read the information contained within heterochromatin. This means that transposons can prevent some instructions from being produced when they should be. Lee and Karpen used fruit flies to investigate to what extent transposons harm organisms by changing the way DNA is packaged, and whether this influences how transposons evolve.</p><p>The experiments show that that more than half of the transposons in fruit flies cause neighboring sections of DNA to be packaged into heterochromatin. This can negatively impact up to 20% of genes in the genome. As a result, transposons that have harmful effects on DNA packaging are more likely to be lost from the fly population during evolution than transposons that do not have harmful effects. Fruit fly species containing transposons that tend to package more neighboring sections of DNA into heterochromatin generally have fewer transposons than genomes containing less harmful transposons.</p><p>The findings of Lee and Karpen provide new insight as to why the numbers of transposons vary among organisms. The next challenge is to find out whether transposons that alter how DNA is packaged are also common in primates and other animals.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.25762.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.25762.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>Transposable elements</kwd><kwd>Epigenetics</kwd><kwd>Population genetics</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 GM117420</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Karpen</surname><given-names>Gary H</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The ability of transposable elements to epigenetically influence adjacent genes impacts genome evolution by driving substantial variation in transposon numbers between species.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Transposable elements (TEs) are genetic elements that can copy and transpose themselves into new genomic locations. Even though there are incidental reports of potentially adaptive TEs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Daborn et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib125">Schlenke and Begun, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Aminetzach et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">González et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib126">Schmidt et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Mateo et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib142">Hof et al., 2016</xref>), they generally lower host fitness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Mackay, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib115">Pasyukova et al., 2004</xref>) and are widely recognized as ‘genomic parasites’. Despite the deleterious fitness consequences of TEs, they comprise appreciable and highly variable proportions of euchromatic genomes in all eukaryotes surveyed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Biémont, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Elliott and Gregory, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Chalopin et al., 2015</xref>). However, fundamental questions remain about the mechanisms that restrict the selfish increases in TE copy number and contribute to the wide variation of TEs within and between species.</p><p>Theoretical analyses predict that, in an outbreeding and meiotically recombining host population, copy number of TEs can be contained (i.e. reach an equilibrium) if the increase in copy number through transposition is counterbalanced by the removal of TEs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Charlesworth and Charlesworth, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Langley et al., 1983</xref>). One possible mechanism for the containment of TEs is to regulate the transposition rate to equal the removal rate. Small RNAs in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, mammals, and plants are enriched for TE sequences and regulate the transposition of TEs in host germlines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Girard et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Gunawardane et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Brennecke et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Aravin et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib138">Slotkin et al., 2009</xref>). These small RNAs guide the Ago and/or Piwi subfamilies of Argonaute proteins (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Hutvagner and Simard, 2008</xref>]) to TE transcripts with complementary sequences, resulting in post-transcriptional silencing (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Klattenhoff and Theurkauf, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Girard and Hannon, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib129">Senti and Brennecke, 2010</xref>]). In addition, TEs can be transcriptionally silenced through small-RNA guided enrichment of repressive epigenetic marks, which include DNA modifications (such as methylation) and post-translational histone modifications (such as di- and tri-methylation of H3 lysine 9 (H3K9me2/3), [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Klenov et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Aravin et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib133">Sienski et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Le Thomas et al., 2013</xref>]). Both post-transcriptional and transcriptional silencing mechanisms reduce the RNA and protein output from TEs, and accordingly lower TE transposition rate. However, despite the presence of small-RNA regulation, measured transposition rates of TEs are significantly higher than excision rates (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Charlesworth and Langley, 1989</xref>]). Furthermore, euchromatic TE insertions in multiple outbreeding species have low population frequencies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Charlesworth and Langley, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Dolgin et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Lockton et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">González et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Lockton and Gaut, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Cridland et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Kofler et al., 2015</xref>), and a reduction in transposition rate alone is unlikely to explain such observations.</p><p>Alternatively, selection against the deleterious effects of TEs has been theoretically proposed and empirically supported as a major force that removes TE insertions from host populations and shapes the population dynamics of TEs (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Charlesworth and Langley, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Lee and Langley 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Barrón et al., 2014</xref>]). It is well-established that TEs can be deleterious through their <italic>genetic</italic> effects, such as inserting into and disrupting genes and other functional elements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Cooley et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Finnegan, 1992</xref>), acting as ectopic regulatory elements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Feschotte, 2008</xref>), and mediating ectopic recombination that results in detrimental chromosomal rearrangements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Langley et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">Montgomery et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib117">Petrov et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Mieczkowski et al., 2006</xref>). On the other hand, TE insertions can also influence the epigenetic states of adjacent functional sequences, interfering with gene regulation (‘epigenetic effects’; reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib137">Slotkin and Martienssen, 2007</xref>]). A genome-wide study in <italic>A. thaliana</italic> first established the associations between DNA methylation of TEs and lower transcript levels of adjacent genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Hollister and Gaut, 2009</xref>). Later studies identified TEs as a major cause for DNA methylation-enriched regions in the <italic>A. thaliana</italic> genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ahmed et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib127">Schmitz et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Dubin et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib120">Quadrana et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Kawakatsu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib139">Stuart et al., 2016</xref>), and several demonstrated that this association results from spreading of DNA methylation from epigenetically silenced TEs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ahmed et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib120">Quadrana et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib139">Stuart et al., 2016</xref>). Associations between TEs and enrichment of repressive epigenetic marks were also documented in mouse cell lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib123">Rebollo et al., 2012</xref>) and maize (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Eichten et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib148">West et al., 2014</xref>). However, only (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Hollister and Gaut, 2009</xref>) explored the influences of these TE-induced enrichment of repressive epigenetic marks on the evolutionary dynamics of TEs.</p><p>In <italic>Drosophila,</italic> TE-induced enrichment of repressive epigenetic marks at functional elements in euchromatin was first solidly supported by comparing the epigenetic states of reporter genes in constructs with and without adjacent TEs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib130">Sentmanat and Elgin, 2012</xref>). The same study also found that epigenetic effects of TEs depend on small-RNA targeting, and thus on host-directed transcriptional silencing of TEs. This spreading of repressive epigenetic marks from epigenetically silenced euchromatic TEs is reminiscent of the well-studied position-effect variegation (PEV), in which repressive epigenetic marks from pericentromeric or subtelomeric heterochromatin spread to juxtaposed euchromatic genes and cause stochastic gene silencing ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Gowen and Gay, 1934</xref>], reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Girton and Johansen, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Elgin and Reuter, 2013</xref>]). The extent of PEV is influenced by several genetic factors, including the amount of heterochromatic DNA in a genome (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Girton and Johansen, 2008</xref>]) and heterochromatic enzymatic and structural proteins whose hypomorphic or null mutations enhance or suppress PEV (known as E(var)s and Su(var)s respectively, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Elgin and Reuter, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib140">Swenson et al., 2016</xref>]). Likewise, the epigenetic effects of TEs on an adjacent reporter genes were observed to be contingent on the expression of two <italic>Su(var)</italic> genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib130">Sentmanat and Elgin, 2012</xref>).</p><p>Previously, we used <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> modEncode epigenomic data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib112">Nègre et al., 2011</xref>) and demonstrated that histone H3K9me3, a key repressive epigenetic mark, is enriched around euchromatic TEs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Lee 2015</xref>). Importantly, TEs adjacent to <italic>genes</italic> that are highly enriched with H3K9me3 are more strongly selected against, supporting an important role for TE’s epigenetic effects in its own population dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Hollister and Gaut, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Lee and Langley 2010</xref>). Yet, several critical questions remain. For example, our previous study was based on the reference <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> strain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adams et al., 2000</xref>), which has been maintained as a laboratory stock for many years, and is unlikely to be representative of natural populations. More importantly, single-strain analysis precluded distinguishing whether the enrichment of H3K9me3 at genes was due to TE-induced enrichment of repressive epigenetic marks, or the preferential insertions of TEs into genomic regions already enriched in repressive marks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Lee 2015</xref>).</p><p>To test the hypothesis that euchromatic TE insertions nucleate repressive epigenetic marks, here we exploit natural variation in the presence/absence of individual TE insertions in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> populations. In this species, euchromatic insertions from most TE families segregate at low population frequencies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Charlesworth and Langley, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Kofler et al., 2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Cridland et al., 2013</xref>). Accordingly, randomly selected, unrelated individuals usually share few TE insertions. This will provide a direct comparison of epigenetic states at homologous sequences with and without the presence of TEs, and allow distinguishing the causal relationship between the presence of TEs and the enrichment of repressive epigenetic marks. Importantly, TEs only comprise 5.4% of the <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> euchromatic genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Hoskins et al., 2015</xref>), and the epigenetic effects of <italic>individual</italic> TE insertions can thus be determined.</p><p>In this study, analyses of the epigenomes of two recently established, wild-derived, inbred <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> strains showed that euchromatic TEs are responsible for the enrichment of repressive epigenetic marks in flanking regions. Further, analysis of individual insertions revealed that more than half of euchromatic TEs are associated with epigenetic effects on flanking sequences, demonstrating their pervasive impact on the <italic>Drosophila</italic> genome. Importantly, we found evidence supporting stronger selection against TE insertions with more extensive epigenetic effects. Comparisons between the closely related <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> and <italic>D. simulans</italic> revealed that the epigenetic effects of TEs also vary between species, and correlate with variation in host genetic factors that regulate epigenetic silencing. Our results support that the epigenetic effects of euchromatic TEs, and host genetic factors that modulate these effects, play an important role in the population dynamics of TEs within and between species.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Euchromatic TEs exhibit extensive epigenetic effects on adjacent sequences</title><p>In <italic>Drosophila,</italic> repressive histone modifications H3K9me2/3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Kouzarides, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Grewal and Elgin, 2007</xref>) and their cognate ‘reader’ protein Heterochromatin Protein 1a (HP1a) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Eissenberg and Elgin, 2014</xref>) play a dominant role in the initiation and maintenance of repressive chromatin states in heterochromatin.

Using modEncode ChIP-seq data generated from the Oregon-R strain, we observed that sequences flanking euchromatic TEs are also enriched for another key heterochromatic histone modification (H3K9me2) and HP1a, while depleted for ‘active’ histone modifications H3K4me2 and H3K4me3, which are enriched at transcribing promoters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Kouzarides, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Kharchenko et al., 2011</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>).

These strains have been fully sequenced and annotated for the locations of euchromatic TE insertions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib122">Rahman et al., 2015</xref>), allowing direct comparison of the epigenetic status of allelic regions with and without TEs. Our ChIP-Seq analyses of H3K9me2 distributions (see Materials and methods) in 4–8 hr RAL315 and RAL360 embryos, which contain fully-formed heterochromatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib153">Yuan and O'Farrell, 2016</xref>), only included TE insertions annotated with high confidence and unique to either strain (see Materials and methods). Importantly, we used highly conservative heterochromatin-euchromatin boundaries (0.5 Mb distal from epigenetically defined boundaries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib124">Riddle et al., 2011</xref>]). This ensures that only euchromatic sequences and TEs were included in the analysis, and prevents confounding effects from pericentromeric or subtelomeric heterochromatin. Because the ChIP-Seq data were generated using whole animals that contain multiple cell types, combined with the stochastic nature of heterochromatic silencing, H3K9me2 enrichment reflects the <italic>average</italic> epigenetic states of all cells in the samples. Accordingly, we analyzed the enrichment of H3K9me2 quantitatively, instead of as binary states (see Materials and methods).</p><p>We compared the epigenetic states of euchromatic sequences around <italic>all</italic> TE insertions present in one strain with those of homologous alleles lacking the TE insertions in the other strain. The presence of TEs correlated with substantially higher H3K9me2 enrichment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), which strongly supports the conclusion that these repressive mark enrichments are due to TE insertions, and not pre-existing epigenetic states.

An immediately obvious pattern is that LTR-type TE families seem to have the strongest epigenetic effects. The LTR <italic>copia</italic> family has the largest proportion of insertions with epigenetic effects, and LTR <italic>roo</italic> insertions display both the most extensive average spread of H3K9me2 and the largest average increase in H3K9me2 enrichment in flanking sequences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>).

The two TE families with &gt;5 kb average spread of H3K9me2 and the four families that yield &gt;50% mean increase in H3K9me2 enrichment are all LTR-type families.

To address this issue, we performed multiple regression analyses that jointly consider the impact of TE’s epigenetic effects and family identity on the population frequencies of TEs (see Materials and methods). Because most TEs in the two DGRP strains analyzed were not detected in the Zambian population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>), we treated the frequency of TE insertions (the number of individuals in which a TE insertion is present in the Zambian population) also as dichotomous variable (‘high frequency’ TE or not, see Materials and methods). Even accounting for the effect of TE family identity, the regression coefficients for TE’s epigenetic effects on population frequencies are still negative for all the regression models analyzed, and are statistically significant for a majority of the models (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>), suggesting that TE family identity is unlikely a major contributor for the negative associations between TE’s epigenetic effects and population frequencies.<table-wrap id="tbl2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.25762.017</object-id><label>Table 2.</label><caption><p>Regression analysis for the associations between TE’s epigenetic effects and population frequencies while accounting for the influence of TE family identity.

As expected, genes with adjacent TEs in either strain have significantly higher, positive z-scores compared to genes distant from TEs in both strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). We further investigated if the differential epigenetic states between homologous alleles depend on TE-induced epigenetic effects, or only on the presence of TEs. For all categories of genes within 10 kb from TEs, z-scores are significantly higher for genes whose neighboring TEs exhibit H3K9me2 spreading (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>).

We predict these TEs should be under stronger purifying selection and have lower population frequencies than other TEs. To test this hypothesis, we further restricted the analysis to genes whose nearest TEs show spreading of H3K9me2. Among these genes, those whose nearest TEs were absent in the Zambian population (‘low frequency’ TEs, see above) have significantly higher z-scores than genes adjacent to ‘high frequency’ TEs (<italic>Mann-Whitney U test, p</italic>=0.0019, median: 0.95 (genes near low frequency TEs) vs 0.32 (genes near high frequency TEs)). The observed differences are most prominent for genes within 1 kb of TEs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). Consistently, there is a significant negative correlation between the z-score of a gene and the population frequency of its nearest TE (<italic>Spearman rank ρ</italic> = −0.18, p&lt;10<sup>−3</sup>).</p><p>A potential functional consequence of H3K9me2 enrichment is reduced transcript levels of influenced alleles. To address this possibility, we performed RNA-seq of developmental stage-matched embryos. Within either strain, there are indeed significant negative correlations between H3K9me2 enrichment and transcript levels for genes within 10 kb of TEs (<italic>Spearman rank ρ =</italic> −0.35 (RAL315) and −0.33 (RAL360), p<italic>&lt;</italic>10<sup>−16</sup> for both). To compare the differential epigenetic states and transcript levels between homologous alleles, we calculated fold changes in expression and z-scores for H3K9me2 enrichment level using RAL 360 allele as reference (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). Note this is different from the z-score used above, which uses the allele without TE as reference. We found an excess number of genes that support the influence of TE’s epigenetic effects on gene expression (higher H3K9me2 enrichment and lower expression of alleles with adjacent TEs, shaded green area in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>) for genes with TEs within 10 kb when compared to other genes in the genome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>, upper 2 × 2 Tables). Restricting the analysis to TEs with epigenetic effects produced an even larger proportion of genes whose TE-neighboring alleles have higher H3K9me2 enrichment and lower expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>, bottom 2 × 2 Tables). Intriguingly, the excess number of genes supporting TE-induced epigenetic effects on expression was mainly observed for one of the two strains analyzed (RAL360). Furthermore, while we found a weak, but significant, negative correlation between z-scores for H3K9me2 enrichment and fold changes in expression for genes without TEs (<italic>Spearman rank ρ</italic> = −0.035, p=0.0084), there are no such correlations observed for genes with TEs within 10 kb (<italic>Spearman rank test</italic> p=0. 57 (RAL315) and 0.16 (RAL360)). In fact, there are multiple genes whose alleles associated with TEs have higher enrichment of H3K9me2, but also higher expression (e.g. arrows in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). These observations suggest that the influence of TE-induced epigenetic states on gene expression may be more complex (see Discussion).<fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.25762.021</object-id><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Differential H3K9me2 enrichment and RNA transcript levels of protein coding genes with and without adjacent TE insertions.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The z-score for H3K9me2 enrichment (X-axis) and log2 expression fold change (Y-axis) were plotted for euchromatic protein coding genes without TEs within 10 kb (‘neither’) and for genes with adjacent TEs in either strain.

Understanding the causes for such variation is critical for evaluating the impacts of various evolutionary forces on the population dynamics of TEs. Selection against the deleterious effects of TEs has been theoretically proposed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Charlesworth and Charlesworth, 1983</xref>) and empirically supported (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Charlesworth and Langley, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Lee and Langley 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Barrón et al., 2014</xref>]) as a dominant force restricting the selfish increase of TEs, and shaping variation of TEs within and between species. Differences in effective population size ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Lynch and Conery, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Lockton et al., 2008</xref>], but see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Charlesworth and Barton, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Groth and Blumenstiel, 2017</xref>]), mating systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Charlesworth and Charlesworth, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib151">Wright and Schoen, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Dolgin et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Agren et al., 2014</xref>), and modes of reproduction (e.g. asexual vs sexual, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Arkhipova and Meselson, 2000</xref>]), were suggested to influence the efficacy of selection against TEs, and thus result in divergence in euchromatic TE content between species. In addition, differential exposure to opportunities for horizontal transfer might also contribute to variation in TE profiles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Clark et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Groth and Blumenstiel, 2017</xref>).</p><p>In this study, we analyzed the <italic>epigenetic</italic> influence of TEs and investigated the role of such effects in the population dynamics of TEs. By comparing the epigenome of two <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> strains with divergent TE insertion positions, we conclude that the enrichment of repressive epigenetic marks around euchromatic TEs is due to the presence of TEs, instead of the preferential insertions of TEs into genomic regions already enriched for repressive epigenetic marks. Surprisingly, quantification of the epigenetic effects of individual TE insertions in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> revealed that more than half of the euchromatic TEs analyzed are associated with at least 1 kb spread of repressive epigenetic marks, with an average spread of 4.5 kb from TEs that display epigenetic effects. In contrast, repressive DNA methylation from epigenetically silenced TEs in <italic>A. thaliana</italic> predominantly spreads only a few hundred base pairs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib120">Quadrana et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib139">Stuart et al., 2016</xref>). Since ~20% of the euchromatic genes are within 5 kb from at least one TE insertion in the reference <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> strain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Kaminker et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib121">Quesneville et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Hoskins et al., 2015</xref>), these estimates suggest that the epigenetic influence of TEs on functional sequences is extensive in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>. Indeed, we observed strong positive associations between the presence of TEs with epigenetic effects and the enrichment of repressive epigenetic marks in adjacent genic alleles, when compared to homologous alleles lacking a neighboring TE insertion. This concurs with observations in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> that TEs contribute significantly to genic DMRs (differential methylated regions) between genomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib127">Schmitz et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib120">Quadrana et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib139">Stuart et al., 2016</xref>). In addition, we found substantial variation in the epigenetic effects among TE families, which could be due to differences in TE types, targeting by piRNAs, and/or the abundance of TE families.</p><p>It was proposed that heterochromatin assembly depends on the concentration of essential heterochromatic enzymatic and structural proteins, whose concentration is highest in heterochromatin and decreases with increasing distance (‘mass action model’, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Locke et al., 1988</xref>]). This model can explain the spread of repressive epigenetic marks from pericentromeric or subtelomeric heterochromatin to juxtaposed euchromatic genes in PEV (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Girton and Johansen, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Elgin and Reuter, 2013</xref>]), and likely the enrichment of repressive epigenetic marks at sequences adjacent to euchromatic TEs. Consistent with predictions of this model, previous (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Lee 2015</xref>) and current analyses both found that H3K9me2/3 enrichment decays with distance from TEs. The enrichment of repressive epigenetic marks could also result from TE-induced formation of de novo piRNA-generating loci that include TE-flanking sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib132">Shpiz et al., 2014</xref>). piRNAs from these piRNA-generating loci would accordingly initiate epigenetic silencing of TE-flanking euchromatic sequences.</p><p>TE-induced reduction in expression of neighboring genes has been demonstrated in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Cridland et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Lee 2015</xref>), and the spreading of repressive epigenetic marks from TEs is a plausible mechanism for such observations. We observed an excess of TE-flanking alleles with higher H3K9me2 enrichment and lower transcript levels than homologous alleles lacking nearby TE insertions. However, there are apparent exceptions to this pattern, such as alleles adjacent to TEs having higher enrichment of H3K9me2 but also higher expression levels than homologous alleles lacking neighboring TEs (e.g. arrows in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). In addition to the epigenetic effects of TEs, <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory sequences contained within TEs could interfere with gene regulation, leading to increased as well as reduced gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib111">Naito et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Batut et al., 2013</xref>). In fact, recent studies that jointly analyzed mobilomes and transcriptomes in <italic>A. thaliana</italic> populations found that TE insertions result in equal frequencies of increased and decreased expression of flanking genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib120">Quadrana et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib139">Stuart et al., 2016</xref>). Besides, SNPs and copy number variants (CNVs) in regulatory sequences are also identified as significant contributors to differential expression between homologous alleles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Massouras et al., 2012</xref>). The observed variation in transcripts level is thus the joint consequence of TE’s epigenetic effects and other genetic factors. Importantly, there are known exceptions to the association between higher enrichment of heterochromatic marks and lower gene expression. In fact, enrichment of repressive epigenetic marks and heterochromatin proteins is surprisingly high for active genes normally located in the pericentromeric heterochromatin, and is required for the proper expression of these genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib147">Wakimoto and Hearn, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Hearn et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib152">Yasuhara and Wakimoto, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib124">Riddle et al., 2011</xref>). For some of these genes, the association with a local heterochromatin environment was even observed for homologs located in euchromatic regions of other <italic>Drosophila</italic> species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Caizzi et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Importantly, our quantifications of the epigenetic effects of TEs and the associated functional consequences on gene expression are likely underestimates of the real effects in natural populations. Screens for genetic mutations repeatedly report an inverse correlation between the dominance of a deleterious allele and its fitness effect (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib135">Simmons and Crow, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib150">Wilkie, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib114">Osada et al., 2009</xref>]). If similar trends apply to the deleterious epigenetic effects of TEs, establishment of the wild-derived inbred <italic>Drosophila</italic> strains used here would have removed the majority of TEs with lethal or sub-lethal epigenetic effects (i.e. substantial functional consequences). The small sample size used here (two strains) precluded detecting the subtle functional consequences of TE-induced epigenetic effects that are expected to be prevalent in inbred strains. Future larger scale epigenomic and transcriptomic profiling of multiple, diverse population samples would be necessary to further investigate the functional consequence of TE’s epigenetic effects. It is also worth noting that not every gene included in the analysis is expressed at the embryonic stage studied (4–8 hr embryo). In fact, we observed a deficiency in the number of genes that both have adjacent TEs and are expressed in 4–8 hr embryos (using data from modEncode (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Graveley et al., 2011</xref>); <italic>Fisher’s Exact Test,</italic> p=0.00017, odds ratio = 0.73). This deficiency is even stronger when only considering TEs with epigenetic effects (<italic>Fisher’s Exact Test,</italic> p&lt;10<sup>−5</sup>, odds ratio = 0.58). Epigenetic marks established at embryonic stages are expected to influence both somatic and germline cells, and were experimentally demonstrated to have a long lasting functional effect through development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Gu and Elgin, 2013</xref>). Accordingly, our observations are consistent with selection preferentially removing TEs that result in spreading of repressive epigenetic marks to adjacent genes expressed in embryonic stages.</p><p>Compared to neutral TE insertions that confer no fitness effects, TEs exerting deleterious fitness effects are more strongly selected against and should appear rare in populations (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Charlesworth and Langley, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Lee and Langley 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Barrón et al., 2014</xref>]). Consistent with the prediction that the epigenetic effects of TEs have deleterious fitness consequences, we found that TE insertions with stronger epigenetic effects have lower population frequencies, demonstrating the importance of such effects in the population dynamics of TEs. In addition, theoretical work suggests that stable equilibrium of TE copy number in an outbreeding, meiotically recombining population requires synergistic epistasis of the deleterious effects of TEs; specifically host fitness must decrease faster than linear with respect to increases in TE copy number (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Charlesworth and Charlesworth, 1983</xref>). However, despite being critical to explaining the population dynamics of TEs, synergistic epistasis has only been empirically supported for deleterious effects mediated by ectopic recombination between nonhomologous TE insertions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Langley et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib117">Petrov et al., 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib118">2011</xref>), one of the many proposed deleterious <italic>genetic</italic> mechanisms for TEs (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Lee and Langley 2010</xref>]). Because piRNAs are generated through feed-forward cycles that involve TE transcripts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Gunawardane et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Brennecke et al., 2007</xref>), we previously predicted that the deleterious epigenetic effects of TEs would confer the theoretically required synergistic epistasis for stable containment of TEs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Lee and Langley 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Lee 2015</xref>). The observed association between the abundance of a TE family and the propensity of its members to influence the epigenetic states of adjacent sequences supports this prediction, and further extends possible evolutionary mechanisms for stable containment of TE copy number in host populations.</p><p>An especially interesting observation is the stronger epigenetic effects of TEs in <italic>D. simulans</italic> compared to <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>. TE insertions in <italic>D. simulans</italic> are more likely to show spreading of H3K9me2 and result in larger increase in H3K9me2 enrichment compared to those of the same TE family in <italic>D. melanogaster.</italic> All else being equal, the stronger epigenetic effects should lead to stronger selection removing TE insertions in <italic>D. simulans.</italic> If the rate of TE proliferation is also similar in these two species, this could account for the lower genomic TE content (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Clark et al., 2007</xref>) and fewer TE insertions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Dowsett and Young, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib146">Vieira et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib145">Vieira and Biémont, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Kofler et al., 2015</xref>) in <italic>D. simulans</italic> compared to <italic>D. melanogaster.</italic> Our observations complement previous comparisons of <italic>A. thaliana</italic> and <italic>A. lyrata</italic>, which revealed negative associations between genomic TE content and the effectiveness of siRNA targeting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Hollister et al., 2011</xref>). Overall, these results strongly support the conclusion that variation in the epigenetic effects of TEs contributes to the divergent TE content observed between even closely related species and significantly impacts TE evolution.</p><p>Finally, we attempted to gain insights into the molecular mechanisms that could account for the between-species differences in the epigenetic effects of TEs. We observed lower amounts of heterochromatic DNA and higher expression of <italic>Su(var)</italic> genes in <italic>D. simulans</italic>, both of which are known to generate more extensive spread of repressive epigenetic marks from constitutive heterochromatin in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>. The amount of heterochromatic DNA was among the first identified dosage-dependent PEV modifiers ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Dimitri and Pisano, 1989</xref>], reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Girton and Johansen, 2008</xref>]). Similarly, <italic>Su(var)</italic> genes were identified through mutants that <italic>suppress</italic> PEV, demonstrating that the wild type genes play positive roles in heterochromatin establishment and/or maintenance (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Girton and Johansen, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Elgin and Reuter, 2013</xref>]). In particular, <italic>Su(var)3–9</italic>, which encodes the H3K9 methyltransferase, displays significantly higher expression in <italic>D. simulans</italic> than in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>, and its between-species difference in expression level ranks in the top 0.75% genome-wide (see Results). H3K9 methylation is critical for suppression of TE expression and transposition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib116">Penke et al., 2016</xref>), and <italic>Su(var)3–9</italic> mutations reduce the epigenetic effects of TEs on adjacent reporter genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib130">Sentmanat and Elgin, 2012</xref>). Furthermore, <italic>Su(var) 3–9</italic> is a haploid suppressor and triploid enhancer of PEV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib128">Schotta et al., 2002</xref>), suggesting that changes in transcript levels of <italic>Su(var)3–9</italic> would result in quantitative differences in the epigenetic effects of TEs. Assuming that the epigenetic effects of TEs depend on the amount of heterochromatic DNA and the expression of <italic>Su(var)</italic> genes in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> and <italic>D. simulans</italic> similarly, variation in these two genetic PEV modifiers provides a viable explanation for the observed differences in the epigenetic effects of TEs and more broadly divergent TE profiles between these two species.</p><p>Our observations support the hypothesis that the host genetic environment contributes to the extent of deleterious epigenetic effects of TEs and influences the population dynamics of TEs, pointing towards a rarely addressed mechanism for the widely observed variation of TEs. Furthermore, PEV is long known to be temperature sensitive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Gowen and Gay, 1933</xref>), and several abiotic factors influence heterochromatin function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib131">Seong et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib134">Silver-Morse and Li, 2013</xref>). Thus, different environmental conditions present in diverse habitats could also contribute to variation in the epigenetic effects of TEs and the widely divergent TE profiles within and between species.</p><p>The observed significant variation in genetic PEV modifiers between <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> and <italic>D. simulans</italic> raises questions about its evolutionary causes. It is worth noting that the deleterious epigenetic effects of TEs are considered as a side effect of host-directed epigenetic silencing of TEs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Hollister and Gaut, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Lee 2015</xref>), and direct positive selection for stronger epigenetic effects of TEs would be unlikely to explain the between-species differences in genetic PEV modifiers. Elevated transcript levels of <italic>Su(var)</italic> genes might have been selected for to silence burst expansions of specific TE families or other types of repetitive sequences. Alternatively, <italic>Su(var)</italic> genes are highly pleiotropic (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Girton and Johansen, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Eissenberg and Reuter, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Elgin and Reuter, 2013</xref>]), and selection might have acted instead on their essential chromosomal functions, with varying influence on the epigenetic consequences of TEs as a secondary effect. Similarly, changes in the amounts of heterochromatic DNA could have resulted from selfish expansion of repetitive sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Charlesworth et al., 1994</xref>) and/or global changes in chromatin landscapes due to karyotype turnover (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Kaiser and Bachtrog, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib144">Vicoso and Bachtrog, 2013</xref>).

When the farthest windows are different between the left and right sides of a TE insertion, we used the window closer to TE for the ‘extent of H3K9me2 spread’ (to be conservative).

The ‘increase in fold enrichment’ is the median relative fold enrichment in the 0–1 kb window immediately next to TE, minus one.

Population frequencies of TE insertions (response variable) were treated as either dichotomous variable (‘high frequency’ TE or not) or count (the number of individuals in which a TE insertion is present).

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Detlef Weigel (Senior Editor) and three reviewers, one of whom, Magnus Nordborg (Reviewer #1), is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Brandon Gaut (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This is a very thorough and important demonstration of the idea that epigenetic silencing of TEs in <italic>Drosophila</italic> may affect nearby genes, and lead to selection against TE insertions. This agrees with similar observations in plants, and suggests that this is a universal aspect of TE biology (at least in organisms with compact genomes).</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>All three reviewers are positive, but have produced lengthy, detailed, and non-overlapping lists of comments. Having gone through these comments, we think they are generally reasonable, self-explanatory and constructive, and we will therefore not follow standard <italic>eLife</italic> practice and try to extract the most important ones. You should obviously feel free to disagree with particular points, but in that case you will need to convince us that you are right!</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>This is a really good paper that will likely prove to be major contribution to our understanding of TE dynamics.

Elsevier: 492-505. [genomewide epigenetics]</p><p>Note that the above look at DNA methylation, but this is essentially a proxy for H3K9.</p><p>Second, I'm somewhat concerned by using &quot;present in Zambia&quot; as a proxy for allele frequency. The logic is OK, but it is a bit crude, and there is a real chance that TE's outside Africa could have been affected by the environment. Also (subsection “TEs with epigenetic effects are more strongly selected against”, second paragraph), you do seem to have some real frequency data. Where is the figure?</p><p>Third, the last paragraph of the subsection “TEs with epigenetic effects are more strongly selected against”, about age and frequency is, frankly, very confused. A causal (statistical) relationship between age and frequency of a mutation is expected under any population genetics model except strong balancing selection. You observe an inverse correlation between silencing and frequency, and attribute this to purifying selection. I believe you are right, but it is formally possible that silencing simply decays with time. The right (and only) way to test this is to get an estimate of age that is independent of allele frequency. You could look for accumulation of mutations between copies of the same insertion, but you would never have enough power (I think – time is too short). Better is to look for the extent of haplotype sharing (the extent of linkage disequilibrium) surrounding insertion alleles. This decays with time, and alleles under selection should be surrounded by more extensive LD than neutral ones, conditional on allele frequency. This would be nice independent demonstration of selection on the more silenced ones.</p><p>The age of the family is not relevant to this (the time scales are completely different).</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>In this remarkably thorough paper, Lee and Karpen examine the epigenetic effects of TE insertions on euchromatic regions of <italic>Drosophila</italic> genomes. The basic premise is that TEs elevate the incidence and spread of repressive epigenetic marks, causing dampening effects on the expression of nearby genes. Depending on the gene in question, these dampening effects could lead to deleterious selection on the TE-containing haplotypes. As such, epigenetic modifications of TEs may be a primary cause of deleterious selection against them. These ideas have been bandied about for a few years now, but there have been few thorough analyses of the idea.</p><p>To test these ideas, the authors start by comparing two inbred <italic>Drosophila</italic> strains for their TE content and the association of individual TE insertions (and euchromatic regions, for that matter) with enrichment of a repressive mark (H3K9me3). They then detail a number of analyses showing that TE insertions are associated with enrichment, that this enrichment often spreads to the TE's flanking regions, which this local enrichment can affect flanking genic regions, and that genic enrichment correlates negatively with gene expression. They also show that enrichment tends to be higher for TEs found at low frequency, which is a direct prediction of the 'deleterious selection by epigenetic modification' hypothesis. Finally, they extend comparisons to <italic>D. simulans</italic>. They present evidence that the epigenetic response is stronger in <italic>D. simulans</italic>, perhaps (?) due to modification of the titration of heterochromatic proteins.</p><p>This study is a welcome and important contribution to the field. It is novel in many aspects but particularly in its depth. The comparison between inbreds permit the address of existing ideas on a genome-wide scale but also permit comparisons among TE families, etc. In fact, I like this paper so much that I have no major comments about the content or any need for additional analyses. That said, it is a lengthy paper and, as might be expected of such a detailed work, there are many areas where clarity could be improved.</p><p>Specific comments:</p><p>Abstract: The abstract needs to be refined, as, in its current shape, it lacks in detail (e.g., H3K9me3).</p><p>Introduction: As a non-drosophilist I found myself puzzled by some of the statements about piRNAs and siRNAs that come later in the manuscript. My comprehension might have been helped by a paragraph or two that reviews known mechanisms of TE epigenetic modification in Drosophila. Would it be worth adding this information? [I was also puzzled about the mechanism of spread. If there is prior knowledge about this, it might be useful to add the information to a paragraph or two on mechanisms.]</p><p>Subsection “Euchromatic TEs exhibit extensive epigenetic effects on adjacent sequences”, fourth paragraph – because measures like the &quot;extent of spread&quot;, &quot;% increase in H3K9me2&quot;, &quot;with/without epigenetic effect&quot; etc. are used throughout, I think it is well worth giving their explicit definitions in the Results in addition to the Materials and methods, especially since the definitions are pretty short. This isn't necessary but may aid clarity for readers.</p><p>Subsection “TE families of LTR-type and targeted by piRNAs show stronger epigenetic effects”, third paragraph – I had difficulties synthesizing the statement that &quot;there is no difference in the amount of piRNAs targeting different types of TE families&quot;, with the fact that piRNA amounts across families correlate with things like the &quot;mean extent of spread&quot; in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>. I guess this is saying that you can still rank families by piRNA amount and get some neat correlations, but it seems a bit strange.</p><p>Anyway, if nothing else, the description of <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref> needs to be improved. From the text, I eventually realized these were Spearman correlations, but the table is not well described in its heading or in its first citation in the text. Finally, I believe this section (subsection “TE families of LTR-type and targeted by piRNAs show stronger epigenetic effects”) could benefit from some clarity about a couple of things: 1) how do piRNAs and siRNAs differ? 2) mapping piRNAs/siRNAs to TEs can be tricky due to multiple mapping phenomena and can totally mislead an analysis if not done carefully. Maybe I missed it in the Materials and methods, but it wasn't clear to me how the data in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref> were gathered (i.e., per family counts of piRNAs and siRNAs). Were pi/siRNAs counted once? Weighted by number of mapping positions? I assume they were mapped to the genome (as opposed to a reduced representation TE dataset). The variation in how these things are done is pretty huge; I just ask that it be clear. (Again, didn't see it in Materials and methods at all, but I think the Materials and methods implies that counts were gathered from another study?)</p><p>Subsection “TEs with epigenetic effects are more strongly selected against”, last paragraph – I found most of the discussion on age to be a bit muddled. If I'm not mistaken, frequency and age should covary, as argued, and (all else being equal) both should covary with epigenetic effect. Thus, the findings in the aforementioned paragraph seem to me to be unlikely, unless age is misestimated. My guess is that the sequence similarity measure to the reference is a misleading or noisy. (Depending on the history in a particular TE family, it's easy to envision cases where it might be positively misleading.) Not sure what to advise here, but I suspect it needs some more thought? Or could even be removed?</p><p>Subsection “Epigenetic effects of TEs result in differential epigenetic states of adjacent coding genes”, second paragraph – I found myself a bit confused here. Is the z-score compared between genes that differ in the presence/absence of flanking TEs in the two lines? If so, what window size defines &quot;flanking&quot;? Or is it really just the closest flanking TE without reference to distance? I'd just like a few more methodological details here in the flow of description of the results.</p><p><xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>: Despite my best attempts, I could not understand it at all! Can you provide an example in the footnotes (for example, explicitly define the data in the first row) or in the text? Maybe I'm missing something obvious, but I just didn't get it!</p><p>Discussion, third paragraph: again, <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref> is referred to almost obliquely. It'd be nice to be described in more detail or add a sentence that references the table explicitly – i.e., &quot;For example, for TEs with higher enrichment in RAL315…&quot;. Great points about inbreds (Discussion, fourth paragraph) and synergistic epistasis (Discussion, fifth paragraph). Really enjoyed them!</p><p>Subsection “Chip-seq data analysis”, second paragraph and following. These are key definitions that (maybe) should be in the Results but definitely should be defined more clearly and precisely. I got the gist, but more precision and care are merited.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>In this paper, the authors analyze the effects that polymorphic TE insertions have on chromatin states in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. This paper is an extension of a previous study that was limited by the fact that the effect of polymorphic TE insertions could not be determined since only one reference was used (from ModEncode, for example). In this paper, the authors explicitly examine the effects of TE insertion polymorphism on variation in repressed chromatin signatures within the genome. This is an important contribution to the field and is very well written.</p><p>My major concern, which I will point out specifically in several places, is that the representation of the data limits the reader’s ability to understand the variation in the signal. In particular, many of the figures compress the data into box plots, where this compression is not appropriate. I will alert the authors to this paper:</p><p>&quot;Beyond Bar and Line Graphs: Time for a New Data Presentation Paradigm&quot;. While the authors might think this concern is nitpicky, I don't think so. The authors are aiming for a high-profile paper and the readers should be able to see the structure of the underlying data and variation. Not all figures are at issue, but some can be revised.</p><p>The article is lacking reference to the work of the Kalmykova lab. In particular, the article must cite Shpiz et al. Euchromatic transposon insertions trigger […] This paper is an important contribution to the field.</p><p>Subsection “Euchromatic TEs exhibit extensive epigenetic effects on adjacent sequences”, second paragraph: It would be worth illuminating in the text the interesting observation in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> that embryos show these effects most strongly.</p><p>Subsection “Euchromatic TEs exhibit extensive epigenetic effects on adjacent sequences”, fourth paragraph: It is a little awkward to say &quot;homologous sequences that lack nearby TEs.&quot; I think the authors mean &quot;with corresponding alleles lacking the TE insertion.&quot;</p><p>Subsection “Euchromatic TEs exhibit extensive epigenetic effects on adjacent sequences”, fourth paragraph: Since the metrics &quot;extent of spread&quot; and &quot;% increase in H3K9me&quot; are used throughout, please exactly define these metrics here, not just in the Methods.</p><p>Subsection “Euchromatic TEs exhibit extensive epigenetic effects on adjacent sequences”, fourth paragraph: Please exactly define the characteristic: &quot;associated with enrichment for H3K9me2 in at least 1 kb&quot;. Likewise, please define how the extent of spreading is defined (what is the cutoff for spread).</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> legend. Please clarify in the legend that these are TE insertion alleles that are absent in the other strain.</p><p>Subsection “TE families of LTR-type and targeted by piRNAs show stronger epigenetic effects”: There is a suggestion that LTRs have stronger effects. This is demonstrated in several ways, but I don't follow the statistics:</p><p>1) Subsection “TE families of LTR-type and targeted by piRNAs show stronger epigenetic effects”, second paragraph: There is suggestion of enrichment with several statements such as &quot;eight of 11 TE families with over half of insertions […] are LTR-type&quot; Is this enrichment significant, given there are more LTR families? A Fisher's exact would be suitable here. A similar point can be made about the next sentence.</p><p>2)They perform a statistical test of this phenomenon (subsection “TE families of LTR-type and targeted by piRNAs show stronger epigenetic effects”, second paragraph), but it is not clear the test is appropriate. Here, they seem to be binning all LTRs (I could be wrong) but this Mann-Whitney U result may be solely driven by one abundant LTR family, such as <italic>copia</italic> or <italic>roo</italic>. The authors should provide a more convincing case that LTRs really exert a stronger effect, in general, instead of this being driven by some families. This could be done in an ANOVA framework, where the effect of TE class is explicitly tested, in contrast to family level effects.</p><p>Subsection “TE families of LTR-type and targeted by piRNAs show stronger epigenetic effects”, third paragraph: &quot;It is worth noting […]&quot; I don't understand this sentence. It appears that they are saying that there are no differences, between strains, in piRNA abundance for each given family. Is that correct? Then why are P-values indicated for two genotypes, sense such a test between two strains would have one P value?</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> is an example of data compression with bar charts that is not appropriate. First, frequency should not be binned in this manner. Such binning is arbitrary and masks the underlying data. Please plot these values continuously. In addition, for 5B and 5C, plot the Y axis continuously for each TE insertion.</p><p>Also, in regard to the analysis of population frequencies, this analysis seems completely confounded by the previously reported family level effects and <italic>copia</italic> number effects. For example, <italic>copia</italic> elements (LTRs, with large <italic>copia</italic> number) may also have low frequencies for other reasons that have nothing to do with the effect they exert on local chromatin. I imagine there are two ways to deal with this. 1) All contrasts must control for within family effects. For example, the test should be: Do <italic>copia</italic> elements with a stronger chromatin effect have lower frequencies than other <italic>copia</italic> elements? Do <italic>roo</italic> elements with a stronger chromatin effect have lower frequencies than other <italic>roo</italic> elements? The family level effects must be accounted for. 2) A formal way to do this would be to directly model population frequency and perform a multiple logistic regression where family effects and chromatin effects are evaluated for their capacity to predict frequencies in the population. This way, family effects and chromatin effects can be explicitly measured and evaluated.</p><p>Right now, this binning approach is not appropriate.</p><p>Subsection “Epigenetic effects of TEs result in differential epigenetic states of adjacent coding genes”. Similar data compression by binning for the expression analysis is not appropriate. The Fisher's exact test approach in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref> doesn't seem appropriate. There is a very nice paired structure to these data that can simply be measured as the difference in RPKM between alleles with a TE and alleles without a TE. Then, a scatter plot can be shown to demonstrate the degree to which chromatin effects are predictive of gene expression differences. Here, the X-axis would be some continuous measure of chromatin effect and the Y-axis would be the measured effect on gene expression. Such a scatter plot is essential for the reader to evaluate the nature of these data. These bins do not allow the reader to understand what is going on.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>. It seems a binomial test would show 7B (proportion of TE spread) significant, but not for the rest of 7B. Please provide P values for a test of more dots above the diagonal than below the diagonal in 7B.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Pervasive epigenetic effects of <italic>Drosophila</italic> euchromatic transposable elements impact their evolution&quot; for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been favorably evaluated by Detlef Weigel (Senior Editor) and three reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below:</p><p>As requested by Reviewer #1, please integrate other previous findings better.</p><p>As requested by Reviewer #3, please address points 1, 3, and 4 (or explain why this is not a good idea).</p><p>The paper is excellent: we just think it would be further improved with relatively little effort.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>I'm happy with your response to my comments with one exception: just adding a bunch of plant references at one point in the Introduction is not enough. Sure, the authors get the citation count credit they deserve, but in the name of scholarship you should do better.</p><p>What struck me when I read your paper is how closely it parallels findings in plants, and I think your paper would improve if you made this clear.</p><p>For example, the spreading of silencing has been shown several times in plants, and there is also strong evidence that selection depends on this. Population frequencies appear to be low, and the recent <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> paper by Colot's group clearly showed that insertions are uniform, but that selection removes them so that older (more frequent) TEs cluster around the centromeres.</p><p>I know it is a pain to do this, but there are several places in both Introduction and Discussion where you could note these similarities. It would really improve the paper, and would be a service to a field that is too often is organism-limited.</p><p>Someone needs to spend a day in a coffee house with a (virtual) stack of papers and a laptop. This is not too much to ask.</p><p>With respect to estimating the age of TEs, I understand that you cannot sequence the interior of the TE, but did you try the haplotype sharing? I think it could be more powerful than you suggest. This is real work, however, and I'm fine with your dropping the section instead.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>The authors have done a thorough job responding to the reviewers' comments. I heartily endorse publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>This is the second version of this article that I have read. The results are very interesting and important, but I feel the argument simplifies some complexity that should be more acknowledged. The authors have addressed many of my concerns, but, as in my first review, I will ask that the authors improve the presentation to allow readers to have a more clear understanding of the underlying complexities.</p><p>1) With regard to the definition of extent of spread, I am still slightly confused. The authors do a good job and provide a graphical representation of these definitions, but by &quot;farthest window&quot;, how do they deal with values on one side being larger than values on the other side. Suppose the extent of spread to the left is 15 kb and the extent of spread to the right is 6 kb. Is a max function used such that 15 kb is the defined extent? Please be exact and precise in this definition.</p><p>2) Introduction, last paragraph, and elsewhere, I think there should be a bit more of a hedge on the conclusion that selection is determining the patterns. Therefore, a sentence like &quot;we observed stronger selection against TE insertions&quot; would preferably be &quot;we find evidence that stronger selection against TE insertions&quot;</p><p>3) This is my most significant comment. I am still confused about the expression analysis.</p><p>First, from <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl3">Table 3</xref>, it appears this effect is only observed in one strain. In fact, for TEs in RAL315 (top set of genes in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>), the odds ratio is 0.95, the opposite expected. Therefore, it is not clear to me that one can argue that this result is straightforward. The authors should be upfront about this strain effect. It's interesting! But it certainly makes the story more complex and reduces the strength of their broader conclusion.</p><p>Second, <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl3">Table 3</xref> can still be improved. For one, the Fisher's Exact test is being performed against the background genes (with respect to sign of effect of enrichment and expression between the two strains), but the way it is presented, the nature of values in the 2X2 table is cryptic. From first look, one might think that the four values in each row are members of the 2X2 table. Now, this is not the correct interpretation, but I encourage the authors to make this clearer. In particular, why not just provide the four different 2X2 tables? This is also made confusing from the fact that, it appears, the numbers are wrong in the example below the table. By my count, for the RAL315 TEs, 56 is the value in the focal cell (H3K9me2 higher in 315, Higher expression in 360), but the values of the other cells (based on the text below) should sum to 121, correct? But, by my count, the rest of the genes with the other states add to 177 (75+56+46). I am sorry if I am wrong, but I guess I am still confused. I do think that presentation of the actual 2X2 tables that go into the FET would be best.</p><p>In light of these issues, I am still not convinced that Fisher's exacts tests of this kind are the best way to present the data. In my last review, I had requested a figure more like <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7 and I</xref> appreciate the authors providing it. However, it is clear from this new figure that the effect that these TEs have on expression, via H3K9me2, is complicated. For example, from the scatter plots for RAL315 TE insertions, there are 131 genes with TE inserts that have higher H3K9me2 in RAL315. However, among these genes, most (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">75</xref>) show a higher level of expression in 315 – the opposite pattern expected. It is also appears from these scatterplots that there is perhaps no correlation between fold H3K9me2 enrichment differences and differences in expression. This is a very interesting and extremely important complexity that must be made evident to the reader. Therefore, I request that these scatter plots be provided in the main figures with a revised version of <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl3">Table 3 <italic>and</italic> a</xref> correlation coefficient be provided for these scatter plots.</p><p>4) The authors have done a good job controlling for the non-independent effects of family and spread of H3K9me in predicting TE insertion frequency. This is evident in their Methods (subsection “TE population frequency analysis”). However, <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref> doesn't provide the jointly estimated regression coefficient for family. It just provides regression coefficients and p-values for extent and magnitude of spread. Please provide results from the full models, where regression coefficients were jointly estimated for epigenetic and family effects.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.25762.039</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p><italic>This is a really good paper that is likely to prove to be major contribution to our understanding of TE dynamics.

However, we agree with reviewers 1 and 3 that it is necessary to show the full-range of variation in TE’s population frequencies, so we added additional supplementary figures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplements 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">3</xref>).</p><p>The two strains used in the study are from DGRP, a collection of <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> strains from North America. We chose the Zambian population to estimate population frequencies of TEs, instead of the North American population, for the following reasons. One is regarding the demographic history of this population, which we discuss in the main text (subsection “TEs with epigenetic effects are more strongly selected against”, second paragraph). Others are technical reasons. The sequencing of DGRP genomes used a mixture of 454 and pair-end Illumina of several read lengths (36bp-125bp). The sequencing coverage is also highly variable between genomes. The power to detect TE insertions is thus highly variable between strains in the DGRP panel. In addition, there are extensive identity-by-descent (IBD) regions among these genomes (Cridland et al. 2013 MBE), which would further complicate the analysis. In contrast, the Zambian population was sequenced with the same sequencing technology, similar read-length and read depth, while having limited IBD regions (Lack et al. 2015 Genetics). It is worth noting that the two DGRP strains used in the study were sequenced with pair-end Illumina long read lengths (125bp) and with high sequencing coverage. There is also limited IBD identified between these two strains.</p><p><italic>Third, the last paragraph of the subsection “TEs with epigenetic effects are more strongly selected against”, about age and frequency is, frankly, very confused. A causal (statistical) relationship between age and frequency of a mutation is expected under any population genetics model except strong balancing selection. You observe an inverse correlation between silencing and frequency, and attribute this to purifying selection. I believe you are right, but it is formally possible that silencing simply decays with time. The right (and only) way to test this is to get an estimate of age that is independent of allele frequency. You could look for accumulation of mutations between copies of the same insertion, but you would never have enough power (I think – time is too short). Better is to look for the extent of haplotype sharing (the extent of linkage disequilibrium) surrounding insertion alleles. This decays with time, and alleles under selection should be surrounded by more extensive LD than neutral ones, conditional on allele frequency. This would be nice independent demonstration of selection on the more silenced ones.</italic> </p><p><italic>The age of the family is not relevant to this (the time scales are completely different).</italic> </p><p>We agreed with reviewers 1 and 2 that our original attempt to exclude age of TE insertions as a contributor to variation in TE’s population frequencies is not well discussed and is confusing.</p><p>We really like the analysis the reviewer suggested. However, because these genomes were sequenced with Illumina short reads, we are unable to gather the internal sequences of individual TE insertions and would detect very few mutations, if any, for inference (on top of the issue of short time scale). Given that most TEs have very low population frequencies or appear as singletons (which are of particular interests) in our analysis, using haplotype sharing to infer age of TE insertions is expected to have limited statistical power. We anticipate future long-read sequencing will enable us to assemble the internal sequence of individual TE insertions, which will allow using sequence comparisons (e.g. divergence between two LTRs of a LTR insertion, or more internal sequences) to infer TE age. Because we are unable to provide unequivocal data with respect to this issue, we removed this section of the Discussion.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3: […] My major concern, which I will point out specifically in several places, is that the representation of the data limits the readers ability to understand the variation in the signal. In particular, many of the figures compress the data into box plots, where this compression is not appropriate. I will alert the authors to this paper:</italic> </p><p><italic>&quot;Beyond Bar and Line Graphs: Time for a New Data Presentation Paradigm&quot;. While the authors might think this concern is nitpicky, I don't think so. The authors are aiming for a high-profile paper and the readers should be able to see the structure of the underlying data and variation. Not all figures are at issue, but some can be revised.</italic> </p><p>We thank the reviewer for pointing out this thoughtful paper. To ensure concise presentation of the data, we retained several boxplots and a table in the main text, while added additional supplementary figures that allow readers to evaluate the full variation of the data.

Please clarify in the legend that these are TE insertion alleles that are absent in the other strain.</italic> </p><p>We revised the figure legend accordingly.</p><p><italic>Subsection “TE families of LTR-type and targeted by piRNAs show stronger epigenetic effects”: There is a suggestion that LTRs have stronger effects. This is demonstrated in several ways, but I don't follow the statistics:</italic> </p><p><italic>1) Subsection “TE families of LTR-type and targeted by piRNAs show stronger epigenetic effects”, second paragraph: There is suggestion of enrichment with several statements such as &quot;eight of 11 TE families with over half of insertions…are LTR-type&quot; Is this enrichment significant, given there are more LTR families? A Fisher's exact would be suitable here. A similar point can be made about the next sentence.</italic> </p><p>These descriptions were intended as a general summary of the TE family data, and not as direct, quantitative support for the conclusion that LTR-type TE families have stronger epigenetic effects. We refrain from doing the Fisher’s Exact test because the categorization is fairly arbitrary (e.g. TE families with &gt;5kb average spread of H3K9me2). Accordingly, we revised the text to avoid misleading readers at this stage of the analysis (subsection “TE families of LTR-type and targeted by piRNAs show stronger epigenetic effects”, second paragraph), and only make a more definitive conclusion after quantitative analysis using Mann-Whitney U tests(see response to next comment).</p><p><italic>2) They perform a statistical test of this phenomenon (subsection “TE families of LTR-type and targeted by piRNAs show stronger epigenetic effects”, second paragraph), but it is not clear the test is appropriate. Here, they seem to be binning all LTRs (I could be wrong) but this Mann-Whitney U result may be solely driven by one abundant LTR family, such as copia or roo. The authors should provide a more convincing case that LTRs really exert a stronger effect, in general, instead of this being driven by some families. This could be done in an ANOVA framework, where the effect of TE class is explicitly tested, in contrast to family level effects.</italic> </p><p>The Mann-Whitney U tests were comparing “the proportion of TEs with epigenetic effects”, “the average extent of H3K9me2 spread”, and “average% increase in H3K9me2 enrichment” between LTR-type TE families and other types of TE families. In other words, one TE family is one data point. So, <italic>roo and copia,</italic> despite being abundant, are two data points in these analyses and are unlikely to be the only TE families driving the significant patterns. We agree that the “units” used for these comparisons was unclear and thus revised the text (subsection “TE families of LTR-type and targeted by piRNAs show stronger epigenetic effects”, second paragraph).</p><p><italic>Subsection “TE families of LTR-type and targeted by piRNAs show stronger epigenetic effects”, third paragraph: &quot;It is worth noting […]&quot; I don't understand this sentence. It appears that they are saying that there are no differences, between strains, in piRNA abundance for each given family. Is that correct? Then why are P-values indicated for two genotypes, sense such a test between two strains would have one P value?</italic> </p><p>What we meant is “irrespective of the genotype (<italic>wK</italic> or <italic>w1118</italic>), piRNA abundance is not significantly different between LTR-type and other type of TE families”. Instead of abbreviating the two p-values as “<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.19”, we now included p-values for each genotype to avoid this confusion. We also revised the text accordingly (subsection “TE families of LTR-type and targeted by piRNAs show stronger epigenetic effects”, third paragraph).</p><p><italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> is an example of data compression with bar charts that is not appropriate. First, frequency should not be binned in this manner. Such binning is arbitrary and masks the underlying data. Please plot these values continuously. In addition, for 5B and 5C, plot the Y axis continuously for each TE insertion.</italic> </p><p>We agree with reviewers 1 and 3 that the binning may not seem appropriate without knowledge of the variation of the data. Consistent with previous findings that most of the TEs are rare in <italic>Drosophila,</italic> the majority of the TEs (68.5%) were not detected in the Zambian population, and most of other TE insertions have low population frequencies. Accordingly, we performed two types of analyses – one by categorizing TEs into ‘observed and not observed’ in the Zambian population, and the other using the continuous distribution of TE frequencies. We have revised the text to clarify this point (subsection “TEs with epigenetic effects are more strongly selected against”, second paragraph). As recommended by the reviewer, we added new supplementary figures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplements 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">3</xref>) that show the full distribution of TE frequencies. Please also see our response to the second comment of reviewer 1.</p><p><italic>Also, in regard to the analysis of population frequencies, this analysis seems completely confounded by the previously reported family level effects and copia number effects. For example, copia elements (LTRs, with large copia number) may also have low frequencies for other reasons that have nothing to do with the effect they exert on local chromatin. I imagine there are two ways to deal with this. 1) All contrasts must control for within family effects. For example, the test should be: Do copia elements with a stronger chromatin effect have lower frequencies than other copia elements? Do roo elements with a stronger chromatin effect have lower frequencies than other roo elements? The family level effects must be accounted for. 2) A formal way to do this would be to directly model population frequency and perform a multiple logistic regression where family effects and chromatin effects are evaluated for their capacity to predict frequencies in the population. This way, family effects and chromatin effects can be explicitly measured and evaluated.</italic> </p><p><italic>Right now, this binning approach is not appropriate.</italic> </p><p>We performed regression analysis to jointly consider the effects of TE’s epigenetic effects and family identity on their population frequencies. To ensure that our conclusion is robust with respect to the assumed regression models, we modeled the response variable (TE’s population frequencies) with several types of regression analyses.</p><p>1) Because a large proportion of TEs are not observed in the Zambian population (68.5%), we modeled TE’s population frequencies as a dichotomous variable and performed logistic regression.</p><p>2) Because the population frequencies of TEs were first observed as “counts” (the number of individuals with a particular TE insertion in the population), and the distribution of TE frequencies is skewed towards small numbers (L-shape), TE’s population frequencies can be treated as Poisson distributed. However, the variance of TE’s population frequencies is larger than the mean (overdispersion). Accordingly, we modeled TE frequencies as either “quasi-poisson” or “negative binomial”, since both are usually used for modeling overdispersed Poisson-like count variables, and performed generalized linear regression.</p><p>Because we do not have <italic>a priori</italic> knowledge about whether the variation in population frequencies between TE families is due to a fixed effect (i.e. each TE family has biological properties that make its insertions always have lower/higher population frequencies) or a random effect (variation between families), we treated the influence of TE family identity on TE’s population frequencies either as a fixed effect (generalized linear model) or a random effect (generalized mixed linear model).</p><p>For all regression models, we observed negative associations between TE’s epigenetic effects and population frequencies, after accounting for the effect of TE family identity. The regression coefficients are statistically significant for majority of the models considered, further corroborating the finding that TEs with stronger epigenetic effects are more likely to have low population frequencies. These new results are now in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref> (subsection “TEs with epigenetic effects are more strongly selected against”, third paragraph).</p><p><italic>Subsection “Epigenetic effects of TEs result in differential epigenetic states of adjacent coding genes”. Similar data compression by binning for the expression analysis is not appropriate. The Fisher's exact test approach in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref> doesn't seem appropriate. There is a very nice paired structure to these data that can simply be measured as the difference in RPKM between alleles with a TE and alleles without a TE. Then, a scatter plot can be shown to demonstrate the degree to which chromatin effects are predictive of gene expression differences. Here, the X-axis would be some continuous measure of chromatin effect and the Y-axis would be the measured effect on gene expression. Such a scatter plot is essential for the reader to evaluate the nature of these data. These bins do not allow the reader to understand what is going on.</italic> </p><p>We now included a supplementary figure describing the full variation of the data (Figure 6—figure supplement 2). As mentioned in the Discussion, for various reasons, we observe genes that are “not following” the prediction (e.g. the allele with a TE has high H3K9me2 enrichment but also high RNA transcript level). We thus performed Fisher’s Exact test, and the proportion of genes following the expected influence of TE insertion (i.e. alleles adjacent to TE insertions have higher H3K9me2 enrichment and lower transcript levels) is significantly more than expectation calculated from genes without TEs in 10kb.</p><p><italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>. It seems a binomial test would show 7B (proportion of TE spread) significant, but not for the rest of 7B. Please provide P values for a test of more dots above the diagonal than below the diagonal in 7B.</italic> </p><p>To test for differences in epigenetic effects of TEs between <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> and <italic>D. simulans,</italic> we used <italic>paired</italic> Wilcoxon tests (Wilcoxon signed-rank test) to assess significance in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>. This is a nonparametric test that takes into account both the sign (i.e. the number of dots above/below the diagonal in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>) and the magnitude of differences. In contrast, a binomial test would miss the important information in the “magnitude of differences”. Accordingly, we still presented our original results using Wilcoxon signed-rank test.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p><italic>I'm happy with your response to my comments with one exception: just adding a bunch of plant references at one point in the Introduction is not enough.

Population frequencies appear to be low, and the recent Arabidopsis paper by Colot's group clearly showed that insertions are uniform, but that selection removes them so that older (more frequent) TEs cluster around the centromeres.</italic> </p><p>We agree that clearer acknowledgement of the relevant plant literature is appropriate, and have revised the text accordingly. However, we are confused about the Quadrana et al. 2016 (study from Colot’s group); we were unable to find data that demonstrated selection against spreading of methylation from TEs. They found that 10% of TE insertion sites have spreading of methylation in most accessions, but this includes accessions without TE insertions. These tend to be in pericentromeric regions, thus the enrichment of DNA methylation likely results from processes other than TE-induced spreading of this epigenetic mark. If this is not what the reviewer was referring to, we would appreciate the reviewer pointing out the relevant data presented in Quadrana et al. 2016. In addition, the accumulation of TEs in pericentromeric regions could also result from lower probability of ectopic exchange and/or reduced efficacy of selection (Hill-Robertson effects). Nevertheless, in this revised manuscript we still incorporate other important observations in this study (see below).</p><p>It is worth noting that, to avoid potential confounding influence of pericentromeric and peritelomeric regions already enriched for repressive epigenetic marks (likely the situation for <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> studies), we used highly conservative euchromatin-heterochromatin boundaries and only analyzed TEs and sequences that are in euchromatic regions.</p><p>Interestingly, similar to our observations, the two recent studies in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> that jointly analyzed mobilomes and transcriptomes (Quadrana et al. 2016 and Stuart et al. 2016) also found complex influences of TEs on differential gene expression (also see below). However, neither study further associated these data with epigenomic data.

An alternative approach may be to use haplotype sharing between alleles with and without TEs, which some groups are current developing. This is something of continuing interest, and we intend to formally address this in the near future (maybe with advice from the reviewer!). For this study, we would like to leave it out for the moment.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p><italic>This is the second version of this article that I have read. The results are very interesting and important, but I feel the argument simplifies some complexity that should be more acknowledged. The authors have addressed many of my concerns, but, as in my first review, I will ask that the authors improve the presentation to allow readers to have a more clear understanding of the underlying complexities.</italic> </p><p><italic>1) With regard to the definition of extent of spread, I am still slightly confused. The authors do a good job and provide a graphical representation of these definitions, but by &quot;farthest window&quot;, how do they deal with values on one side being larger than values on the other side. Suppose the extent of spread to the left is 15 kb and the extent of spread to the right is 6 kb. Is a max function used such that 15 kb is the defined extent? Please be exact and precise in this definition.</italic> </p><p>When the farthest windows are different between the left and right sides of the TE insertion, we used the smaller value in order to be conservative. In this example, the TE would be estimated to have 6kb spread. We clarified our definition in Materials and methods (subsection “ChIP-Seq data analysis”, second paragraph).</p><p><italic>2) Introduction, last paragraph, and elsewhere, I think there should be a bit more of a hedge on the conclusion that selection is determining the patterns. Therefore, a sentence like &quot;we observed stronger selection against TE insertions&quot; would preferably be &quot;we find evidence that stronger selection against TE insertions&quot;</italic> </p><p>We revised the text in the last paragraph of the Introduction according to reviewer’s suggestion. We also double-checked that, at other places where selection was discussed, we did state that it is our evidence suggesting stronger selection, instead of directly observed stronger selection against TE insertions.</p><p><italic>3) This is my most significant comment. I am still confused about the expression analysis.</italic> </p><p><italic>First, from <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl3">Table 3</xref>, it appears this effect is only observed in one strain. In fact, for TEs in RAL315 (top set of genes in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>), the odds ratio is 0.95, the opposite expected. Therefore, it is not clear to me that one can argue that this result is straightforward. The authors should be upfront about this strain effect. It's interesting! But it certainly makes the story more complex and reduces the strength of their broader conclusion.</italic> </p><p><italic>Second, <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl3">Table 3</xref> can still be improved. For one, the Fisher's Exact test is being performed against the background genes (with respect to sign of effect of enrichment and expression between the two strains), but the way it is presented, the nature of values in the 2X2 table is cryptic. From first look, one might think that the four values in each row are members of the 2X2 table. Now, this is not the correct interpretation, but I encourage the authors to make this clearer. In particular, why not just provide the four different 2X2 tables? This is also made confusing from the fact that, it appears, the numbers are wrong in the example below the table. By my count, for the RAL315 TEs, 56 is the value in the focal cell (H3K9me2 higher in 315, Higher expression in 360), but the values of the other cells (based on the text below) should sum to 121, correct? But, by my count, the rest of the genes with the other states add to 177 (75+56+46). I am sorry if I am wrong, but I guess I am still confused. I do think that presentation of the actual 2X2 tables that go into the FET would be best.</italic> </p><p>This is an error at our end and we have corrected it (also see below).</p><p><italic>In light of these issues, I am still not convinced that Fisher's exacts tests of this kind are the best way to present the data. In my last review, I had requested a figure more like <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7 and I</xref> appreciate the authors providing it. However, it is clear from this new figure that the effect that these TEs have on expression, via H3K9me2, is complicated. For example, from the scatter plots for RAL315 TE insertions, there are 131 genes with TE inserts that have higher H3K9me2 in RAL315. However, among these genes, most (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">75</xref>) show a higher level of expression in 315 – the opposite pattern expected. It is also appears from these scatterplots that there is perhaps no correlation between fold H3K9me2 enrichment differences and differences in expression. This is a very interesting and extremely important complexity that must be made evident to the reader. Therefore, I request that these scatter plots be provided in the main figures with a revised version of <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl3">Table 3 and a</xref> correlation coefficient be provided for these scatter plots.</italic> </p><p>We agree with the reviewer that the complexity between the associations of H3K9me2 enrichment and transcript levels is of biological significance and should be more clearly pointed out. To address reviewer’s comments, we did the following in this revision.</p><p>1) For differential expression analysis, we excluded genes that are deemed to have no or extremely low expression by the modEncode developmental time course data. These genes indeed have no or extremely few mapped reads in our dataset, and the estimated expression fold changes are expected to be more prone to errors than other genes. Details are included in Materials and methods (subsection “RNA-seq analysis”, first paragraph).</p><p>2) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>—figure supplement is now <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>. We replaced the confusing <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl3">Table 3</xref> with <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>, which includes 2x2 tables for testing whether there is an enrichment of genes supporting the epigenetic effects of TEs on gene expression. We also pointed out genes that are not following the expected trend (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>, arrows; subsection “Epigenetic effects of TEs result in differential epigenetic states of adjacent coding genes”, last paragraph; Discussion, fourth paragraph) and the differences between two strains (subsection “Epigenetic effects of TEs result in differential epigenetic states of adjacent coding genes”, last paragraph), as pointed out by the reviewer.</p><p>3) As requested by the reviewer, we provided results for the correlation tests and (if the test is significant) the correlation coefficient between z score for differential epigenetic states and fold change for expression difference (subsection “Epigenetic effects of TEs result in differential epigenetic states of adjacent coding genes”, last paragraph). We found a negative, though weak, correlation between z score and log2 fold change for genes without TEs, but no significant correlations for genes with 10kb to TEs.</p><p>4) We provided potential explanations for the complex relationship between H3K9me2 enrichment status and differential gene expression.</p><p>A) Incidences of TE insertions leading to both down- and up-regulation of gene expression have been observed. Consistently, recent genome-wide studies in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> found that TEs result in equal frequency of increased and decreased expression of neighboring genes (Discussion, fourth paragraph).</p><p>B) Structural variants may also contribute to differential gene expression (discussed in previous version of the manuscript).</p><p>C) This study used inbred strains, and TEs inducing strong reduction in transcript levels are expected to have been removed during the inbreeding process. The small sample size in our current study (two strains) likely precluded detecting subtle functional consequences of TE’s epigenetic effects that are expected prevalent in inbred strains (Discussion, fifth paragraph).</p><p>D) There are known exceptions to the negative influence of enrichment of heterochromatic marks on gene expression. In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, multiple essential genes are located in pericentromeric heterochromatin, and their expression depends on a heterochromatin environment (i.e. enrichment of H3K9me2/3 marks and heterochromatin proteins). Furthermore, several homologs of <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> heterochromatic genes are located in euchromatic regions in other species and, even in euchromatin, these homologs are also enriched with heterochromatin proteins/marks, suggesting conservation of epigenetic environment for gene function (Discussion, fourth paragraph).</p><p><italic>4) The authors have done a good job controlling for the non-independent effects of family and spread of H3K9me in predicting TE insertion frequency. This is evident in their Methods (subsection “TE population frequency analysis”). However, <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref> doesn't provide the jointly estimated regression coefficient for family. It just provides regression coefficients and p-values for extent and magnitude of spread. Please provide results from the full models, where regression coefficients were jointly estimated for epigenetic and family effects.</italic> </p><p>These data are now provided as <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Table 2—source data 1</xref>. Because of the large number of TE families (which generates an extensive table), we did not provide this in the main text <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>.</p></body></sub-article></article>
