Measuring the stiffness of chromosomes offers valuable insight into their structural properties. In this study, we analyzed the stiffness of chromosomes from metaphase I (MI) and metaphase II (MII) oocytes. Our results revealed a tenfold increase in stiffness (Young’s modulus) of MI chromosomes compared to somatic chromosomes. Furthermore, the stiffness of MII chromosomes was found to be lower than that of MI chromosomes. We examined the role of meiosis-specific cohesin complexes in regulating chromosome stiffness. Surprisingly, the stiffness of chromosomes from three meiosis-specific cohesin mutants did not significantly differ from that of wild-type chromosomes, indicating that these cohesins may not be primary determinants of chromosome stiffness. Additionally, our findings revealed an age-related increase of chromosome stiffness for MI oocytes. Since aging is associated with elevated levels of DNA damage, we investigated the impact of etoposide-induced DNA damage on chromosome stiffness and found that it led to a reduction in stiffness in MI oocytes. Overall, our study underscores the dynamic and cyclical nature of chromosome stiffness, modulated by both the cell cycle and age-related factors.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>meiosis</kwd><kwd>chromosome stiffness</kwd><kwd>cohesin protein</kwd><kwd>oocyte</kwd><kwd>spermatocyte</kwd><kwd>age</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R00 HD082375</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Qiao</surname><given-names>Huanyu</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 GM135549</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Qiao</surname><given-names>Huanyu</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>UM1 HG011536</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Marko</surname><given-names>John F</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 GM105847</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Marko</surname><given-names>John F</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 GM117155</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jordan</surname><given-names>Philip W</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>T32 ES007326</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Qiao</surname><given-names>Huanyu</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>U54 CA203000</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Qiang</surname><given-names>Wenan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection, and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Mammalian condensed chromosomes exhibit diverse structural properties, as reflected in their varying stiffness across different cell stages and with aging.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>DNA serves as the carrier of genomic information, interacting with a wide variety of proteins to form chromatin during interphase. Before cell division, chromatin is compacted into thick, noodle-like chromosome structures, a process which plays a critical role in ensuring the equitable distribution of genetic material (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Vagnarelli, 2013</xref>). This process is essential for maintaining genome integrity, as any errors in chromosome behavior during meiosis or mitosis can lead to conditions such as cancer, infertility, miscarriage, or congenital diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Potapova and Gorbsky, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Theisen and Shaffer, 2010</xref>). Despite many decades of research, chromosome structure and organization are not yet understood.</p><p>Chromosome compaction during mitosis and meiosis is not a random process, but a tightly regulated sequence of events. In mammals, centimeters-long segments of DNA are compacted into chromosomes less than 10 μm long, via a multi-level process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kschonsak and Haering, 2015</xref>). This process begins with the formation of nucleosomes, wherein DNA wraps around histone octamers, following the ‘beads on a string’ model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alberts et al., 2002</xref>). Linker histone H1 binds to the entry and exit points of DNA on the nucleosome and interacts with the linker DNA region between nucleosomes.</p><p>However, the interaction between histones and DNA does not come close to explaining the full extent of chromosome compaction, indicating that other factors must be involved in this process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Wood and Earnshaw, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Paulson et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Batty and Gerlich, 2019</xref>). There are different models for chromosome organization, with the most popular being the ‘Scaffold/Radial-Loop’ model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Laemmli et al., 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Maeshima and Laemmli, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Paulson and Laemmli, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Earnshaw and Laemmli, 1983</xref>) and the ‘Chromatin Network’ model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Biggs et al., 2019</xref>). The Scaffold/Radial-Loop model proposes a continuous central protein core with chromatin loops stacked around it, based on electron microscopy observations. The Chromatin Network model suggests that structure proteins link chromatin segments without forming a continuous central core. MNase, an enzyme that degrades DNA/chromatin, ablated chromosome stiffness, in discord with a pure Scaffold/Radial-Loop model and instead indicating a key role for chromatin cross-bridges (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Poirier and Marko, 2002</xref>). Experiments with DNases, which affect chromosome stiffness depending on their cutting frequencies, lend support to the Chromatin Network model (or equivalently, a chromosome radial looping model without a continuous proteinaceous scaffold and with some degree of crossbridging between adjacent loops).</p><p>Chromosome compaction and decompaction occur in different phases of the cell cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Antonin and Neumann, 2016</xref>), and the shape and size of chromosomes vary accordingly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Zickler and Kleckner, 2023</xref>). It is reasonable to hypothesize that chromosome stiffness also differs between stages, and between mitotic and meiotic chromosomes, which have similar shapes but experience different molecular events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Marko and Siggia, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Koshland and Strunnikov, 1996</xref>). Chromosome stiffness measurements have shown that prophase I spermatocyte chromosomes are approximately 10 times stiffer than those in mitosis, indicating differences in chromosome organization between meiosis I and mitosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Biggs et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>During meiosis I, a unique railroad-track-like protein structure, known as the synaptonemal complex (SC), forms between the two homologous chromosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Heyting, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hollingsworth, 2020</xref>). Although the SC was thought to be a potential factor increasing stiffness of meiotic chromosomes, it has been observed that SYCP1, a key SC component, does not contribute to chromosome stiffness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Biggs et al., 2020</xref>). SYCP1 laterally connects the two ‘rails’ of the SC, axial elements (AEs), but may not impact the longitudinal stiffness. It is more likely AEs provide mechanical strength to the meiotic chromosomes longitudinally. Cohesin proteins, which connect sister chromatids in both mitosis and meiosis, are fundamental components of AEs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Peters et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Ishiguro et al., 2011</xref>). In meiosis, meiosis-specific cohesin proteins, such as SMC1β, RAD21L, REC8, and STAG3, may play a role in chromosome structure and stiffness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Zheng and Xie, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Rong et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gyuricza et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Aging can also induce significant changes in chromosomes, potentially leading to apoptosis, senescence, or cancer, all of which affect the lifespan and well-being of both animals and humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Shammas, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Faggioli et al., 2011</xref>). Moreover, chromosome-associated protein levels change with age, with some increasing while others decreasing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Thakur, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Oliviero et al., 2022</xref>). For instance, cohesin proteins along chromosome axes decrease with age, potentially contributing to increased rates of aneuploidy and unsuccessful gamete production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lister et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Nakagawa and FitzHarris, 2017</xref>). Given the elevated aneuploidy rates in oocytes from older individuals, it is essential to explore how aging impacts chromosome mechanics and to gain a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms driving these changes.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Chromosome stiffness measurement for metaphase I and metaphase II mouse oocytes</title><p>To measure oocyte chromosome stiffness, we isolated chromosomes from oocytes collected from 3- to 4-week-old mice.

This setup allowed us to measure chromosome stiffness by moving one pipette and observing and calibrating the bending of the other (see Materials and methods for further details). We stretched and relaxed the chromosomes to monitor its length change under an applied force, ultimately determining their Young’s modulus (a measure of material stiffness which is independent of geometry, i.e., chromosome thickness or number of chromatids). These experiments were carried out with extensions of less than twice the chromosome’s native length, ensuring a reversible mechanical response—that is, the force versus extension curve was similar during both stretching and retraction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Chromosome stiffness in MI oocytes is about 10 times higher than that in mitotic cells</title><p>Chromosome stiffness has been studied for a variety of mitotic cells, revealing similarities and differences across different cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hornick et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Sun et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Strom et al., 2021</xref>).

Prior studies found a large difference between mitotic and spermatocyte meiotic chromosome stiffness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Biggs et al., 2020</xref>). Spermatocyte meiotic prophase chromosomes were found to be 10 times stiffer than somatic chromosomes, which may be due to chromosome compaction or folding mechanisms specific to meiosis. During prophase I of meiosis, the SC zips up the two homologous chromosomes with components that are meiosis specific (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gordon et al., 2021</xref>). Previously, we found that SYCP1, an essential component of the SC that connects the lateral and central elements, does not contribute to the high prophase I chromosome stiffness in spermatocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Biggs et al., 2020</xref>), consistent with a ‘liquid crystal’ organizational scheme of the SC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Rog et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Here, we found that high chromosome stiffness also occurs in MI oocytes, which have a Young’s modulus approximately 10 times larger than that of mitotic chromosomes, five times larger than that of MII chromosomes, and approximately the same as that of prophase I chromosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). We note that the Young’s modulus corrects for the varying thickness of chromosomes and indicates the elasticity in a volume- and geometry-independent way. However, the same trend of a large increase in chromosome stiffness during progression from somatic metaphase to meiotic prophase I and persisting through MI, followed by a reduction in chromosome stiffness upon progression to MII, is reflected in the force needed to double the length of chromosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). This robust trend of a strong stiffening of chromosomes during prophase I and MI is in general accord with expectations from the chromosome compaction/relaxation and mechanics progression proposed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kleckner et al., 2004</xref>. To further test Kleckner et al<italic>.</italic>’s model it would be desirable to measure the elasticity of somatic mitotic prophase chromosomes, but this has proven to be technically problematic in our attempts to date.</p><p>The SC central element dissociates from chromosomes before MI, in accord with our prior result that SYCP1 does not impart high meiotic chromosome stiffness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Biggs et al., 2020</xref>). We also measured chromosome stiffness in MII oocytes and found that it is significantly lower than in MI oocytes (in quantitative agreement with prior work <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hornick et al., 2015</xref>, which measured a doubling force of MII chromosomes approximately double that of somatic mitotic chromosomes). Given the high and comparable stiffnesses of prophase I and MI chromosomes, we focused on factors specific to meiosis I, noting that AEs of the SC can still load onto chromosomes even in <italic>Sycp1<sup>−/−</sup></italic> spermatocytes which display WT prophase I chromosome elasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Biggs et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>Cohesin proteins are components of the meiotic prophase chromosome axis, and load onto chromosomes during DNA replication. Some meiosis-specific cohesins, such as REC8, persist on chromosome arms until anaphase I. We hypothesized that cohesins rather than the central element might contribute to meiotic chromosome stiffness, at least through MI. However, comparing results from experiments on WT and cohesin-deficient (<italic>Rec8<sup>−/−</sup></italic>, <italic>Rad21l<sup>−/−</sup></italic>, and <italic>Stag3<sup>−/−</sup></italic>) spermatocytes, we found no difference in chromosome stiffness. We conclude that the meiosis-specific cohesins do not account for high stiffness in meiotic chromosomes. While we do not yet understand the molecular origin of the high stiffness of meiotic chromosomes, we hypothesize that factors present during prophase I and persisting through MI, drive high meiotic chromosome stiffness.</p><p>A limitation of the current experiments is that we were restricted to analyzing homozygous meiotic cohesin mutants in prophase I in spermatocytes. While it would be valuable to compare these results with prophase I oocytes, this is currently not a practical option since oocytes reach this stage in utero, making genotyping at that time highly challenging. It would have been preferable to carry out control experiments on heterozygous spermatocytes, but the quantitative lack of any difference in prophase I mechanics across the four genetic cases studied (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) strongly suggests that cohesin mutations do not substantially affect chromosome mechanics at prophase I.</p><p>Another limitation is that our mechanics experiments are extracellular, following removal of chromosomes from MI and MII oocytes, prophase I spermatocytes and cultured somatic cells. The extracellular environment (phosphate-buffered saline [PBS], or cell culture buffer for somatic cells) is different from the environment inside the cell, and one might hypothesize that this changes chromosome mechanics, for example, via loss of chromosome-folding proteins after their isolation. In addition to past experiments indicating that mitotic chromosomes are stable for long periods after their isolation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Pope et al., 2006</xref>), we carried out control experiments on mouse oocyte chromosomes where we incubated them for 1 hr in PBS, or exposed them to a flow of Triton X-100 solution for 10 min; there was no change in chromosome stiffness in either case (Methods and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>).

Several factors, including condensin, have been found to affect chromosome stiffness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Sun et al., 2018</xref>). Condensin exists in two distinct complexes, condensin I and condensin II, and both are active during meiosis. Published studies indicate that condensin II is more sharply defined and more closely associated with the chromosome axis from anaphase I to metaphase II (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lee et al., 2011</xref>). Additionally, condensin II appears to play a more significant role in mitotic chromosome mechanics compared to condensin I (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Sun et al., 2018</xref>). Thus, condensin II likely contributes more significantly to meiotic chromosome stiffness than condensin I. It would be interesting to determine to what extent condensin defects affect meiotic chromosome structure.</p><p>Age also plays a role in altering chromosome stiffness. We found that chromosomes from aged MI oocytes had higher stiffness compared to those from younger oocytes, indicating that aging influences chromosome stiffness, in accord with a corresponding result for MII chromosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hornick et al., 2015</xref>). This also provided further support for our conclusion that cohesins are not the primary factor making meiotic chromosomes stiffer as cohesin-protein levels reduce with age. The question of the molecular-level cause of oocyte meiotic chromosome stiffening with age remains open.</p><p>Hundreds of DNA double-stranded breaks are spontaneously introduced by the SPO11 protein at the onset of meiosis and aging also induces DNA damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Carofiglio et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Schumacher et al., 2021</xref>). How can meiotic chromosomes still become stiffer even in the presence of hundreds of DNA breaks in vivo? The answer may lie in the DNA repair proteins that are recruited to or near the DNA damage sites to repair the DNA damage and maintain genome integrity. Therefore, we hypothesized that DNA repair proteins contribute to meiotic chromosome stiffness. To test this hypothesis, we used a chemotherapy drug-etoposide to induce DNA damage in MI oocytes. Etoposide can increase the levels of TOP2–DNA covalent complexes, which generate DNA damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Menendez et al., 2022</xref>). We found that etoposide treatment caused chromosome stiffness to decrease. This result is consistent with our previous study that DNA breaks can reduce chromosome stiffness in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Poirier and Marko, 2002</xref>), reaffirming that meiotic chromosomes integrity relies on DNA continuity rather than the linkage of chromosome axis components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Biggs et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Since DNA repair proteins do not increase chromosome stiffness, other factors must be responsible for the high level of meiotic chromosome stiffness. During senescence, the amount of nuclear protein increases by around twofold, even though the cohesin level is decreased (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Tsutsumi et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">De Cecco et al., 2011</xref>). Thus, it is possible that some nuclear proteins increase chromosome stiffness with age. However, further investigation is needed to determine which nuclear proteins contribute to chromosome stiffness. Additionally, histone methylation might influence chromosome stiffness because the level of histone methylation is proportional to chromosome stiffness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Biggs et al., 2019</xref>). Given that histone methylation levels are altered during aging, it is also plausible that some histone methyltransferases and demethylases regulate chromosome stiffness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Soriano-Tárraga et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Wang et al., 2022</xref>). Moreover, histone methylation, especially H3K4, H3K9, and H3K36, plays a very important role in synapsis and recombination and has been found on meiotic chromatin from leptotene stage onward (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Wang et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hochwagen and Marais, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Powers et al., 2016</xref>). Further experiments could test the hypothesis that histone methylation regulates meiotic chromosome stiffness across different cell types.</p><p>No matter what factors are involved in stiffening meiotic chromosomes, they must alter chromosome organization to regulate chromosome stiffness. This indicates that chromosome stiffness is an important parameter for understanding chromosome structure. Defective chromosome organization is often related to various diseases, such as cancer, infertility, and senescence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Thompson and Compton, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Harton and Tempest, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">He et al., 2018</xref>), and can be expected to cause changes in chromosome mechanics. By using micromanipulation experiments to study chromosome stiffness, we can better understand the mechanisms underlying these chromosome defects, potentially leading to new treatments and therapies.</p><p>A well-documented characteristic of aged oocytes is their higher rate of aneuploidy compared to that of younger oocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Selesniemi et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Ma et al., 2020</xref>). The majority of aneuploidies can be traced to meiosis I, especially anaphase I, because it is an error-prone process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kolano et al., 2012</xref>). It would be intriguing to investigate whether the increased chromosome stiffness contributes to this issue. A common cause of aneuploidy is lagging chromosomes during anaphase I (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Godek and Compton, 2018</xref>). Chromosome stiffness may be related to the occurrence of lagging chromosomes, as chromosome separation relies on the pulling forces exerted by microtubules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Duro and Marston, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cohen-Fix, 2000</xref>). During anaphase I, homologous chromosomes, rather than sister chromatids, segregate. Thus, the chromosome region between the centromere and crossover must resist the tension applied by the spindle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Duro and Marston, 2015</xref>). Chromosomes must be stiff enough to prevent breakage under the pulling force. If the chromosomes are excessively stiff, the tightly connected homologous chromosomes may not properly separate, potentially causing aneuploidy. This suggests that chromosome stiffness change may be related to the high rate of aneuploidy observed in aged oocytes. Modulating factors altering chromosome stiffness may help reduce the incidence of aneuploidy. Moreover, further investigation into the relationship between chromosome stiffness and lagging chromosomes could provide insight into the mechanisms underlying aneuploidy in oocytes.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom">Reagent type (species) or resource</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Designation</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Source or reference</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Identifiers</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Strain, strain background (<italic>M. musculus</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">CD-1</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Charles River Laboratories, Wilmington, MA</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID:IMSR_CRL:022">IMSR_CRL:022</ext-link></td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Strain, strain background (<italic>M. musculus</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">C57BL/6</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">This paper and papers from Dr. Philip W.

Both ovaries were immediately dissected and washed with M2 medium. The ovaries were then placed in prewarmed M2 medium containing 100 μM IBMX at 37°C. Sterilized needles were used to release cumulus–oocyte complexes (COCs). Next, COCs were pipetted in and out several times with a mouth pipette under dissection microscope to remove the cumulus cells surrounding the oocyte, yielding denuded oocytes at the GV stage. These oocytes were then placed in prewarmed M2 medium containing 100 μM IBMX.</p><p>Oocytes with irregular shapes and abnormal sizes were discarded, while healthy oocytes were selected and washed three times in M16 medium. The oocytes were then transferred to small drops of M16 medium covered with mineral oil in a petri dish and incubated at 37°C in a 5% CO<sub>2</sub> incubator. Depending on the experimental plan, oocytes were cultured with or without additional chemicals for 6 hr to reach the MI stage or 14 hr to reach the MII stage.

Well, &quot;slightly&quot; means it is rather similar and therefore the commonly used statement that MII is similar to mitosis is OK - contrary to the authors claim.</p><p>There are a lot of awkward sentences in this text. Some sentences lack words, are not sufficiently precise in wording and/or logic, and there are numerous typos. Some examples can be found in lines 89 (grammar), 94, 95 (&quot;looked&quot;), 98, 101 (&quot;difference&quot; - between what?), and some are commonplaces or superficial (lines 92/93, 120...,). Occasionally the present and past tense are mixed (e.g. in M&amp;M). Thus the manuscript is quite badly written.</p><p>Comments on revisions:</p><p>In their revised paper, Liu et al have addressed a number of my concerns and thus the paper is clearly improved in several details, e.g. in showing a control for a potential effect of the detergent (new supplies. fig. 5). Other points were not sufficiently addressed though.</p><p>I remain sceptical about using mice of a substantially different genetic background (CD1) as controls in the analysis of the cohesin mutants (C57BL/6). The argument that C57BL/6 yield smaller litter size is, frankly, ridiculous. Hundreds of labs worldwide extensively and successfully work with C57BL/6. Further, the paper Liu et al. cite to argue that there are no (or minor) differences in chromosome structure (Biggs et al., 2020, which is from the same lab) of the two mouse strains deals with spermatocyte chromosomes only. Nothing there on oocyte chromosomes. And there is no direct comparison within the same experimental setting since in Biggs et al only C57BL/6 is used (sic!). Thus, this is not a convincing argument. It would also be reassuring to see an independent reference directly comparing different genetic backgrounds (authors may have a look at older papers of Pat Hunt/Terry Hassold where they may find some data). In my experience, differences in genetic background do play a very clear role in meiosis, e.g. in the timing of juvenile spermatogenesis, in the onset of puberty, in the kinetics of oocyte maturation, in the success of PBE, and in biophysical properties as seen in the stability of oocytes during experimental handling. In fact, the authors themselves indicate differences in reproduction by stating the low litter size of C57BL/6. Thus, I strongly advise carrying out at least a few key experiments using C57BL/6 control mice (which can very easily and cheaply be obtained from vendors; the authors have used C57BL/6 wt before - see their 2020 paper).</p><p>The answer to my question #5 is not really satisfactory. I asked specifically how the authors isolated the very small chromosomes from Stag3-/- spermatocytes, where the axes are almost non-existing. The authors refer to suppl. fig. 3, but that shows isolation from Rec8-/- spermatocytes, which still have nicely visible, well-formed, shortened axes. Suppl. fig. 4 shows this for Rad21l-/-. Why not show this for the Stag3-/-, which in this respect is the most critical and difficult, and specifically answer my question?</p><p>The overall criticism of the lack of conceptual novelty of the basic message of the paper and of very little if any insights into the mechanisms and factors determining the changes in chromosome stiffness remains.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="author-comment" id="sa3"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.97403.3.sa3</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Liu</surname><given-names>Ning</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/047426m28</institution-id><institution>University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign</institution></institution-wrap><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Urbana</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Qiang</surname><given-names>Wenan</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/000e0be47</institution-id><institution>Northwestern University</institution></institution-wrap><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Evanston</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Jordan</surname><given-names>Philip W</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Johns Hopkins University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Baltimore</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Marko</surname><given-names>John F</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/000e0be47</institution-id><institution>Northwestern University</institution></institution-wrap><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Evanston</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Qiao</surname><given-names>Huanyu</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/047426m28</institution-id><institution>University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign</institution></institution-wrap><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Urbana</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>By using the biophysical chromosome stretching, the authors measured the stiffness of chromosomes of mouse oocytes in meiosis I (MI) and meiosis II (MII).

Initially, we hypothesized that DNA damage or depletion of meiosis-specific cohesin might contribute to the observed increase in chromosome stiffness. However, our experimental finding did not support these hypotheses, indicating that neither DNA damage nor cohesion depletion is responsible for the stiffness increase. The molecular basis underlying the stage-related stiffness increase remains elusive and requires exploration in future studies. In the Discussion, we propose that factors such as condensin, nuclear proteins, and histone methylation may play a role in regulating meiotic chromosome stiffness. The involvement of these factors in stage-related chromosome stiffening requires future investigation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>This paper reports investigations of chromosome stiffness in oocytes and spermatocytes.

Ideally, we would have compared wild-type and cohesin-deleted mouse oocytes at the metaphase I (MI) stage. However, experimental constraints made this approach unfeasible: spermatocytes and oocytes from <italic>Rec8-/-</italic> and <italic>Stag3-/-</italic> mutant mice cannot reach MI stage, and <italic>Rad21l-/-</italic> mutant mice are sterile in males and subfertile in females, because cohesin proteins are crucial for germline cell development.</p><p>Additionally, collecting prophase I chromosomes from oocytes is exceptionally challenging and requires fetal mice as prophase I oocyte sources because female oocytes progress to the diplotene stage during fetal development. The process is further complicated by the difficulty of genotyping fetal mice, making the study of female prophase I impracticable. By contrast, spermatocytes are continuously generated in males throughout life, with meiotic stages readily identifiable, making them more accessible for analysis.</p><p>Our findings consistently showed increased chromosome stiffness in both prophase I spermatocytes and MI oocytes, suggesting that the phenomenon is not sex-specific.

To support this assertion, we have provided additional evidence in the revised manuscript demonstrating that this low concentration of Triton X-100 has a negligible effect on chromosome stiffness (Supplement Fig. 5, Right panel).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) Why did the authors use mouse strains of different genetic backgrounds, CD-1, and C57BL/6?

As our lab does not currently maintain C57BL/6 colony and given that this strain typically produces small litter sizes - which would have complicated the remainder of the study - we chose CD-1 mice as the control group and used C57BL/6 mice specifically for the cohesin study. To address potential concerns regarding genetic background differences, we compared our results with previously published data from C57BL/6 mice and found no significant differences (2710 ± 610 Pa versus 3670 ± 840 Pa, P = 0.4809) (Biggs et al., 2020).

Measuring chromosome stiffness can provide valuable insights into chromosome organization and function. Using a sophisticated micromanipulation system, Liu et al. analyzed chromosome stiffness in MI and MII oocytes. The authors found that chromosomes in MI oocytes were ten-fold stiffer than mitotic ones. The stiffness of chromosomes in MI mouse oocytes was significantly higher than that in MII oocytes. Furthermore, the knockout of the meiosis-specific cohesin component (Rec8, Stag3, Rad21l) did not affect meiotic chromosome stiffness. Interestingly, the authors showed that chromosomes from old MI oocytes had higher stiffness than those from young MI oocytes. The authors claimed this effect was not due to the accumulated DNA damage during the aging process because induced DNA damage reduced chromosome stiffness in oocytes.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>The technique used (isolating the chromosomes in meiosis and measuring their stiffness) is the authors' specialty. The results are intriguing and informative to the chromatin/chromosome and other related fields.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>(1) How intact the measured chromosomes were is unclear.</p></disp-quote><p>Currently, a well-calibrated chromosome mechanics experiment requires the extracellular isolation of chromosomes. In experiments conducted parallel to those in our previous study (Biggs et al., 2020), we obtained quantitatively consistent results, including measurements of the Young modulus for prophase I spermatocyte chromosomes. Our isolation approach is significantly gentler than bulk methods that rely on hypotonic buffer-driven cell lysis and centrifugation. If substantial chromosomal damage had occurred during isolation, we would expect greater variation between experiments, as different amounts or types of damage could influence the results.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) Some control data needs to be included.</p></disp-quote><p>We used wild-type prophase I spermatocytes and metaphase I (MI) oocytes as controls.

Although the structural preservation of the chromosomes is essential for this kind of measurement, the meiotic chromosomes were isolated in PBS with Triton X-100 and measured at room temperature.

Our findings indicate that neither PBS nor Triton X-100 caused significant changes in chromosome stiffness (Supplemental Fig. 5).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Recommendations For The Authors:</bold></p></disp-quote><p>Major points of Reviewers that the Editor indicated should be addressed</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(1) Reviewer's point 3, the effect of the high concentration of etoposide: It would be advisable to use lower concentrations of etoposide to observe the effect of DNA damage on chromosome stiffness more accurately.</p></disp-quote><p>The effect of etoposide on oocyte is dose-dependent (Collins et al., 2015). Oocytes are generally not highly sensitive to DNA damage, and even at relatively high concentrations, not all may exhibit a response. To ensure that sufficient DNA damage in the oocytes we isolated, we used relatively high concentration of etoposide for the experiment. This concentration (50 μg/ml) falls within the typical range reported in the literature (Marangos and Carroll, 2012)(Cai et al., 2023)(Lee et al., 2023). As the reviewer suggested, we tested two additional lower concentrations of etoposide (5 μg/ml and 25 μg/ml) (see Fig. 5 C). We did not observe any significant differences in chromosome stiffness in 5 µg/ml etoposide-treated oocytes compared to the control. However, higher concentrations of etoposide (25 μg/ml) significantly reduced oocyte chromosome stiffness compared to the control.</p><p>Revision to manuscript:</p><p>“Results at lower etoposide concentrations revealed that chromosome stiffness in untreated control oocytes was not significantly different from that in oocytes treated with 5 μg/ml etoposide (3780 ± 700 Pa versus 3930 ± 400 Pa, P = 0.8624). However, chromosome stiffness in untreated oocytes was significantly higher than that in oocytes treated with 25 μg/ml etoposide (3780 ± 700 Pa versus 1640 ± 340 Pa, P = 0.015) (Figure 5C).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) Reviewer's point 3, the effect of Triton X-100: This is related to the concern of the #3 reviewer. It is critical to check whether the detergent does not affect the stiffness indirectly or not.</p></disp-quote><p>To demonstrate that the low concentration of Triton X-100 does not influence chromosome stiffness, we conducted additional experiments. First, we isolated chromosomes and measured their stiffness. Then, we treated the chromosomes with 0.05% Triton X-100 via micro-spraying and remeasured the stiffness. The results showed no significant difference (see Supplement Fig. 5 right panel).</p><p>Revision to manuscript:</p><p>“In addition to past experiments indicating that mitotic chromosomes are stable for long periods after their isolation (Pope et al., 2006), we carried out control experiments on mouse oocyte chromosomes where we incubated them for 1 hour in PBS, or exposed them to a flow of Triton X-100 solution for 10 minutes; there was no change in chromosome stiffness in either case (Methods and Supplementary Fig. 5).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) Reviewer's point 1, the effect of the buffer composition: Please describe how the composition affects the stiffness of the chromosomes.</p></disp-quote><p>PBS is an economical and effective buffer solution that closely mimics the osmotic conditions of the cytoplasm, which is crucial for maintaining chromosomal structural integrity. Appropriate ion concentrations are crucial for preserving chromosome integrity, as imbalances—either too high or too low—can alter chromosome morphology (Poirier and Marko, 2002). When chromosomes are stored in PBS, their stiffness remains relatively stable, even with prolonged exposure, ensuring minimal changes to their physical properties. To confirm this, we isolated chromosomes and measured their stiffness. After one-hour incubation in PBS, we remeasured stiffness and observed no significant differences, which demonstrated that chromosomes remain stable in PBS (see Supplement Fig.5 left panel).</p><p>Revision to manuscript:</p><p>“In this study, we developed a new way to isolate meiotic chromosomes and measure their stiffness. However, one concern is that the measurements were conducted in PBS solution, which is different from the intracellular environment. To address this, we monitored chromosome stiffness overtime in PBS solution and found that it remained stable over a period of one hour (Supplement Fig. 5 Left panel).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>Major points:</p><p>(1) Previously, the role of condensin complexes in chromosome stiffness is shown (Sun et al. Chromosome Research, 2018). Thus, at least the authors described the condensin staining on MI and MII chromosomes.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added sentences in the discussion to elaborate on the role of condensin.</p><p>Revision to manuscript:</p><p>“Several factors, including condensin, have been found to affect chromosome stiffness (Sun et al., 2018). Condensin exists in two distinct complexes, condensin I and condensin II, and both are active during meiosis. Published studies indicate that condensin II is more sharply defined and more closely associated with the chromosome axis from anaphase I to metaphase II (Lee et al., 2011). Additionally, condensin II appears to play a more significant role in mitotic chromosome mechanics compared to condensin I (Sun et al., 2018). Thus, condensin II likely contributes more significantly to meiotic chromosome stiffness than condensin I.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) Although the authors nicely showed the difference in the stiffness between MI and MII chromosomes (Figure 2), as known, MI chromosomes are bivalent (with four chromatids) while MII chromosomes are univalent (with two chromatids). The physical property of the chromosomes would be affected by the number of chromatids. It would be essential for the authors to measure the physical properties of a univalent of MI chromosomes from mice defective in meiotic recombination such as Spo11 and/or Mlh3 KO mice.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer correctly pointed out that the number of chromatids in chromosomes differs between metaphase I (MI) and metaphase II (MII) stages. We have addressed this difference by calculating Young’s modulus (E), a mechanical property that describes the elasticity of a material, independent of its geometry. Young’s modulus describes the intrinsic properties of the material itself, rather than the specific characteristics of the object being tested. It is calculated as E=(F/A)/(∆L/L0), where F was the force given to stretch the chromosome, A was the cross-section area, ∆L was the length change of the chromosome, and L0 was the original length of the chromosome. While an increase in chromosome or chromatid numbers, results in a larger cross-sectional area, leading to a higher doubling force (F). This variation in chromosome number or cross-sectional area does not impact the calculation of chromosome stiffness/Young’s modulus (E). While study of the mutants suggested by the referee would certainly be interesting, it would be likely that the absence of these key recombination factors would impact chromosome stiffness in a more complex way than just changing their thickness; this type of study is beyond the scope of the present manuscript and is an exciting direction for future studies.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) In Figure 5, the authors measure the stiffness of etoposide-treated MI chromosomes. The concentration of the drug was 50 ug/ml, which is very high. The authors should analyze the different concentrations of the drug to check the chromosome stiffness. Moreover, etoposide is an inhibitor of Topoisomerase II. The effect of the drug might be caused by the defective Top2 activity, rather than Top2-adducts, thus DNA damage. It is very important to check the other Top2 inhibitors or DNA-damaging agents to generalize the effect of DNA damage on chromosome stiffness. Moreover, DNA damage induces the DNA damage response. It is important to check the effect of DDR inhibitors on the damage-induced change of stiffness.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer is correct in noting that etoposide can induce DNA damage and inhibit Top2 activity. To address this concern, our previous DNase experiment provided further clarity and supports our results of this study (Biggs et al., 2020). This experiment was conducted in vitro, where DNase treatment caused DNA damage on chromosomes without affecting Top2 activity or triggering DNA damage response. The results demonstrated that DNase treatment led to reduced chromosome stiffness, which aligns with the findings presented in our manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) In the same line as the #3 point, the authors also need to check the effect of etoposide on the stiffness of mitotic chromosomes from MEF.</p></disp-quote><p>Experiments on MEF mitotic chromosomes were designed to serve as a reference for the meiotic chromosome studies. The etoposide experiments on meiotic chromosomes specifically aimed to investigate how DNA damage affects meiotic chromosome structure. While it would be interesting to explore the effects of etoposide-induced DNA damage on mitotic chromosomes, it represents a distinct research question that falls outside the scope of the current study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Minor points:</p><p>(1) Line 141-142: Previous studies by the author analyzed the stiffness of mitotic chromosomes from pro-metaphase. Which stage of cell cycles did the authors analyze here?</p></disp-quote><p>To ensure consistency in our experiments, we also measured the stiffness of mitotic chromosomes at the prometaphase stage. The precise stage used is very near to metaphase, at the very end of the prometaphase stage. We have modified the manuscript to clarify this point.</p><p>Revision to manuscript:</p><p>“For comparison with the meiotic case, we measured the chromosome stiffness of Mouse Embryonic Fibroblasts (MEFs) at late pro-metaphase (just slightly before their attachment to the mitotic spindle) and found that the average Young’s modulus was 340 ± 80 Pa (Figure 2B). The value is consistent with our previously published data, where the modulus for MEFs was measured to be 370 ± 70 Pa (Biggs et al., 2020).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) Line 157: Here, the doubling force of MI (and MII) oocytes should be described in addition to those of spermatocytes.</p></disp-quote><p>The purpose of this paragraph is to demonstrate the reproductivity and consistency of our experiments. In this section, we compared our data with previously published findings. Published data do not include chromosome stiffness measurement from MI mouse oocytes. Our experiment is the first to assess this. Therefore, we did not include MI mouse oocytes in that comparison. To clarify this, we have added sentences to highlight the comparison of doubling force.</p><p>Revision to manuscript:</p><p>“Here, we found that the doubling forces of chromosomes from MI and MII oocytes are 3770 ± 940 pN and 510 ± 50 pN, respectively. We conclude that chromosomes from MI oocytes are much stiffer than those from both mitotic cells and MII oocytes (Supplement Fig. 2), in terms of either Young’s modulus or doubling force.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) Line 202: What stage of prophase I do the authors mean by the spermatocyte stage here? Diakinesis, Metaphase I or prometaphase I? I am not sure how the authors can determine a specific stage of prophase I by only looking at the thickness of the chromosomes.

Since <italic>Rec8-/-</italic> spermatocytes cannot progress beyond the pachytene stage of prophase I, the isolated chromosomes must be in prophase I rather than diakinesis, metaphase I, prometaphase I, or any later stages (Xu et al., 2005). Based on the cell size and degree of chromosome condensation (Biggs et al., 2020), it is most likely that the measured chromosomes are at the zygotene-like stage. However, as we cannot definitively determine the exact substage of prophase I, thus, we have referred to them simply as prophase I.</p><p>Revision to manuscript:</p><p>“We isolated chromosomes from <italic>Rec8-/-</italic> prophase I spermatocytes, which displayed large and round cell size and thick chromosomal threads, indicative of advanced chromosome compaction after stalling at a zygotene-like prophase I stage (Supplement Fig. 3). The combination of large cell size and degree of chromosome compaction allowed us to reliably identify <italic>Rec8-/-</italic> prophase I chromosomes.
