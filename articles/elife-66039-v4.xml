networks in deep brain regions, which are experimentally challenging to study.

We identified new CX neuron types, novel sensory and motor pathways, and network motifs that likely enable the CX to extract the fly’s head direction, maintain it with attractor dynamics, and combine it with other sensorimotor information to perform vector-based navigational computations. We also identified numerous pathways that may facilitate the selection of CX-driven behavioral patterns by context and internal state. The CX connectome provides a comprehensive blueprint necessary for a detailed understanding of network dynamics underlying sleep, flexible navigation, and state-dependent action selection.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>central complex</kwd><kwd>connectome</kwd><kwd>navigation</kwd><kwd>sleep</kwd><kwd>sensorimotor</kwd><kwd>insect</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hulse</surname><given-names>Brad K</given-names></name><name><surname>Haberkern</surname><given-names>Hannah</given-names></name><name><surname>Franconville</surname><given-names>Romain</given-names></name><name><surname>Turner-Evans</surname><given-names>Daniel</given-names></name><name><surname>Takemura</surname><given-names>Shin-ya</given-names></name><name><surname>Wolff</surname><given-names>Tanya</given-names></name><name><surname>Noorman</surname><given-names>Marcella</given-names></name><name><surname>Dreher</surname><given-names>Marisa</given-names></name><name><surname>Dan</surname><given-names>Chuntao</given-names></name><name><surname>Parekh</surname><given-names>Ruchi</given-names></name><name><surname>Hermundstad</surname><given-names>Ann M</given-names></name><name><surname>Rubin</surname><given-names>Gerald M</given-names></name><name><surname>Jayaraman</surname><given-names>Vivek</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>An analysis of the first complete synaptic resolution connectome of <italic>Drosophila</italic>'s navigation circuit uncovers neural network motifs supporting broadly relevant sensorimotor computations.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Flexible, goal-oriented behavior requires combining diverse streams of sensory and internal state information from the present with knowledge gathered from the past to determine context-appropriate patterns of actions into the future. This presents the nervous system with several challenges. For many animals, selecting actions based on sensory input requires the dynamical transformation of information from sensors on one body part into a reference frame suitable for the activation of muscles on another (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Buneo et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib166">Huston and Jayaraman, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib165">Huston and Krapp, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib280">Pouget et al., 2002</xref>). When integrating information from different sensors, the brain must also resolve any conflicts that arise between different cues. Further, maintaining goal-oriented behavioral programs over long timescales requires the brain to ignore transient sensory distractions and to compensate for fluctuations in the quality of sensory information or perhaps even its temporary unavailability. Brains are thought to solve such complex computational challenges by relying not just on direct sensory to motor transformations, but also on abstract internal representations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib236">Moser et al., 2008</xref>). Abstract representations are useful not just in animal brains, but also in artificial agents trained to solve challenging navigational tasks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Banino et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Cueva and Wei, 2018</xref>). In the brain, representations that persist in the absence of direct sensory input are thought to rely on attractor dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib195">Knierim and Zhang, 2012</xref>), which are typically generated by recurrent neural circuits in deep brain regions rather than just those at the sensory and motor periphery. A major challenge in understanding the dynamics and function of deep brain circuits is that—in contrast to early sensory circuits—their inputs and outputs are usually difficult to identify and characterize. Further, the attractor dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib195">Knierim and Zhang, 2012</xref>) and vector computations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Bicanski and Burgess, 2020</xref>) that characterize circuits involved in flexible navigation are thought to rely on structured connectivity between large populations of neurons. This connectivity is difficult to determine, at least in large-brained animals. Insects, with their identified neurons and smaller brains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib120">Haberkern and Jayaraman, 2016</xref>), present an excellent opportunity to obtain a detailed understanding of how neural circuits generate behavior that unfolds flexibly and over longer timescales.</p><p>Insects maintain a specific pattern of action selection over many minutes and even hours during behaviors like foraging or migration, and maintain a prolonged state of inaction during quiet wakefulness or sleep (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib143">Hendricks et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib317">Shaw et al., 2000</xref>). Both types of behaviors are initiated and modulated based on environmental conditions (e.g., humidity, heat, and the availability of food) and an insect’s internal needs (e.g., sleep drive and nutritive state) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib117">Griffith, 2013</xref>). The context-dependent initiation and control of many such behaviors is thought to depend on a conserved insect brain region called the central complex (CX) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib141">Helfrich-Forster, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib273">Pfeiffer and Homberg, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib334">Strauss, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib363">Turner-Evans and Jayaraman, 2016</xref>). In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, this highly recurrent central brain region, which is composed of ~3000 identified neurons, enables flies to modulate their locomotor activity by time of day (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib208">Liang et al., 2019</xref>), maintain an arbitrary heading when flying (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">Giraldo et al., 2018</xref>) and walking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib116">Green et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib365">Turner-Evans et al., 2020</xref>), form short- and long-term visual memories that aid in spatial navigation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib200">Kuntz et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib212">Liu et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib250">Neuser et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib253">Ofstad et al., 2011</xref>), use internal models of their body size when performing motor tasks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib198">Krause et al., 2019</xref>), track sleep need and induce sleep (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Donlea et al., 2018</xref>), and consolidate memories during sleep (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Dag et al., 2019</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>The central complex (CX) and accessory brain regions.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The portion of the central brain (aquamarine) that was imaged and reconstructed to generate the hemibrain volume (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib306">Scheffer et al., 2020</xref>) is superimposed on a frontal view of a grayscale representation of the entire <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> brain (JRC 2018 unisex template [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Bogovic et al., 2020</xref>]).

Neural activity in the region has been linked to sensory maps and directed actions using electrophysiology in a variety of different insects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">el Jundi et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib118">Guo and Ritzmann, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib131">Heinze and Homberg, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib135">Heinze and Reppert, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib326">Stone et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib371">Varga and Ritzmann, 2016</xref>). In the fly, CX neurons have been shown to track the insect’s angular orientation during navigation in environments with directional sensory cues and also in their absence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Fisher et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib114">Green et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib193">Kim et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib256">Okubo et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib312">Seelig and Jayaraman, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib364">Turner-Evans et al., 2017</xref>). Many computational models have been proposed to explain how the CX generates such activity patterns during navigation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Arena et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Cope et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib181">Kakaria and de Bivort, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib190">Kim and Dickinson, 2017a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib193">Kim et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib326">Stone et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib337">Su et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib364">Turner-Evans et al., 2017</xref>). However, a key untested assumption in most computational and conceptual models of CX function is the connectivity of CX circuits. Connectivity and circuit structure, in turn, can inspire models of function.</p><p>Although the anatomy of the CX (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–E</xref>) and the morphology of its neurons have been examined in a wide variety of insects using light-level microscopy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">el Jundi et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib124">Hanesch et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib136">Heinze et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib132">Heinze and Homberg, 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib134">Heinze and Homberg, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib155">Homberg, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib210">Lin et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib258">Omoto et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib273">Pfeiffer and Homberg, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib329">Strausfeld, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib389">Williams, 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib391">Wolff et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib392">Wolff and Rubin, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib405">Young and Armstrong, 2010b</xref>), the synaptic connectivity of CX neurons has mainly been estimated indirectly from the light-level overlap of the bouton-like processes of one neuron and the spine-like processes of another. GFP-reconstitution-across-synaptic-partners (GRASP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib397">Xie et al., 2017</xref>) and trans-Tango (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib258">Omoto et al., 2018</xref>), methods that are limited in accuracy and reliability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib204">Lee et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib347">Talay et al., 2017</xref>), have also been used to infer synaptic connectivity in the fly CX. Optogenetic stimulation of one candidate neural population and two-photon imaging of the calcium responses of another (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Franconville et al., 2018</xref>) has allowed estimations of coarse functional connectivity within the CX, but this technique currently lacks the throughput to comprehensively determine connectivity at the single-neuron (rather than neuron-type) level, and cannot easily discriminate direct from indirect synaptic connectivity. There have also been efforts to characterize synaptic structure in the CX and associated regions with electron microscopy (EM) in the bee and locust (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib140">Held et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib157">Homberg and Muller, 2016</xref>), and a combination of coarse-scale and synaptic-resolution EM has been used to infer connectivity in the sweat bee (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib326">Stone et al., 2017</xref>). Most recently, the reconstruction of a small set of CX neurons within a whole-brain volume acquired using transmission electron microscopy (TEM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib410">Zheng et al., 2018</xref>) was used to examine the relationship between circuit structure and function in the head direction system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib365">Turner-Evans et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>Here we analyzed the arborizations and connectivity of the ~3000 CX neurons in version 1.1 of the ‘hemibrain’ connectome—a dataset with 25,000 semiautomatically reconstructed neurons and 20 million synapses from the central brain of a 5-day-old female fly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib306">Scheffer et al., 2020</xref>)(see Materials and methods). For most of the analyses, interpretations, and hypotheses in this article, we built on a large and foundational body of anatomical and functional work on the CX in a wide variety of insects. We could link data from different experiment types and insects because many CX neuron types are identifiable across individuals, and sometimes even across species. Thus, it was possible to map results from a large number of CX physiology and behavioral genetics experiments to specific neuron types in the hemibrain connectome.</p><p>Not all parts of the dataset have been manually proofread to the same level of completeness (measured as the percentage of synapses associated with neural fragments that are connected to identified cell bodies). In the CX, some substructures were proofread more densely and to a higher level of completion than the others. Comparing the connectivity maps obtained after different extents of proofreading indicated that synaptic connectivity ratios between CX neuron types were largely unchanged by proofreading beyond the level applied to the full CX. This validation step reassured us that our analyses and conclusions were not significantly compromised by the incompleteness of the connectome.</p><p>We analyzed the connectome throughout the CX and its accessory regions. We also identified pathways external to the CX that bring sensory input to the region and others that likely carry motor signals out. Further, we discovered multiple levels of recurrence within and across CX structures through pathways both internal and external to the CX. Overall, we found that neural connectivity in the fly’s central brain is highly structured. We were able to extract circuit motifs from these patterns of connectivity, which, in turn, allowed us to hypothesize links between circuit structure and function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>High-level schematic and an example sensorimotor pathway through the central complex (CX).</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The CX integrates information from multiple sensory modalities to track the fly’s internal drives and its orientation in its surroundings, enabling the fly to generate flexible, directed behavior, while also modulating its internal state.

Neurons within each pathway make all-to-all synaptic connections with other neurons of their type and contact ‘compass neurons’ known to represent the fly’s head direction, creating a potential neural substrate within the EB for extracting orientation information from a variety of environmental cues.</p><p>The compass neurons are part of a recurrent subnetwork with a topological and dynamical resemblance to theorized network structures called ring attractors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Ben-Yishai et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib322">Skaggs et al., 1995</xref>) that have been hypothesized to compute head direction in the mammalian brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib163">Hulse and Jayaraman, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib192">Kim et al., 2017c</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib364">Turner-Evans et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib365">Turner-Evans et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib396">Xie et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib407">Zhang, 1996</xref>). A key connection in the subnetwork is from the compass neurons to a population of interneurons in a handlebar-shaped structure called the protocerebral bridge (PB; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). The synaptic connectivity profile of the interneurons suggests that they ensure that the head direction representation is maintained in a sinusoidal ‘bump’ of population activity before it is transferred to multiple types of so-called ‘columnar’ neurons. In addition to receiving head direction information, many of these columnar neurons likely also receive input related to the fly’s self-motion in paired structures known as the noduli (NO; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Currier et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib217">Lu et al., 2020b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib218">Lyu et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib326">Stone et al., 2017</xref>). The NO input may independently tune the amplitude of sinusoidal activity bumps in the left and right halves of the PB. Some classes of columnar neurons project from the PB back to the EB, while others project to localized areas within a coarsely multilayered and multicolumnar structure called the fan-shaped body (FB; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). The loosely defined layers and columns of the FB form a rough, two-dimensional grid. FB columnar neurons convey activity bumps from the left and right halves of the PB to the FB. The PB-FB projection patterns of these neurons suggest that their activity bumps in the FB have neuron type-specific phase shifts relative to each other, similar to those observed between EB columnar neurons that are thought to update the head direction representation in the EB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib114">Green et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib364">Turner-Evans et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib365">Turner-Evans et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>Each FB columnar neuron type contacts multiple FB interneuron types, each of whose individual neurons collectively tile the width of the FB. These interneurons have neuronal morphologies that are either ‘vertical,’ in that they connect different layers within an FB column, or ‘horizontal,’ in that they extend arbors across intervening columns. These columnar gaps between synaptic connections made by each horizontal interneuron can be interpreted as phase jumps in the context of activity bumps in the FB. The many FB interneuron types form a densely recurrent network with repeating connectivity motifs and phase shifts. Taken together with the self-motion and sinusoidal head direction input that many FB columnar neurons are known to receive in other structures, these motifs and phase shifts seem ideal to perform coordinate transformations necessary for a variety of vector-based navigational computations. The FB interneurons also provide the major input to canonical CX output types. The phase shifts of the output columnar types between the PB and the FB are well suited to generate goal-directed motor commands based on the fly’s current heading (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib326">Stone et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>In addition to the columnar neurons and interneurons, the FB receives layer-specific synaptic inputs from multiple regions, including the superior medial protocerebrum (SMP). Some of these inputs link the FB to a brain region called the mushroom body (MB), which is involved in associative memory and is the subject of a companion manuscript (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib207">Li et al., 2020</xref>). These layer-specific inputs reinforce an existing view of the FB as a center for context-dependent navigational control, a structure that enables different behavioral modules to be switched on and off depending on internal state and external context. The architecture and connectivity of the FB suggest that the region may provide a sophisticated, genetically defined framework for flexible behavior in the fly.</p><p>Previous studies have established a role for both the dorsal FB (dFB) and the EB in tracking sleep need and controlling sleep-wake states (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Donlea, 2019</xref>). Our analysis of these circuits suggests that there are more putative sleep-promoting neuron types in the dFB than previously reported, many of which form reciprocal connections with wake-promoting dopaminergic neurons (DANs). Furthermore, these dFB neuron types have numerous inputs and outputs, and form bidirectional connections to sleep circuits in the EB. Our results highlight novel neuron types and pathways whose potential involvement in sleep-wake control requires functional investigation. Finally, we identified multiple novel output pathways from both the EB and ventral and dorsal layers of the FB to the lateral accessory lobe (LAL), SMP, crepine (CRE), and posterior slope (PS) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). These regions themselves host networks that project to many brain areas and neuron types that ultimately feed descending neurons (DNs). DNs project to motor centers in the ventral nerve cord (VNC), allowing the CX to exert a wide-ranging influence on behavior, likely well beyond the navigational and orienting behaviors most often associated with the CX. Indeed, the regions that are targeted by the output pathways are associated not just with sensory-guided navigation, but with innate behaviors like feeding and oviposition and with associatively learned behaviors. Another remarkable feature of the CX’s output pathways is the large number of collaterals that feed back into the CX at each stage. Such loops could implement various motor control functions, from simple gain adaptation to more complex forms of forward models.</p><p>In summary, our analysis revealed remarkable patterning in the connections made by the hundreds of neuron types that innervate different structures of the CX. In the ‘Results’ section, we describe this patterned connectivity in some detail. In the ‘Discussion’ section, we synthesize these findings and explore what this patterned circuit structure may imply about function, specifically in the context of vector-based navigation and action selection. Although many readers may prefer to jump directly to the ‘Results’ section that discusses neuron types, circuits, and brain regions related to their particular research focus, we recommend that the general reader identify the ‘Results’ section that most interest them by first reading the ‘Discussion’ section.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>In contrast to many previous EM-based circuit reconstruction efforts, which have relied on sparse, manual tracing of neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Eichler et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib142">Helmstaedter et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib365">Turner-Evans et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib410">Zheng et al., 2018</xref>), the hemibrain connectome was generated using a combination of automatic, machine learning-based reconstruction techniques (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib173">Januszewski et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib206">Li et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib306">Scheffer et al., 2020</xref>) and manual proofreading (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib306">Scheffer et al., 2020</xref>). This semiautomatic process allowed us to reconstruct a large fraction of most neurons that project to the CX. This, as we explain below, aided our efforts to classify and name CX neurons. Of course, a complete CX connectome would contain the complete reconstruction of all neurons with processes in the CX, the detection of all their chemical and electrical synapses, and an identification of all pre- and postsynaptic partners at each of those synapses. The resolution of the techniques used to generate the FIBSEM connectome did not permit the detection of gap junctions. Nor does the connectome reveal neuromodulatory connections mediated by neuropeptides, which are known to be prevalent in the CX (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib179">Kahsai and Winther, 2011</xref>), although rapid progress in machine learning methods may soon make this possible (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Eckstein et al., 2020</xref>). Glial cells, which perform important roles in neural circuit function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Allen and Lyons, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Bittern et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">De Pittà and Berry, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib219">Ma et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib238">Mu et al., 2019</xref>), were not segmented. In addition, although the hemibrain volume contains the core structures of the CX—the entire PB, EB, and FB, and both the right and left NO and asymmetrical body (AB) (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref> for a hierarchy of the named CX brain regions in the volume)—it does not include all brain structures that are connected to the CX. Specifically, for many brain structures associated with the CX that are further from the midline, the hemibrain volume only contains complete structures within the right hemisphere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib306">Scheffer et al., 2020</xref>). Thus, the hemibrain does not contain most of the LAL, CRE, wedge (WED), vest (VES), gall (GA), and bulb (BU) from the left hemisphere, and CX neurons whose arbors extend into these excluded brain structures are necessarily cut off at the borders of the hemibrain volume (their status is indicated in the connectome database, see Materials and methods). Even for structures within the right hemisphere, such as the LAL, CRE, and PS, some neural processes that connect these structures to each other were not captured in the volume, sometimes making it impossible to assign the orphaned arbors to known neurons. Nevertheless, we were able to identify the vast majority of CX neurons and many neurons in accessory regions as well.</p><table-wrap id="table1" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title>Brain regions of the central complex contained and defined in the hemibrain.</title><p>The regions are hierarchical, with the more indented regions forming subsets of the less indented.

using data from light microscopy (LM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib124">Hanesch et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib210">Lin et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr"

rid="bib405">Young and Armstrong, 2010b</xref>). Light-level data, often acquired from GAL4 lines that genetically target small numbers of neuron types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib174">Jenett et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib249">Nern et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib272">Pfeiffer et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib391">Wolff et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib392">Wolff and Rubin, 2018</xref>), reveal neuronal morphology in sufficient detail to classify neurons into types and subtypes. However, only neurons targeted by existing genetic lines can be identified through light-level data, and morphologically similar neuron types can be hard to distinguish. For example, the PEN1 and PEN2 types (now called PEN_a and PEN_b; see Materials and methods), which seem identical at the light level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib391">Wolff et al., 2015</xref>), were initially differentiated by their functional properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib114">Green et al., 2017</xref>). The hemibrain dataset provides much higher resolution maps of CX neurons than light-level data and enables a distinction to be drawn based on connectivity between neuron types that are morphologically identical in light-level samples. EM reconstructions confirm that PEN_a and PEN_b neurons are indeed strikingly different in their synaptic connectivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib306">Scheffer et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib365">Turner-Evans et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>However, LM data offer far greater numbers of neurons per neuron type across different brains. To date, just this one fly CX has been densely reconstructed and analyzed at synaptic resolution with EM. Thus, for neuron types that are represented by just one neuron per hemibrain, at best two fully traced neurons are available for analysis (one per side), and only one if the arbor of the second extends outside the hemibrain volume. The inherent variability of individual neurons of a single type is not yet clear; for example, the LCNO neurons discussed in the NO section are known from LM to arborize in the CRE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib392">Wolff and Rubin, 2018</xref>), but do not arborize in the region in this sample. It is possible that arbors in some neuropils exhibit a greater degree of variability than other neuron types; for example, the number and length of branches in a larger neuropil such as the LAL could be less tightly regulated than in a small neuropil, leading to greater variability in morphology and perhaps also in synaptic connections with upstream or downstream partners in that neuropil. Notably, the hemibrain dataset does not contain the previously identified ‘canal’ cell, an EB-PB columnar neuron type (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib392">Wolff and Rubin, 2018</xref>). The absence of this neuron type may be a developmental anomaly of the particular fly that was imaged for the hemibrain dataset or may hint at broader developmental differences across different wild-type and Gal4 lines.</p><p>The full spectrum of the morphology of a neuron type will likely not be verified until multiple single neurons are analyzed in a split-GAL4 line known to target just that one neuron type or until multiple brains are analyzed at EM resolution. In the meantime, EM and LM datasets contribute both partially overlapping as well as unique anatomical insights useful for classifying and naming neurons. Both datasets were therefore used to assign names to previously undescribed neurons of the CX, the overwhelming majority of which are FB neurons (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Tables 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3">3</xref> for all new CX neuron types, with numbers for each type, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref> for the positions of those new types in known FB fiber tracts; see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4">Table 4</xref> for numbers of different EB, PB, and NO neuron types). All CX neurons have been given two names, a short name that is convenient for searching databases and that is used as a shorthand abbreviation throughout this article, and a longer name that provides sufficient anatomical insight to capture the overall morphology of the neuron. The long anatomical names have their roots in both the EM and LM datasets, emphasize overall morphology, and attempt to define neuron types based on features that we anticipate can be distinguished at the light level, ultimately in split-GAL4 lines (see details in Materials and methods). The short names are derived primarily from hemibrain connectivity information. Our overall method for connectivity-based neuron-type classification of CX neurons was described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib306">Scheffer et al., 2020</xref>, but see Materials and methods for a short summary. Finally, to facilitate comparisons with neurons of other insect species, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref> provides the median diameter of the main neurite for each CX neuron type in the dataset.</p><table-wrap id="table2" position="float"><label>Table 2.</label><caption><title>Identified fan-shaped body (FB) tangential neuron types and the number of each

connectome</title><p>The manual proofreading procedure we used is labor-intensive and time-consuming. For this reason, it was not performed to the same extent on the entire connectome. For example, completeness within the core CX structures is generally higher than completeness within CX-associated regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib306">Scheffer et al., 2020</xref>), and completeness also differed for different CX regions. We therefore performed a series of validation analyses to examine how such differences in completeness might affect estimates of connectivity. In particular, we examined how connectivity estimates might be affected by the percentage of synapses that are assigned to known neuronal bodies rather than to unidentified neural fragments (partially reconstructed neural processes) within a given region. This analysis was performed both on the EB, comparing two different stages in the proofreading process, and in the PB and FB, comparing symmetric regions proofread to different levels of completion.</p><sec id="s2-2-1"><title>Neuron-to-neuron connectivity before and after dense proofreading for the same neurons</title><p>To assess how sensitive connectivity estimates are to the completeness level of the tracing, we compared both the pre- and postsynaptic connectivity of a selection of neurons (see Materials and methods) arborizing in a specific brain structure, the EB, before and after it was subjected to focused proofreading (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>).

This process then sends branches out into multiple brain structures or substructures. Although there is sometimes one compartment with mainly postsynaptic specializations, the other compartments are typically ‘mixed,’ featuring both pre- and postsynaptic specializations. This heterogeneity and compartmentalization make it challenging to compare the relative weight of different synaptic inputs to the neuron’s synaptic output. Even for fly neurons that spike, action potential initiation sites are largely unknown (although see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib113">Gouwens and Wilson, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib287">Ravenscroft et al., 2020</xref>). Furthermore, spiking neurons may perform local circuit computations involving synaptic transmission without action potentials.</p><p>In this study, we will, as a default, analyze the relative contributions of different presynaptic neurons separately for different neuropils. In some cases, we will assume a polarity for neurons based on compartments in which they are mainly postsynaptic. For spiking neurons, these ‘dendritic’ areas would be expected to play a more significant role in determining the neuron’s response, even if the neuron displays mixed pre- and postsynaptic specializations in other compartments. Consider, for example, this rule applied to a much-studied olfactory neuron, the projection neuron (PN). PNs receive most of their inputs in the antennal lobe (AL) and project to regions like the MB and lateral horn (LH), where they have mixed terminals. Our rule would lead to the AL inputs being evaluated separately and being considered stronger contributors to a PN’s spiking outputs than any synaptic inputs in the MB and LH. As discussed further in a subsequent section, we will use this logic to define the ‘modality’ of most ring neurons, which innervate the BU and EB, by the anterior optic tubercle (AOTU) input they receive in the BU rather than by the inputs they receive in the EB. This logic also applies to the tangential neurons of the FB, which receive inputs mainly in regions outside the CX and have mixed terminals inside the FB. Note that some CX neuron types may not rely on spiking at all, and that our assumptions may not apply to such graded potential neurons. The situation is also somewhat different for some interneuron types, such as the PB-intrinsic Δ7 neurons, which have multiple arbors with postsynaptic specializations.</p><p>CX synapses are not all of the ‘T-bar’ type that is most common in the insect brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Frohlich, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib228">Meinertzhagen, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib362">Trujillo-Cenoz, 1969</xref>). As discussed later, several CX neurons make ‘E-bar’ synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib316">Shaw and Meinertzhagen, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib345">Takemura et al., 2017a</xref>), which we do not treat any differently in analysis. In addition, although many synapses are polyadic, with a single presynaptic neuron contacting multiple postsynaptic partners (Materials and methods, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), it is notable that some neurons, such as ring neurons, make rarer convergent synapses in which multiple presynaptic ring neurons contact a single postsynaptic partner (Materials and methods, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib224">Martin-Pena et al., 2014</xref>).

While there is overlap between the regions that provide input to different CX neuropils, each CX neuropil has a distinct set of input regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). For instance, the EB receives input primarily from the BU, LAL and GA, and to a lesser extent from the CRE, the inferior bridge (IB), and the superior neuropils. The NO also receives inputs from the LAL, GA, and CRE, but gets additional inputs from the wedge (WED), epaulette (EPA), and vest (VES). To assess the information transmitted to the CX by different input pathways, we traced, when possible, these pathways back to their origin or ‘source.’ These source neurons were grouped into classes associated with particular brain regions, functions, or neuromodulators (legend in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>; also see Appendix 1—table 6 in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib306">Scheffer et al., 2020</xref>). We found that the CX receives inputs originating from a variety of neuron types, including visual projection neurons (vPNs), AL neurons, fruitless (Fru) neurons, MBON neurons, and neuromodulatory neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). Although the hemibrain volume did not permit us to trace pathways completely from the sensory periphery all the way into the CX, we tried to identify as many inputs as possible using previous results from light microscopy as our guide. We will begin by describing components of a prominent pathway from the fly’s eyes to the EB. We will then trace a possible pathway for mechanosensory input to enter the CX and describe how sensory information is integrated in the EB.

Nearly every neuron type that receives most of its input in the BU has presynaptic specializations within one or more core CX structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). The majority of cells in the BU are part of the anterior visual pathway. This pathway includes the TuBu neurons and their postsynaptic partners, the ring neurons (ER), which bring visual information to the EB (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table5">Table 5</xref>). Most neurons innervating the BU (e.g., the TuBu neuron types and the ring neurons [except ER6]) have spatially restricted, glomerular arborizations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib357">Trager et al., 2008</xref>). Other neuron types arborize widely within the structure, such as the AOTU046 and extrinsic ring (ExR) neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). A recent study combining lineage-based anatomy and functional imaging has suggested that the BU may be organized into zones with similarly tuned TuBu neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib257">Omoto et al., 2017</xref>). We used synapse locations of different types of TuBu neurons and their downstream partners, the ring neurons, to partition the BU into different zones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B and C</xref>), each with numerous microglomeruli where TuBu neurons make synapses onto ring neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib357">Trager et al., 2008</xref>). Each microglomerulus is formed by small arbors of up to five TuBu neurons from one type and their downstream ring neuron partners (see below and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1A and B</xref>). Consistent with the functional and anatomical segregation suggested by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib257">Omoto et al., 2017</xref>, TuBu neurons originating from different parts of the AOTU do indeed segregate into different zones within the BU (superior, inferior, and anterior BU, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7Ci</xref>), with MC61-fed TuBu neurons innervating the superior BU and MC64-fed TuBu neurons targeting the inferior BU (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). The only exception is the polarization-tuned TuBu01, which arborizes in its own compartment, the anterior BU (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7Ci</xref>).

Glomeruli in the superior BU tend to be smaller and more defined than glomeruli in the inferior BU. Except for ER6, an atypical ring neuron, ring neurons that receive their input in the BU also send their dendrites into a single zone of the BU, thereby maintaining some separation of visual pathways from the AOTU (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7Cii</xref>).</p><table-wrap id="table5" position="float"><label>Table 5.</label><caption><title>Known properties of ring neuron classes.</title><p>LAL: lateral accessory lobe;

However, some TuBu types feed multiple ring neuron types, for example, most TuBu02 neurons project to both ER3a_a and ER3a_d ring neurons, and also to ER3m ring neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>). Although the segregation of TuBu types is largely maintained at the type-to-type level, there is significant mixing at the level of individual TuBu to ring neuron connections. Most TuBu neurons feed several ring neurons of a given type, but the level of divergence varies between TuBu types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1B</xref>). TuBu02 neurons, for example, make synapses onto multiple ER3a_a, ER3a_d and ER3m neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1B</xref>). There is also significant convergence, with many ring neurons receiving inputs from multiple TuBu neurons of the same type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1A</xref>).</p><p>A particularly strong contrast can be observed between the mapping of TuBu01 to ER4m, which is strictly one-to-one, preserving receptive fields (but not polarotopy; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib125">Hardcastle et al., 2020</xref>), and TuBu06 to ER5, where multiple TuBu06 neurons contact a single ER5 neuron and single TuBu06 neurons project to multiple ER5 neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D and E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1B</xref> and C). This is noteworthy as TuBu01 and TuBu06 receive input in the same region of the AOTU, but their downstream partners, ER4m and ER5 neurons, are known to have different functions. ER4m is tuned to polarized light (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib125">Hardcastle et al., 2020</xref>) and is likely involved in visual orientation, whereas ER5 neurons are involved in sleep (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib214">Liu et al., 2016</xref>). Both will be discussed in more detail in later sections.</p><p>Overall, this combination of divergence from individual TuBu neurons to multiple ring neurons and convergence from multiple TuBu neurons to individual ring neurons strongly suggests that we should expect receptive fields in the anterior visual pathway to expand, and sensory tuning to potentially become more complex from TuBu to ring neurons. Finally, it is important to note that there are several neuron types with wide arborizations within the BU that likely also influence processing in the structure. These include a subset of ExR neuron types (ExR1, ExR2, ExR3, and ExR5) and the AOTU046 neurons, which are discussed below.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4-3"><title>The anterior visual pathway: contralateral influences</title><p>Thus far, we have characterized the anterior visual pathway as a largely feedforward pathway of neurons with spatially localized arbors projecting from the early visual system to the AOTU and on to the BU.

The interhemispheric TuTuB_a neurons connect the right and left AOTU (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8Ai</xref>). These neurons pool medullary input from the visual field of one hemisphere and synapse onto a subset of TuBu neurons on the contralateral side. Note that at least one of these TuTuB neurons is known to be tuned to polarized light e-vector orientation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib125">Hardcastle et al., 2020</xref>). The interhemispheric AOTU046 neurons receive input from multiple brain regions including both AOTUs, the BU (although they primarily send outputs there), the FB, and the ipsilateral (to their soma) IB and superior posterior slope (SPS) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8Aii,Ci, Di, and E</xref>). AOTU046 and TuTu neurons are well positioned to mediate contralateral inhibition since both neuron types receive input from large areas of the contralateral AOTU (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>). Indeed, AOTU046 targets ring neuron types in the BU that show strong signatures of contralateral inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib339">Sun et al., 2017</xref>). Curiously, AOTU046 provides input to TuBu neurons in both the AOTU and BU, targeting somewhat different subsets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1A</xref>).</p><p>We did not find any obvious candidates that could provide TuBu neurons of the inferior BU with small-object-sized receptive fields in the contralateral hemisphere as has recently been suggested for a subset of these neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib257">Omoto et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib318">Shiozaki and Kazama, 2017</xref>). Based on the connectome, one possibility is that these reported responses were not caused by small-field feature detectors related to the AOTU or BU, but rather by input from the ExR3 neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8Aiii and Dii</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1B</xref>). The ExR3 neurons receive synaptic input from a variety of neurons in areas that are known to respond to optic flow and the fly’s own movements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8F</xref>, note that inputs are mixed with outputs; see also later section on ExR neurons), both of which may have contributed to the reported response properties. A second possibility is that these responses were observed in the subset of ring neurons that form glomeruli in the BU, but also receive additional inputs in the LAL (ER3a_a and ER3a_d, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10s5">Figure 10—figure supplement 5</xref>). Finally, contralateral visual information may also reach these neurons from inter-medullary connections, a possibility that we could not investigate in the hemibrain dataset.</p><p>The widely arborizing neurons – ExR1, ExR2, ExR3, ExR5, and AOTU046 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>) – have somewhat overlapping arbors in the BU (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D</xref>) but are selectively interconnected in the region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>). The bilaterally projecting AOTU046 neurons receive ipsilateral inputs from ExR2 and ExR5 neurons and contralateral input from the ExR3 neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>, the right AOTU046 receives input from ExR2 and ExR5, the left one from ExR3), and then provide input to ExR1 neurons in the same hemisphere (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>).

The connectome allowed us to identify these neurons as TuBu06 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figures 7D and E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">8B</xref>). TuBu06 neurons, in turn, receive input from the bilateral TuTuB_b neurons that receive clock circuit input through the DN1pB neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib119">Guo et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib202">Lamaze et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib208">Liang et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). These connections provide a link between sleep and circadian circuits within the CX, which we discuss in more detail in a later section. Circadian input from DN1pB neurons to ER4m via TuBu01 neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>) may also affect neural responses in the polarized light e-vector pathway, consistent with findings in other insects; this could allow for polarized light responses to be adjusted based on the time of day to compensate for changes in the polarization pattern as the sun moves across the sky (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib135">Heinze and Reppert, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib271">Pfeiffer and Homberg, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib299">Sauman et al., 2005</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-4-5"><title>Mechanosensory (wind) input to ring neurons</title><p>In addition to the visual inputs described above, the EB also receives mechanosensory input, as demonstrated by intracellular recordings of wind-sensitive activity in the locust (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib151">Homberg, 1994</xref>) and by extracellular recordings in the cockroach CX demonstrating directionally tuned activity in response to mechanical stimulation of the antennae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Bender et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib118">Guo and Ritzmann, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib292">Ritzmann et al., 2008</xref>). In the fly, recent work has shown that mechanosensory information is carried by ER1 and a subset of ER3a ring neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib256">Okubo et al., 2020</xref>). Unlike the majority of ring neurons that bring sensory information to the EB and receive visual input in the BU, these ring neurons gather much of their input from the LAL and WED (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A and B</xref>), a structure known to receive significant mechanosensory input from the antennal Johnston’s organ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib264">Patella and Wilson, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib343">Suver et al., 2019</xref>). ER1 neurons differ from ER3a cells most prominently in their arborizations in the EB, which we will cover in more detail in the next section. The CX connectome revealed that both of these neuron populations consist of multiple types. There are two ER1 types, ER1_a and ER1_b, and four ER3a types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10s5">Figure 10—figure supplement 5</xref>). Of the four ER3a types, ER3a_a and ER3a_d primarily receive inputs in the BU, whereas ER3a_b and ER3a_c receive inputs in the LAL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10s5">Figure 10—figure supplement 5</xref>). We found that only ER3a_b and ER1_b neurons are postsynaptic to neurons that we believe to be WPN neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A–C</xref>) – neurons that have been characterized as being wind-direction-sensitive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib343">Suver et al., 2019</xref>). These putative WPN neurons are themselves downstream of APN neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A and C</xref>), which are known to be mechanosensory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib264">Patella and Wilson, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib343">Suver et al., 2019</xref>). The ER1_b neurons also receive input in the LAL from the LAL138 (previously known as WL-L) neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Franconville et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib256">Okubo et al., 2020</xref>), which, recent work has suggested, tonically inhibit the ER1_b neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib256">Okubo et al., 2020</xref>). We note that this study also showed evidence for WL-L neurons being gap-junction-coupled to ER1_b neurons. The hemibrain volume lacks the resolution to confirm this observation. In contrast to the ER1_a neurons, whose processes are uniformly distributed along the dorsal-ventral axis of the LAL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9Di and Ei</xref>), the ER1_b neurons receive inputs, especially from ExR7 neurons (discussed in later sections) in relatively distinct clusters arranged along the dorsal-ventral axis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9Dii and Eii</xref>). The latter spatial segregation is consistent with physiological reports of their distinct but overlapping tuning to wind direction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib256">Okubo et al., 2020</xref>). Our analysis suggests that directional information from wind stimuli is conveyed to the EB by ER1_b and ER3a_b neurons. Functional properties of major inputs to the other LAL ring neurons have not been characterized, and it is therefore unknown what information is conveyed by these types. Because ER1_a, ER1_b, and ER3a_b neurons receive the majority of their input from unidentified neurons in the LAL, WED, and CRE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B</xref>), the directional mechanosensory information that they receive may well be combined with other sensorimotor information from other presynaptic partners (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s1">Figure 9—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig9" position="float"><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><title>Mechanosensory input to the ellipsoid body (EB).</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Connectivity graph of paths from putative APN2 and APN3 to ER neurons.

More recently, functional studies have demonstrated that the population activity of EPG (compass) neurons, each of which arborizes in a single EB sector (‘wedge’), represents the fly’s orientation relative to the external world (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib312">Seelig and Jayaraman, 2015</xref>). This activity, which localizes to a contiguous ‘bump’ spanning the processes of EPG neurons in neighboring sectors, is required for flies to stably maintain arbitrary headings as they walk or fly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">Giraldo et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib116">Green et al., 2019</xref>).

Broadly, numerous experimental and computational studies suggest that the compass-like dynamics of the EPG population, which resemble those of a theorized network structure called a ring attractor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib192">Kim et al., 2017c</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib365">Turner-Evans et al., 2020</xref>), are generated by the interaction of several neuron types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Cope et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Fisher et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib114">Green et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib181">Kakaria and de Bivort, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib193">Kim et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib276">Pisokas et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib364">Turner-Evans et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib365">Turner-Evans et al., 2020</xref>). The neural compass relies on input from the anterior visual pathway to remain tethered to the fly’s visual surroundings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Fisher et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib125">Hardcastle et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib193">Kim et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib365">Turner-Evans et al., 2020</xref>) and from mechanosensory ring neurons to tether to the direction of wind (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib256">Okubo et al., 2020</xref>). This representation of the fly’s head direction is also updated by self-motion cues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib114">Green et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib364">Turner-Evans et al., 2017</xref>) and persists even when the fly is standing still in darkness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib312">Seelig and Jayaraman, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib365">Turner-Evans et al., 2020</xref>). Not surprisingly, the EB receives input from a large number of canonical ring neuron types. It also receives input from numerous columnar neurons that together bidirectionally link the EB to the PB, NO, GA, and LAL, as well as ExR neurons, which connect the EB to many brain structures outside the CX (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5Ai and B</xref>). In the sections that follow, we provide a high-level view of the anatomical organization of the EB, followed by analyses of the different neuron types innervating the structure, and of their interconnectivity within it, particularly in the context of tethering the fly’s compass representation to sensory cues in its environment.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig10" position="float"><label>Figure 10.</label><caption><title>Overview of the organization of the ellipsoid body (EB).</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Region arborization plot of neuron types that innervate the EB, showing average pre- and postsynaptic counts by region.

Ring neuron types also vary in the spatial extent of their arbors and the degree to which they overlap with the arbors of other ring neuron types. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10Ci</xref> displays this overlap through the location of synapses in the anterior-radial plane (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10s4">Figure 10—figure supplement 4A</xref> for anterior-radial cross-sections along different parts of the EB). When neuron types are grouped by the subregions of structures outside the EB where they receive their inputs, synapses of different ring neuron classes appear to tile the anterior-radial cross-section of the EB (sample cross-section shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10Cii</xref>). The only significant overlap between different ring neuron classes occurs between the BUs and BUa ring neurons, which receive inputs in similar parts of the AOTUsu (see previous section). Most columnar neurons, which are so named because they each only innervate single glomeruli in the PB and single sectors (‘tiles’ and ‘wedges’ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib391">Wolff et al., 2015</xref>]) of the EB torus, spread their synapses across fairly large fractions of the anterior-radial cross-section of the structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10s4">Figure 10—figure supplement 4B</xref>, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10s2">Figure 10—figure supplement 2C</xref> for synapse locations of individual EB columnar types). In particular, the population of EPG and EL neurons makes synapses across most of the EB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10s2">Figure 10—figure supplement 2</xref>). EL neurons (called EB.w.AMP.s-Dga-s.b in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib391">Wolff et al., 2015</xref>) have never been characterized physiologically. The ExR neuron types are similar to ring neurons in arborizing across the entire circumference of the EB. However, in contrast to most ring neurons, they make synapses across fairly large fractions of the anterior-radial cross-section of the EB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10s3">Figure 10—figure supplement 3C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10s4">Figure 10—figure supplement 4C</xref>).

They bring diverse sensory information into the EB (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5">Table 5</xref>, morphological renderings in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10s5">Figure 10—figure supplement 5</xref>). Visually tuned ring neurons with ipsilateral receptive fields (ER2a-d, ER4d) and ring neurons tuned to polarized light (ER4m) are well-characterized and the fly’s head direction system is known to tether to such cues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Fisher et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib125">Hardcastle et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib193">Kim et al., 2019</xref>). ER1_b and ER3a_b are tuned to wind direction, but only ER1_b appears to directly influence the head direction representation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib256">Okubo et al., 2020</xref>). Less is known about the tuning and function of other ER3 neuron types. Pan-neuronal imaging has suggested that a subset of ER3 neurons in the aBUi responds to contralateral visual information and motor actions (potentially the ER3a neurons, based on their anatomical position in the BU and their inputs in the LAL), but many ER3 neurons have been reported to be unresponsive to visual stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib257">Omoto et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib318">Shiozaki and Kazama, 2017</xref>). Based on their connectivity with ExR3 and ExR1, we hypothesize that ER3d ring neurons are involved in sleep-wake control (see section on sleep for details). One other ring neuron type, ER5, has been explicitly linked to tracking sleep need (discussed further in a later section). Finally, the unusual ring neuron type – the ER6 – receives most of its non-EB input in the GA (discussed in more detail in a later section), where it contacts EPG and PEG neurons.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5-3"><title>Generating a head direction representation from diverse sensory cues</title><p>The fly’s compass system can tether to directional sensory cues carried by a variety of ring neuron types, forming an internal representation of head direction in a world-centered (i.e., allocentric) reference frame. Using the complete EB connectivity information of the hemibrain connectome, we found that most – but not all – ring neuron types from both hemispheres make direct synaptic contacts with EPG neurons from both sides of the brain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11A</xref>, third and fourth columns of the connectivity matrix, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video3">Video 3</xref>; <xref ref-type="video" rid="video4">Video 4</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib365">Turner-Evans et al., 2020</xref>). In the analyses that follow, we will consider the number and location of synapses that various visual and mechanosensory ring neurons make onto EPG neurons as a proxy for the influence that these different sensory cues exert on the EPG compass. For example, the physiological observation that ER3a_b neurons, which respond to wind direction, do not directly impact EPG dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib256">Okubo et al., 2020</xref>) is well accounted for by their lack of direct synaptic connections to EPG neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11A</xref>). The other ER3a neurons also make few connections to EPG neurons. Note that although the unusual ER6 neuron type does not synaptically contact EPG neurons in the EB (top two row blocks in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11A</xref>), these neurons – and most of the ER3a as well as ER5 neurons – do make strong contacts with the EL columnar neuron types (first and second columns in the connectivity matrix in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11A</xref>, morphological rendering in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11B</xref>). The functional significance of EL neurons and of these connections is unknown. The stimulation of ER6 neurons triggers an inhibitory response in EPG neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Franconville et al., 2018</xref>), which might be mediated through their connections in the gall (see Figure 56) or indirectly through other columnar neurons (see below).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig11" position="float"><label>Figure 11.</label><caption><title>Ring neuron to columnar connectivity.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Neuron-to-neuron connectivity matrix for connections from ring neurons to EL and EPG neurons in the ellipsoid body (EB) on a single neuron level.

This flexibility of tethering the EPG compass to different cues is thought to be achieved by experience-dependent plasticity acting on the synaptic weights between ring neurons and EPG neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Fisher et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib193">Kim et al., 2019</xref>). These studies suggested that the strength of a visual ring neuron’s synapses onto EPG neurons would, through sculpted inhibition, localize EPG activity to a specific sector of the EB for a given head direction in a specific visual setting (schematized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11C</xref>). Considering the strong correlation between synapse counts and the area of synaptic contact between neuron pairs in at least larval <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Barnes et al., 2020</xref>), and assuming that the functional strength of synapses depends on synaptic surface area (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib148">Holler-Rickauer et al., 2019</xref>), we asked whether we could detect any signatures of such plasticity-based sculpting in synapse counts between ring and EPG neurons (note that a change in synapse counts is only one of many potential signatures of plasticity-related changes in synaptic strength). Specifically, we examined the connectivity matrix between a variety of ring neurons – ER1_a, ER1_b, ER2_a-d, ER4d, and ER4m – and EPG neurons for any consistent nonuniformities. We conjectured that if synapse counts or relative weights reflect functional synaptic strengths, we should see specific patterns in the connectivity between ring neurons and EPG neurons. For example, we might expect that the ring neuron synaptic profiles onto multiple EPG neurons within a wedge (i.e., EPG neurons that share the same head direction tuning) would be more similar than their synaptic profiles onto EPG neurons with very different tuning (i.e., those from angularly distant parts of the EB) (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11C</xref>). We found no such correlations or modularity for most ring neuron types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11s1">Figure 11—figure supplement 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table6">Table 6</xref>). There were two exceptions: the polarization-tuned ER4m neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11A and D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11s1">Figure 11—figure supplement 1Cviii</xref>), and, to a lesser extent, the ER1_a neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11s1">Figure 11—figure supplement 1Ci</xref>). Thus, if synaptic weights from sensory ring neurons onto EPG neurons vary in consistent patterns as a result of a fly’s experience, as we expect they must, this is not reflected in synapse counts for the vast majority of ring neuron types (note, however, that we know little of the sensory experience of this fly; see Materials and methods). The absence of obvious structural signatures of synaptic strength is perhaps unsurprising in the context of plasticity that acts at a timescale of tens of seconds to a few minutes, as is the case here (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Fisher et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib193">Kim et al., 2019</xref>). In the case of the polarization-tuned ER4m neurons, we observed that synapse counts to EPG neurons varied smoothly along the circumference of the EB, but with mirror-symmetric profiles for ER4m neurons from the left and right hemisphere, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11D</xref>), resulting in stronger connections from the left hemisphere for EB wedges on the right half of the EB and stronger connections from the right hemisphere to the left half of the EB. Given the mirror symmetry of the represented axis of polarization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib125">Hardcastle et al., 2020</xref>), this connectivity pattern may allow the fly to generate a complete, 360° head direction representation from twofold symmetric polarized light input, an idea that we return to in ‘Discussion.’ Although a recent study reported wind-direction-tuned responses in ER1 neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib256">Okubo et al., 2020</xref>), we believe that the neurons characterized in that study to be only ER1_b neurons – whether the ER1_a neuron type is also mechanosensory is as yet unknown.</p><table-wrap id="table6" position="float"><label>Table 6.</label><caption><title>Significance values for wedge-specific modularity in connections between ring and EPG neurons.</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="top">Neuron</th><th align="left" valign="top">Ring to EPG</th><th align="left" valign="top">Ring to EPG</th><th align="left" valign="top">EPG to ring</th><th align="left" valign="top">EPG to ring</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="top"><bold>name</bold></td><td align="left" valign="top"><bold>synapse count</bold></td><td align="left" valign="top"><bold>relative weight</bold></td><td align="left" valign="top"><bold>synapse count</bold></td><td align="left" valign="top"><bold>relative weight</bold></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top"/><td align="left" valign="top"/><td align="left" valign="top"/><td align="left" valign="top"/><td align="left" valign="top"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">ER1_a</td><td align="char" char="." valign="top">0.028</td><td align="char" char="." valign="top">0.007</td><td align="char" char="." valign="top">0.989</td><td align="char" char="." valign="top">0.994</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">ER1_b</td><td align="char" char="." valign="top">0.826</td><td align="char" char="." valign="top">0.697</td><td align="char" char="." valign="top">0.911</td><td align="char" char="." valign="top">0.936</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">ER2_a</td><td align="char" char="." valign="top">0.626</td><td align="char" char="." valign="top">0.592</td><td align="char" char="." valign="top">0.993</td><td align="char" char="." valign="top">0.993</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">ER2_b</td><td align="char" char="." valign="top">0.509</td><td align="char" char="." valign="top">0.492</td><td align="char" char="." valign="top">0.735</td><td align="char" char="." valign="top">0.739</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">ER2_c</td><td align="char" char="." valign="top">0.414</td><td align="char" char="." valign="top">0.304</td><td align="char" char="." valign="top">0.992</td><td align="char" char="." valign="top">0.985</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">ER2_d</td><td align="char" char="." valign="top">0.074</td><td align="char" char="." valign="top">0.074</td><td align="char" char="." valign="top">0.947</td><td align="char" char="." valign="top">0.946</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">ER4d</td><td align="char" char="." valign="top">0.916</td><td align="char" char="." valign="top">0.879</td><td align="char" char="." valign="top">0.269</td><td align="char" char="." valign="top">0.274</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">ER4m</td><td align="char" char="." valign="top">0</td><td align="char" char="." valign="top">0</td><td align="char" char="." valign="top">0.503</td><td align="char" char="." valign="top">0.492</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><fn><p>Each matrix was shuffled 1000 times, and modularity was computed for each shuffled matrix.

What if the different sensory streams do not provide a consistent estimate of head direction? This kind of conflict can, for example, arise during translational movement when local visual landmarks provide a less stable estimate of head direction than global cues like wind direction and the polarization pattern of the sky. We asked if the spatial connectivity pattern of ring neurons onto EPG neurons holds any clues about how such conflicts are resolved. Specifically, we considered the electrotonic distances of synapses to the spike initiation zone of a neuron, which is often correlated with the influence that the input can exert on the neuron’s ability to fire (or not fire) a spike. We asked if we could extract an expected weighting of head direction-tethering cues conveyed by ring neurons based on the electrotonic distance of their synapses to the estimated spike initiation zone of their EPG neuron targets.</p><p>Although little is known about spike initiation zones in fly neurons, the best estimates thus far have come from studies in olfactory PNs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib113">Gouwens and Wilson, 2009</xref>). In these multipolar neurons, spikes are thought to be initiated near the base of their major input arbors in the AL. These results are also consistent with the subcellular localization of voltage-gated sodium channels in a broader class of central brain neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib287">Ravenscroft et al., 2020</xref>). We thus made the assumption that spikes in the EPG neurons are initiated at the root of their arbors in the EB, near the intersection of these processes with processes that travel to the GA and PB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Figure 12A</xref>). We found that these putative spike initiation points (yellow circles in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Figure 12A and C</xref>, left) tend to cluster at a certain depth and radial position of the EB. Specifically, EPG neurons tend to enter the EB near a central annulus and from the posterior side. We expected some systematic variation in ring neuron synapse locations by type because different ring neuron types arborize at different depths and radial positions in the EB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10s1">Figure 10—figure supplement 1C</xref>). By grouping the ring neuron types according to their sensory modality, inspired by their overall connectivity in the EB and their known sensory tuning (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figures 10F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">12B</xref>), we found that the locations of synapses from the ring neurons to the EPG neurons tend to cluster by modality group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Figure 12C</xref>, right, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12s1">Figure 12—figure supplement 1A</xref>, compare also to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10Cii</xref>). Further, an analysis of the synapses of the ring neurons in these different sensory modality groups onto the EPG neurons revealed a clear trend in their relative electrotonic distances to the root node (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Figure 12D and E</xref>). Broadly, as seen in the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of an example EPG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Figure 12D</xref>), the electrotonic distance between different ring neuron types and the root of each of their postsynaptic EPG neurons suggests an ordering in expected influence on EPG activity, with the mechanosensory neuron synapses being the closest, the different visual neurons being next, and the sleep-related ring neurons potentially exerting the least impact on the EPG neuron’s ability to fire a spike. We then compared the locations of ring neuron synapses to those of PEN synapses (labeled ‘motor’ in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Figure 12B–E</xref>). These self-motion inputs to the fly’s head direction system (discussed in later sections) were electrotonically closer to the root of the EPG arbors in the EB than any of the ring neuron inputs (compare left plot with purple region in right plot in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Figure 12C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12s1">Figure 12—figure supplement 1A</xref>). While there is some variability, these broad trends are consistent across neuron types within the different modality groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12s2">Figure 12—figure supplement 2</xref>). The rank ordering is fairly consistent across EPG neurons, as can be seen by comparing the medians of the distributions of the synapse locations of ring neurons from each modality group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Figure 12E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12s1">Figure 12—figure supplement 1B, C</xref>; see Materials and methods). These same trends were also observed when analyzing the physical distance along the arbor between synapses and the postsynaptic EPG root (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12s1">Figure 12—figure supplement 1D, E</xref>). Most synapses were found to occur within 50 µm of the root (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12s1">Figure 12—figure supplement 1F</xref>). A similar picture emerged for the EL neuron type, the second columnar neuron type that receives inputs from many ring neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12s3">Figure 12—figure supplement 3</xref>; the higher variability across individual ELs is likely due to a greater variation in arbor shape along the circumference of the EB relative to the EPG neurons as seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10s4">Figure 10—figure supplement 4B</xref>). In summary, our analysis of the electrotonic distances of synapses from different ring neuron types to EPG neurons in the EB suggests a consistent prioritization of sensory inputs to EPG neurons that may reflect the relative importance of different sensory stimuli in driving the fly’s head direction estimate. Sculpted inhibition from different sensory ring neurons appears largely focused on the intermediate arbors of the EPG neurons, and excitatory self-motion inputs that update the head direction representation during turns are closer to the root of the EPG neuron arbors in the EB.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig12" position="float"><label>Figure 12.</label><caption><title>Morphology analysis of ring neuron connectivity to EPG neurons.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Skeleton of a single EPG (id. 1447576662) with the selected root point indicated in yellow.

As we outline in ‘Discussion,’ such all-to-all inhibition may help to minimize the influence of noise on the compass system and effectively enhance the influence of the most prominent sensory cues on the angular position of the EPG bump in the EB.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig13" position="float"><label>Figure 13.</label><caption><title>Inter-ring neuron connectivity.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Connectivity matrix for connections between ring neurons in the ellipsoid body (EB) on single neuron level.

Examples of types that show all-to-all connections include the ER4m, ER2a-d, and ER3w types (off-diagonal blocks in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13">Figure 13A</xref>). A different heavily connected set includes the ER3_m and all ER3a neurons. In both cases, most – but not all – type-to-type connections are reciprocal. While the first set of ring neuron types synapse directly onto EPG neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figures 11A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13">13B</xref>), the second set mostly interact with EPG neurons indirectly – in the case of the ER3a neurons, through their impact on ER3m neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figures 11A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13">13A</xref>) and EL neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13">Figure 13B</xref>). To assess the potential impact of across-type connections between ring neurons, we generated a graph for connections between ring neurons, which showed that ring neuron types with similar tuning formed highly interconnected clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13">Figure 13C</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5">Table 5</xref>). We ranked individual types by the numbers of synapses that they make onto EPG neurons – presumably contributing to the generation and maintenance of the head direction signal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Fisher et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib193">Kim et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13">Figure 13C</xref>, see Materials and methods). For groups of ring neuron types that provide strong input to the EPG neurons, this revealed a second, implicit hierarchy between different ring neuron types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figures 11A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13">13B</xref>). Prominent among these ring neuron types are those that – based on their TuBu inputs and recent neurophysiological evidence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib125">Hardcastle et al., 2020</xref>) – we believe to be associated with the sky compass pathway. ER4m, ER2_a-d, and possibly ER3w. All of these types are part of a highly interconnected cluster. Within this cluster, connections between inhibitory ring neurons define a suppression hierarchy. For example, the ER4m neurons, which are most strongly tuned to polarized light e-vector orientation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib125">Hardcastle et al., 2020</xref>), make a significant number of synapses onto all other neuron types in the cluster (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13">Figure 13A and C</xref>), and do not receive nearly as many in return (as indicated by the size of the dot representing the neuron type), placing this neuron type at the top of the hierarchy within this cluster. The ER2_c type appears next, inhibiting ER2_a and ER2_d neuron types. ER4d neurons, which likely convey information about a broader range of visual features (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib311">Seelig and Jayaraman, 2013</xref>), are not inhibited by any of the other ring neuron types and make a large number of synapses onto EPG neurons themselves (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13">Figure 13C</xref>). Other high-ranking ring neuron types include the ER3p_a, which is one of the primary target types of the EL neurons in the EB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13">Figure 13B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13s1">Figure 13—figure supplement 1B</xref>), and the ER1_a and ER1_b neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Figure 12B</xref>), at least one of which is mechanosensory and brings information about wind direction to the EB (likely ER1_b, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib256">Okubo et al., 2020</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13">Figure 13B</xref> shows the relative contributions of all ring neuron types to tethering the EPG compass in terms of the relative strength of the respective ring neuron inputs to EPG neurons. On top of this, the suppression hierarchy circuit motif could help with selecting a single-ring neuron type for updating the compass when multiple-ring neuron populations are activated, thus effectively establishing a preference for certain sensory compass cues over others.</p><p>A few ring neuron types appear to be privileged in also receiving feedback from the EPG neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13s1">Figure 13—figure supplement 1B</xref>). This privileged set of ring neuron types includes, once again, the ER4m neurons, which carry polarized light e-vector information. This feedback may serve to amplify their impact on tethering the head direction representation to sensory input, while potentially reducing the influence of ring neurons that carry other types of sensory information.</p><p>In summary, we found evidence for several mechanisms by which different sensory inputs to EPG neurons could be integrated, and potential conflicts between cues resolved. First, the strength of connections from various ring neurons onto EPG neurons, as measured by relative weight, varies between types. Polarization-sensitive ER4m neurons provide the strongest input to EPG neurons and are also privileged in receiving feedback from EPG neurons. Consistent, but weaker, ring neuron-to-EPG connections are made by other visually tuned ring neurons and those that bring in mechanosensory information (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figures 11A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13">13B</xref>). Second, the position of ring neuron synapses along EPG neuron arbors varies systematically, not only with ring neuron type but more generally with the type of sensory information carried by different types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Figure 12E</xref>). This is also reflected in the organization of ring neuron arbors in the EB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10Cii</xref>). Based on the electrotonic distance of synapses from the putative spike initiation zone of EPG neurons, self-motion signals from PEN neurons are in a privileged position to excite the compass neurons, while ring neurons carrying mechanosensory, ipsilateral visual, and polarization e-vector cues provide the strongest inhibitory influences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Figure 12E</xref>). However, the ordering of ring neuron influence on the EPG compass based on synapse location differs slightly from the ranking based on relative connection weights for mechanosensory ER1 neurons and the likely polarization-sensitive ER4m, ER2c, and ER3w neurons (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Figure 12E</xref> to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13">Figure 13C</xref>). Finally, within modality groups, inhibitory ring neurons form suppression hierarchies that may help to select strong guidance signals when multiple sensory cues are present. These suppression hierarchies occur between types that carry potentially related compass information such as the position of the sun (potentially ER2 types) and the celestial polarization pattern (likely ER4m) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13">Figure 13C</xref>). Taken together, these circuit motifs may help to resolve guidance cue conflicts and ensure a stable head direction representation.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5-6"><title>Ring neuron connectivity with other neuron types</title><p>Some ring neuron types synapse onto some of the other columnar neuron types in the EB.

In addition, ER1_a and ER1_b neurons contact PEN_a (formerly PEN1) neurons from both sides of the brain although those connections are rather weak (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13s1">Figure 13—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Some ring neuron types receive presynaptic input in the EB from columnar neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13s1">Figure 13—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Most of the columnar-to-ring-neuron connections are weak or inconsistent across neurons of the same type (e.g., inputs from PEN_a to ER1_a and ER1_b neurons, or inputs from EPG and PEN_b neurons to ER4m). A notable exception is the strong PEG-to-ER6 neuron connectivity. Most columnar feedback to ring neurons comes from EL neurons, which themselves receive input from several ER neuron types. The EL neurons make synaptic contacts onto most ring neuron types, most strongly to ER3p neurons. We do not yet know the function of these columnar-to-ER connections.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5-7"><title>‘Head direction’ versus ‘heading direction’</title><p>In contrast to mammals, the function of the fly compass has not yet been monitored in head-free animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib163">Hulse and Jayaraman, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib294">Rubin et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib351">Taube et al., 1990a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib352">Taube et al., 1990b</xref>). This motivated us and others to refer to the representation as being of ‘heading direction’ rather than ‘head direction’ until the issue can be conclusively resolved with direct evidence. However, considering that diverse sensory cues are all communicated to the EB in head-centered coordinates, we will now employ the term ‘head direction’ to refer to the EPG population representation. Note that this is consistent with the terminology that has long been used in studies of the CX in many other insects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib154">Homberg, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib371">Varga and Ritzmann, 2016</xref>), but awaits experimental confirmation in those animals as well.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5-8"><title>ExR neurons connect the EB with numerous other brain regions</title><p>In addition to the ring neuron types, which bring information from outside the CX to the EB, another class of neurons termed ‘extrinsic ring’ (ExR) neurons also form ring-shaped arbors along the circumference of the EB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib124">Hanesch et al., 1989</xref>). In contrast to most of the ring neurons, ExR neurons are comprised of only one or two neurons per hemisphere and arborize in multiple regions outside the CX (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig14">Figure 14A</xref>). Only a subset of the ExR neurons have been described before and little is known about their function. We identified eight types of ExR neurons, each type targeting distinct sets of brain regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig14">Figure 14A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig14s1">Figure 14—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig14s2">Figure 14—figure supplement 2</xref>). Consistent with their diverse morphologies and projection patterns outside the CX, the inputs and outputs of different ExR types are largely distinct (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig14">Figure 14B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig14s3">Figure 14—figure supplement 3A</xref>). While all ring neurons serve as inputs to the CX, only a subset of the ExR neurons appear to be inputs. Most ExR neuron types have mixed polarity in the EB, and two ExR neuron types are CX output neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig14">Figure 14A</xref>, bottom). The CX input neurons are ExR1 and ExR4, which convey information primarily from the BU, LAL, and GA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig14">Figure 14A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig14s3">Figure 14—figure supplement 3B</xref>). For a more detailed descriptions of ExR connectivity in the BU, see also <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>. The CX output neurons, ExR7 and ExR8, will be discussed in more detail in the output section. The remaining ExR neurons – ExR2, ExR3, ExR5, and ExR6 – have both inputs and outputs outside of the EB, although some do have clear input or output regions (e.g., ExR5, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig14">Figure 14A</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig14" position="float"><label>Figure 14.</label><caption><title>Overview of extrinsic ring (ExR) neurons.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Region arborization plot of all ExR types from the right hemisphere, showing average pre- and postsynaptic counts by region.

Indeed, ExR1 neurons, also called Helicon cells, have been linked to the control of sleep homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Donlea et al., 2018</xref>). We will cover ExR1 and ExR3 neurons in more detail in the sleep section. Besides ExR1 and ExR3, ExR5 also receives a large fraction of its EB inputs from ring neurons, specifically from the ipsilateral visual ER4d neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig14s3">Figure 14—figure supplement 3B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10F</xref>). All ExR neurons make connections to columnar EL and EPG neurons, suggesting a role in modulating the function of the fly’s head direction representation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig14">Figure 14Ci</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig14s4">Figure 14—figure supplement 4A</xref>). Connectivity with EPGt, PEG, and PEN neurons is sparser, with ExR4 providing strong input to PEG and both PEN neuron types, and ExR6 selectively contacting PEN_a and EPGt neuron types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig14">Figure 14Ci</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig14s4">Figure 14—figure supplement 4A</xref>). Columnar neurons also feedback onto ExR neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig14">Figure 14Cii</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig14s4">Figure 14—figure supplement 4B</xref>).</p><p>Many ExR neurons make direct and indirect connections to the same partner types in multiple brain regions, suggesting that they do more than just act as input and output pathways for the EB. We analyzed these different connectivity motifs by comparing ExR connections within the EB to their direct and indirect connections in other regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig15">Figure 15A</xref>). We restricted our analysis to downstream partners of ExRs and focused on three specific connectivity motifs: ‘parallel connections,’ ‘canonical feedback,’ and ‘linked targets’ (see schematic in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig15">Figure 15A</xref>). ‘Parallel connections’ describe a motif in which ExR neurons make direct or indirect connections outside the EB to the same neuron type that they also contact in the EB (red arrow in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig15">Figure 15A</xref>, left). The ‘canonical feedback’ motif covers cases in which ExR neurons directly or indirectly connect outside the EB to neurons that feed back onto ExR neurons in the EB (yellow arrow in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig15">Figure 15A</xref>, middle). The third motif captures cases where downstream partners of ExR neurons are themselves connected in the EB, making them ‘linked targets’ (green arrow in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig15">Figure 15A</xref>, right). Not all ExR neuron types engage in these motifs. ExR1 and ExR4, because they are primarily input neurons to the EB, and ExR8, because it is purely an output neuron of the EB. Among the others, the linked targets motif is most commonly observed, potentially allowing these ExR neurons to link the activity of related circuitry in multiple brain regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig15">Figure 15B</xref>). The majority of motifs are formed through ring neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig15">Figure 15C</xref>), suggesting that ExR neurons form a feedback loop onto one of the primary input pathways to the EB.</p><fig id="fig15" position="float"><label>Figure 15.</label><caption><title>Extrinsic ring (ExR) connectivity motifs.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic explaining the ExR connectivity motif analysis, which compares connectivity within the ellipsoid body (EB) to connectivity outside the EB. The top row shows the three circuit motifs that were considered, and the bottom row their equivalent representation in a compact circular network plot. Here we compare connections from ExR to other EB neurons outside and inside the EB. We only consider out-of-EB pathways for ExR neurons. The out-of-EB pathways can be direct or indirect connections (pink arrows) to other EB neurons (in green). ‘Parallel connections’ occur when the source neurons also contact the pathway target neuron inside the central complex (CX) (in red). The ‘canonical feedback’ motif describes the case where the target of the pathway contacts the source type in the CX (in yellow). ‘Linked targets’ are neurons connected in the CX that are targets of the same neuron outside of the CX (in green).

ExR2 are DANs of the PPM3 cluster and have been linked to ethanol-induced hyperactivity and the control of circadian activity peaks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib196">Kong et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib208">Liang et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib247">Nässel and Elekes, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib258">Omoto et al., 2018</xref>). Outside of the EB, ExR2 neurons receive input in the LAL and EB and send outputs primarily to the BU (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig14">Figure 14A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig14s3">Figure 14—figure supplement 3B</xref>). Through these BU connections, ExR2 neurons directly and indirectly target many of the same ring neurons that they also contact in the EB, specifically ER neurons from the ipsilateral visually-responsive cluster (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig15">Figure 15Ei and Fi</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>). Thus, ExR2 neurons may modulate the fly’s motor activity by regulating visual inputs to the fly’s head direction system. The putatively serotonergic ExR3 neurons form parallel connections and feedback connections with three sets of highly interconnected ring neuron populations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig15">Figure 15C and Eii</xref>). One group of ring neuron partners is the ipsilateral visually tuned cluster of ring neurons, which is also targeted by ExR2. A second group is the ER3a/ER3m cluster, with which ExR3 forms parallel and a few feedback connections in the EB. The third and final group is the ER3d cluster, which may play a role in sleep-wake control (see Figure 53). ExR3 neurons contact ER3d neurons directly in both the EB and the BU, and indirectly through TuBu neurons, forming parallel and feedback connections with each ER3d neuron in the EB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig15">Figure 15Eii and Fii</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>).</p><p>Taken together, our analysis suggests that ExR neurons are highly diverse but can be broadly grouped into types that primarily provide input to the EB, those that serve as output pathways from the EB and those that appear to be mixed input and output neurons; ExR neurons in the last group modulate input pathways to the EB through connections both inside and outside the EB.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>A ring attractor network formed by recurrent loops between the EB and PB</title><p>The architecture of the fly’s head direction system has already been described in some detail in a series of experimental studies. These studies identified network motifs that likely underlie the generation, maintenance, and updating of the fly’s head direction representation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib114">Green et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib115">Green and Maimon, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib163">Hulse and Jayaraman, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib364">Turner-Evans et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib365">Turner-Evans et al., 2020</xref>). These motifs, the network’s dynamics, and the system’s responses to perturbation strongly suggest that the network implements a type of ring attractor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib192">Kim et al., 2017c</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib364">Turner-Evans et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib365">Turner-Evans et al., 2020</xref>). In this section, we describe the connectivity of columnar neurons that form the core of the network. These four classes of EB-PB columnar neurons arborize in single glomeruli in the PB and in localized regions of the EB, while also sending processes to a third structure (either the GA or the NO). We do not describe ring attractor theories in any detail here, but rather encourage the reader to refer to prior work for more information on the significance of attractor networks.</p><sec id="s2-6-1"><title>EB-PB columnar neurons: recurrent partners that maintain and update the compass</title><p>The activity in the EPG neurons represents the fly’s head direction. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig16">Figure 16A</xref>, each EPG neuron connects an EB wedge with a single glomerulus in the PB, while also innervating the GA (discussed in later sections). The PB is mirror symmetric in appearance, with a left half and a right half. The 16 EPG wedges in the EB alternate so that half go to the right PB while half go to the left. In this way, the EPG neurons map the different locations around the ring of the EB to both the right and the left PB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig16">Figure 16B</xref>). The EPG neurons bring the head direction signal to the PB from the EB. A bump of activity in the EPG neurons in the EB will therefore manifest as two bumps in the PB, with one on either side. Due to the alternating left and right projections of EB wedges to either the right or the left PB, the bump on the right side will be shifted 22.5° (360°/16 wedges) with respect to the bump on the left (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib391">Wolff et al., 2015</xref>), as has been observed experimentally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib218">Lyu et al., 2020</xref>).</p><fig id="fig16" position="float"><label>Figure 16.</label><caption><title>EPGs connect the ellipsoid body (EB) to the protocerebral bridge (PB).</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>, <bold>Ai</bold>) A morphological rendering of two EPG neurons.

However, this study, which was based primarily on the Full Adult Fly Brain (FAFB) dataset (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib410">Zheng et al., 2018</xref>), relied on manual reconstruction of only a fraction of the circuit. The completeness of the hemibrain connectome has now allowed us to more thoroughly examine the compass subnetwork and exposed additional structure-function relationships within the compass circuit, which we discuss below.</p><p>The EPG activity bump moves around the EB either clockwise (CW) or counterclockwise (CCW), depending on which direction the fly turns (head movements are also likely to update the EPG bump, but this has yet to be established). The angular velocity input that moves the bump in the EB is thought to primarily come from the PEN neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib114">Green et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib364">Turner-Evans et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib365">Turner-Evans et al., 2020</xref>). There are two types of PEN neurons, PEN_a and PEN_b, both of which are synaptically connected in recurrent loops with EPG neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib365">Turner-Evans et al., 2020</xref>), are conjunctively tuned to head direction and angular velocity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib114">Green et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib364">Turner-Evans et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib365">Turner-Evans et al., 2020</xref>), and likely receive angular velocity inputs in the NO (discussed in a later section). These recurrent loops have either a CW or CCW shift in their projection patterns. Considering that the EPG head direction representation spans 360° of angular space, we can describe these projection patterns as ‘anatomical phase shifts’ relative to the EPG population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig17">Figure 17A</xref>, schematized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig17">Figure 17B</xref>). That is, PEN neurons receive their head direction inputs from a given EPG neuron in the PB. They then send their projections to an EB tile that is shifted CW or CCW from the EB wedge innervated by the presynaptic EPG neuron. The functional consequence of this phase shift is that the phase (angle) of the PEN activity bump is likely to be shifted relative to the phase (angle) of the EPG activity bump. This phase shift is in opposite directions for PEN neurons with arbors in the right vs. left side of the PB (see sample images of EPG and PEN_a neurons in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig16">Figures 16A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig17">17A</xref>; connectivity matrices in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig17">Figure 17C and D</xref>).

Consistent with these models, we found that PEN neurons from each PB glomerulus contact EPG neurons in every wedge of the EB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig17">Figure 17C</xref>). EPG neurons then complete the loop by synapsing onto PEN neurons in all but the most lateral glomeruli on each side of the PB. The apparent disconnect in connectivity at the edges of the PB is likely addressed by an additional cell type, as discussed below. Importantly, even without this bridging cell type, EPG and PEN_a neurons are so densely interconnected within the EB that a network graph of their subnetwork forms a ring (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig17">Figure 17E</xref>; see Materials and methods). The PEN_b neurons’ connectivity to the EPG neurons looks much like the PEN_a neurons’ connectivity to the EPG neurons in both the EB and PB. This similarity in connectivity does not extend to all partners of the PENs, however. Indeed, each type has unique partners in both brain regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig17s1">Figure 17—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>The PEN neurons in the outermost (ninth) glomeruli do not receive any EPG input from the EPG neurons that project to the eighth glomerulus. Instead, a key neuron type, EPGt, arborizes in that outer glomerulus and appears to fill the ‘gap’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib391">Wolff et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig18">Figure 18A</xref>). While the EPGt neurons have very similar connectivity to the EPG neurons in the PB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig18">Figure 18B</xref>), they receive far fewer synaptic inputs in the EB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig18">Figure 18C</xref>), with a striking sparsity of ring neuron inputs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig18">Figure 18D</xref>). However, EPGt neurons do receive PEN input in the EB. The wedges at the bottom of the EB are innervated by both the EPGt neurons from glomerulus nine and by the EPG neurons that project to glomerulus 1, potentially completing the loop (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig18">Figure 18E</xref>).</p><fig id="fig18" position="float"><label>Figure 18.</label><caption><title>EPGt neurons extend EPG-like connectivity.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Morphological renderings of all <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://neuprint.janelia.org/results?dataset=hemibrain%3Av1.2.1&amp;qt=findneurons&amp;qr%5B0%5D%5Bcode%5D=sk&amp;qr%5B0%5D%5Bds%5D=hemibrain%3Av1.2.1&amp;qr%5B0%5D%5Bpm%5D%5Bdataset%5D=hemibrain%3Av1.2.1&amp;qr%5B0%5D%5Bpm%5D%5Bskip%5D=true&amp;qr%5B0%5D%5Bpm%5D%5BbodyIds%5D=1168659995%2C1168660239%2C1168664447%2C1219069439&amp;qr%5B0%5D%5Bpm%5D%5Bcompartments%5D=EB%2CPB%2CGA%28R%29&amp;qr%5B0%5D%5Bpm%5D%5Bcoordinates%5D=26151.346279831698%2C63300.148647912734%2C24612.28856292045%2C26193.752370093654%2C25182.91012738648%2C23339.8092230892&amp;qr%5B1%5D%5Bcode%5D=fn&amp;qr%5B1%5D%5Bds%5D=hemibrain%3Av1.2.1&amp;qr%5B1%5D%5Bpm%5D%5Bdataset%5D=hemibrain%3Av1.2.1&amp;qr%5B1%5D%5Bpm%5D%5Ball_segments%5D=false&amp;qr%5B1%5D%5Bpm%5D%5Bneuron_name%5D=EPGt&amp;qr%5B1%5D%5BvisProps%5D%5BrowsPerPage%5D=25&amp;tab=0&amp;ftab=">EPGt</ext-link> neurons.

Although some PEG neurons do synapse directly onto EPG neurons in the EB, these connections are sparse and feature only a few synapses. By contrast, the PEG-to-PEN_b and PEN_b-to-EPG connections are both strong and consistent around the ring. There are nine PEG neurons on each side of the PB, one for each glomerulus. Each connects to one of the eight PEN_b neurons in the EB, with PEG neurons from both glomerulus 1 and glomerulus 9 connecting to PEN_b neurons from PB glomerulus 2.

The picture that emerges from this analysis is of a neuron type that is the central hub of the PB. all neurons downstream of EPG neurons receive head direction input that is also processed by theΔ7 neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig20">Figure 20B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig20s1">Figure 20—figure supplements 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig20s2">2</xref>).</p><p>A key question raised by the hub-like connectivity of the Δ7 neurons is how these neurons pass on the EPG head direction signal. Many navigational algorithms combine head direction signals with information about the animal’s movements to compute a vector representation of the animal’s position. In these models, the vector representation is stored in sinusoidal activity patterns, where the phase of the sine wave encodes the angle of the vector and the amplitude of the sine wave represents its length (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib276">Pisokas et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib326">Stone et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib356">Touretzky et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib390">Wittmann and Schwegler, 1995</xref>).</p><p>We therefore asked if the Δ7 neurons transform the local EPG head direction signal into sinusoidal activity patterns in the Δ7 neurons’ downstream partners. Each Δ7 neuron receives smoothly varying input from EPG neurons across the PB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig20">Figure 20C</xref>, upper-left quadrant). Aligning and averaging these input profiles across all Δ7 neurons revealed that the EPG input to Δ7 neurons was in fact well fit by a cosine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig20">Figure 20D</xref>, see Materials and methods) (similar observations are made by a parallel study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib218">Lyu et al., 2020</xref>]). Each Δ7 neuron sends output to specific PB glomeruli that are seven glomeruli apart (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig20">Figure 20A and C</xref>, lower-right quadrant). Since the output is highly targeted and the Δ7 neurons as a population continuously cover the entire PB, the sinusoidal input profile is unlikely to be further shaped by the Δ7 neurons’ outputs.</p><p>To further test if any input from the EPG population will be reformatted into a sinusoid, we simulated EPG activity propagating through the Δ7 neurons to their outputs. We began by assuming that the EPG neurons have an activity bump, similar to that observed experimentally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib312">Seelig and Jayaraman, 2015</xref>). We also assumed that the EPG to Δ7 and Δ7 to EPG connection weights are approximately proportional to their synaptic counts. Our simulations revealed that propagating this activity across the neuron types led to an activity profile that could be even better fit by a sinusoid than the synaptic connectivity profile alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig20">Figure 20E</xref>). Since the EPG to Δ7 connectivity profile is already sinusoidal, this result is relatively independent of the shape of the input activity. For example, if we assumed an impulse (delta) function input from the EPG neurons to one PB glomerulus, the resulting signal was still shaped like a sinusoid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig20">Figure 20F</xref>). We note, however, that these calculations ignore any nonlinearities, as well as the large number of synapses between individual Δ7 neurons. Considering that the Δ7 neurons synapse onto nearly all PB neurons in their specific output glomeruli (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig20">Figure 20C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig20s1">Figure 20—figure supplements 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig20s2">2</xref>), we would expect this transformation of the bump to apply to those neurons as well. By similarly multiplying the EPG-Δ7 synaptic profile with the output profile from the Δ7 neurons onto each of the other neuron types, we found that the sinusoidal reshaping applied to nearly all columnar neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig20">Figure 20G</xref>). The unique spacing of the Δ7 neurons’ inputs and outputs further suggests that this sinusoidal profile will be passed most strongly to glomeruli that represent head direction angles that are 180° shifted from the glomeruli where the EPG activity is strongest (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig20s3">Figure 20—figure supplement 3</xref>).</p><p>Note that just as the EPGt neuron type may expand the influence of the head direction signal to the outermost PB glomerulus (discussed in an earlier section), the P6-8P9 neuron type may extend the sinusoidal shaping of the signal to the entire PB. The P6-8P9 neurons have a similar morphology to the Δ7 neurons, receiving input across multiple PB glomeruli while outputting in only one glomerulus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig21">Figure 21A</xref>). The P6-8P9 neurons also have similar input partners to the Δ7 neurons across glomeruli 6–9 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig21">Figure 21B</xref>), and similar output partners in glomerulus 9 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig21">Figure 21C</xref>), though the number of input and output synapses per glomerulus differs across the two cell types. Overall, the similarities between the P6-89 and the Δ7 neurons suggest that the P6-8P9 neurons perform a similar, albeit far more localized, function as the Δ7 neurons.</p><fig id="fig21" position="float"><label>Figure 21.</label><caption><title>P6-8P9 neuron morphology and connectivity resembles that of the Δ7 neurons that arborize in the outer glomeruli.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) A morphological rendering of a <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://neuprint.janelia.org/results?dataset=hemibrain%3Av1.2.1&amp;qt=findneurons&amp;qr%5B0%5D%5Bcode%5D=sk&amp;qr%5B0%5D%5Bds%5D=hemibrain%3Av1.2.1&amp;qr%5B0%5D%5Bpm%5D%5Bdataset%5D=hemibrain%3Av1.2.1&amp;qr%5B0%5D%5Bpm%5D%5Bskip%5D=true&amp;qr%5B0%5D%5Bpm%5D%5BbodyIds%5D=911919815%2C972513129%2C1004018344%2C5813058389&amp;qr%5B0%5D%5Bpm%5D%5Bcompartments%5D=PB&amp;qr%5B0%5D%5Bpm%5D%5Bcoordinates%5D=26151.346279831698%2C63300.148647912734%2C24612.28856292045%2C26193.752370093654%2C25182.91012738648%2C23339.8092230892&amp;qr%5B1%5D%5Bcode%5D=fn&amp;qr%5B1%5D%5Bds%5D=hemibrain%3Av1.2.1&amp;qr%5B1%5D%5Bpm%5D%5Bdataset%5D=hemibrain%3Av1.2.1&amp;qr%5B1%5D%5Bpm%5D%5Ball_segments%5D=false&amp;qr%5B1%5D%5Bpm%5D%5Bneuron_name%5D=P6-8P9&amp;qr%5B1%5D%5BvisProps%5D%5BrowsPerPage%5D=25&amp;tab=0&amp;ftab=">P6-8P9</ext-link> neuron.

Deviations from uniformity tend to be mirror symmetric across the right and left PB, suggesting that they are not just the result of developmental variability.

None of the CX columnar neuron types that target the PB and NO send arbors to both the EB and FB. Broadly, the FB and EB columnar neurons are known to be sensitive to the fly’s head direction and to self-motion signals, likely enabling these neurons to update navigational representations in the EB and FB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Currier et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib114">Green et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib319">Shiozaki et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib364">Turner-Evans et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib365">Turner-Evans et al., 2020</xref>).

Much like the other CX structures, the NO is characterized by dense recurrence. All columnar neurons are recurrently connected to the LNO neurons that they receive input from (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig25">Figures 25B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig26">26B</xref>). Additionally, most of the columnar neurons – with the notable exception of the PFNp neurons (whose function is unknown) – are also strongly recurrently connected to other neurons of their type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig25">Figures 25B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig26">26D</xref>). These recurrent within-type connections account for a large fraction of the NO outputs of EB and FB columnar neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig26s1">Figure 26—figure supplement 1A</xref>).

One potential organizing principle for the LNO-columnar connections is suggested by the inputs that the different types of LNO neurons receive. Clustering the LNO types by their inputs neatly divides them into classes that synapse onto specific groupings of CX columnar neurons (e.g., the GLNO neurons that provide input to PEN neurons, while LNOa_R cells contact the PFNa_L neurons, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig27">Figure 27C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig27s1">Figure 27—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Note that although a single LNO type may provide input to multiple classes of CX columnar neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig27">Figure 27C</xref>), an LNO that is connected to an EB columnar neuron never contacts an FB columnar neuron and vice versa. Combined with the fact that most columnar neurons receive relatively similar inputs in the PB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig26">Figure 26C</xref>), this LNO-based segregation suggests that the information that each grouping of CX columnar neurons receives in the NO may differ substantially, even within a single NO compartment.

PB-FB-*, FX, vΔ, and hΔ (where X and * stand for an additional, neuron type-specific neuropil). Each class contains many distinct neuron types. The population of neurons comprising each neuron type innervates all columns of the FB, but in a layer-restricted manner. As shown next to each anatomical rendering, a neuron type’s morphology can be summarized by illustrating the location of dendritic (rectangle) and axonal (circles) compartments for the nine FB layers and any associated neuropil. Here, each neuron type is colored according to its class (see legend in <bold>D</bold>). (<bold>C</bold>) Same as in (<bold>B</bold>), but for 2 of the 145 types of FB tangential cells. (<bold>D</bold>) Schematic showing the innervation pattern of every FB columnar neuron type, each illustrated as in (<bold>B</bold>). Columnar neurons can be roughly grouped into four putative functional groups: those that convey information from outside the FB to specific FB layers (columnar inputs; subset of PB-FB-* neurons), those that convey information between layers of the FB (intra-FB columnar neurons; vΔ and hΔ neurons), those that convey information out of the FB (columnar outputs; PB-FB-* and FX), and those that could perform a mixture of these functions (input/output). Columnar inputs have axons in every FB layer they innervate, intra-FB columnar neurons have processes confined to the FB, and columnar outputs have dendrites (and very few axons) in every FB layer they innervate. Note that while some columnar types are grouped (e.g., PFNm and PFNp), these types can be distinguished by their connectivity both within and outside of the FB (e.g., PFNm and PFNp receive distinct noduli [NO] inputs). In addition, tangential cells innervating the superior protocerebrum (SMP/SIP/SLP), crepine (CRE), and/or lateral accessory lobe (LAL) (and additional structures) provide input to (left panel) and output from (right panel) specific FB layers. Tangential cells in many different layers send processes to the SMP/SIP/SLP, CRE, and/or LAL, but only consistently target these regions in most cell types in the layers that are shown.

Further, recent physiological recordings have demonstrated that PB-FB columnar neurons convey the head direction representation from the left and right PB to the FB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib319">Shiozaki et al., 2020</xref>), and that, similar to the PEN neurons, PFN activity is likely modulated by self-motion inputs received in the NO (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Currier et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib217">Lu et al., 2020b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib218">Lyu et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib319">Shiozaki et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib326">Stone et al., 2017</xref>). Sensorimotor information may also enter the FB through tangential neuron types whose activity is gated by behavioral state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib384">Weir and Dickinson, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib383">Weir et al., 2014</xref>). Importantly, the FB is also home to a prominent class of columnar output neurons, known as PFL neurons in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib391">Wolff et al., 2015</xref>) and CPU1 neurons in other insects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">de Vries et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">el Jundi et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">el Jundi et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib136">Heinze et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib131">Heinze and Homberg, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib132">Heinze and Homberg, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib135">Heinze and Reppert, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib326">Stone et al., 2017</xref>). These neurons, whose activity has been linked to directed movement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib323">Skutt-Kakaria et al., 2019</xref>), send projections to the LAL, where they contact DNs involved in steering (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib288">Rayshubskiy et al., 2020</xref>). Consistent with this view, some CX neurons in cockroaches have activity that predicts future forward and rotational velocity, and electrical stimulation of the CX evokes stereotyped locomotor responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib223">Martin et al., 2015</xref>). Together, these studies support the view that FB circuits implement head-direction-based navigational behaviors such as straight-line orientation, long-range migration, and visual route following (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib159">Honkanen et al., 2019</xref>). It remains largely unknown how the FB network may support these navigational functions, but a recent study proposed a network model inspired by physiology and anatomy in the bee that could perform vector-based path integration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib326">Stone et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Navigational functions have mostly been associated with ventral FB circuits. In contrast, more dorsal layers have primarily been studied in the context of sleep-wake control (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Dubowy and Sehgal, 2017</xref>). Prominent among these are a population of dorsal FB tangential neurons whose intrinsic excitability tracks sleep need and whose activation induces sleep (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Donlea et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib275">Pimentel et al., 2016</xref>). FB tangential neurons also receive contextual input from the MB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Dag et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib207">Li et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib303">Scaplen et al., 2020</xref>), an important center for learning and memory (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib234">Modi et al., 2020</xref>). Together, the above evidence suggests that context- and state-dependent action selection, including initiating periods of behavioral quiescence, may be governed by the FB.</p><p>Compared to other CX regions, much less is known about the overall structure and connectivity of the FB network. Considering the sheer complexity of the structure’s recurrent circuits, we devote many of the following sections to describing the FB’s columnar organization before we delve into intra-FB connectivity patterns. We then describe the plethora of FB tangential neuron types that form the structure’s layers and that likely provide contextual and state information to the columnar network. We end with two more focused sections, one on the sleep-wake network of the dorsal FB and the other on pathways from the MB to the FB. In ‘Discussion,’ we build on this detailed structural description to propose hypotheses for the roles of different neuron types in FB circuit function.</p><sec id="s2-9-1"><title>Overview of FB structure, neuron types, and major input/output pathways</title><p>The FB is coarsely divided into columns along its medial-lateral axis by four large classes of columnar neurons: PB-FB-*, FX, vΔ, and hΔ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig28">Figure 28A and B</xref>), where ‘*’ and ‘X’ refer to accessory regions of the CX. In addition to these ~60 columnar neuron types, ~150 types of FB tangential neurons divide the FB into nine layers along the dorsal-ventral axis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig28">Figure 28A and C</xref>). Each class of columnar neuron contains many distinct neuron types. Within each type, individual columnar neurons form spatially restricted arbors that innervate type-specific FB layers and, as a population, tile FB columns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig28">Figure 28B and D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig28s1">Figure 28—figure supplement 1</xref>). Compared to the PB, with its spatially segregated glomeruli (nine in each hemisphere), FB columns are not as clearly defined, nor are they clearly visible in light-level images. Instead, FB columnar neurons form a type-specific number of columns (from 6 to 12) and there is considerable variability in how evenly each type tiles the FB. Similarly, FB layers lack clear boundaries, much like the EB’s annuli (i.e., along the radial axis).</p><p>Columnar and tangential neurons also project to regions outside the FB, providing pathways for information exchange with accessory neuropils such as the NO, LAL, CRE, and SMP/SIP/SLP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig28">Figure 28A</xref>). Based on their input from the EPG neurons and the polarity of their arbors, PB-FB-* neurons likely convey head-direction-related information from the PB to the FB (PFN, PFR, and PFGs types; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib319">Shiozaki et al., 2020</xref>), and also from the FB to the LAL (PFL types; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib288">Rayshubskiy et al., 2020</xref>). Two classes of interneurons, the vΔ and hΔ types, are composed of neurons whose arbors are largely confined to the FB, relaying information across layers and columns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig28">Figure 28B and D</xref>). FX neurons are a heterogeneous columnar neuron class whose types primarily arborize in the FB and either the CRE or SMP/SIP/SLP. Similar to FX types, FB tangential neurons heavily innervate the CRE, SMP/SIP/SLP, and LAL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig28">Figure 28C and D</xref>), but often contain additional arbors in type-specific neuropils, such as the NO, EB, or BU, which we detail in later sections.</p></sec><sec id="s2-9-2"><title>The columnar structure of the FB as defined by PB-FB-* neuron types</title><p>Most PB-FB-* columnar types divide the FB into approximately nine columns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig29">Figure 29</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video5">Video 5</xref>), thereby linking the nine glomeruli in the left and right PB to corresponding regions the FB. PFN neurons that innervate layer 1, such as PFNp_a, project to one of nine distinct tooth-shaped structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig29">Figure 29A</xref>). This is consistent with previous light-level anatomy, which described the ventral margin of layer one as being composed of seven distinct teeth plus two ‘cryptic teeth’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib391">Wolff et al., 2015</xref>), together accounting for the nine clusters observed here. Columnar types with arbors in intermediate FB layers, such as the PFNa neurons, are less well clustered, and instead show a more continuous tiling of the FB, but their innervation pattern is also consistent with the existence of approximately nine columns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig29">Figure 29A</xref>). One type, the PFGs neurons, has 18 neurons in total, which fairly evenly tile the FB, dividing it into 9 columns or approximately 18 ‘demi-columns,’ roughly 1 demi-column per neuron (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig29">Figure 29B</xref>; see legend for exceptions to this pattern). Moreover, individual PB-FB-* neurons have neuronal arbors whose width is slightly less than 1/9th of the layer’s width (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig29">Figure 29D</xref>), and the distance between neurons in adjacent columns is 1/9th the layer width on average (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig29">Figure 29E</xref>). One notable exception to this pattern is the PFNd type, which clearly forms eight columns. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig29s1">Figure 29—figure supplement 1</xref> shows morphological renderings and mean column locations for all PB-FB-* types, with the exception of PFL neurons, which we cover in later sections. Overall, the FB innervation of most PB-FB types is consistent with there being approximately nine columns, but there is considerable variability in how evenly each type tiles the FB. Variation in arbor width and spacing determines how much adjacent columns overlap.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig29" position="float"><label>Figure 29.</label><caption><title>Most PB-FB-* neurons form nine columns in the fan-shaped body (FB).</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Morphological renderings of PFNp_a and PFNa populations, colored by column (C1–C9). Left schematic shows location of dendritic (rectangle) and axonal (circles) compartments for the nine FB layers and any associated neuropil. Right panels show zoomed-in views of the FB, revealing a nine-column structure. Notice that PFNp_a columns are clustered while PFNa columns tile the FB more evenly. Note also that neurons innervating the same column often share the same fiber tract. The blue and yellow arrows in the top-right panel mark columns C8 and C9, which are closely spaced but show a clear spatially offset, as shown in panel (<bold>C</bold>). (<bold>B</bold>) Morphological rendering of the 18 neurons composing the PFGs population. Schematic on left as described in (<bold>A</bold>). Left panel shows front view (note that not all cell bodies are visible in this view). Arbor width is variable between cells. In addition, there is more substantial overlap in the dorsal FB arbors. The nine columns defined by this cell type are therefore more distinguishable in the ventral arbors. Right panel grays the nine neurons that project to the right gall, revealing that each column comprises two neurons, one of which projects to the left and the other to the right gall-surround, and that these right- and left-projecting neurons alternate in the FB. This projection pattern breaks the nine columns into ~18 ‘demi-columns,’ one neuron per demi-column, with two exceptions (purple and gray arrows). The purple arrow marks a demi-column which lacks separation from adjacent demi-columns. Similarly, the gray arrow marks a demi-column containing two neurons, whereas all other demi-columns contain one neuron. Whether these are the result of wiring errors requires further investigation. (<bold>C</bold>) Top-down view showing every neuron’s median location for all individual neurons in the PFNp_a, PFNa, and PFGs populations. Notice that while PFNp_a forms nine clear clusters, PFGs tile space more evenly. The distinct clustering seen in the PFNp_a arbors is reflected by the unique, scalloped morphology of layer 1 of the FB. The arrow in the PFNp_a panel points to a neuron that innervates both C1/C2 (assigned to C2) and C9, which is why its synapse location ended up outside of either cluster. (<bold>D</bold>) Distribution of neuronal arbor widths for PFGs, PFN, PFL, and PFR neurons. As shown in the inset, the width (red line) of synaptic point clouds (black dots) from individual neurons was measured along a direction locally tangent to a line bisecting the FB layer (green). To account for differences in layer size, the raw width (red line) was normalized by dividing the length of the layer (green line). Each distribution was normalized to have a peak of 1. The vertical dashed line in the graph marks 1/9th of the layer width, the arbor width that would result from nine evenly spaced columns that have minimal overlap and collectively tile the layer. Notice that most neurons take up slightly less than 1/9th of the layer. Importantly, this measure is independent of the neuron’s column assignment. (<bold>E</bold>) Distribution of inter-column distance, expressed as a fraction of the layer width, as in (<bold>D</bold>). Inter-column distance was measured by calculating the distance between the mean location of pairs of neurons in adjacent columns (as shown in inset), normalized to the length of the

This anatomical mapping conveys the activity bump in the EB to both the left and right PB, generating two bumps that get inherited by CX columnar neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib114">Green et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib364">Turner-Evans et al., 2017</xref>). From this mapping, each PB glomerulus can be assigned an approximate ‘anatomical phase’ that indicates its preferred directional tuning, as defined by its EPG input. PB-FB neurons connect glomeruli in the left and right PB to columnar regions of the FB. However, their projection patterns have not been systematically characterized. Here we take a discrete view of this projection pattern and describe the various ways in which PB-FB types link PB glomeruli to FB columns.</p><p>The projection pattern of two EB columnar types – PEG and PEN – provides a framework for identifying similar patterns in PB-FB columnar neuron projections. First described at the light level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib391">Wolff et al., 2015</xref>), PEG neurons project from PB glomeruli back to the same regions of the EB that provided their input, establishing a ‘default pattern’ where activity bumps from the left and right PB will approximately overlap in the EB. In contrast, PEN neurons project from PB glomeruli back to EB tiles with an ‘anatomical phase shift’ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig17">Figure 17</xref>). This phase shift conveys the activity bumps from the left and right PB to regions approximately ±45° from the EPG bump, a motif that is responsible for updating the EPG bump position (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib114">Green et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib364">Turner-Evans et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>To investigate the mappings from PB glomeruli to FB columns, we first focused on neurons innervating glomeruli R5 and L5. These glomeruli receive input from adjacent wedges in the EB and, therefore, have similar allocentric head direction tuning (22.5° difference; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig16">Figure 16</xref>), ensuring that when a bump is centered at L5 in the left PB there will be a second bump centered between R5/R4 in the right PB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig30">Figure 30Ai</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib114">Green et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib218">Lyu et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib364">Turner-Evans et al., 2017</xref>). Next, we compared the columnar position of the R5 and L5 projections in the FB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig30">Figure 30Ai and Aii</xref>). Two neuron types – PFGs and PFR_a – were found to map R5 and L5 to the same FB column, C5, consistent with the absence of any phase shift since these similarly tuned neurons project to overlapping regions in the FB. When we extended the PB-FB mapping to the other neurons in these types, we found that this projection pattern was circularly symmetric, leading to a consistent, approximately 0° phase shift across the populations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig30">Figure 30Aiii</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video6">Video 6</xref>). Thus, for PFGs and PFR_a neuron types, we would expect activity bumps carried by the left and right PB populations to overlap in the FB (see bottom of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig30">Figure 30Ai</xref>), regardless of bump location (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig30">Figure 30Aiii</xref>). As described previously (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig19">Figure 19E</xref>), each PB-FB type innervates a variable number of PB glomeruli across the population. PFGs innervate all nine glomeruli in the left and right PB, and their 0° phase shift provides one means of assigning an approximate phase to each FB column. Importantly, PFGs map glomeruli R1/R9 and L1/L9 to columns C1 and C9, respectively, suggesting that these outer FB columns share a similar anatomical phase (as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig30">Figure 30Ai and Aii, Bi and Bii</xref>), consistent with a circular representation. The projection pattern of PFR_a neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig30">Figure 30Aiii</xref>), which only innervate the medial eight glomeruli in the left and right PB, also supports this notion.</p><fig id="fig30" position="float"><label>Figure 30.</label><caption><title>PB-FB-* neurons have type-specific phase shifts in fan-shaped body-to-protocerebral bridge (PB-to-FB) projections.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) PFGs and PFRa neurons connect PB glomeruli to FB columns with no phase shift.

Based on EB-to-PB columnar neuron projection patterns (EPG neurons, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig16">Figure 16</xref>), when a bump is centered at L5 in the left PB, a second bump will be centered between R5/R4 in the right PB (both marked in purple). With no phase shift in their projection pattern, neurons innervating R5/L5 both project to C5 in the FB.

That is, PFN neurons connect PB glomeruli to FB regions using a one-column contralateral phase shift. This phase shift implies that PFN populations from the left and right PB would generate spatially shifted activity bumps in the FB that will be separated by ~90° (see bottom of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig30">Figure 30Bi</xref>).

As quantified further below (Figure 34), the precise magnitude of PB-FB phase shifts and FB column phase is also continuous and can be estimated using PB-FB connectivity since these phase shifts will depend on how postsynaptic neurons in the FB sample from their PB-FB inputs. As with the PEN neurons, whose phase shifts appear strongly linked to their function of shifting the EPG bump in the EB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib114">Green et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib364">Turner-Evans et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib365">Turner-Evans et al., 2020</xref>), we believe that the PB-FB phase shifts offer insights as to the likely navigational function of each of these neuron types (outlined in ‘Discussion’).

Median neuron locations are shown for layer 1, where most vΔ types have primarily dendritic arbors, as well as the dorsal layer containing the most synapses, where vΔ types have axonal arbors. Neurons are colored by column (see legend). Gray neurons indicate those vΔ neurons that project to both C1 and C9, which we refer to as C0. Instead of marking median neuron location in the bottom panels, the gray dots mark the median location of the two arbors. Note that most vΔ neuron types show a highly variable columnar structure.</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-66039-fig31-figsupp1-v4.tif"/></fig><fig

Neurons are colored by column in a way that preserves left- and right-projecting pairs (see legend). Note that hΔ neuron types make a variable number of columns and that some types show a tighter columnar structure than others.</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-66039-fig31-figsupp2-v4.tif"/></fig></fig-group><p>Two of these pontine neuron types are not FB interneurons, but rather are neurons that bring information into the FB from other CX structures. The vΔA_a neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig31">Figure 31Ai</xref>) have mainly postsynaptic specializations in the AB, a mysterious structure at the base of the FB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib174">Jenett et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib263">Pascual et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib392">Wolff and Rubin, 2018</xref>) that we discuss later, and send arbors up throughout the dorsal most layers of the FB. The hΔK neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig31">Figures 31Bi</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">10F</xref>), by contrast, each innervate wedge-shaped regions of the EB, which vary in size and coverage, and columns in intermediate FB layers before projecting to more dorsal layers of the FB. These neurons could carry head direction information directly from the EB to the FB, bypassing the PB, but their connectivity in the FB suggests that they may also be related to behavioral state, a topic we return to in a section focused on sleep circuits (Figure 53). With the exception of the vΔA_a, a subset of vΔA_b that innervates the AB, and hΔK neurons, all other vΔ and hΔ neuron types are interneurons whose arbors are restricted to the FB.</p><p>There are many different types of vΔ neurons, each distinguished by the layer(s) that they innervate, by the vertical distance between their multiple (usually two) arbors, and by the spread of each arbor. These different vΔ types are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig31s1">Figure 31—figure supplement 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video8">Video 8</xref>. Note that although some neuron types, such as the vΔH, form nine FB columns, most types vary in how cleanly, as a population, they tile each layer that they innervate. Similar to PB-FB columnar neurons, even types with a disorganized columnar structure can be assigned to the discrete nine-column scheme based on the average location of their arbor (see Materials and methods), which provides a convenient means to assess their relative columnar positions. Interestingly, all vΔ types also contain one or more individual neurons that project bilaterally to both C1 and C9, which we refer to as ‘C0’ (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig31">Figure 31Ai</xref>). These neurons provide further support that columns C1 and C9 correspond to similar anatomical phases since they receive shared into from individual C0 neurons.</p><media mimetype="video" mime-subtype="mp4" id="video8" xlink:href="elife-66039-video8.mp4"><label>Video 8.</label><caption><title>Morphological renderings of the vΔ neurons.</title><p>Each of the vΔ cell types is shown in order as follows: the vΔA_a, vΔA_b, vΔB, vΔC, vΔD, vΔE, vΔF, vΔG, vΔH, vΔI, vΔJ, vΔK, vΔL, and vΔM neurons. Each neuron has been assigned to one of nine (loosely defined) FB columns, and is color coded accordingly. For each cell type, example neurons are shown first, followed by the entire population. Each cell type also has neurons that arborize in both column 1 and column 9. These neurons are shown in gray, and an example of one multi-columnar neuron from each population is shown after the entire population is displayed.</p></caption></media><p>All hΔ neurons have two horizontally separated arbors within the FB, one of which is predominantly presynaptic (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig31">Figure 31B</xref>). Each hΔ type has matching left- and right-projecting neuron pairs whose two arbors largely overlap. As a population, both the right- and left-projecting populations tile all FB columns. The many hΔ types are distinguished by the layer(s) that they innervate and by the horizontal spread of their arbors. These different types are shown in detail in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig31s2">Figure 31—figure supplement 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video9">Video 9</xref>. By contrast with the nine-column tiling of the vΔ neurons, some hΔ types divide the layers they innervate into 12 columns, such as the hΔA and hΔL neurons, others into 8 columns, such as the hΔD and hΔH neurons, and one, the hΔF, into just 6 columns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig31s2">Figure 31—figure supplement 2</xref>). In most cases, the population of neurons within each type neatly tile the layers that they innervate (see, e.g., the hΔH and hΔM neurons). Overall, the structure of the hΔ and vΔ backbone provides an avenue to determine the direction of information flow through the intra-FB columnar network, which we discuss in a later section (Figure 37).</p><media mimetype="video" mime-subtype="mp4" id="video9" xlink:href="elife-66039-video9.mp4"><label>Video 9.</label><caption><title>Morphological renderings of the hΔ neurons.</title><p>Each of the PB-FB columnar cell types is shown in order as follows: the PFGs, PFL1, PFL2, PFL3, PFNa, PFNd, PFNm_a, PFNm_b, PFNp_a, PFNp_b, PFNp_c, PFNp_d, PFNp_e, PFNv, PFR_a, and PFR_b neurons.

These types do not have arbors in the PB.

FR types send projections to the ROB; FS types send projections to the SMP/SIP/SLP regions; and FC types send projections to the CRE. With few exceptions, FR and FS types have primarily postsynaptic arbors in the FB and presynaptic specializations in their extra-FB neuropil (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig28s1">Figure 28—figure supplement 1</xref>), potentially forming additional columnar output pathways, as discussed in the CX outputs sections.

We now turn our focus to connectivity within the intra-FB network and describe how columnar information may flow from PB-FB inputs to columnar outputs.</p><p>Much of the FB’s columnar input comes from the PFN neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig33">Figure 33A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig33s1">Figure 33—figure supplement 1</xref>, see also <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig26">26</xref><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig19">Figures 19</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig25">25</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig26">26</xref>), which have postsynaptic specializations in both the PB and NO. Some of the PFN types also make synapses within their type in the FB columns that they innervate – much like the PEN neurons in the EB. Though there are direct connections between PFN neurons and columnar FB output neurons in the FB, the majority of PFN synapses are to vΔ, hΔ, and FC neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig33">Figure 33A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig33s1">Figure 33—figure supplement 1</xref>). Thus, much of the input to the FB passes into a multilayer, multicolumn intra-FB network. To gauge the ‘depth’ of the intra-FB network, we quantified the different ‘path lengths’ from PFN inputs to columnar FB output neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig33">Figure 33Bi</xref>) (see Materials and methods). For example, PFNa neurons have direct connections to PFL1 neurons. This is a path length of 1. PFNa neurons also have indirect connections to PFL2 neurons through first hΔJ and then hΔH neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig33">Figure 33Bi and Bii</xref>). This is a path length of 3. We found that direct connections from PFN neurons to output neurons are relatively sparse, while many more two- or three-step pathways can be traced through hΔ and/or vΔ neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig33">Figure 33Bii</xref>). While highly recurrent, the intra-FB network can therefore roughly be thought of as being 3–4 layers deep, though we note that this analysis does not include the FB tangential neurons.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig33" position="float"><label>Figure 33.</label><caption><title>Fan-shaped body (FB) columnar type to columnar type connectivity.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The type-to-type connectivity between FB columnar neuron types arranged in a three-layer network diagram.

The connectivity shows clear indications of preferred pathways and subnetworks. For example, the PFNa/FC1/PFL1 types are primarily connected to one another, with only sparse connections to other FB neuron types. These types therefore form their own subnetwork within the FB (below the line in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig33">Figure 33A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig33s1">Figure 33—figure supplement 1</xref>). Examining this subnetwork at the individual neuron level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig33">Figure 33C</xref>), we found that the connectivity patterns in the subnetwork largely matched the columnar overlap of the different constituent neurons. However, we found that direct connections from individual PFNa neurons to PFL1 neurons were not as strong or as consistent across neurons as direct connections from PFNa neurons to FC1 neurons. FC1 neurons themselves send their outputs to a putative motor area (CRE), to PFL1 neurons within their column, and to other FC neurons. Thus, the indirect pathways from PFNa to FC1 to PFL1 may contribute more to PFL1 activity than the direct PFNa to PFL1 connections. These indirect pathways point to the importance of depth in FB networks.</p><p>To parse additional subnetworks in the FB, we next grouped neuron types based on common connectivity patterns – specifically, their upstream and downstream partners (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig33s2">Figure 33—figure supplement 2</xref>, and Materials and methods). We expected that types within a subnetwork would share common upstream and downstream partners. Indeed, the FC1 neurons clustered together based on both their inputs and outputs, a clear signature of the PFNa/FC1/PFL1 subnetwork. The vΔF, vΔG, vΔH, and vΔI neurons also clustered together (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig33s2">Figure 33—figure supplement 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig33s3">Figure 33—figure supplement 3</xref>). However, most neuron types that share an upstream cluster split into multiple downstream clusters (and vice versa). This splitting suggests that the intra-FB network cannot, through columnar connectivity alone, be cleanly split into multiple subnetworks. Instead, information is propagated throughout the FB, across layers and columns. However, we note that FB tangential neurons may ‘gate’ some of these pathways, allowing for a clean functional separation of subnetworks. We return to this topic in the ‘Discussion.’</p></sec><sec id="s2-9-7"><title>PB-FB columnar connectivity: preserved phase shifts without functional lateralization</title><p>The anatomical projection pattern of PB-FB neuron types suggests that they convey activity bumps from the left and right PB to the FB, but with type-specific phase shifts, as described above (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig30">Figure 30</xref>). In particular, the projection pattern of PFGs and PFR_a types suggests that they convey the activity bumps from the left and right PB to overlapping columnar locations in the FB, establishing a ‘default’ mapping between PB glomeruli and FB columns. In contrast, all PFN types have a one-column contralateral phase shift, predicting that the left and right activity bumps will end up ~90° apart in the FB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig34">Figure 34A</xref>). Consistent with this notion, these anatomical phase shifts impact PB-FB neurons’ connectivity with their downstream targets in the FB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig34">Figure 34B, C</xref>). For example, PFNa neurons that innervate glomerulus R5 synapse onto FC1B neurons in C6, and L5 neurons synapse onto FC1B neurons in C4, consistent with their anatomical projection pattern (top panel, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig34">Figure 34C</xref>). More nuanced morphological characteristics also affect connectivity. For example, PFNp_a neurons, which arborize in spatially restricted regions of the FB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig29">Figure 29</xref>), primarily connect single PB glomeruli to single FB columns, while PFNa neurons, which have slightly wider FB arbors, connect single PB glomeruli to several adjacent FB columns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig34">Figure 34C</xref>). Thus, PB-FB phase shifts structure columnar input to the FB network.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig34" position="float"><label>Figure 34.</label><caption><title>Protocerebral bridge to fan-shaped body (PB-FB) projection patterns determine FB neuron’s phase shift and directional tuning.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic of a PB-to-FB projection pattern showing the one-column contralateral phase shift employed by PFN types, as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig30">Figure 30B</xref>.

(<bold>D</bold>) Scatter plot showing the estimated directional tuning of FB neurons as a function of their medial-lateral position. For every v∆, h∆, or FX neuron postsynaptic to a PB-FB type, directional tuning was estimated by assigning angles to PB-FB neurons according to the PB glomerulus they innervate and by taking a circular mean across all angles inherited by the postsynaptic FB neuron, weighted by connection strength (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib218">Lyu et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig34s1">Figure 34—figure supplement 1</xref>, and Materials and methods).

Note that PFR_b, PFNp_a, and PFNp_d types were excluded from this analysis due to inconsistent downstream connectivity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig35">Figure 35</xref>) or because they exclusively target h∆ types on both axonal and dendritic compartments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig37">Figure 37</xref>), both of which complicated phase shift estimates (see Materials and methods).

For individual neurons to have a 90° phase shift, they must sample from presynaptic PB-FB neurons that innervate at least two PB glomeruli (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig34s1">Figure 34—figure supplement 1B</xref>).</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-66039-fig34-v4.tif"/></fig><fig id="fig34s1" position="float" specific-use="child-fig"><label>Figure 34—figure supplement 1.</label><caption><title>Estimating protocerebral bridge-fan-shaped body (PB-FB) phase shifts and directional tuning of FB neurons.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic showing angular assignments of PB glomeruli based on the projection pattern of EPG neurons from the EB to the PB.

(<bold>B</bold>) Schematics showing several commons ways in which FB neurons (v∆, h∆, or FX) sample from presynaptic PFN neurons to generate phase shifts that are ~90°. Each neuron’s phase shift is computed as the phase difference between the average angles inherited from the left PB population and the angles it inherits from the right PB population. In taking the average from the left/right populations, the circular mean is weighted by connection strength from each presynaptic neuron. As shown in the left and middle panels, if an FB neuron samples from PB-FB neurons that innervate only two glomeruli (one on the left, one on the right), its phase difference will either be 112.5° or 67.5° since no left-right pair of PB glomeruli are separated by 90°. Instead, if a postsynaptic neuron is to have a 90° phase shift, it must sample from more than two glomeruli, as shown in the right panel.

However, as noted above (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig29">Figures 29</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig31">31</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig32">32</xref>), FB columnar neurons form a type-specific number of columns and there is a large variability in how evenly each type tiles the FB. This raises the possibility that the directional tuning of FB neurons may vary continuously according to their medial-lateral position in the FB. To assess this possibility, we used connectivity to infer the directional tuning of FB neurons by taking circular means of the phases that FB neurons inherit from their presynaptic PB-FB inputs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib218">Lyu et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig34s1">Figure 34—figure supplement 1</xref>). This analysis revealed a strong correlation between FB neurons’ medial-lateral position and their estimated directional tuning (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig34">Figure 34D</xref>). Consistent with the notion that the FB inherits a sinusoidal activity bump from the PB, the medial and lateral borders are tuned to similar phases, as expected for a circular representation. In addition, FB neurons’ directional tuning is quite evenly distributed, suggesting that, rather than forming discrete columns that are consistent across neuron types, FB neurons can take on a range of angles that is largely determined by their medial-lateral position and, therefore, the subset of PB-FB inputs that they sample from.</p><p>This approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib218">Lyu et al., 2020</xref>) also allowed us to estimate the magnitude of the PB-FB phase shift for PB-FB neuron types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig34">Figure 34E</xref>). In agreement with our projection-based analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig30">Figure 30</xref>), PFGs and PFR_a were found to have anatomical phase shifts close to 0°. In contrast, all PFN neuron types have an ~90° phase shift, with some variability across neuron type. To investigate the source of PFN phase shift variability, we analyzed how individual FB neurons sample from the left and right PB-FB populations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig34">Figure 34F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig34s1">Figure 34—figure supplement 1</xref>). Consistent with our angular assignments in the PB, FB neurons that sample from just two distinct angles – one from the left PFN population and one from the right PFN population – have phase shifts that are usually 67.5 or 112.5° (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig34">Figure 34F</xref>). This is because no left-right pair of glomeruli is separated by 90° (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig34s1">Figure 34—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Instead, neurons with a 90° phase shift sampled from at least three PB glomeruli. This effect explains some of the type-to-type variability in PFN phase shifts. For example, FB neurons that receive input from PFNa neurons have phase shifts very close to 90° since they mostly sample from at least three glomeruli (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig34s1">Figure 34—figure supplement 1C</xref>), likely due to PFNa neurons’ wide FB arbors, as mentioned above. In contrast, neurons that receive input from PFNp types often sample from just two glomeruli that are 112.5° apart. This may be because PFNp types form spatially clustered arbors in the ventral FB, which favors a more restricted connectivity pattern, as mentioned above. Since this effect reflects the diverse ways in which FB neurons sample from the left and right PB populations, it is unlikely to be due to the precise angles assigned to PB glomeruli. We return to the potential functional role of PB-FB phase shifts in the context of vector navigation in ‘Discussion.’</p><p>These PB-FB projection patterns raises the possibility that the bumps conveyed from the left and right PB could propagate independently through the FB network, a scenario we refer to as ‘functional lateralization.’ Does the FB network’s connectivity support such a scenario? One signature of lateralization would be that PFN neurons from different sides of the PB might project to different neuron types in the same FB columns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig35">Figure 35A</xref>). However, we found no systematic differences in left versus right PFN inputs to different downstream FB neuron types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig35">Figure 35B</xref>). A second signature of lateralization might be PFN neurons from different sides of the PB projecting to distinct neurons within a downstream type, perhaps organized by demi-columns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig35">Figure 35C</xref>). However, we found that the input contributions of left and right PB neurons were very similar for most downstream neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig35">Figure 35D</xref>). Although there are some exceptions to this rule, these exceptions are almost all neurons with both weak and inconsistent connections at the population level (small dots to the top left of the plot in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig35">Figure 35E</xref> and an absence of large dots at the top right). Note that the PFNd neurons do preferentially and consistently make lateralized connections with other PFNd neurons. That is, within the FB, PFNd neurons from the left PB synapse onto PFNd neurons from the right PB, and those from the right PB onto those from the left PB, but neither population makes synapses with other PFNd neurons from the same side of the bridge (see arrow in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig35">Figure 35E</xref>). Thus, consistent with physiological reports from some PB-FB neuron types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib319">Shiozaki et al., 2020</xref>), the bumps from the left and right PB are likely to be summed by each downstream FB neuron type, rather than multiple bumps that might then be processed independently within the FB. Note, however, that this does not rule out the possibility of multiple activity bumps arising from <italic>different</italic> PFN types, the navigational implications of which we explore in ‘Discussion.’ Note also that although there appears to be no lateralization in the context of FB bump dynamics, there is considerable asymmetry in how some FB neurons from the left and right halves of the structure project to the AB.</p><fig id="fig35" position="float"><label>Figure 35.</label><caption><title>Right and left PB-FB-* populations target the same FB neuron types and neurons.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic showing one potential mechanism – type-specific targeting by left and right PB-FB-* populations – by which activity from the left and right PB could propagate through separate FB channels.

With few exceptions (e.g., PFNd-to-PFNd), strong and consistent connections have downstream neurons that receive input from both left and right PB populations (low lateralization). This rules out the model from (<bold>C</bold>). Note that a small jitter was introduced so that overlapping points could be resolved.

As suggested by its name, the structure is notable for having distinctly different sizes on either side of the midline, with the right side typically being larger than the left (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib174">Jenett et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib263">Pascual et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib392">Wolff and Rubin, 2018</xref>). There is some evidence suggesting that flies with an AB that is roughly equal in size in both the right and left hemisphere have reduced long-term memories of shock-associated odors as compared to their more asymmetric conspecifics, though their short-term memories are unaffected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib263">Pascual et al., 2004</xref>). Neurons in the AB have also been associated with fructose feeding preference (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib244">Musso et al., 2021</xref>). The AB may therefore serve multiple functional roles. Indeed, the AB receives inputs from many different brain regions, including the SMP, SIP, ATL, and CRE, and sends its outputs primarily to the dorsal and ventral layers of the FB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig36">Figure 36B</xref>). Pathways upstream from the AB inputs primarily originate in the LH, though clock neurons, the AL, vPNs, and other sources also appear (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig36s1">Figure 36—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Many of the AB neuron types that innervate the FB have been described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib392">Wolff and Rubin, 2018</xref>), but we identified two new types that primarily get input in the AB: the FS4A and FS4B neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig36">Figure 36C</xref>).

The left AB primarily connects the vΔA_a neurons with the SA3 neurons, while the right AB connects many more types of AB neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig36">Figure 36D</xref>). Another notable feature is that FB-AB columnar neurons that arborize in the right half and center of the FB send processes to the right AB, while neurons that arborize in the left FB send processes to the left AB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig36">Figure 36E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig36s1">Figure 36—figure supplement 1B</xref>). This is in stark contrast with the NO, whose left and right halves both receive PFN projections from all FB columns. The FB targets of AB-FB neurons are varied, including tangential, vΔ, and hΔ neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig36">Figure 36F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig36s1">Figure 36—figure supplement 1C</xref>).

Even PFNv neurons, which have presynaptic sites within the PB, do not receive much columnar input in the FB, making recurrent columnar loops unlikely. This suggests that the FB acts as a way station along a feedforward pathway, receiving a PB bump – modified by input from accessory structures like the NO – before initiating actions by transmitting commands to premotor centers. However, also in contrast to the EB, the FB is characterized by dense and highly specific intercolumnar and interlayer recurrent connections between different neuron types. This connection matrix likely strongly influences bump dynamics and enables recurrent network dynamics <italic>within</italic> the structure. We now focus on describing the most prominent motifs in this network.</p><p>As described in a previous section (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig31">Figure 31</xref>), the backbone of the FB’s recurrent network is a 2D grid formed by the hΔ and vΔ neurons. More generally, all FB columnar types can be divided into two broad categories based on the morphology of their neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig37">Figure 37A</xref>). The processes of ‘vertical’ neuron types are largely confined to a single column and include all PB-FB-*, FX, and vΔ types. ‘Horizontal’ hΔ neuron types, by contrast, have processes in two distinct columns. As depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig37">Figure 37A</xref>, these vertical and horizontal neuron types connect to each other in several different ways. Importantly, however, the connectivity between different vertical and horizontal types closely respects some simple rules. We found that connections were typically either localized to the same column (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig37">Figure 37Bi</xref>), jumped half the width of the FB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig37">Figure 37Bii</xref>), or did both (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig37">Figure 37Biii</xref>). In this last case, a presynaptic neuron in one FB column synapses onto postsynaptic hΔ neurons, some with primarily dendritic arbors in the column and some with primarily axonal arbors in the column. Because hΔ neurons are assigned to columns based on the location of their dendritic arbor, this connectivity motif produces two diagonal bands in the column-to-column connectivity matrix (bottom panel of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig37">Figure 37Biii</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig37" position="float"><label>Figure 37.</label><caption><title>The intra-fan-shaped body (intra-FB) columnar network is built from a small number of circuit motifs.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) FB columnar neurons can be divided into vertical and horizontal types.

Note that hΔ neurons are named according to the column containing their dendritic arbor, which impacts the connectivity matrix structure, as shown in the examples in (<bold>B</bold>). Vertical and horizontal neurons give rise to four connection types. vertical-to-vertical (V to V), vertical-to-horizontal (V to H), horizontal-to-horizontal (H to H), and horizontal-to-vertical (H to V).

See legend in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig37s1">Figure 37—figure supplement 1</xref> for details.

(<bold>Bi</bold>) Motifs that generate a diagonal column-to-column connectivity matrix.

Excitatory connections would shift the bump by 180° while inhibitory connections would maintain its phase (bottom panel). (<bold>Biii</bold>) Motifs that could produce a column-to-column connectivity matrix with two diagonal bands. Excitation and inhibition could produce a double-bump pattern, as shown in the bottom panel. Alternatively, if the axonal compartment receives inhibitory input and the dendritic compartment receives excitatory input, a single bump would be preserved (not shown). (<bold>C</bold>) Scatter plot showing that FB connectivity matrices can be grouped into one of the three motifs. Each circle in the scatter plot marks the location of a single connectivity matrix in principal component space.

Principal component analysis (PCA) was performed using a matrix containing all connectivity vectors (n = 903 connectivity matrices), and each vector was projected onto the largest two PCs (PC1 and PC2). Circles are colored according to pre-to-post connection type (see legend). Note that the large majority of connectivity matrices correspond to motifs 1 and 2 (diagonal point clouds), whose orthogonality is preserved in PC space.

For example, a column-matched excitatory connection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig37">Figure 37Bi</xref>) would preserve the phase of the bump, but if that connection were inhibitory, it would shift the bump by half the width of the FB (roughly 180° in azimuth). Similarly, a connection across half the FB’s width might shift the bump by 180°, if it happens to be excitatory, or keep it in place (0°) if it were inhibitory (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig37">Figure 37ii</xref>). We analyzed the complete set of connectivity matrices (see, e.g., the bottom row of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig37">Figure 37Bi–iii</xref>) between all vertical and horizontal types using principal components analysis (PCA) and found that the three broad intercolumnar motifs that we identified accounted for most of the variance across the entire set (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig37">Figure 37C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig37s1">Figure 37—figure supplements 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig37s2">2</xref>, see Materials and methods). Not knowing the neurotransmitters and receptors involved in these motifs, we cannot exactly say how the activity bump from the PB is modified by the FB network. However, the connectivity strongly suggests that azimuthal comparisons and transformations of activity bumps are a key function of much of the FB’s recurrent circuitry. We describe the potential significance of these specific motifs for bump-driven navigational computations in ‘Discussion.’</p><p>We now turn to the other axis of information flow in the FB, the vertical axis. As noted in a previous section, the PFN neurons provide the FB with most of its columnar input. These neurons target the ventral layers of the FB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig38">Figure 38A</xref>) – in fact, most PFN neurons target layers 1 and 2, while PFNa, PFNd, and PFNv types target layers 3 and 4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig28s1">Figure 28—figure supplement 1</xref>). The PFR and PFGs types are the exception to this rule, with presynaptic specializations up to layer 6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig28s1">Figure 28—figure supplement 1</xref>). When we examined the 2D grid of neuron types formed by the FB’s interneurons, we found a discernable vertical direction to information flow within the structure. Specifically, most of the intra-FB columnar neurons transfer information from the ventral layers of the FB to the dorsal layers, as can be seen from the distribution of their postsynaptic and presynaptic specializations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig38">Figure 38B and C</xref>). Both the hΔ and vΔ types receive most of their extra-FB columnar input in their ventral arbors and provide output in their dorsal arbors (as denoted by the dark circles being consistently higher than light circles in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig38">Figure 38D</xref>). The FB output neurons do not appear to selectively get input from the lower FB layers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig28">Figure 28</xref>), suggesting that the dorsal flow of information in the FB is primarily used in intra-FB computations.</p><fig id="fig38" position="float"><label>Figure 38.</label><caption><title>Δ neurons in the fan-shaped body (FB) preferentially take input in lower FB layers and output to upper FB layers.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) All presynaptic sites for all the PFN neuron types.

While most types target one FB layer, some, such as FB1I, target multiple layers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig40">Figure 40Bi</xref>). Separately, while most types have processes external to the CX, some, such as FB4Z, are intrinsic FB interneurons, with no external processes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig40">Figure 40Bii</xref>). Notably, not all FB tangential neurons uniformly fill their layer. FB4Z, for example, sends out selective processes to target specific partners within layer 4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig40s1">Figure 40—figure supplement 1B</xref>). There is also considerable variability in where the FB tangential neurons arborize outside of the CX. For example, the FB tangential neurons in layers 3–5 preferentially send processes to the LAL and CRE, while the upper layers tend to target the SMP/SIP/SLP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig40">Figure 40C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig40s2">Figure 40—figure supplement 2</xref>). Finally, in stark contrast with EB ring neurons, most FB tangential neurons consist of only one or two neurons per side (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig40">Figure 40D</xref>). We found no clear evidence of side preference for neurons originating on the right or left within a given type. Neurons from both sides target PB-FB columnar neurons from both sides of the PB. The small number of neurons per type suggests that they convey specific, uniform information to their targeted layer(s).</p><p>The number of different FB tangential neurons that provide output to any given FB layer and the diversity of brain regions from which they draw their inputs suggests that every computation that the FB participates in is likely modulated by context. Precisely what these modulatory influences are is largely unknown. They could be purely sensory, for example, or they could convey the state of the animal. However, some hints may come from the upstream partners of the different FB tangential neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig40">Figure 40E</xref>). For example, MB output neurons preferentially target layer 4 (which will be discussed in the next section). The LH, which receives direct olfactory, thermosensory, and hygrosensory input and multisensory inputs from the visual, mechanosensory, and gustatory systems as well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Dolan et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib308">Schlegel et al., 2020</xref>), is part of input pathways that project to most FB layers. vPNs, AL neurons, and the courtship-associated Fru neurons are also upstream of many FB tangential types. This diverse array of upstream partners could convey a range of contextual cues to layers throughout the FB.</p><p>Although little is known about most of the FB’s tangential neurons, there are some exceptions. Most notably, dorsal FB tangential types are known to be involved in sleep-wake control (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Artiushin and Sehgal, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Donlea, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Dubowy and Sehgal, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib141">Helfrich-Forster, 2018</xref>), a topic we return to below (Figures 48–53). In addition, a recent study focused on the LH identified an FB tangential neuron type they called PV5k1, which, when optogenetically stimulated under closed-loop visual conditions, leads to a reduction in the fly’s wingbeat frequency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Dolan et al., 2019</xref>). The neurons targeted by the GAL4 lines used in that study likely correspond to FB2H_a, FB2H_b, and/or FB2I_b, neuron types that target some hΔ neuron types and also the PFL2 and PFL3 neuron types, consistent with the direct influence on the fly’s behavioral patterns (see later sections on PFL neurons). Another recent study found that FB tangential neurons that target layer 6 encode food choice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib298">Sareen et al., 2020</xref>). Inhibiting these neurons made hungry flies more likely to eat bittersweet food with 500 mM sucrose instead of purely sweet food with 50 mM sucrose. The activity of these neurons was also shown to encode the food choice.</p><p>The ExFl1 neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib212">Liu et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib383">Weir et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib405">Young and Armstrong, 2010b</xref>), which are likely the FB2B_a and/or FB2B_b neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig41">Figure 41A</xref>), have also been characterized. These neurons respond to progressive optic flow and are strongly modulated by whether or not the fly is flying (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib383">Weir et al., 2014</xref>), providing a potential indication the motor state of the animal. Information from the FB2B_a neurons is fed to other FB tangential neurons, FB interneuron types (including some hΔ and vΔ neurons), intermediate types (such as the FC neurons), and output neurons (such as the FR neurons, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig41">Figure 41B</xref>). The FB2B_a neurons also get input in the FB from the other layer 2 FB tangential neurons and from the columnar FC1 neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig41">Figure 41C</xref>).

In such a situation, the tangential neurons could be ideally placed to provide information about positive or negative reinforcers, a function typically carried out in the fly brain by DANs. Indeed, several FB tangential neurons are known to be DANs (discussed further below), as indicated by the gray bars in the connectivity matrix in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig42">Figure 42</xref>. DANs are not the only neuromodulatory neurons amongst the FB tangential neurons. It is likely that several other FB tangential neurons may be modulatory and peptidergic, but we could only confirm one additional such neuron, the octopaminergic OA-VPM3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig42">Figure 42</xref>, first row in the connectivity matrix).</p><p>Overall, the FB tangential neurons primarily target the intra-FB network and rarely target the PFN neurons, the major source of columnar input to the FB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig42">Figure 42</xref>).

However, in contrast to the ring neurons, there are far fewer neurons in each FB tangential type, and their subnetworks seem less tightly clustered, making it more difficult to detect hierarchies amongst the potential contextual inputs (squares marked in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig43">Figure 43</xref>). Like the ring neurons, all tangential neurons of the FB, including the DANs, also receive considerable intra-FB input near their presynaptic sites in the FB, (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig44">Figure 44A</xref>), much of it from their targets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig44">Figure 44B</xref>).</p><p>We also examined the connectivity matrix within and across different FB tangential neuron types at the level of individual neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig45">Figure 45A</xref>). Similar to the ring neurons, a subset of FB tangential types have reciprocal connections between the individual neurons within that type. For example, FB2I neurons interact strongly with each other, and these interactions are spread uniformly across columns within their layer of innervation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig45">Figure 45B</xref>). If these interactions are inhibitory, as is the case with ring neurons, such connectivity may facilitate a competition between similar contextual inputs that are vying to influence navigational computations based on the columnar position of the bump. We revisit this possibility in ‘Discussion.’</p><fig id="fig45" position="float"><label>Figure 45.</label><caption><title>Several fan-shaped body (FB) tangential neuron types show all-to-all connections that resemble connectivity patterns within and between ER neuron types.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Neuron-to-neuron connectivity matrix for the FB tangential types.

Our knowledge of the precise nature of these signals has been limited by a lack of extensive characterization of inputs to these less structured brain regions. A notable exception is the set of inputs that arrive from the MB. The MB is thought to be a center for associative learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Cognigni et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib234">Modi et al., 2020</xref>). It receives inputs from nearly all sensory modalities, is innervated by multiple types of DANs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib207">Li et al., 2020</xref>), and provides an architecture to flexibly convert sensory information from thousands of Kenyon cells (KCs) into experience-dependent (and DAN-mediated) valence signals carried by the MB’s output neurons, the MBONs. MBONs broadcast these valence signals to other areas of the brain, but how these signals drive the fly’s behavioral responses is not fully understood. In this section, we analyze pathways connecting the MB and the CX. Communication between these structures may play an important role in sleep (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Dubowy and Sehgal, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib321">Sitaraman et al., 2015</xref>), memory consolidation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Berry et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Dag et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Donlea, 2019</xref>), context-dependent feeding decisions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib298">Sareen et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib304">Scaplen et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib303">Scaplen et al., 2020</xref>), and perhaps also the conversion of the MB’s valence signals into goal-directed actions during navigation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Collett and Collett, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib340">Sun et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>As described in a companion paper on the MB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib207">Li et al., 2020</xref>), about half of the MBONs directly synapse onto FB tangential neurons that target the middle layers (4–6) of the FB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig46">Figure 46A</xref>). Some MBONs contact only a single type of FB tangential neuron. For example, MBON09 connects exclusively to FB4R (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig46">Figure 46Bi</xref>).

The glutamatergic MBON30 neuron type targets the LCNOp neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig46">Figure 46Biv</xref>) that themselves feed the PFNp columnar neurons. The strength of these direct connections varies widely.

To begin to address this question, we looked at the connectivity between these neuron types within the dFB, where their arbors overlap most strongly and where the majority of their presynaptic sites reside (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig50">Figure 50</xref>). Plotting neuron-to-neuron connectivity revealed a densely recurrent network, but with variable connection strengths, even across neurons of the same type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig50">Figure 50A</xref>). Not surprisingly, given its more ventral arbors, the dopaminergic FB5H neuron type lacks direct connections with the types present in R23E10. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig50">Figure 50B</xref> shows a network graph of the connectivity between R23E10 neuron types and the two remaining DAN types. The network can be roughly divided into two clusters: one containing layer 6 neurons and the other layer 7 neurons. Each cluster contains both putative sleep-promoting R23E10 neuron types and a putative wake-promoting DAN type. Importantly, the two DAN types make reciprocal connections to nearly every 23E10 neuron in their layer. This simple motif resembles the classic ‘flip-flop’ circuit model of brain state regulation thought to underlie sleep-wake control in mammals (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib297">Saper et al., 2010</xref>). In this model, wake-promoting and sleep-promoting neuron types have reciprocal inhibitory connections, ensuring that only one population is active at a time.

We found that the dFB sleep-wake neuron types have the potential to influence a large number of neuron types both inside and outside the FB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig51">Figure 51</xref>). Sleep-wake types target both columnar and tangential neuron types within the FB, and also have downstream targets in the SMP/SIP/SLP, consistent with the presence of mixed arbors in these regions. Similarly, many upstream neuron types have the potential to influence the sleep-wake neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig52">Figure 52</xref>), especially through inputs to their dendritic arbors in SMP/SIP/SLP (see early section on ‘Assessing the relative importance of different synaptic inputs’). Within the FB, many of the neurons upstream of sleep-wake neuron types are also downstream of sleep-wake types, forming recurrent loops. For example, FB6A and FB6C_b are reciprocally connected with OA-VPM3, a wake-promoting octopaminergic neuron type with processes spanning many brain regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib251">Ni et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib313">Seidner et al., 2015</xref>). The physiological relevance of these candidate upstream and downstream connections remains to be determined, providing many targets for future physiological investigation.</p><p>Previous studies have suggested that a recurrent loop links sleep-wake circuits in the dFB with those in the EB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Donlea et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib214">Liu et al., 2016</xref>), but identifying the neurons and pathways involved has proven challenging. To address this, we constructed a network graph that contains the dFB types identified above, a few of their main partners, as well as previously reported CX sleep-wake neuron types: ER5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib214">Liu et al., 2016</xref>), ExR1 (i.e., ‘helicon cells’; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Donlea et al., 2018</xref>), and ExR3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib215">Liu et al., 2019</xref>). This analysis revealed that three neuron types – ExR1, ExR3, and hΔK – directly link sleep circuits in the EB with those in the dFB through distinct channels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig53">Figure 53</xref>).</p><p>ExR1 and ExR3 form a subnetwork in the EB with extensive reciprocal connections involving ER5 and ER3d types. ER5 neurons are known to be involved in homeostatic sleep control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib214">Liu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib285">Raccuglia et al., 2019</xref>) and receive circadian input from the anterior-projecting DN1 pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib119">Guo et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib202">Lamaze et al., 2018</xref>). ER5 neurons also synapse onto EL neurons, which target nearly all other ring neuron types in the EB (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10F</xref> for network graph). This may allow ER5 neurons to impact activity throughout the EB circuit. ER3d neurons innervate the inferior-posterior portion of the BU, a region known to contain glomeruli that lack ipsilateral or contralateral visual receptive fields (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib257">Omoto et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib318">Shiozaki and Kazama, 2017</xref>). In addition, ER3d neuron types are targeted by a driver line that labels neurons expressing the 5HT7 serotonin receptor and have been previously implicated in the serotonergic ExR3 sleep-wake circuit of the EB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig53s1">Figure 53—figure supplement 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib215">Liu et al., 2019</xref>). Finally, hΔK neurons have purely dendritic inputs in the EB, where they receive input predominately from PEN_b neurons. This may be one pathway by which the head direction signal, whose amplitude correlates with the fly’s locomotor activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib364">Turner-Evans et al., 2017</xref>), can be passed directly to dFB circuits.</p><p>ExR1, ExR3, and hΔK neurons all send projections to the dFB, where they connect with distinct clusters (indicated as gray regions in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig53">Figure 53</xref>). The largest cluster consists of a recurrent FB network that includes PFGs, a putative neuromodulatory columnar type (as discussed in a later section), FB6A neurons, which are contained in 23E10, as well as ExR3 and hΔK neurons. While this cluster is anchored by FB6A, it seems likely that even sleep-wake neuron types that lack direct connections with ExR1 and hΔK may be able to influence their activity since sleep-wake neuron types are recurrently connected, as described above.</p><p>These results identify a complex network that may allow for communication between sleep-wake circuits in the FB and those in the EB. However, the vast majority of the input and output to sleep-wake neuron types involve additional pathways, most of which have not been functionally characterized, as described above. For example, most of the output from dFB sleep-wake neuron types is onto other FB neurons, raising the possibility that inducing sleep may involve previously unrecognized neuron types and pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Dag et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib355">Tomita et al., 2020</xref>). For example, Lei, Keleman et al. (in preparation) have identified the neuron that corresponds to the sleep-promoting split-GAL4 line SS57264 described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Dag et al., 2019</xref> as FB2B_a. This neuron is not connected to the R23E10 neurons by the columnar neurons in a single step, so these sleep-promoting mechanisms are not obviously coordinated.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s2-10"><title>Pathways that leave the CX: feedback, motor output, and more</title><p>In the preceding sections, we focused on characterizing the connectivity patterns of different structures within the CX. We now turn our attention to potential output pathways from the CX. The CX is thought to communicate with the motor centers through the PFL neurons in the LAL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib124">Hanesch et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib132">Heinze and Homberg, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib245">Namiki and Kanzaki, 2016</xref>), where they contact DNs involved in the control of steering (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib288">Rayshubskiy et al., 2020</xref>). Here we systematically analyzed the circuits downstream of CX neurons in all CX accessory structures and constructed a more complete picture of all CX outputs. We show that, besides being involved in a large number of recurrent loops back into the CX, CX output neurons are upstream of numerous circuit modules that span most of the brain’s neuropils.</p><p>We began by examining the projection patterns of all core CX neuron types that contact neurons in other brain regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig54">Figure 54A</xref>). These neurons target a narrow column around the CX that extends through the BU, GA, CRE, LAL, SPS, WED, RUB, ROB, SMP, SLP, IPS, and SPS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig54">Figure 54A and B</xref>), as partially described in previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib124">Hanesch et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib207">Li et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib210">Lin et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib288">Rayshubskiy et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib391">Wolff et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib392">Wolff and Rubin, 2018</xref>). The neural projections and synapse locations within these regions appear to largely segregate by type (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig54">Figure 54B</xref>). Different types of neurons contribute very different numbers of synapses to their target areas, from tens of synapses for some FB tangential neurons to more than 10,000 synapses for PFL3 neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig54">Figure 54C</xref>).

We describe these different targets in more detail in subsequent sections.</p><p>Different pathways out of the CX show varying degrees of divergence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig55">Figure 55E</xref>). Divergence here refers to the number of new neuron types reached at each network layer. For example, pathways that start at EL, ER6, ExR1, FB6Q, or FB6T neurons reach very few neuron types overall, suggesting that the information in these pathways does not spread widely. By contrast, pathways that start at PFL3 and FS1A neurons reach many different neuron types within a few hops, suggesting that information from these types is widely shared across the brain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig55">Figure 55E</xref>). The number of types reached partially reflects the difference in synapse numbers (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig55">Figure 55E</xref> to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig54">Figure 54C</xref>).

The GA appears to primarily house recurrent connections between CX neurons, creating CX-to-CX recurrent loops that may allow EB columnar neurons to form connectivity patterns independent of their EB arborizations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig56">Figure 56D</xref>). For example, all EPG and PEG neurons arborize in the GA. Depending on which EB wedge the neurons innervate, they target either the dorsal or ventral GA compartment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig56">Figure 56E</xref>; this compartment specificity was previously described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib391">Wolff et al., 2015</xref>). In their respective compartments, EPG neurons then synapse onto PEG neurons, resulting in a checkerboard-like connectivity pattern (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig56">Figure 56D</xref>). As a result, each set of columnar neurons innervating one GA subcompartment comprises four tiles separated by 90° increments. The functional significance of this motif is currently unknown. A few non-columnar types also participate in recurrent motifs between the GA and the EB. ER6, one of the few ring neuron types that does not connect to EPG neurons in the EB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig56">Figure 56Fii</xref>), is recurrently connected to both EPG and PEG neurons in the GA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig56">Figure 56D</xref>), and to PEG neurons in the EB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig56">Figure 56F</xref>). ExR6 also outputs to the EPG neurons in the GA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig56s1">Figure 56—figure supplement 1A</xref>), and ExR6 and EPG neurons are recurrently connected in the EB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig14s3">Figure 14—figure supplement 3</xref>). Finally, it is worth noting that EPG neurons also receive strong input from a LAL neuron of unknown function in the GA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig56s1">Figure 56—figure supplement 1A</xref>). In summary, the GA mostly hosts recurrent connectivity motifs between EPG, PEG, and a defined subset of ER and ExR neurons.</p><p>Some columnar neuron types, such as the EL and PFGs neurons, do not target the GA proper. Instead, they target an undefined region surrounding the GA termed the GA surround (GAs). In the GAs, EL neurons appear to primarily form all-to-all connections to other EL neurons from the same hemisphere (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig56">Figure 56D and Fi</xref>). Curiously, neither the EL neurons nor the PFGs neurons make many synapses in the GAs. We therefore looked in the EM images for evidence of other signaling mechanisms. We found that the synapses formed by both PFGs and EL neurons are elongated-bar (E-bar rather than T-bar) synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib316">Shaw and Meinertzhagen, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib345">Takemura et al., 2017a</xref>) and that they contain dense core vesicles (DCVs) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig56s1">Figure 56—figure supplement 1B–D</xref>). DCVs have been associated with neuropeptide or neuromodulator release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Burgoyne and Morgan, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib123">Hammarlund et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib248">Nassel and Winther, 2010</xref>), suggesting that synaptic activity in the GA may be broadly regulated in ways that have not yet been explored.</p><p>The round body (ROB) and rubus (RUB) are innervated by the FB columnar PFR and FR neurons, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig56">Figure 56C</xref>). Both PFR types arborize in the ROB. There, PFR_a receives input only from PFR_b, while PFR_b neurons make all-to-all within-type connections as well as a number of output connections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig56s2">Figure 56—figure supplement 2A and B</xref>). The most significant connection in the ROB appears to be from PFR_b to the only non-CX neuron targeting a large extent of the ROB, LAL002, which in turn connects to several other non-CX neurons in the LAL and CRE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig56s2">Figure 56—figure supplement 2B and C</xref>). Similar to PFR neurons in the ROB, only one of the FR neurons, FR1, forms strong within-type all-to-all connections in the RUB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig56s3">Figure 56—figure supplement 3A</xref>). However, unlike in the ROB, both FR1 and FR2 make connections to non-CX partners in the RUB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig56s3">Figure 56—figure supplement 3B</xref>). Notably, the sets of downstream partners as well as the output pathway circuits of FR1 and FR2 are largely distinct (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig56s3">Figure 56—figure supplement 3B and C</xref>). Thus, while the ROB and RUB contain recurrent connections between CX columnar neurons like the GA does, they differ from the GA in that they can also be considered CX output structures. Some of their outputs will be described in later sections.</p></sec><sec id="s2-10-2"><title>CX feedback pathways through other regions</title><p>CX output neurons that project to other regions that are less tightly linked to the CX – like the LAL, CRE, or SMP – also participate in feedback pathways.

Feedback constitutes only 25% of total pathway weights out of the PFL neurons, and the ExR8 neuron type contributes virtually nothing to pathways that feedback into the CX. This corresponds to differences between output neuropils. Most synapses made by CX output neurons in the LAL, WED, and PS are to ‘true’ outputs pathways that leave the CX, whereas the situation is more mixed in regions like the CRE and SMP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig56">Figures 56A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig57">57A</xref>).</p><p>Unsurprisingly, the major input types of the CX – ER neurons and FBt neurons – are the main recipients of synapses from feedback pathways (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig57">Figure 57A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig57s1">Figure 57—figure supplement 1</xref>). Some columnar types are also targeted by feedback pathways, and these pathways usually involve columnar-to-columnar recurrence, similar to the motifs we described in the GA, ROB, and RUB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig57">Figure 57B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig57s1">Figure 57—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Moreover, only weak feedback pathways connect EB and FB neurons. EB columnar neurons and ExR neurons mostly talk between themselves (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig56">Figure 56</xref>, see also <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig15">Figure 15</xref>), whereas FB neurons mostly reach FB tangential neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig56">Figures 56B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig57">57A</xref>). EB-FB and FB-EB pathways <italic>outside</italic> the CX are largely absent and weak when present because EB neurons and FB neurons innervate nonoverlapping areas outside of the CX (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig54">Figure 54B</xref>) and therefore form few direct connections between each other in these accessory regions. However, there are a few notable exceptions. For example, the PFL types participate in output pathways that feed back into the EB through ER and ExR neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig57">Figure 57Ci and Cii</xref>). Additionally, PFL2 and PFL3 neurons reach several LAL-NO neuron types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig57">Figure 57Ci and Ciii</xref>). Since the PFL2 and PFL3 neurons are hypothesized to carry motor commands (see ‘Discussion’), these pathways from the PFL neurons to the EB and NO could be used to bring self-motion information back into the CX in the form of efference copies.</p></sec><sec id="s2-10-3"><title>Network motifs involving CX neurons with external projections</title><p>Above we described how CX-neuron-to-CX-neuron connections outside of the CX are most commonly made between neurons originating in the same core CX structure (EB or FB). We next asked if these same neuron types also connect inside the CX, and if so, what types of motifs best captured their connectivity patterns inside and outside the CX (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig58">Figure 58</xref>). Following the same line of analysis that we used for analyzing ExR connectivity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig15">Figure 15</xref>), we distinguished three possible motifs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig58">Figure 58A</xref>): ‘canonical feedback,’ ‘parallel connections,’ and ‘linked targets.’ The ‘canonical feedback’ motif corresponds to cases in which CX output neurons make synapses outside of the CX onto other CX neurons, which, in turn, project back to a core CX structure in which they contact the original output neurons. For example, PFL1 neurons provide convergent input to FB2B_b neurons, which then feed back onto PFL1 neurons in the FB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig58">Figure 58B</xref>). Similar feedback motifs have frequently been found to be involved in inhibitory gain control and gating (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib393">Womelsdorf et al., 2014</xref>). In our example, if FB2B_b were to be inhibitory, it would potentially allow PFL1 neurons to regulate the timing and magnitude of their output. The fact that many ER neurons are known to be inhibitory makes gain control through feedback loops a potential function of those motifs in the EB. The second motif involves ‘parallel connections’ from one type onto another in multiple structures. For example, neurons of the tangential type FB6T synapse onto neurons from the ipsilateral FB6E type in both the SMP/SIP and the FB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig58">Figure 58C</xref>). The function of such a motif is not clear, but it is likely to depend on the extent to which electrical activity in these neurons is compartmentalized. The third and final motif involves neurons projecting to ‘linked targets.’ These recurrent subnetworks are composed of multiple neuron types that connect to each other in the CX while sharing a common input outside the CX. A prominent example of such a case is the FB8F_a neuron type that projects to a set of FB6 neurons interconnected in the FB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig58">Figure 58D</xref>). This linked target motif could allow a CX output neuron to regulate the activity of a group of CX neurons as a whole.</p><fig id="fig58" position="float"><label>Figure 58.</label><caption><title>Central complex (CX-to-CX) motifs.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic of the three motifs considered and their equivalent representation in a compact circular network plot.

Motifs are formed by the relation between those pathways outside of the CX and the connections formed inside of the CX by the same CX neurons. ‘Canonical feedback’ corresponds to the target of the pathway contacting the source type in the CX (yellow). ‘Parallel connections’ occur when the source neurons also contact the pathway target neuron inside the CX (red). ‘Linked targets’ are neurons connected in the CX that are targets of the same neuron outside of the CX (green).

Such recurrence could help sustain ring attractor dynamics in the EB-PB network. In the FB, the columnar neurons making the strongest contributions to downstream networks outside the CX (PFL, FS, and PFR_b neurons) almost exclusively form canonical-feedback motifs. These neuron types constitute the main channels by which the CX communicates with the rest of the brain and likely modulates the fly’s actions; feedback inhibition – if indeed it is inhibition – could enable greater temporal precision and faster switching between different actions while also controlling the amplitude of these outputs. Finally, the linked-target motif is predominant in the dorsal layers of the FB.

The majority of external targets receive significant input from only one CX type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig59">Figure 59C</xref>). This segregation of targets stems from the anatomical segregation of the CX neurons synapses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig54">Figure 54B</xref>) and is maintained several synapses downstream (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig59s1">Figure 59—figure supplement 1</xref>).

This suggests that heading or head direction information may be lost in downstream partners and that the output modules could act as simple functional units (see ‘Discussion’).</p></sec><sec id="s2-10-5"><title>Known neuron types reached by CX output pathways</title><p>Although the majority of pathways that exit the CX lead to poorly characterized neurons, we did find many well-identified targets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig60">Figure 60A and B</xref>). These targets include neuromodulatory or peptidergic neurons, MBONs, vPNs, and DNs, among others. Of these, some of the most prominent are MBONs receiving input from FR, FS, PFR_b, and FB8F_a pathways, vPN neurons receiving input from ExR8 and PFL3 pathways, and the DNs targeted by PFL2 and PFL3 pathways (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig60">Figure 60C</xref>). We discuss these pathways in more detail below.</p><fig id="fig60" position="float"><label>Figure 60.</label><caption><title>Connections to identified types.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Normalized pathway weights (see Methods <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig3">Appendix 1—figure 3</xref> and Materials and methods) of pathways that end on various known types.

These functions are, in part, mediated by interactions between MBONs and DANs. In the previous section (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig46">Figures 46</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig47">47</xref>), we focused on direct and indirect inputs from MBONs to the CX. We now turn our attention to information flow in the reverse direction. Such interactions could enable the CX to trigger the consolidation of courtship memories by driving DANs that project to the MB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Dag et al., 2019</xref>). More generally, these connections could play a role in modulating the learned behaviors that the MBONs are thought to drive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Aso et al., 2014b</xref>).</p><p>The FR, FS1, FS2, and PFR_b neuron types, and one type of FB tangential neuron type (FB8F_a), all send outputs to a weakly connected subnetwork of PPL DAN and MBON neuron types. This network is mostly located in the CRE and SMP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig61">Figure 61A–B</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video20">Video 20</xref>). In that network, two MBON types receive direct input from one CX neuron type each: MBON30, from FR1 neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig61">Figure 61D</xref>, also discussed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib207">Li et al., 2020</xref>), and MBON27, from FS1B neurons. MBON27 and MBON30 are both ‘atypical MBONs,’ which receive some of their synaptic inputs outside the MB. This is to be expected as no CX neurons project directly to the MB. Within this network, single PPL and MBON neurons form small local subcircuits, interconnected by uncharacterized CRE and SMP neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig61">Figure 61B–E</xref>). Interestingly, most of the prominent dopaminergic targets of the CX are PPL neurons innervating the MB. Only one PPL neuron in that set does not innervate the MB (PPL107). Neurons from the PAM cluster receive much weaker contributions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig61">Figure 61A</xref>). PPL neurons are thought to carry punishment signals in the MB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Aso and Rubin, 2016</xref>), in contrast with the reward-associated PAM cluster. It would therefore appear that the CX could modulate learning in the MB by preferentially targeting punishment signaling neurons. Since this modulation is coming from columnar neurons of the FB, it is possible that the CX modulates punishment signals in an orientation-dependent manner.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig61" position="float"><label>Figure 61.</label><caption><title>Connections to mushroom body output neurons (MBONs), dopaminergic, and antennal lobe neurons.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Pathway weights (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig3">Appendix 1—figure 3</xref>) from the central complex (CX) to MBONs, dopaminergic (DANs), and antennal lobe neurons for which the total pathway weight is greater than 0.05%, colored by the CX type of origin.

The MBONs in this subnetwork are not among the strongest MBON inputs to the CX (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig46">Figures 46</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig47">47</xref>). There is therefore no strong recurrent loop between the CX and the MB. One interesting exception is MBON30, which is weakly connected to some LAL-NO neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig46">Figures 46</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig47">47</xref>). MBON27, on the other hand, is known to receive inputs from visual KCs in the MB and projects to DNs in the LAL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib207">Li et al., 2020</xref>). Finally, MBON20 neurons, which are reached by PFR_b through a somewhat separate network (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig61">Figure 61B</xref>), are themselves strongly linked to two DNs, DNp42 and DNb05 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib207">Li et al., 2020</xref>). DNp42 is required for innate aversive olfactory behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib164">Huoviala et al., 2020</xref>). Besides the preferential targeting of punishment associated DANs, this is another indication that the CX to MB link may modulate aversion.</p><p>Two other neurons are associated with this CX to MBON subnetwork: mALD1, a giant AL neuron of unknown function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig62s1">Figure 62—figure supplement 1C</xref>) and the large inhibitory oviposition interneuron oviIN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig61">Figure 61B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig61s1">Figure 61—figure supplement 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib377">Wang et al., 2020</xref>). These large neurons lie at the intersection of MB and CX outputs, where they can be flexibly modulated by both; this may be ideal for their potential role in triggering or modulating entire behavioral programs like oviposition.</p></sec><sec id="s2-10-7"><title>Interactions with visual projection pathways</title><p>Few of the vPNs, outputs from the optic lobes to the central brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib237">Mu et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib261">Panser et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib394">Wu et al., 2016</xref>), reach the CX. Instead, many vPNs interact fairly directly with motor pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib246">Namiki et al., 2018</xref>). Nevertheless, we found links between CX outputs and a few vPNs, suggesting that the CX may selectively modulate specific, direct visuomotor pathways.</p><p>Four types of CX output neurons (PFL1, PFL3, PFR_b, and ExR8 neurons) interact with visual pathways (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig62">Figure 62A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig62s1">Figure 62—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video17">Videos 17</xref>–<xref ref-type="video" rid="video18">18</xref>). Pathways originating from the PFL1, PFL3, and PFR_b neurons all target the output areas of a subset of vPNs. The PFL3 and PFL1 neurons reach three lobula columnar (LC) neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig62">Figure 62B–G</xref>), whereas PFR_b indirectly contacts a range of lobula and medulla neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig62s1">Figure 62—figure supplement 1</xref>). In all these cases, connections are axo-axonal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig62">Figure 62C, E and G</xref>), meaning that these CX pathways likely regulate the output of the vPNs. Moreover, these connections are often reciprocal, which indicates that the vPNs also regulate the CX output pathways that target them. Finally, we also found that despite being reciprocally connected the CX output pathways only share a small fraction of their outputs with the vPNs they target (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig62s2">Figure 62—figure supplement 2</xref>). In short, FB output pathways and a select set of direct visuomotor pathways have the potential to influence each other’s outputs. These reciprocal connections may allow the direct visuomotor pathways and indirect CX-mediated pathways to compete for control of the fly’s actions.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig62" position="float"><label>Figure 62.</label><caption><title>Connections to visual projection neurons (vPNs).</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Total pathway weights (see Materials and methods and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig3">Appendix 1—figure 3</xref>) from the central complex (CX) to vPNs for which the total pathway weight is greater than 0.05%, colored by the CX type of origin.

These kinds of neurons are generally thought to convey information about specific visual features (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib394">Wu et al., 2016</xref>), but the details of which neurons convey which features are still incomplete. Of the neurons found here, only one type, LC10, has been investigated for its function. LC10 neurons, which interact with PFL3 pathways in the AOTU (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig62">Figure 62D and E</xref>), have been shown to be essential to the small object tracking system used by males to follow females during courtship (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib290">Ribeiro et al., 2018</xref>). The interaction between PFL3 and LC10 pathways could therefore prioritize changes of direction driven by the small object tracking system versus those driven by the CX. The other LC type in contact with PFL3, LC33 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig62">Figure 62B and C</xref>), was first described in the hemibrain dataset (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib306">Scheffer et al., 2020</xref>). Interestingly, in both cases, PFL3 pathways are only connected with a subset of the LC neurons of a given type, suggesting that the visuomotor pathways influenced by (and influencing) the CX output pathways have specificities beyond the feature specificity conferred by individual vPN types. The LC type in contact with PFL1 pathways, LC27 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig62">Figure 62F and G</xref>), was also first described in the hemibrain dataset (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib306">Scheffer et al., 2020</xref>). Given the predominance of the PLP and PVLP in PFL1 outputs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig59">Figure 59Di</xref>), and the fact that the optic glomeruli are positioned at the PVLP and PVLP/PLP boundary, it is possible that PFL1 output pathways interact with other LC neurons that are not presently identified or that are only partially traced in the volume.</p><p>In contrast with those axo-axonal connections made between FB output pathways and visual columnar neurons, the ExR8 output pathway contacts ‘centrifugal’ (CH) visual neurons, that project from the central brain to the optic lobes. Specifically, ExR8 reaches the dorsal centrifugal horizontal (DCH) and ventral centrifugal horizontal (VCH) neurons in the PS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig62">Figure 62H1</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video22">Video 22</xref>). CH neurons, whose response properties have been characterized in the blowfly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib130">Hausen, 1976</xref>), are part of the horizontal-motion-sensing network of the lobula, where they are both pre- and postsynaptic. However, these neurons receive the majority of their inputs in the central brain. In blowflies, the VCH and DCH neurons are both nonspiking and inhibitory, and they confer their motion sensitivity to at least one of their downstream targets, the small-object-motion-sensitive FD1 neuron (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Egelhaaf et al., 1993</xref>). All these neurons respond to motion both in the ipsilateral (front-to-back) and contralateral (back-to-front) direction. The FD1 neuron, in particular, has been hypothesized to suppress motion responses during saccades (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib144">Hennig et al., 2011</xref>). The ExR8 to CH projection is therefore one place where the CX can directly influence sensory processing (in this case, visual motion processing). The ExR8 have not yet been functionally characterized, but are unusual for an ExR neuron type in that they seem like ‘true’ CX output neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig57">Figure 57A</xref>). In addition to its EB inputs, the ExR8 neuron type receives input in the ipsilateral NO1 from PEN_b neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig25">Figure 25B</xref>). ExR8 could therefore relay information about angular velocity from the fly’s movements to circuits that detect visual motion and potentially suppress the visual responses that are the consequences of the animal’s own movements.</p></sec><sec id="s2-10-8"><title>CX outputs to the motor system</title><p>As mentioned above, the CX is known to play a role in determining the fly’s movements. Movements are controlled through DNs, which carry motor commands from the central brain to the VNC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib160">Hsu and Bhandawat, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib246">Namiki et al., 2018</xref>). Light microscopy has enabled the identification of a few LAL-projecting CX neuron types that may link the CX to DNs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib124">Hanesch et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib134">Heinze and Homberg, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib210">Lin et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib391">Wolff et al., 2015</xref>). A complete connectome should, in principle, allow us to identify all CX to DN neural pathways. However, the limited volume of the hemibrain has permitted at most one-third of these neurons to be identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib306">Scheffer et al., 2020</xref>). We used the identified DNs to focus our analysis of CX output neurons, while noting that a larger number of CX output neurons that project to other brain areas and to as-yet-unassigned neural segments might well make contributions to DNs that were difficult to identify in the hemibrain volume.</p><p>The main source of CX input to DNs comes from PFL2 and PFL3 neurons, with additional smaller contributions from ExR7, ExR8, and FR2 neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig63">Figure 63A</xref>). Multiple DN types receive strong PFL2/PFL3 inputs. Most prominent among these are DNa02, DNa03, DNa04, and DNb01 neuron types, as well as a putative DNg neuron (5813078378). DNa02 is known to be involved in turning in walking flies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib288">Rayshubskiy et al., 2020</xref>). DNa02, DNa03, DNa04, and DNb01 share inputs to varying degrees, suggesting that they could be part of an interacting premotor network. Since head direction- and heading-related information present in the FB is lost at the first synaptic relay in the LAL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig59s5">Figure 59—figure supplement 5</xref>), the only obvious simple way asymmetries can arise downstream of the PFL neurons are through uneven innervation on the right or left side of the brain. All PFL2 neurons project to identical neurons on both sides of the brain, whereas left PFL3 neurons only contacts neurons in the right LAL, and vice versa. Consequently, the DN network is influenced symmetrically by PFL2 neurons and asymmetrically by PFL3 neurons. This is consistent with the hypothesis that PFL2 neurons control forward walking and/or fixation in flight, and that PFL3 neurons control turning. In such a scheme, turns in walking flies would be controlled by asymmetric modifications of the fly’s gait (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">DeAngelis et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib331">Strauss and Heisenberg, 1990</xref>) and turns in flight by asymmetric changes in wing kinematics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib239">Muijres et al., 2015</xref>), both modulated by PFL3 neurons. No other CX output neurons appear to be in a position to execute such a function (also see ‘Discussion’). It is interesting to note that the DN neurons in question innervate a variety of leg and wing neuropils in the VNC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib246">Namiki et al., 2018</xref>), suggesting that control of different actuators is somewhat integrated or coordinated in the LAL. PFL2 and PFL3 neurons also reach the moonwalker neuron MDN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Bidaye et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Feng et al., 2020</xref>), which has a bilateral innervation pattern and is known to drive backward walking. This connection is almost exclusively contralateral (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig63s1">Figure 63—figure supplement 1A and B</xref>), a suggestion that the MDN could also be involved in asymmetric behaviors.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig63" position="float"><label>Figure 63.</label><caption><title>Connections to descending neurons.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Pathway weight (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig3">Appendix 1—figure 3</xref> and Materials and methods) from the central complex (CX) to descending neurons (DNs) for which the total pathway weight is greater than 0.05%, colored by CX type of origin and separated by their putative ventral nerve cord (VNC) innervation.

The LAL targets of PFL2 neurons on a given side contribute mostly to ipsilateral networks, while PFL3 neurons tend to also reach contralateral DNs through strong connections to midline crossing LAL neurons. Such neurons have been shown to function in flip-flop circuits mediated by inhibition in the silkworm moth brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib170">Iwano et al., 2010</xref>) and could participate in modulating left-right asymmetries in the activity of the output network (see ‘Discussion’). More generally, the heavily recurrent LAL networks could participate in the integration and coordination of activity between the different DNs.</p><p>ExR7 also indirectly reach some DNs in this network (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig63">Figure 63B</xref>). Additionally, we observed that ExR8 neurons target, through PS neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig63s1">Figure 63—figure supplement 1C–E</xref>), a different set of DNs thought to innervate neck and haltere neuropils (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib246">Namiki et al., 2018</xref>). This connection, taken together with the ExR8 connection to the CH neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig62">Figure 62H and I</xref>), suggests that ExR8 could play a role in controlling head movements and their interplay with optic flow signals.</p><p>Finally, FR2 reaches DNp32 through a SMP interneuron (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig63s1">Figure 63—figure supplement 1F</xref>).

However, we did notice that PFL neurons that innervate certain PB glomeruli consistently provide stronger inputs to their downstream targets in the LAL than PFL neurons coming from other glomeruli. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig64">Figure 64</xref> shows that the outputs of the left PFL3 neurons are strongest for the individual PFL neurons that innervate PB glomerulus L3. This observation can partly be explained by the difference in the number of neurons that innervate each glomerulus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig24s1">Figure 24—figure supplement 1</xref>).

L3 and R3 are ~180° apart; when the bump is in L3, it is also near R7 and vice versa. Therefore, if the EPG bump of activity was in L3 or R3 and passed to the PFL3 neurons, the asymmetries in PFL3 output would then generate a turn. Only when the PFL3 outputs are symmetric, in R5/L5, would no turn be generated (see ‘Discussion’). Input to the PFL3 neurons in the FB could confer flexibility on such a scheme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib288">Rayshubskiy et al., 2020</xref>). Interestingly, the inhomogeneities we observed are strongest for the LAL interneurons targeted by the PFL3 neurons rather than their direct connections to the DNs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig64">Figure 64A</xref>).

This asymmetry is likely related to the fact that these neurons innervate the AB. The innervation pattern in the FB is denser on the side that does not go to the AB. FS4A prominently targets neurons projecting to the flange (FLA) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig65">Figure 65B</xref>). The FLA, also known as the dorsal tritocerebrum, belongs to the SEZ and is thought to control food intake (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib127">Hartenstein et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib286">Rajashekhar and Singh, 1994</xref>), suggesting that FS4A neuron may be involved in directing feeding behaviors. What role this asymmetry could play in feeding behaviors is unclear. It is however reminiscent of the recent report that neurons linking the AB to the dorsal layers of the FB (likely vΔA_a) play a crucial role in coordinating feeding behaviors to fructose sensing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib244">Musso et al., 2021</xref>).</p><fig id="fig65" position="float"><label>Figure 65.</label><caption><title>Asymmetric connection to the flange (FLA).</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Connectivity matrix between FS4A_L and its direct downstream partners outside of the central complex (CX), on the right side of the brain.

Beyond brain regions that are directly downstream of CX output neurons (e.g., the LAL for PFL neuron types, the CRE for FC, FR, and PFR neuron types, the SMP/SIP for the FS neuron types), a few other, more distant neuropils reappear regularly in these downstream circuits. The IB and ATL are targeted by prominent neurons in the PFL3, FS3, FC2C, and PFR_b downstream networks. The lateral part of the PLP is part of the PFL1, FC1E, and FR1 networks. As mentioned before, LC neuron output circuits likely also innervate some parts of the lateral PLP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib306">Scheffer et al., 2020</xref>). The ExR8 and a FS1B networks reach ventral brain regions (SPS/IPS down to the GNG).

There are also indications of interactions between CX-related output circuits and more direct visual output pathways, suggesting that these different sensorimotor pathways may differentially modulate each other during specific behavioral contexts. The more dorsal output networks of the FB, which act through other columnar neurons (FC, FS, FR, and PFR_b), are likely involved in modulating and directing behaviors that depend on the animal being correctly oriented in its surroundings. Those behaviors could be innate, like oviposition or feeding, or learned and influenced through the CX to MBON network. A prominent feature of nearly every layer of these output circuits is strong feedback to the CX, indicating that information related to the fly’s intended actions is relayed back to the core CX structures. All these output circuits are also densely recurrent, a feature that should enable fine-tuning and coordination during action selection. Despite the incompleteness of our analyses, it is clear that information from the CX influences a wide variety of targets across the brain, from neurons that arborize in sensory systems to DANs and DNs.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Recent physiological and anatomical studies at the light and EM level have highlighted strong links between circuit structure and function in the adult fly central brain.

In the ‘Results’ sections, we have provided a detailed description of CX neuron types and circuits, with a particular focus on extracting and examining network motifs from the perspective of what we currently know about CX circuit function and CX-mediated behavior. We found many repeating motifs, raising the possibility that an understanding of the computational roles of some of these may generalize to others. Some of these motifs match those that have been proposed previously to implement ring attractors for head direction computation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib163">Hulse and Jayaraman, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib365">Turner-Evans et al., 2020</xref>). Others seem suitable for gain control in multiple structures. And still others seem to be ideal for vector computations that would be required for robust navigational behaviors. We found that information from the CX’s output neuron types is broadcast through fairly segregated pathways that are distributed across the brain, not just to premotor centers but to sensory regions and, importantly, back into the CX itself. In the sections that follow, we discuss some functional implications of these motifs and of other results from our analyses. We derived these functional implications not just from our connectomic analyses and the historical precedent of structure predicting function in many different neural circuits, but also on published physiological and behavioral studies. Testing the hypotheses that we outline below will require a long series of functional experiments, but the connectome provides an invaluable guide for the design and prioritization of such experiments.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>EM circuit reconstruction: how complete is complete enough?</title><p>The value of EM-level connectomes in understanding the function of neural circuits in small and large brains is widely appreciated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abbott et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib211">Litwin-Kumar and Turaga, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib307">Schlegel et al., 2017</xref>).

As part of our analysis of the CX connectome, we found that although increased proofreading led to an expected increase in the number of synaptic connections between neurons, it did not necessarily lead to significant changes in the relative weight of connections between different neuron types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref>). While it is important to note that we made comparisons between the hemibrain connectome at fairly advanced stages of proofreading in the CX, our results do suggest that it may be possible to obtain an accurate picture of neural circuit connectivity from incomplete reconstructions.

Although the involvement of some of these neuron types, for example, PFGs neurons, in sleep-wake circuits suggests a plausible scenario for state-dependent modulation of CX circuits, such explanations are not easily available in all cases.</p><p>It is important to note that our use of relative weights to assess synaptic strength was informed by observed correlations between synapse counts and the area of synaptic contact in larval <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Barnes et al., 2020</xref>), and the dependence of synaptic strength on synaptic surface area, at least in the mammalian neocortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib148">Holler-Rickauer et al., 2019</xref>). We expect relative weights to provide only an approximate measure of true functional strength. Further, synapses across the <italic>Drosophila</italic> brain undergo structural changes depending on the time of day, sleep, activity, and the animal’s specific experiences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Bushey et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib199">Kremer et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib282">Pyza and Meinertzhagen, 1999</xref>); properly accounting for the impact of such factors on connectivity patterns would require comparisons across multiple connectomes. Also, as previously discussed, the hemibrain connectome does not capture glial networks or gap junctions. Despite all these limitations, the identification of chemical synapses between CX neurons and examining their relative weight based on synapse counts allowed us to extract network motifs that make strong predictions about function. We discuss these insights in the following sections.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>What the CX’s network motifs tell us about its navigational computations</title><p>Many flexible, goal-driven behaviors unfold over longer durations than fast reflexive responses and are robust to the temporary loss of sensory cues directly associated with the goal. Desert ants, for example, use path integration to return to their nests after long foraging trips in relatively featureless landscapes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib381">Wehner, 2020</xref>), and mammals use working memory to perform delayed match-to-sample tasks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib293">Romo et al., 1999</xref>). For such behaviors, brains are believed to rely on intermediate representations and neural dynamics that persist or update even in the absence of direct sensory inputs. Such persistent representations have long been believed to be generated, updated, and maintained by recurrent attractor networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Brody et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Durstewitz et al., 2000</xref>). These more abstract intermediate representations also enable disparate sensory and self-motion cues of different modalities to be registered to a shared reference frame. A path integrating ant, for example, may use such a representation to register cues from polarized light, visual optic flow and proprioception (but see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib269">Pfeffer and Wittlinger, 2016</xref>) and all Diptera likely need to register visual and haltere input, as flesh flies do (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib184">Kathman and Fox, 2019</xref>). Ultimately, information in these reference frames must still be dynamically converted to a body-centered reference frame for situation-appropriate action. Decades of experimental work in a variety of species have led theorists to propose gain fields for the implementation of such coordinate transformations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Andersen et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib278">Pouget and Sejnowski, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib279">Pouget and Snyder, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib295">Salinas and Abbott, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib412">Zipser and Andersen, 1988</xref>), but the predicted neural circuit connectivity has not been directly identified. In addition, for an animal to learn from experience, any past associations of the current context with good or bad outcomes must be recalled and used to modify neural dynamics at the level of such intermediate representations, raising computational questions that have been explored in the field of reinforcement learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib341">Sutton and Barto, 2018</xref>). The repertoire of flexible navigational behaviors that insects display suggests that their small brains may solve many of these computational challenges.

Some ‘channels’ of this pathway have been characterized functionally, while the function and sensory tuning of other groups of neurons remains elusive.

Our findings suggest that different cues exert differing levels of influence on the EPG neurons that carry the head direction representation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig66">Figure 66C</xref>). A prioritization of certain sensory cues is reflected in the relative locations of synaptic input from different sensory streams onto the EPG dendrites in the EB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Figure 12E</xref>), in the relative weight of those inputs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11A</xref>), in the feedback that some ring neuron pathways receive from the EPG neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13s1">Figure 13—figure supplement 1B</xref>), and in the relative weight of across-type inhibition from some ring neuron types onto others (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13">Figure 13A and C</xref>). The implicit hierarchy of ring neuron inputs to the fly compass indicates that the EPG head direction representation preferentially tethers to environmental references that are likely to indicate a global direction. Bright visual landmarks, for example, may originate from celestial bodies such as the sun, but they could also be generated by local terrestrial objects (e.g., gaps in a forest canopy). By contrast, a polarization pattern in the sky, if available, represents a reliable global reference, which might explain the observed circuit motifs that suggest the preferential use of polarization cues to update the fly’s head direction representation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig66">Figure 66C</xref>). However, the relatively high connection strength between ER4m and EPG neurons may also arise from this fly not being exposed to polarized light stimuli (see Materials and methods). Such deprivation could have prevented these connections from being subjected to the synaptic depression that other visual pathways may have experienced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Fisher et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib193">Kim et al., 2019</xref>) (but note that there is no evidence yet for long-term structural changes at any of these synapses).</p><p>Particularly when navigating over long distances, skylight cues allow the head direction representation to be tethered to global landmarks such as the sun and to the polarized light patterns of the sky (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib135">Heinze and Reppert, 2011</xref>). Indeed, polarized light e-vector information has long been thought to be important for the determination of sky compass-based head direction in many insects. A dorsal band of the insect eye called the dorsal rim area is structurally specialized for the detection of polarized light e-vectors in the sky (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib201">Labhart, 1999</xref>).

For the polarization-tuned ER4m neurons, we observed that synapse numbers to EPG neurons varied smoothly along the circumference of the EB, but with mirror-symmetric profiles for ER4m neurons from the left and right hemisphere, respectively. If synapse counts correlated with synaptic strength, this would result in stronger connections from ER4m neurons of the left hemisphere for EB wedges on the right half of the EB and stronger connections from the right hemisphere to the left half of the EB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figures 11D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig67">67A</xref>). This structure was even more clearly revealed when we analyzed the pairwise correlation of EPG neurons according to their ER4m inputs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11s1">Figure 11—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig67">Figure 67B</xref>): all EPG neurons on the right side of the EB were positively correlated with each other, while being anticorrelated with those on the left side, and the inverse pattern was observed for the left EPG population. Given that polarized light has a 180° symmetry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib125">Hardcastle et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib385">Weir et al., 2016</xref>), this connectivity pattern may allow the fly to generate a complete, 360° head direction representation from polarized light input (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig67">Figure 67B</xref>).</p><fig id="fig67" position="float"><label>Figure 67.</label><caption><title>Disambiguating directional information from polarized light sensors.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Connectivity matrix of ER4m inputs to EPG neurons in the ellipsoid body (EB).

The receptive fields of the fly’s polarization sensors in the left and right eye face the contralateral celestial hemisphere and tile a small strip along the rostral-caudal axis of the fly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig67">Figure 67C and D</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib137">Heinze, 2014</xref>). Along this strip tuning to e-vectors varies continuously and covers nearly the full 180° range of possible e-vector orientations. Given the naturalistic celestial polarization pattern schematized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig67">Figure 67C</xref>, the geometry of the slightly curved receptive field ‘strip’ might act as a rough ‘matched filter’, such that neurons in the dorsal rim area on the side of the sun (facing the contralateral sky) are systematically more strongly activated than those on the side facing away from the sun (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig67">Figure 67D</xref>). The all-to-all inhibition between left and right ring neurons in the EB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13">Figure 13A</xref>) may then systematically select either the left or the right ring neurons to tether the head direction depending on which direction the fly is facing relative to the current position of the sun, thus disambiguating the 180° mirror symmetry in the polarization signal.</p><p>In locusts, TL-neurons, homologs of the fly’s ring neurons, and PB neurons have been shown to exhibit matched-filter-like tuning to the full-sky polarization patterns generated by the sun (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Bech et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib413">Zittrell et al., 2020</xref>). A corollary of these studies is that individual TL neurons in the locust have receptive fields that span large parts of the sky. Indeed, the area of the sky that is sampled by photoreceptors in the dorsal rim area is significantly larger in locusts compared to flies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib137">Heinze, 2014</xref>), and it is plausible that further sensory processing along the anterior visual pathway towards the CX differs between species as well, in which case different insects might employ different strategies for disambiguating polarized light stimuli.</p><p>The mechanism described above would not require that the sun be directly visible, but it might still be beneficial to have ring neurons that have multimodal tuning to both polarized light and sun-like stimuli. Such cells have been described in other insects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">el Jundi et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib135">Heinze and Reppert, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib266">Pegel et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib270">Pfeiffer et al., 2005</xref>). While this has yet to be demonstrated experimentally, multimodal ring neurons tuned to both visual features and polarized light e-vector orientation may also exist in flies. Hardcastle and colleagues report polarization-tuned neurons in the superior bulb (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib125">Hardcastle et al., 2020</xref>), where tuning to bright features has also been observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib257">Omoto et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib311">Seelig and Jayaraman, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib339">Sun et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Besides visual cues, mechanosensory wind stimuli can drive the fly’s head direction system in the EB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib256">Okubo et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figures 9</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig66">66B</xref>). Information about wind direction reaches the EB via ring neurons that arborize in the LAL. Wind tuning has been demonstrated in both ER3a and ER1 neurons, although only ER1 neurons were able to update the head direction estimate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib256">Okubo et al., 2020</xref>). Analysis of the connectome suggests that both the ER1 and ER3a neuron populations consist of multiple types with distinct inputs. We found that only ER1_b and ER3a_b neurons got strong inputs from cells that we believe to be the wind-sensitive LAL138 (WL-L) and WPN neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib256">Okubo et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib343">Suver et al., 2019</xref>). The connectivity of these two ring neuron types onto EPG neurons, with strong connections from ER1_b but no connections from ER3a_b neurons, is consistent with the observation that ER1 but not ER3a neurons can drive the head direction representation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11A</xref>). It is also noteworthy that in the EB, ER1_b neurons deviate from the within-type all-to-all inhibition motif that all other ring neurons show in the EB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13">Figures 13A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig66">66C</xref>). A possible reason is that an accurate mapping from ER1 neuron activity to a head direction representation requires pooling information from multiple ring neurons at once (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib256">Okubo et al., 2020</xref>). Our analysis also suggests that ER1_b input to the EPG neurons is suppressed by ER1_a neurons, but it is presently unknown whether ER1_a neurons also encode wind direction or whether these neurons are tuned to a different stimulus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig66">Figure 66C</xref>). ER1_a and ER1_b inputs in the LAL are distinct and unfortunately little is known about the inputs ER1_a receives.</p><p>Whether over short or long distances, olfactory cues are strong indicators of good food sources. Flies are known to fly upwind when they encounter an appetitive odor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Budick and Dickinson, 2006</xref>), a strategy also employed by other insects navigating to an odor source (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Carde and Willis, 2008</xref>). A robust navigational strategy would allow an insect to maintain the same heading using other cues even if the wind were to transiently die down. Based on the proximity of different ring neuron inputs to the putative spike initiation sites of EPG neurons, the head direction representation is likely to be strongly tethered to wind direction by input from ER1_b neurons (and perhaps also ER1_a neurons, although their function is currently unknown) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib256">Okubo et al., 2020</xref>). If visual cues are flexibly mapped onto head direction representation using this wind direction input as a reference (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Fisher et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib193">Kim et al., 2019</xref>), the EPG compass could allow the fly to preserve its heading using those cues even in the absence of wind.</p><p>The relative importance of synapse location in determining the cues to which the EPG compass tethers will only be clear with in-depth investigations of EPG neuron biophysics. More broadly, future studies of ring neuron and EPG interactions should provide an implementation-level understanding of a variety of computations related to dynamic multisensory integration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib280">Pouget et al., 2002</xref>) and the resolution of conflicts between cues of different reliability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Deneve et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib147">Hoinville and Wehner, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib395">Wystrach et al., 2015</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-3-2"><title>All-to-all inhibition for noise reduction in sensory inputs to the compass network</title><p>Recent studies have proposed an important role for fast-timescale, short-term plasticity of synaptic connections between ring and EPG neurons in enabling the EPG compass to quickly adapt to different sensory settings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig66">Figure 66D</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Fisher et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib193">Kim et al., 2019</xref>). The connectome suggests that the ring neuron network may also preselect more salient cues for the compass through all-to-all inhibitory connectivity within each type. The precise impact of all-to-all inhibition on the ring neuron network’s preprocessing of localizing cues that are used to generate the head direction representation will depend on the timescale of the inhibitory conductance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Ermentrout, 1992</xref>), which is as yet unknown. If the inhibitory conductance is fast, all-to-all inhibition would create winner-take-all dynamics in which a few ring neurons receiving the strongest inputs effectively shut down all other ring neurons. In sensory settings characterized by a single dominant sensory cue, such as the sun or polarized light e-vector orientation in a desert landscape during the day (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Coyne et al., 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib382">Weir and Dickinson, 2012</xref>), only a handful of ring neurons with appropriately tuned receptive fields (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Fisher et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib257">Omoto et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib311">Seelig and Jayaraman, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib318">Shiozaki and Kazama, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib339">Sun et al., 2017</xref>) would be active within each type for any particular head direction. Fast all-to-all inhibition in this setting would enhance the activity of the most dominant ring neuron within each type and would minimize the impact of noise from the others, which might otherwise disrupt the stability of the EPG compass.</p><p>However, stable and unique heading representations are also generated within scenes with multiple strong cues, such as within a forest or when walking on the branches of a tree, as long as the two-dimensional arrangement of cues allows for a unique determination of heading (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib193">Kim et al., 2019</xref>). In the presence of multiple salient cues, we would expect multiple ring neurons to respond with comparable strength for any given heading of the fly and several to respond weakly to any additional visual cues (‘clutter’) in the scene. Although fast all-to-all inhibition in this scene would still filter out these weaker responses, it could allow multiple, strongly responsive ring neurons to remain active for each heading. A slower inhibitory conductance would, in this situation, induce oscillatory spiking dynamics between these multiple ‘winners’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Ermentrout, 1992</xref>), a situation that has been referred to as ‘winnerless competition’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib284">Rabinovich et al., 2001</xref>), and that has been suggested to be useful for sequential memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib314">Seliger et al., 2003</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-3-3"><title>State-dependent modulation of ring neurons</title><p>Ring neuron responses are not determined purely by sensory cues. These neurons appear to be modulated by state, maintain a baseline level of activity, and may be biophysically configured to support oscillatory population activity linked to sleep need (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib285">Raccuglia et al., 2019</xref>). The many additional inputs that many ring neuron types receive in the BU (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>) provide clues as to how the activity of these neurons might be modulated by the fly’s behavior and its internal state. The visually tuned superior BU ring neurons primarily receive input from a large interhemispheric AOTU neuron (AOTU046), which may mediate dynamic stimulus selection through delayed contralateral inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib339">Sun et al., 2017</xref>). The same group of ring neurons also shows changes in activity with the fly’s behavioral state (flight versus walking) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib311">Seelig and Jayaraman, 2013</xref>) and indeed many of these neurons receive input from the dopaminergic ExR2 neuron that has been linked to changes in the fly’s motor activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib196">Kong et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib208">Liang et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib348">Tao et al., 2020</xref>).

Strong experimental and theoretical evidence suggests that the representation is maintained by a ring attractor network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib192">Kim et al., 2017c</xref>), which includes at least some of the recurrently connected columnar neurons that link the EB and the PB: the EPG, PEN_a, PEN_b, and PEG neuron types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib114">Green et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib364">Turner-Evans et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib365">Turner-Evans et al., 2020</xref>). The patterns of connectivity between individual neurons of these types are consistent around the entire EB and across the length of the PB. Similarly, the broad connectivity patterns of individual neurons within these types to tangential neurons – Δ7 neurons in the PB and different types of ring neurons in the EB – are similar across these structures. Notably, however, two distinct classes of neurons (EPGt neurons and the P6-8P9 neurons, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig18">Figures 18</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig21">21</xref>, respectively) only innervate the edges of the network; both innervate the outer glomeruli of the PB, and the EPGt neurons also innervate the corresponding wedges in the EB. These types may help to stitch together what might otherwise be a discontinuity in the ring attractor network. Indeed, the EPGt neurons in the left and right PB arborize in wedges in the EB that lie directly in between the wedges occupied by the EPG neurons on either side of the potential discontinuity (in PB glomeruli 1 and 8). The EPGt neurons may therefore represent angular positions halfway between the edge angles, bridging the gap. We note, however, that the Δ7 neurons and the P6-8P9 neurons that output in these outer glomeruli each receive unique input from different sets of EPG neurons, making it hard to assign a clear corresponding EB angle to glomerulus 9 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig68">Figure 68Ai</xref>).</p><fig id="fig68" position="float"><label>Figure 68.</label><caption><title>Conveying and transforming the head direction representation from the ellipsoid body (EB) to the fan-shaped body (FB).</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic showing how a bump of activity gets conveyed from the EB to the left and right PB.

The ER6 neurons, for example, receive input from the EPG and PEG neurons in the GA and send outputs to the PEG, EL, and PEN_b neurons in the EB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13s1">Figure 13—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig56">Figure 56</xref>), potentially modulating the EPG-to-PEG-to-PEN_b-to-EPG feedback loop. Furthermore, many of the ExR neurons make connections to and receive input from EB columnar neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig14">Figure 14</xref>). The PB receives neuromodulatory input from the dopaminergic LPsP neurons and the octopaminergic P1-9 neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig23">Figure 23</xref>). The LPsP neurons may enable changes in synaptic strength in the PB. Such plasticity in the PB has been suggested to allow flies to calibrate their directed movements to their body size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib198">Krause et al., 2019</xref>). In sensory brain regions, octopaminergic neurons are known to modulate neuronal conductances based on the fly’s behavioral state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib336">Strother et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib342">Suver et al., 2012</xref>), and it is an open question whether the P1-9 neurons play a similar role in the PB.

The connectome allowed us to follow this activity bump through the CX as it gets duplicated, reformatted, recombined, and, finally, read out. In the process, we discovered network motifs that seem ideally suited for performing vector computations. These motifs place constraints on the network’s computational capacity and inspire conceptual models for how the network might function. We begin by describing how the activity bump is forwarded from the EB to the PB, where it is duplicated and reformatted into a sinusoidal profile. In subsequent sections, we consider how the FB network may recombine these bumps to perform vector computations in support of goal-directed behavior.</p><p>The EPG population divides the EB into 16 ‘wedges,’ suggesting that the fly’s head direction system samples angular space at 22.5° intervals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig68">Figure 68A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib124">Hanesch et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib210">Lin et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib312">Seelig and Jayaraman, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib391">Wolff et al., 2015</xref>). Importantly, this does not mean that the system cannot resolve head directions at resolutions higher than 22.5° since the differential activation of columnar neurons with distinct directional tunings can effectively represent any arbitrary angle within the 360° around the fly. From the EB, EPG neurons convey the HD bump to both the left and right PB, generating two bumps that are sampled at approximately 45° intervals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig68">Figure 68A</xref>). Due to the EPG projection pattern (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib391">Wolff et al., 2015</xref>), there is a 22.5° shift in the directional tuning between EPG neurons in left and right PB, as recently confirmed by physiological recordings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib218">Lyu et al., 2020</xref>). Importantly, the bumps in the left and right PB still encode the same head direction, but do so using sets of neurons whose sampling of angular space is shifted by 22.5°.</p><p>Within the PB, FB columnar neurons inherit a head direction bump directly from EPG neurons and indirectly through Δ7 neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig68">Figure 68Bi</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Franconville et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib114">Green et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib364">Turner-Evans et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib365">Turner-Evans et al., 2020</xref>). The Δ7 populations appear ideally suited to reformat the EB bump into a sinusoidal profile, regardless of its original shape (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig20">Figure 20</xref>). Individual Δ7 neurons provide output to 2–3 PB glomeruli spaced ~180° apart (i.e., separated by seven glomeruli). Between these axonal compartments are dendritic segments whose EPG input weight is well fit by a sinusoid, suggesting that individual Δ7 neurons should have a sinusoidal tuning curve. Assuming the Δ7 population uniformly samples angular space (e.g., with a 45° sampling interval), this would manifest as two sinusoidal bumps across the PB, one in the left PB and one in the right PB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig68">Figure 68Bii</xref>). Furthermore, recurrent Δ7 connections may enforce a sinusoidal activity pattern on the Δ7 population itself, which could improve the ability of Δ7 neurons to reformat the activity bump into a sinusoidal profile before passing it on to PB-FB types. The Δ7 population provides input to ~10 types of PB-FB neurons, effectively duplicating the activity bump in the process. As discussed below (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig69">Figure 69</xref>), this duplication may allow the FB network to recombine bumps in a way that implements a compact vector calculator (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig68">Figure 68C</xref>).</p><fig id="fig69" position="float"><label>Figure 69.</label><caption><title>Conceptual model showing that PFN phase shifts, when combined with differential noduli (NO) input, could produce ±45° bump shifts between the protocerebral bridge (PB) and fan-shaped body (FB).</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic of a PB-to-FB projection pattern with a one-column contralateral phase shift.

The sum of these two bumps will end up closer to –90°, the location of the left PB bump, due to the difference in bump amplitudes. (<bold>C</bold>) Phasor diagram interpretations of the scenarios from (<bold>A</bold>) and (<bold>B</bold>). In the left panel, with equal NO input, the left PFN and right PFN bumps sum to produce the purple vector located at 0. In the right panel, with differential NO input, the left PFN bump becomes bigger than the right PFN bump (as in <bold>B</bold>), and therefore, their sum is closer to the left PFN bump. This effectively shifts the bump by a phase that depends on the difference in amplitude between the left and right PFN populations. Importantly, the PFN neurons’ one-column ipsilateral phase shift limits such bump shifts to ±45° from the PB bump. Phases shifts outside this area (marked in gray) cannot be produced.

In its most basic form, 2D path integration requires that an animal keep track of its direction and distance relative to a stored goal location, such as a food source or nest, often without the use of external landmarks. The direction and distance to the goal location is thought to be computed through the integration of self-motion signals and stored as a ‘home vector.’ To return to the goal location, animals are thought to generate appropriate motor commands by comparing their current heading to the stored home vector.

Although there is as yet no definitive evidence that the CX is used for path integration, in the next few subsections, we show how a network built from FB-inspired circuit motifs could compute a translational velocity (TV) vector in an allocentric reference frame whose integration would yield a home vector. We note that the framework for vector computations that we describe below is likely to be useful for a much broader array of behaviors involving oriented action selection.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3-7"><title>The potential for vector computations in the FB</title><p>PFN neurons serve as the major columnar input to the FB network. The ±45° phase shift that is characteristic of all PFN neuron types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig30">Figures 30</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig34">34</xref>) implies that activity bumps from the left and right PB would end up ~90° apart in the FB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig69">Figure 69A</xref>). The amplitude of these activity bumps is likely to be strongly influenced by the different inputs that PFN neurons receive through their lateralized projections in the NO (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig25">Figure 25</xref>), setting up the possibility of bump-based vector computations in the FB. The PEN_a neurons, which are conjunctively tuned to head direction and angular velocity, perform a similar computation in the EB by providing phase-shifted input to the EPG neurons, thereby updating the position of the EPG bump when the fly turns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib114">Green et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib364">Turner-Evans et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib365">Turner-Evans et al., 2020</xref>). Inside the FB, vector computations fed by phase-shifted PFN bumps whose amplitudes are controlled by different conjunctive signals could ultimately drive PFL neuron types to generate appropriate motor commands (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig39">Figures 39</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig63">63</xref>), an algorithmic idea (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib128">Hartmann and Wehner, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib390">Wittmann and Schwegler, 1995</xref>) for which an FB implementation was first proposed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib326">Stone et al., 2017</xref>.</p><p>Although the intra-FB columnar network is highly recurrent, much of it is built from a limited number of circuit motifs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig37">Figure 37</xref>). These motifs serve as the backbone of a 2D grid in which activity bumps are constrained to either maintain their phase (i.e., maintain their column) while moving across layers, or shift phase by 180° (i.e., shift by half the width of the FB). While some pathways directly connect PFN neurons to output pathways, such as those involving PFL neurons, many more pathways run through this 2D grid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig33">Figure 33</xref>). Thus, the network has depth, providing multiple layers with which to process activity bumps. In addition, a large number of tangential neuron types selectively innervate different layers of the FB, suggesting that the FB’s vector computations are influenced by context and internal state. In the sections that follow, we draw from published experimental and theoretical work to explore the navigational implications of PB-FB neuron phase shifts. Importantly, for the purposes of discussion, we assume that the magnitude of PFN phase shift is precisely 90°, a simplifying assumption about symmetry in the circuit that ignores the type-to-type variability in estimated phase shifts across PFN types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig30">Figures 30</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig34">34</xref>), the functional significance of which remains unknown. Similarly, we assume all LNO types to be excitatory, but the proposed conceptual models could be built from inhibitory LNO types as well. Finally, while the columnar structure of the various vΔ and hΔ types shows considerable variability, we assume these neurons can either maintain the phase of an FB bump or shift it by 180°.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3-8"><title>Potential function of PFN phase shifts: forward models and coordinate transformations</title><p>Despite the PFN phase shifts, the two 90°-separated activity bumps arising from a single PFN type cannot propagate independently through the FB network because nearly all single neurons and neuron types that are postsynaptic to PFN neurons sample from left and right populations equally (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig35">Figure 35</xref>). Instead, each postsynaptic FB type likely sums the bumps from the left and right PFN populations, indicating that each postsynaptic type represents a single, summed bump that will propagate through the FB network.</p><p>Much like the PEN neurons, the PFN neurons innervating the left PB project to the right NO and neurons innervating the right PB project to the left NO, where they receive input from various LNO types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig25">Figure 25</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib210">Lin et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib391">Wolff et al., 2015</xref>). One potential function that this differential NO input to the left and right PFN populations could serve is to produce a new, transformed directional representation that could take on angles ±45° around the fly’s instantaneous head direction. For example, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig69">Figure 69B</xref>, a strong excitatory input to the right nodulus would increase the bump amplitude of the left PFN population relative to the right PFN population. In turn, the summation of these two bumps by a postsynaptic neuron type in the FB would result in a new bump that lies closer to that of the left PFN population.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig69">Figure 69C</xref> shows phasor diagrams of this process. Critically, because these vectors can only take on positive values (firing rates above 0), such differential input could only shift the resulting vector’s phase by ±45° around the fly’s instantaneous head direction. What might this transformed directional representation encode? The answer likely depends on the nature of the input that PFN neurons receive from LNO types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig25">Figure 25</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib392">Wolff and Rubin, 2018</xref>). Recent work in <italic>Drosophila</italic> has shown that some PFN neurons show differential activity in the NO that reflects the fly’s turning behavior during flight (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib319">Shiozaki et al., 2020</xref>), but the nature of the rotational velocity signal remains to be determined. We briefly outline two hypothetical scenarios that differ in the specific information carried by PFN neurons.</p><p>Directly wiring sensors to actuators in different ways can, in principle, allow a simple agent to display a variety of behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Braitenberg, 1984</xref>). But flies, like most animals, have to deal with an additional complication. Some of their sense organs are on body parts that are different from those that enable them to move. PFN phase shifts could enable coordinate transformations, such as converting the allocentric head direction representation into an allocentric body direction representation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig69">Figure 69D</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Andersen and Cui, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Andersen et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Batista, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Bicanski and Burgess, 2020</xref>). Flies make head movements that change their head-body angles by as much as 30° during both flight (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Duistermars et al., 2012</xref>) and walking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Fujiwara et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">Geurten et al., 2014</xref>). In this scenario, LNO neurons that provide input to PFN neurons arborizing in the left and right NO would encode how much the head is rotated to one or the other azimuthal direction of the body’s axis, perhaps derived from proprioceptive information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib265">Paulk and Gilbert, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib281">Preuss and Hengstenberg, 1992</xref>). When properly calibrated, such differential input could allow the PFN phase shift (which, at 45°, is sufficient to encode the entire range of head-body angles) to rotate the head direction vector by an angle equal to the head-body angle. This would effectively transform the fly’s head direction vector into an allocentric body direction vector. To do so, the network could use gain fields (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Andersen et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib278">Pouget and Sejnowski, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib279">Pouget and Snyder, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib295">Salinas and Abbott, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib412">Zipser and Andersen, 1988</xref>), with an intermediate layer composed of PFN neurons whose head direction tuning curves are gain-modulated by shared input related to the head-body angle. The neuron types downstream of PFN neurons would complete the coordinate transformation through their structured sampling of PFN neurons with distinct directional tunings. Coordinate transformations such as these may be useful when combining allocentric directional representations with body-centered velocity estimates to estimate direction and distance. We return to this idea in more detail in subsequent sections on vector computations related to path integration.</p><p>A second scenario is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig69">Figure 69E</xref>. if we assume that an LNO type carries a motor efference copy of the fly’s rotational velocity, as has been shown to exist in the fly visual system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Fujiwara et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib191">Kim et al., 2017b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib189">Kim et al., 2015</xref>), then bump shifts driven by differential input to the left and right PFN populations could function as a forward model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib379">Webb, 2004</xref>) that encodes a prediction of the fly’s future head direction or body direction. Why might a forward model of head or body direction be useful? Intracellular recordings from neurons in the ring attractor network have revealed that PEN activity is tuned to the fly’s rotational velocity, but that this activity lags behavior by ~100 ms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib364">Turner-Evans et al., 2017</xref>). Similar lags may result from propagation delays in neural processing, either along sensory pathways into the EB or in passing the bump from EB to FB. In situations where flies might rely on the CX to direct their movements, especially in time-critical scenarios, such delays in updating the compass could be costly. One way to overcome this is for the PFN network to compute the fly’s approximate future head or body direction so that navigational decisions can effectively be made in real time, a strategy that dragonflies have been shown to use during rapid prey capture maneuvers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib231">Mischiati et al., 2015</xref>). A forward model could also allow the fly to distinguish changes in its head or body direction associated with voluntary movements from those induced by external disturbances, such as changes in wind direction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Currier et al., 2020</xref>). More generally, matching the predicted head and body direction with the actual direction could enable the fly to fine-tune its movements to produce intended motor outputs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib198">Krause et al., 2019</xref>). As described below, PFL neuron types have anatomical phase shifts that appear well-suited to perform such comparisons (Figure 73).</p><p>The PFN neuron types that the computations hypothesized above might involve are as yet unclear. However, our analysis of PFN inputs from LNO types does allow us to draw some inferences about the sort of self-motion information that different PFN neuron types might carry. For example, considering that PFL2 neurons provide selective feedback to the LNO3 neuron type and considering that the PFL3 neurons feed the LCNOp neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig57">Figure 57C</xref>), we would hypothesize that the former may provide its downstream PFN neurons – the PFNv neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig27">Figure 27</xref>) – with efference information related to translational (and potentially forward) movement and that the latter my provide its PFN targets – several PFNp subclasses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig27">Figure 27</xref>) – with efference information related to rotational movements. In addition, many LNO types are downstream of pathways from vPNs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>), consistent with the use of optic flow-based self-motion signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib326">Stone et al., 2017</xref>). Furthermore, given that LNO types are the target of multiple input pathways, these neurons could carry combinations of sensory and motor signals to encode self-motion. Physiological recordings in behaving flies would be needed to test such hypotheses.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3-9"><title>Intra-FB circuit motifs for vector computation</title><p>Phase shifts of a single PFN neuron type could enable the generation of vectors that are within ±45° of the fly’s instantaneous head direction. Intriguingly, the FB network appears to be wired to expand this range to allow for computations with vectors of arbitrary angles.</p><p>As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig70">Figure 70</xref>, the vΔ and hΔ neuron types could, in principle, allow for vector computations across arbitrary azimuthal angles. In this example, we consider two hypothetical PFN populations (PFN1 and PFN2), both with 45° contralateral phase shifts, as shown in the phasor diagrams in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig70">Figure 70B</xref>. On their own, these PFN populations are limited to directional representations spanning 45° around the head direction signal that they inherit. However, an excitatory hΔ (or an inhibitory vΔ) would invert the PFN2 vectors, shifting them by 180°. Thus, if a postsynaptic neuron type were to sum the input from the noninverted PFN1 neuron population and an inverted PFN2 neuron population, it could form a representation of any arbitrary vector over the full 360° range, even though the PFN1 and PFN2 populations are individually range-limited (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig70">Figure 70B and C</xref>). A similar inversion could happen at the level of the PB if one PFN population were to receive excitatory Δ7 input while the other received inhibitory Δ7 input, which is likely how the 180° separation of PEN_a and PEN_b population bumps is generated and maintained in the PB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib114">Green et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib364">Turner-Evans et al., 2017</xref>). Together, the noninverted PFN1 and inverted PFN2 neuron populations form a basis set of four basis vectors, all separated by 90° (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig70">Figure 70C</xref>). As mentioned previously, the requirement for PFN neurons to have a positive firing rate prevents any single PFN population from forming a basis set on its own; instead, forming a basis set requires four independent bumps located at 90° intervals. When this situation is achieved, independent NO input could alter the relative amplitudes of bumps carried by each of the four PFN populations (inverted and noninverted PFN1 and PFN2 populations), enabling their sum to encode a vector with any angle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig70">Figures 70C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig25">25</xref>) and could thus represent such independent vectors. Importantly, during navigation, the orientation of this set of four vectors would be dynamically updated with the head direction representation, such that any computations derived from these vectors would be independent of the fly’s current head direction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig70s1">Figure 70—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig70" position="float"><label>Figure 70.</label><caption><title>Conceptual model showing how two PFN populations, when combined with differential noduli input, could form a four-vector basis set whose summation could produce any vector.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic of a protocerebral bridge-to-fan-shaped body (PB-to-FB) projection pattern with a one-column contralateral phase shift.

Integration of the left and right PFN activities can then store a home vector as two independent components. During readout, a population of PFL neurons is assumed to compare the insect’s current head direction to that of directions 45° to the left and to the right to decide which direction is closer to the implicitly stored home vector. This 45° ‘functional offset’ (phase-shift) was derived from physiological recordings, demonstrating that some LNO neurons function as optic flow sensors whose optimal expansion points are 45° to the left and right of the bee (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib326">Stone et al., 2017</xref>), a feature we return to below. While conceptually elegant, one major feature of this model is inconsistent with the anatomy and connectivity of the homologous neurons in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> connectome. In particular, the model requires that the left and right PFN bumps independently propagate to right and left PFL populations, respectively. This operation is unlikely to be supported by the FB columnar network since every neuron and neuron type postsynaptic to PFN neurons receives input from both the left and right populations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig35">Figure 35</xref>).</p><p>In the next two sections, we use the additional anatomical and connectivity information provided by the CX connectome to propose two conceptual models for computing an allocentric TV vector whose integration could be stored as a single home vector. The first model builds on the work of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib326">Stone et al., 2017</xref> and uses PFN offsets to simplify home vector computation. The second model is more relevant to walking insects and incorporates a head-to-body coordinate transformation to compute the fly’s TV vector. In both cases, the key computation performed by the FB network is a coordinate transformation that ensures that egocentric velocity signals and allocentric directional representations are directionally aligned.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3-11"><title>Computing an allocentric TV vector using head-centered optic flow sensors during flight</title><p>Flying insects are thought to perform visual odometry by relying on optic flow sensors to estimate their velocity relative to the ground (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib205">Leitch et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib324">Srinivasan, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib325">Srinivasan, 2015</xref>), consistent with leg-based cues being of little use and motor signals being unreliable in the face of external perturbations, like gusts of wind. In addition, during flight many insects make banked turns involving body rolls that are accompanied by gaze-stabilizing head rotations that keep the head near the horizontal plane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib191">Kim et al., 2017b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib239">Muijres et al., 2015</xref>). Importantly, flight trajectories often contain a significant sideslip component as well, during which the insect’s TV is in a direction that is different from that of its head-body axis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Braun et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>The FB’s recurrent circuitry described above could use self-motion information to compute a flying insect’s allocentric TV vector. One potential model is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig71">Figure 71</xref>. This model is composed of two PFN neuron types that receive independent input from two hypothetical LNO neuron types, LN1 and LN2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig71">Figure 71B</xref>), for which there are multiple candidates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig25">Figure 25</xref>). It exploits the FB network’s ability to form a set of four basis vectors to compute a single TV vector. To do so, it employs the optic flow sensors described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib326">Stone et al., 2017</xref> – with their preferred expansion points spaced at 45° intervals around the fly’s head – to modulate the amplitudes of the four basis vectors such that their sum encodes an instantaneous allocentric TV vector (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig71">Figure 71C–E</xref>). Importantly, this model relies on the fact that the basis vectors and optic flow sensors are directionally aligned (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig71">Figure 71C and D</xref>). That is, at every moment in time, each bump in the basis set has its amplitude modulated by a velocity input that senses movement in the same direction as encoded by the bump. Much like the model of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib326">Stone et al., 2017</xref>, this model can account for holonomic motion (i.e., an animal’s movements in directions not limited to its heading and head direction). Another feature of this model is that it should be insensitive to head movements in the yaw plane since the optic flow sensors and FB basis vectors are both in head-centered coordinates. A recent study found that, similar to the optic flow sensors described above, some PFN neuron types and their LNO inputs are preferentially tuned to air flow oriented ~45° to left or right of the fly’s head (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Currier et al., 2020</xref>), providing for a second potential velocity estimate whose tuning is aligned to PFN basis vector. The next conceptual model explores how this might work in walking insects, when the velocity sensors may be in a body-centered reference frame while the directional representation is in a head-centered allocentric reference frame.</p><fig id="fig71" position="float"><label>Figure 71.</label><caption><title>A conceptual model that computes an allocentric translational velocity vector using head-centered optic flow sensors during flight.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Illustration of a fly whose head and body direction are pointed north and whose translational velocity vector is 22.5° east of north.

These velocity estimates could be derived from motor efference copies or proprioceptive cues, and we assume the existence of estimates for both forward (parallel to the body axis) and sideslip (perpendicular to the body axis) velocity.

Circuits for computing these quantities are shown in (<bold>B</bold>) and (<bold>C</bold>), respectively. (<bold>B</bold>) Circuit for computing the component of the TV vector parallel to the fly’s body axis.

The firing rate of each PFN population is noted below each PFN node. Arrow width is proportional to firing rate. Gray arrows indicate neurons that are silent. Note that head angle input alone is insufficient to bring the LN neurons to threshold, but it can boost PFN firing when combined with a velocity input. In this case, LN2<sub>L</sub> remains silent despite receiving a head angle input from HA<sub>L</sub>, and LN1<sub>L</sub> is strongly driven by both the forward velocity signal and HA<sub>L</sub>. LN1<sub>R</sub>, meanwhile, is moderately driven by the forward velocity signal alone. This conditional effect of the head angle input could be achieved in other ways, but the core conceptual model would remain the same.

A velocity signal increases the amplitude of the two PFN vectors that point in the direction the fly is moving (for the example situation in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig72">Figure 72B</xref>, in the forward direction), resulting in a vector whose amplitude encodes velocity and whose direction is either the fly’s head direction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig72">Figure 72B</xref>), or its reverse head direction, which would be captured by the PFN2 population in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig72">Figure 72B</xref>. At the same time, an input related to the head-body angle transforms the head-centered vector into a body-centered vector, as described above (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig69">Figure 69</xref>).

To accomplish this, the models use coordinate transformations to ensure that allocentric vectors are directionally aligned with the egocentric velocity estimates that control their amplitudes. While these particular models highlight the general utility of such transformations, the FB circuitry could, in principle, accommodate many similar models. In addition, it is possible that animals structure their movements during outbound paths to simplify the computation of the TV vector. For example, if an animal were to only move forward during outbound paths, then circuit components dedicated to encoding backward motions would not be needed by the path integration circuit, a feature explicitly used by the model of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib326">Stone et al., 2017</xref>. Similarly, it is possible that an exact solution is not always required to perform path integration. For example, if a model generates errors that tend to cancel out during the integration process, the home vector can still effectively guide behavior. The local search behavior of foraging <italic>Drosophila</italic>, for example, involves relatively short loops that may not require a precise accounting of the goal location (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Brockmann et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib121">Haberkern et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib190">Kim and Dickinson, 2017a</xref>). In most situations, the fly should also be able to use local sensory cues in addition to path integration during such search behaviors. Finally, it is possible that egocentric velocity signals could come prealigned to FB bumps, assuming that the LAL could implement the trigonometric functions needed to scale velocity signals according to, for example, head-body angle. Taken together, these models highlight the connectome’s ability to inspire novel, implementation-level hypotheses about network computation. They also provide a framework for generating many similar models, with specific implementations that likely depend on cell type, species, and behavioral need. Ultimately, evaluating models like these necessarily requires physiological recordings from animals in specific behavioral contexts. Indeed, two contemporaneous studies have discovered direct physiological evidence that FB circuits compute the fly’s TV and have independently proposed theoretical models that are conceptually similar to those described above (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib217">Lu et al., 2020b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib218">Lyu et al., 2020</xref>). Yet, it is currently unclear if the output of this computation encodes the fly’s TV vector or just the phase of this vector. Similarly, how the type-to-type variability in PFN phase shift magnitude (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig34">Figure 34</xref>) affects these computations requires future study. Finally, it is also possible that tangential neurons carrying feedback or self-motion signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib384">Weir and Dickinson, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib383">Weir et al., 2014</xref>) could scale the magnitude of these vectors within the FB network itself.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3-14"><title>Potential mechanisms for TV integration and home vector storage</title><p>Theoretical work has suggested several potential ways to integrate TV vectors. First, TV could be integrated and stored using two separate circuits: a ring attractor that encodes the angle of the home vector and a line attractor that encodes the length of the home vector (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib128">Hartmann and Wehner, 1995</xref>). Rather than keeping track of the distance traveled in each allocentric direction, this network would shift the columnar location of an activity bump to encode the phase of the home vector. Solutions like these seem unlikely to be implemented by the FB since they require FB-centered attractors with circuit motifs for shifting the bump, similar to those found in the EB-PB attractor, which we see no evidence for in the FB network. Second, the model of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib326">Stone et al., 2017</xref> employed 18 neurons per FB column and used structured recurrent connections between them to integrate and store a two-component home vector (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib326">Stone et al., 2017</xref>). The hemibrain connectome provides little evidence for such structured recurrent PFN connections, especially in the NO, where some PFN types show all-to-all connectivity. Finally, the conceptual models described above allow for the computation of a single TV vector (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig71">Figures 71</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig72">72</xref>), suggesting that the FB network could simply integrate the corresponding activity bump and store the resulting home vector directly. In doing so, this integration processes would function by keeping track of the distance traveled in each allocentric direction. How might the network integrate the TV vector and store the resulting home vector?</p><p>Integration and storage could occur through several complementary mechanisms operating at different scales, from changes in synaptic strength or the excitability of individual neurons to persistent activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib220">Major and Tank, 2004</xref>) at the single neuron (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib403">Yoshida and Hasselmo, 2009</xref>) or network level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aksay et al., 2007</xref>). In addition, integration and storage mechanisms may vary across species and environmental context depending on the animal’s needs. For example, desert ants can maintain multi-day memories of multiple goal vectors to food sites and remember home vectors over 1–2 days (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib380">Wehner et al., 2004</xref>). This sort of long-term maintenance would favor stable storage mechanisms, such as changes in synaptic strength. In contrast, <italic>Drosophila</italic> performing relatively brief local searches close to a food source may rely on short-term mechanisms that could involve persistent neural activity. The connectome alone does little to constrain the space of possible storage mechanisms, but it can provide information regarding the likely site of storage and inspire a few conceptual models for how the vector could be stored.</p><p>Several considerations narrow the potential site of home vector storage in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. In the framework of the above conceptual models, the home vector would be stored downstream of the four-vector basis sets used to compute the TV vector. The PFL2 and PFL3 neuron types are well positioned to read out the home vector by comparing it to the fly’s instantaneous head direction (see section below), suggesting that the home vector is perhaps stored by neuron types that provide inputs to the PFL neurons. The PFL neuron types could also store the home vector themselves. Some insects are likely to maintain more than one goal vector (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Dacke and Srinivasan, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib221">Mangan and Webb, 2012</xref>), but the PFL neurons could store these different goal vectors through input-synapse-specific presynaptic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib111">Goldschmidt et al., 2017</xref>) or postsynaptic plasticity. In addition to direct PFN input, PFL2/3 neurons receive shared input from a handful of hΔ types, several FC2 types, one or two vΔ types, and many FB tangential neuron types, each of which could also potentially store a home vector.</p><p>Several potential storage mechanisms seem plausible. Many hΔ neuron types have within-type recurrent connections, forming small loops that connect pairs of hΔ neurons that encode directions 180° apart. If the biophysical properties of these neurons allowed for graded, persistent activity, and hΔ neurons have inhibitory connections, each column-pair could encode the direction traveled along one dimension. Alternatively, while the FC neurons providing input to PFL2/3 neurons largely lack within-type recurrent connections, they could maintain a vector in working memory through graded changes in their excitability or activity. Finally, the FB’s tangential neurons could potentially store home vectors through column-specific plasticity, as is known to occur between ring neurons and EPG neurons. In general, some recurrent architectures may allow for the storage of home vectors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib390">Wittmann and Schwegler, 1995</xref>), but an FB ring attractor, if it were to exist, would likely not allow for home vector storage since these networks have the undesirable property of forming a single activity peak at the expense of the activity in distance columns that would be needed to fully encode the home vector.</p><p>Overall, although the connectome can do no more than rule out some circuit implementations of how the home vector might be stored, it should prove useful in prioritizing a search for the likely neural targets for such a function. It is important to note that the entire circuitry described above must function in different modes depending on the animal’s behavioral needs – integrating direction and distance traveled to update the home vector when the fly is searching, but switching to reading out the home vector when the fly is attempting to return to a previously visited spot. The likeliest candidates for such behavioral mode switching are the FB’s tangential neurons.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3-15"><title>Reading out the home vector</title><p>Once formed, how might an insect ‘read out’ the home vector to return to its goal location? In our formulation, the home vector points <italic>from</italic> the nest <italic>to</italic> the insect’s current location. Returning home, then, requires that an insect move in a direction <italic>opposite</italic> to the home vector. To accommodate the other behaviors and computations that these circuits are likely to be involved in, we refer to the home vector as the ‘stored vector,’ which is read out to orient the insect along a ‘goal vector’ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig73">Figure 73</xref>, bottom panel). However, unlike an ant or bee, the fly is not a central place forager. Thus, ‘goal’ in this context refers only to a spot that the fly is likely to return to during a local search, such as a food source (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Brockmann et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib190">Kim and Dickinson, 2017a</xref>). PFL neurons are generally regarded as the major columnar output of the FB network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">el Jundi et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib124">Hanesch et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib136">Heinze et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib132">Heinze and Homberg, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib149">Homberg, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib210">Lin et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib323">Skutt-Kakaria et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib391">Wolff et al., 2015</xref>).

In particular, PFL neurons may use their PB-FB phase shifts to compare the fly’s instantaneous head direction, which they receive in the PB, to that of the stored vector, which they may receive in the FB, to generate appropriate motor commands to guide the fly to its goal. In doing so, they effectively generate egocentric motor commands based on allocentric directional variables. Interestingly, each of the three PFL types have characteristic phase shifts that strongly predict their involvement in generating distinct motor commands (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig73">Figure 73</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig73" position="float"><label>Figure 73.</label><caption><title>PFL neurons could generate egocentric motor commands by comparing the fly’s allocentric head direction to an allocentric vector stored in the fan-shaped body (FB).</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) PFL2 neurons could use their 180° protocerebral bridge (PB)-FB phase shift to generate a forward velocity signal that is largest when the fly is oriented towards the ‘goal vector,’ which in our formulation is away from the ‘stored vector’ (see bottom panel and ‘Discussion’). PFL2 neurons sample a single bump in the PB and individual PFL2 neurons project to both the left and right lateral accessory lobe (LAL), consistent with a bilateral velocity signal like forward walking. Top panel shows a schematic of the PFL2 180° phase shift between PB glomeruli (top row) and FB columns (bottom row). In this example, the stored vector points due north. To return to the goal location, PFL neurons compare the fly’s instantaneous head direction to the stored vector. The 180° phase shift ensures that PFL2 output will be largest when the fly is oriented towards the goal direction (and opposite the stored vector). (<bold>B</bold>) Similar to (<bold>A</bold>), but for the PFL3 neuron type and its 90° PB-FB phase shift. Unlike PFL2 neurons, PFL3 and PFL1 neurons (<bold>C</bold>) sample head direction bumps from the left and right PB, and individual neurons project to either the left or right LAL, consistent with motor commands with a left/right asymmetry, such as turning. In the case of PFL3 neurons, the 90° phase shift ensures that the left PFL3 population will be most active when the fly is 90° to the right of the goal direction. Similarly, the right PFL3 population will be most active when the fly is 90° to the left of the goal direction. If we assume that the right PFL3 neurons generate right turns and left PFL3 neurons generate left turns, then the motor command would act to align the fly’s heading with that of the goal direction.

A scheme with some similarities to this, and also relying on somewhat different inhomogeneities in synaptic weights onto PFL3 neurons and modulation of activity in the FB, has been proposed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib288">Rayshubskiy et al., 2020</xref>. Importantly, synaptic count inhomogeneities in the PB are not required for the FB-driven framework conceptualized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig72">Figure 72</xref>.</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-66039-fig73-figsupp1-v4.tif"/></fig></fig-group><p>PFL2 neurons may use their 180° phase shift and bilateral LAL projections to increase the fly’s forward velocity when its heading is directly away from the stored vector, which in our formulation is towards the goal location (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig73">Figure 73A</xref>, bottom panel). Unlike the other PFL types, PFL2 neurons receive only a single bump as input in the PB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig39">Figure 39</xref>). This suggests that the population cannot make left versus right activity comparisons. In agreement with this, individual PFL2 neurons make bilateral projections to the left and right LAL. Because of their 180° phase shifts, the PFL2 population activity will be largest when the fly is heading directly towards its goal location. The above characteristic suggests that PFL2 neurons are ideally suited to generate a motor command related to forward velocity.</p><p>PFL3 neurons may use their 90° phase shifts and lateralized LAL projections to orient the fly towards the goal. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig73">Figure 73B</xref>, their 90° offset predicts that the left and right PFL3 populations will have their maximum activity when the fly is 90° to the right or left of the goal direction, respectively. If the left PFL3 population generates left turns and the right PFL3 populations generated right turns, then the orienting behavior of the fly will have two equilibrium points: a stable equilibrium that occurs when the fly is oriented towards the goal direction and an unstable equilibrium when the fly is oriented in the opposite direction. This sort of read out would ensure that flies orient directly towards the goal location. It is additionally possible that across-column inhomogeneities in the EPG-&gt; PFL synaptic profile (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig73s1">Figure 73—figure supplement 1</xref>) and in the PFL-&gt; LAL network (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig64">Figure 64</xref>) may provide the fly with a ‘default goal’ in the absence of any FB input, similar to a hypothesis recently advanced in an independent study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib288">Rayshubskiy et al., 2020</xref>). The 45° offset of PFL1 neurons may serve a related function, although they target distinct downstream neurons compared to PFL2/3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig57">Figure 57C</xref>). One possibility is that the PFL2/3 neurons affect body orientation while the PFL1 population controls a separate variable, such as sideslip or head-body angle. Ultimately, it is also important to remember that brain regions like the LAL and CRE house complex recurrent networks with inter-hemispheric pathways that are likely to be inhibitory (see Output sections) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib170">Iwano et al., 2010</xref>). These networks are likely to play a major role in the transformation of PFL population activity into motor commands for the fly, something that our hypotheses do not incorporate.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3-16"><title>Summary: vector computations in the FB</title><p>The discussion above supports the notion that the FB network has the computational capacity to compute, store, and read out vectors in support of goal-directed navigational behaviors.

In addition, ethologically based studies in behaving insects have established a range of vector-based behaviors, from long-distance migrations that require a time-compensated sun compass (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib135">Heinze and Reppert, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib268">Perez et al., 1997</xref>) to the waggle dance that bees use to communicate the distance and direction of a food source (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Frisch, 1967</xref>). The ability of some insects to store multiple goal vectors and the fact that different insect species may use vector computations to support distinct behaviors has important implications for FB circuits. The FB may have evolved as a general vector calculator that can be co-opted, whether by evolution or in support of distinct behaviors, to support vector-based navigation strategies generally. In support of this idea, FB circuits, neuron types, and motifs are highly conserved across insects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib330">Strausfeld, 2012</xref>), including PB-FB phase shifts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib302">Sayre et al., 2021</xref>). Additionally, the ability of some insects to store multiple goal vectors requires mechanisms for switching between them, a function perhaps mediated by the large class of FB tangential neurons that could convey context and state information to the columnar networks involved in vector operations.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Beyond navigation: the CX as a multifunctional network for context-based action selection</title><p>While we have focused much of our discussion on column-specific computations supporting vector navigation, the CX also receives input from over 150 distinct tangential neuron types. In the sections below, we briefly highlight these neurons’ role in sensorimotor processing, memory-guided decision-making, circadian rhythms, sleep-wake control, and nutrient homeostasis. Together, these findings suggest that the CX operates as a multifunctional network supporting state- and context-dependent action selection for high-level behavioral control.</p><sec id="s3-4-1"><title>Sensorimotor processing</title><p>Consistent with the CX’s involvement in navigation, several studies have implicated FB tangential neurons in sensorimotor processing. For example, ExFl1 neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib151">Homberg, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib212">Liu et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib383">Weir et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib405">Young and Armstrong, 2010b</xref>), which are likely FB2B_a and/or FB2B_b neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig41">Figure 41A</xref>), are strongly modulated by whether or not the fly is flying and are tuned to progressive optic flow (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib383">Weir et al., 2014</xref>), providing a potential indication of the fly’s current sensory and motor state. Similar activity patterns may be expressed by several other FB types as well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib384">Weir and Dickinson, 2015</xref>). In addition, a recent study focused on the LH identified an FB tangential neuron type called PV5k1 (FB2H_a, FB2H_b, and/or FB2I_b) whose activation during closed-loop visual conditions leads to a reduction in the fly’s wingbeat frequency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Dolan et al., 2019</xref>). Sensorimotor signals like these are well positioned to influence CX-driven motor commands based on the fly’s immediate sensory environment and ongoing motor state.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4-2"><title>Memory-guided decision-making</title><p>Flexible behavior also requires animals to respond to their immediate sensory surroundings by evaluating past associations regarding the valence and novelty of available sensory cues. To investigate this, we focused on tracing pathways between the MB – the fly’s main learning and memory center – and the CX (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig46">Figures 46</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig47">47</xref>). In agreement with results from a companion manuscript focusing on the MB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib207">Li et al., 2020</xref>) and trans-Tango-based circuit mapping (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib304">Scaplen et al., 2021</xref>), we found extensive pathways leading from MBONs to FB tangential neurons. In the context of navigation, the MB is considered a potential source of visual snapshot memory, which may allow insects to base their navigation decisions on remembered panoramic views (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Collett and Collett, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib340">Sun et al., 2020</xref>). Consistent with this general notion, some FB tangential neuron types in FB layers 2 and 8 have been proposed to play a major role in visual learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib212">Liu et al., 2006</xref>). In addition, recent studies have implicated MB-to-CX pathways in behaviors other than navigation. For example, MB-to-CX circuits may be important for experience-dependent alcohol preference (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib255">Ojelade et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib304">Scaplen et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib303">Scaplen et al., 2020</xref>). In addition, MB-to-CX circuits are involved in consolidating courtship experience into long-term memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Dag et al., 2019</xref>). The sheer number of connections between MBONs and FB tangential neurons suggests that this prominent pathway is involved in many behaviors that make use of valence and novelty signals extracted from past associations that the fly has made with its current sensory surroundings.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4-3"><title>Circadian influence on the CX</title><p>Animals also select their actions based on latent environmental variables, such as the time of day, which are predictive of environmental conditions like temperature and humidity. Flies are most active around dawn and dusk, and show consolidated periods of inactivity throughout the night and during a daytime siesta (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Dubowy and Sehgal, 2017</xref>). This daily rhythm is imposed by outputs from the circadian network and functions to restrict behavior to appropriate times of day. Previous studies have identified a population of anterior-projection DN1 clock neurons that convey circadian information through TuBu neurons to EB ring neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figures 6C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7D</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib119">Guo et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib202">Lamaze et al., 2018</xref>). Thus, CX circuits are likely to receive circadian information that could be used to select behaviors according to time of day (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib208">Liang et al., 2019</xref>). Whether circadian pathways target other regions of the CX requires further investigation. In addition to receiving circadian inputs that could affect rest-activity rhythms, considerable evidence suggests that CX circuits are involved in tracking internal states, such as sleep need and nutritive state, which we turn to next.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4-4"><title>Sleep-wake control</title><p>While its functions remain largely unknown, sleep is associated with a variety of processes in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, including synaptic homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Bushey et al., 2011</xref>), memory formation and consolidation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Berry et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Dag et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Donlea et al., 2011</xref>), changes in gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Cirelli et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib411">Zimmerman et al., 2006</xref>), and several metabolic processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib186">Kempf et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib368">Vaccaro et al., 2020</xref>). Sleep in flies is behaviorally defined as a reversible state of immobility that is homeostatically regulated and associated with an increased arousal threshold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib143">Hendricks et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib317">Shaw et al., 2000</xref>). It is marked by drastic changes in brain-wide activity patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib252">Nitz et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib344">Tainton-Heap et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib402">Yap et al., 2017</xref>). The neural circuits involved in tracking sleep need and inducing sleep are thought to partially reside in the CX. In particular, a heterogeneous population of FB tangential neurons labeled by the R23E10 GAL4 line induces sleep when activated and tracks sleep need through changes in baseline firing rate and intrinsic excitability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Donlea et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib275">Pimentel et al., 2016</xref>) (but see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib344">Tainton-Heap et al., 2020</xref>). Similarly, ER5 ring neurons track sleep need, and reciprocal connections between the EB and dFB are hypothesized to form a core circuit for homeostatic control of sleep (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Donlea et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib214">Liu et al., 2016</xref>). Counteracting these sleep-promoting neurons are wake-promoting DANs in the dorsal FB that are thought to promote wakefulness by inhibiting R23E10 neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib251">Ni et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib275">Pimentel et al., 2016</xref>). Our connectomic analysis revealed extensive reciprocal connections between putative sleep- and wake-promoting populations within the dFB, which could function as a ‘flip-flop’ switch to ensure that only one population is active at a time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib297">Saper et al., 2010</xref>). In addition, we identified a large number of previously undescribed pathways leading to and from sleep-wake neuron types whose potential involvement in sleep-wake control requires future investigation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig51">Figures 51</xref>—<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig55">55</xref>), including reciprocal pathways connecting neurons in the EB with those in the dorsal FB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig53">Figure 53</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Donlea et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib215">Liu et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Several limitations of the hemibrain dataset are notable in the context of sleep.

Within the EB, a population of ring neurons allows flies to assess the nutritive value of sugars, independent of their taste (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Dus et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib262">Park et al., 2016</xref>). Similarly, tangential neuron types in the dorsal FB have been implicated in feeding decisions based on the nutritive value of foods, and they may incorporate past experience into these computations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib298">Sareen et al., 2020</xref>). And vΔA_a columnar neurons, which innervate the AB and dFB, show oscillatory dynamics that depend on hemolymph glucose levels, and altering vΔA_a activity levels affects fructose preference (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib244">Musso et al., 2021</xref>). Together, these studies implicate CX circuits in nutrient homeostasis, a process important for successful foraging based on the fly’s metabolic needs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Corrales-Carvajal et al., 2016</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-4-6"><title>Circuit motifs for high-level behavioral control and action selection</title><p>The need for high-level behavior selection may explain the potential interactions of circuits related to navigation, feeding, circadian rhythms, and sleep. Hungry flies, for example, are known to forgo sleep in favor of foraging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib185">Keene et al., 2010</xref>). Similarly, both sleep and feeding are known to be under circadian control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Dubowy and Sehgal, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib243">Murphy et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib398">Xu et al., 2008</xref>), biasing their occurrence to appropriate times of day. Based on these considerations and the experimental evidence summarized above, it seems likely that the CX operates as a multifunctional network that can be dynamically reconfigured (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib222">Marder, 2012</xref>) to support a variety of goal-directed behaviors based on immediate sensorimotor variables, learned associations, time of day, sleep need, nutritive state, and other as-yet-unknown inputs. Such a view of the CX is consistent with the variety of neuromodulator and peptides released by FB neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib180">Kahsai et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib178">Kahsai et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib179">Kahsai and Winther, 2011</xref>).</p><p>Our connectomic analysis identified circuit elements and motifs that may support appropriate action selection. Most notably, many tangential neuron types, including EB ring neurons, form dense recurrent connections, both within neurons of a type and across distinct neuron types. For example, the FB’s tangential neurons in layer 6 that have been implicated in sleep-wake control are highly recurrently connected. It is possible that some of these neurons or other neurons in their layer are involved in decision-making related to feeding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib244">Musso et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib298">Sareen et al., 2020</xref>). If so, inhibitory interactions between these different tangential neurons may – akin to the interactions of ring neurons for sensory control of the fly’s compass – enable the fly to select appropriate actions based on internal need. Related to this, recent studies have reported oscillatory activity in ER5 ring neurons related to sleep-wake control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib285">Raccuglia et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib402">Yap et al., 2017</xref>), but how the highly recurrent networks in the EB and FB might support such oscillations remains to be determined. One possibility is that all-to-all inhibition between ring neurons in the EB could, with the appropriate inhibitory conductances, induce such patterns of activity. A different issue raised by the highly recurrent architecture of sleep-wake networks concerns how activity may propagate in these networks. Artificial stimulation of neurons within such potentially self-regulating networks may trigger downstream activity that is never seen in more naturalistic situations, confounding the interpretation of experimental results. Testing such ideas will require a finer-resolution analysis of the role that these neurons play in the action selection process.</p><p>How might the CX’s columnar architecture support these distinct behaviors? Links between the CX’s role in sleep and navigation have begun to be explored both experimentally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Donlea et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib208">Liang et al., 2019</xref>) and computationally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib369">Valle et al., 2020</xref>), but the CX connectome suggests that the number of pathways and neuron types that connect circuit elements known to be involved in these functions may have been underestimated. For example, the dFB tangential neurons involved in sleep-wake control contact many columnar neuron types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig51">Figure 51</xref>). Although we believe this columnar structure – and the FB’s 2D grid more generally – to be convenient for vector computations, why this columnar structure may be needed for sleep-wake control or for feeding- and satiety-related computations remains mysterious. One possibility is that head direction or traveling direction signals may be used as proxies for tracking the quality or quantity of the fly’s waking experience, perhaps to estimate sleep and/or nutritional need. Alternatively, the FB’s navigational signals may be inherently activity-promoting since they likely drive premotor neurons in the FB. If so, these navigational signals may require suppression to establish a sleep state or to enable a hungry fly to stop on a patch of nutritive food. Another possibility, suggested previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Donlea et al., 2018</xref>), is that tangential neurons may gate incoming sensory information, which could promote sleep or perhaps encourage a hungry fly to continue a feeding bout by ignoring distractors. Ultimately, if the columnar neurons are the main output of the CX, as seems likely, the FB’s tangential neurons must impact behavior through them.</p><p>Considering that the highest layers of the FB are associated with modulating the fly’s activity depending on sleep state and satiety levels, the connectivity pattern within the FB suggests that information about the fly’s current navigational state may enter the FB ventrally, that additional processing may happen in the middle layers, which receive considerable input from the MB, and that this processing may then determine the fly’s next actions (or inaction) in the dorsal layers. An additional possibility suggested by the flow of bump information from ventral to dorsal layers of the FB, and by the diffusion of columns in the dorsal layers, is that the specificity of actions is organized along the vertical axis of the FB, with oriented actions modulated and signaled by output neurons originating in the middle layers (see next section) and the fly’s overall state of activity modulated in directionally nonspecific ways by the highest layers.</p><p>Compared to the vector computation models suggested by the CX’s columnar structure, deriving connectome-inspired insights into the function of the CX’s action selection networks proved more challenging. One reason for this is that most FB tangential neurons receive input from CX-associated regions whose function remains poorly understood, like the SMP/SIP/SLP, making it hard to assign specific circuit functions to these neurons based on their inputs alone. In contrast, the vector computation models relied on a considerable amount of prior experimental data that, when mapped to the connectome, provided physiological hooks for generating novel hypotheses regarding circuit function. In addition, FB tangential types often have extensive reciprocal connections to other tangential types, which, given the absence of functional data, is hard to interpret. Once some of these functions are better understood, it may be possible to derive internal state hierarchies, like those we identified for directional sensory cues carried by EB ring neurons, which could suggest how the CX prioritizes different internal states. However, many of these internal states involve variables that evolve over time, such as nutritive state or sleep need, suggesting the underlying CX networks may undergo considerable plasticity that may not be apparent in connectome-level connectivity. The dynamic interaction of different internal state variables is likely also governed by neuropeptidergic signals that bathe the CX (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib180">Kahsai et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib179">Kahsai and Winther, 2011</xref>), but that our analysis did not capture. Finally, given our limited understanding of the variety of behavior the CX may support, understanding how internal state cues may factor into these behaviors is hard to predict at present. To better understand which behaviors the CX may be involved in, we used the connectome to identify output pathways, a topic we turn to next.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Directing and modulating movement based on the fly’s current state</title><p>The outputs of the CX likely modulate the fly’s actions in a variety of different behavioral contexts, including voluntary take-offs, negotiating uncertain terrain, feeding, oviposition, and fighting. The structure of the FB, in particular, suggests that it could modify the head direction signal to orient the fly with respect to behaviorally specific ‘goal’ directions. Such goals could be a source of food or safety or, for female flies, a good site for oviposition.</p><p>The FB’s columnar output types (PFL, PFR, FR, FC, and FS neurons) feed relatively independent output subnetworks, which may support, through unknown mechanisms, the maintenance of independent goal locations associated with different behaviors. Alternatively, these subnetworks could control independent sets of behaviors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig74">Figure 74</xref>, which is partly based on <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig74s1">Figure 74—figure supplement 1</xref>, proposes a speculative set of modules for this; see also <xref ref-type="video" rid="video17">Videos 17</xref>–<xref ref-type="video" rid="video22">22</xref>). If true, each subnetwork may carry the potential for the execution of actions towards independent goal locations, each specific for a given behavior and carried by a specific FB columnar type (or set of types). For example, some subnetworks could control behaviors related to goals in front of the animal, such as feeding or gap crossing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib277">Poeck et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib360">Triphan et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib358">Triphan et al., 2010</xref>). Some CX outputs contact a limited number of MBON-associated networks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig61">Figure 61</xref>). These connections may allow the CX to modulate some behavioral responses to specific sensory contexts that have been associated with negative or positive valence through the MB. The fact that an oviposition neuron (oviIN) is associated with these MBON networks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig61">Figure 61</xref>) could mean that CX networks influence spatial decision-making during oviposition, which is known to be informed by several external factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib400">Yang et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib408">Zhang et al., 2020</xref>). In contrast, how and why CX signals from the columnar FR1 neurons should directly influence MB neurons themselves (in the case of the FR1 neurons, the MBON30 neurons) is less clear. The variety of different interactions between the MB and CX suggests that investigations of memory-guided orientation and navigation may benefit from a study of both regions acting in concert. Consistent with such an idea, the atypical MBON, MBON27, targets the DNa03 neuron type (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib207">Li et al., 2020</xref>), which is also targeted by PFL3 neurons.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig74" position="float"><label>Figure 74.</label><caption><title>Summary of output networks.</title><p>Schematic representation of the contributions of CX output neurons to various subnetworks and their potential functions.

Each of these body parts could benefit from coordinated but independent control and could be individually targeted by CX outputs. The CX could, in the context oviposition, direct abdomen bending for egg laying in a manner that incorporates the fly’s internal sense of its body size, posture, and orientation relative to its surroundings. Hints for how the CX exerts such directional control may be found in the morphology of its outputs.</p><p>Output neurons with bilateral innervation patterns in premotor regions such as the LAL and CRE are likely to modulate symmetric actions (e.g., forward walking), while those with unilateral innervations in such regions likely control asymmetric actions (e.g., turning). Examples of the former include the PFL2 and FS1-3 neurons, while PFL1, PFL3, PFR, FR, FS4, and FC neurons all show unilateral innervations of premotor regions.</p><p>These different output signals could also vary in how directly they control flies’ behavior. CX outputs could themselves direct the animal’s movements and/or orientation towards a desired location or away from one associated with danger. The PFL2 and PFL3 neurons provide the most direct link from the CX to the motor center, known as the VNC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig63">Figure 63</xref>). As the major output channel of the CX, they are prime candidates to guide orientation and/or movements to a CX-specified goal. However, these actions would need to be coordinated with movements of body parts that alter the sensed orientation, most notably head movement. The ExR8 neuron is a candidate to carry out some of those corrections, through connections both to DNs and to the visual system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig63s1">Figure 63—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig62">Figure 62</xref>). The remainder of the CX’s outputs act more indirectly, and may modulate and gate actions controlled by other brain regions rather than directly controlling them. This is well exemplified by the multiple points of convergence between visual pathways and CX output pathways (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig62">Figure 62</xref>). We remain entirely in the dark concerning some CX output neuron types (PFL1, ExR7, and most of the FC neurons) and much of their downstream circuitry. Further characterization of these underexplored brain regions, a more complete connectome, and genetically targeted imaging and perturbation experiments will help to identify the function of these pathways.</p></sec><sec id="s3-6"><title>Navigation with small networks and with numerical variation in columnar neurons</title><p>The remarkable behavioral repertoire of insects is still more remarkable when considering their small brains. The CX connectome suggests that part of the secret behind this wide-ranging repertoire lies in having evolved architectures that are precisely configured for sophisticated behavior, but – physiological and behavioral genetics studies suggest – with weights that are plastic to allow these behaviors to flexibly adapt to context and situational demand. It is likely that the impressive computational power of their brains may also derive from an underexplored aspect of their neurons: their capacity for arbor-specific local computations, possibly even subthreshold computations in which synaptic release does not require spiking, and molecular computations through signal transduction cascades (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib353">Thornquist et al., 2020</xref>). These issues will require further experiments, but the connectivity we observe in the EB, for example, hints at a rich potential for insights into subcellular computation in the CX.</p><p>Regardless of the true computational capacity of single neurons, it is remarkable that the fly can navigate with a head direction system of 16 directionally tuned columns (in the EB) and just a few thousand neurons performing vector computation (in the FB). In principle, such small networks should be exquisitely sensitive to any variations in the number of neurons encoding each direction. However, the CX connectome revealed a striking difference in the number of columnar neurons that innervate each of the 18 PB glomeruli (although these differences are mirror-symmetric). Although several studies have investigated the developmental origins of columnar CX neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib267">Pereanu et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib338">Sullivan et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib375">Walsh and Doe, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib401">Yang et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib404">Young and Armstrong, 2010a</xref>), we do not know of any that have noted or focused on this systematic mirror symmetry. There are indications of numerical variations in some columnar neurons, such as the EPG, PEN, and PFL neurons, in the FAFB volume as well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib288">Rayshubskiy et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib365">Turner-Evans et al., 2020</xref>), and more complete EM reconstructions of that volume (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Dorkenwald et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib206">Li et al., 2019</xref>) should be able to clarify whether these variations exactly match what is seen in the hemibrain volume.</p><p>The functional consequences of the systematic variation of neuron numbers across columns are entirely unknown. It is possible that this variation builds redundancy into a critical navigational system or that the increased numbers of neurons in specific glomeruli ensure a preferred ‘default’ location for the bump to occupy within the more central columns of CX structures, and perhaps also a ‘default’ heading for the fly to adopt (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig64">Figures 64</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig73">73</xref>), an idea that is similar to a suggestion advanced independently in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib288">Rayshubskiy et al., 2020</xref>. A different possibility is that such variation is not stereotyped across flies, but is specific to individuals, and that this may account for locomotor biases across the population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Ayroles et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Buchanan et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib323">Skutt-Kakaria et al., 2019</xref>). Functional experiments with specific perturbations of neuron numbers in different columns may be necessary to further investigate this issue. Regardless of their functional role, how such mirror symmetric numerical variation is achieved may be an intriguing question for future studies of CX development. We do not know if asymmetries and mirror symmetries in columnar neuron numbers are also present in the CX of other insects, but parallel efforts in connectomics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib302">Sayre et al., 2021</xref>) should soon make this clear. Some Diptera, including <italic>Drosophila</italic>, have a closed EB, in contrast with most other insects, whose CBLs have an open, FB-like (CBU-like) structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib330">Strausfeld, 2012</xref>). The nonuniform distribution of the EPG neurons at the base of the EB (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig18">Figure 18</xref>), EPGt innervation at that location, and systematic modifications to neuron number across the columnar neuron types may represent an evolutionary adjustment to the closing of this structure.</p></sec><sec id="s3-7"><title>The CX as a tractable deep recurrent neural network</title><p>Technical advances over the past several decades have enabled increasingly large-scale recordings of neural activity from the central brains of a wide range of animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib177">Jun et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib216">Lu et al., 2020a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib335">Stringer et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib370">Vanwalleghem et al., 2018</xref>). These recordings have, in turn, enabled high-throughput studies of neural response properties that have focused on relating patterns of neuronal activity to sensory, behavioral, and internal state variables. However, the biophysical and circuit mechanisms underlying these response properties have been more challenging to access. Similarly, dramatic progress in the field of machine learning has enabled the creation of sophisticated artificial agents that can solve a variety of different cognitive tasks, including flexible navigation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Banino et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Cueva and Wei, 2018</xref>). Some units in these deep networks develop response properties broadly similar to those observed in real brains.</p><p>Insights into how such artificial neural networks generate the representations observed in their units – something that could, in principle, guide mechanistic hypotheses for the function of natural neural networks – have been slower to come (but see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Cueva et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib367">Uria et al., 2020</xref> for progress in uncovering the architectural basis of navigational responses in these networks). In this era of deep learning, a broader question concerns the level of understanding that is appropriate or even possible for the function of large and complex neural networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Gao and Ganguli, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib129">Hasson et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib209">Lillicrap and Kording, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib291">Richards et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib301">Saxe et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib399">Yamins and DiCarlo, 2016</xref>). What seems achievable is an understanding of learning rules and objective functions that can, in principle, generate networks with realistic population responses for specific cognitive tasks. The conservation of the CX’s structure across arthropods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib159">Honkanen et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib330">Strausfeld, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib363">Turner-Evans and Jayaraman, 2016</xref>) perhaps highlights the extent to which the region has, in practice, been shaped by such rules over evolutionary timescales in the service of flexible behavior. But what of an understanding of the actual network implementation itself? Some have argued against the necessity or desirability of such a level of understanding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib129">Hasson et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib291">Richards et al., 2019</xref>). The fly’s relatively brief history in systems neuroscience provides an increasingly compelling counterargument and may eventually offer a roadmap for implementation-level understanding that could scale to much larger brains and more complex cognitive functions.</p><p>The fly displays a wide repertoire of flexible behaviors, and some of its recurrent neural circuits show dynamics that have been linked to associative learning and navigation across animals. Its 100,000-neuron brain circuits may appear complex, but they also feature modularity, type-specific connectivity and topography that is genetically prespecified and has been refined over its evolutionary history. Some of these features apply to much larger brains as well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib146">Hodge et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib225">Maruoka et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib300">Saunders et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib327">Strange et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib349">Tasic et al., 2018</xref>), although there is likely greater flexibility in the wiring of mammalian circuits and greater heterogeneity within cell types in the mammalian brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Cembrowski and Menon, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Cembrowski and Spruston, 2019</xref>). It is possible that developmentally driven organizational features of natural brains may actually make them more tractable than artificial neural networks for an understanding of their function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib406">Zador, 2019</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig75">Figure 75A</xref>, for example, shows the connectivity of a small fraction of the fly CX’s many neuron types arranged by layers. Taking a single-neuron-resolution view of this subnetwork shows just how densely recurrent it is (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib305">Scheffer, 2020</xref>), even at a small scale (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig75">Figure 75B</xref>). Indeed, if the types and connectivity of these neurons were unknown, extracting network structure from population responses would be a challenge. However, sorting the neurons into types – in this case, inhibitory types – makes the logic of the network clearer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig75">Figure 75C</xref>; also see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig75s1">Figure 75—figure supplement 1</xref> for the part of the CX that we believe to be structured for navigational computations). Combining this circuit connectivity with physiological studies has enabled not only the generation of hypotheses for the computations that may be carried out by subnetworks at each layer, but, increasingly, tests of these hypotheses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Fisher et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib114">Green et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib193">Kim et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib192">Kim et al., 2017c</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib217">Lu et al., 2020b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib218">Lyu et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib364">Turner-Evans et al., 2017</xref>). As a result, it is possible to establish circuit-level mechanisms underlying the generation of different response properties. Importantly, fly circuit connectivity is not always structured (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Caron et al., 2013</xref>), many synaptic connections are plastic, and information from one part of the network often flows to all other parts of it (as we detail in sections of this article). Nevertheless, the developmentally prespecified organization of these networks makes them experimentally tractable. Although the computational capacity of the morphologically and biophysically complex neurons in these networks has likely been vastly underestimated, the connectome thus raises the prospects for at least a circuit-level understanding of how the fly’s CX generates many of this small animal’s flexible behaviors.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig75" position="float"><label>Figure 75.</label><caption><title>The central complex (CX) seen as a deep recurrent neural network for navigation.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) A layered representation of the connectivity of a selection of neuron types in the CX, with a bias towards those involved in navigation.

Neurons with practically indistinguishable shapes but with different connectivity patterns were split into connectivity subtypes within a morphology type (eg., the subclasses of PFN neuron types). For this connectivity-driven subclassification, we used a cell type clustering tool called CBLAST (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib306">Scheffer et al., 2020</xref>) in an iterative process, using neuron morphology as a template, and regrouping neurons after more careful examination of neuron projection patterns and their connections. CBLAST usually generated clusters that were consistent with the morphological groupings of the neurons, but often suggested new subgroupings. This clustering served as a naming guide after manual inspection (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2 table3">Tables 2 and 3</xref> for all neuron types, with numbers for each type).</p><p>All CX neurons have been given two names, a short name that we use throughout the article, and a longer name that captures the overall morphology of the neuron. Both long and short names for the vast majority of PB, NO, and AB neurons are published (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib392">Wolff and Rubin, 2018</xref>) and remain largely unchanged, even though slight changes were made to certain formats in the FB nomenclature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib306">Scheffer et al., 2020</xref>). For example, abbreviated names published in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib392">Wolff and Rubin, 2018</xref>, used a one-letter rather than a two-letter code for CX neuropils and non-CX neuropils included lower case letters (e.g., Sps, Ib). There are several cases in which these published names are identical to either abbreviated names in other brain regions or in other systems. These redundant names have consequently been changed, as follows. LN was changed to LNO, GLN was changed to GLNO, and EB ring neurons were changed from R1-R6 to ER1-ER6 to distinguish them from the names of fly photoreceptors. Details for the PB/NO/AB nomenclature scheme can be found in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib392">Wolff and Rubin, 2018</xref>.

In other words, there is no fixed number of columns in the FB as is shown for PB glomeruli, although most fall neatly into nine columns, as discussed in ‘Results.’ The placement of arbors, both within specific layers and across columns, is a defining morphological feature and is therefore included in columnar neuron names, as described in the following rule.</p></list-item></list></list-item><list-item><p>There are two basic blueprints for columnar neuron architecture: one in which input arbors are vertically arranged within a single column, indicated by the prefix ‘v’ in the short name and D0 in the anatomical name, and a second in which the arbors are horizontally distributed across the width of the FB, indicated by the prefix ‘h’ in the short name and D# in the anatomical name (see below; further details in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib306">Scheffer et al., 2020</xref>). The input arbor(s) for the horizontal class of neurons are vertically arranged within a column, as with the vertical class, and is/are separated by a neuron type-specific number of columns. The number of columns between these two arbors is referred to as Δ (‘delta’) and is indicated in the neuron name by ‘Δ’ followed by the number of columns that separate the input from the output arbors (details described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib306">Scheffer et al., 2020</xref>). The following sample neuron illustrates the nomenclature scheme described above. FB2,3,4,5D5FB4,5v (hΔI) has a predominantly input arbor in layers 2,3,4, and 5 that extends through one column, its output arbor ‘skips’ five columns (D5) and extends vertically, within a column, through layers 4 and the ventral half of layer 5.</p></list-item></list><p>For short names, a detailed account of the naming scheme for the FB neurons has already been described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib306">Scheffer et al., 2020</xref>). We briefly use the FB ‘tangential’ neurons as examples to illustrate the scheme. We found a total of 574 FB tangential neurons. Each neuron has widely extended processes spreading across a layer of the FB. The tangential processes typically extend throughout a single FB layer, but a few neuron types have multilayered arborizations. Their morphological classifications are based on the FB layers they innervate as well as their arborization patterns outside the CX and locations of their cell bodies. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3">Table 3</xref> shows the number of neuron types for each FB layer and their cell counts. The numbers in the type name indicate the layer in which they arborize (i.e., FB1, FB2, …), followed by uppercase letters classifying their morphological types. When connectivity subtypes were identified, lowercase letters are used after underscores, for example, FB1E_a and FB1E_b. Methods <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig2">Appendix 1—figure 2</xref> shows an example of identified connectivity types within a morphology type. We judged that these neurons were nearly indistinguishable based on morphology, so they were all given the same type name, FB2F. However, since CBLAST suggested these neurons should be clustered into three groups, FB2F was split into three connectivity types, FB2F_a, FB2F_b, and FB2F_c, with manual confirmation of their actual connections. For each morphological or connectivity type, there are always at least two neurons because we found pairs of neurons in the right and left side of the brain (even though the left side is only partially captured by the reconstructed hemibrain volume). We also identified several intrinsic columnar neurons in the FB, including hΔ and vΔ types, and columnar PNs, for example, FR (FB-RUB), FC (FB-CRE), and FS (FB-SMP).

Thus, to compute the relative weight of a connection from neuron <italic>a</italic> to neuron <italic>b</italic> in a region X, we counted the synapses from <italic>a</italic> to <italic>b</italic> in region X and divided this number by the total number of inputs that <italic>b</italic> received in X. We feel that this metric is the best approximation of a functionally relevant measure. We also occasionally used a second connectivity measure, <italic>output contribution</italic>. Output contribution is the relative output weight from neuron <italic>a</italic> to neuron <italic>b</italic>, computed by dividing the number of synapses from neuron <italic>a</italic> to neuron <italic>b</italic> in region X by the total number of outputs that <italic>a</italic> sends in region X. While this measure is unlikely to be functionally meaningful, it is useful for comparing the output composition of neurons (e.g., <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig26">Figure 26B</xref>, bar graphs and validation).</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Quantification of connectivity between neuron types</title><p>Each neuron type can consist of many neurons.

We started by generating a graph representation of a neuron. Using nat, we read in a neuron’s skeleton and transformed this object into a directed graph for which the weights of the edges are the Euclidean distance between the vertices and the edges were directed away from the soma. Assuming the skeleton nodes are placed in such a way to capture the curvature of the neuron’s arbors, the Euclidean distance between two nodes is a decent approximation of the arbor distance between these two points. Hence, the neuron graph contains sufficient information to calculate the distance along a neuron’s arbor between any two points. These neuron graphs also contained information about the width of the arbor at each vertex. Each synapse location was projected to the closest (in Euclidean distance) graph node location. For more info, see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://natverse.org/nat/articles/neurons-as-graph.html">http://natverse.org/nat/articles/neurons-as-graph.html</ext-link>.</p><p>Once we had the graph representation, we identified a root point that approximates the putative spike initiation zone. Extrapolating from studies in <italic>Drosophila</italic> PNs, we assumed the spike initiation zone for EPG neurons to be near the roots of the neuron’s arbors in the EB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib113">Gouwens and Wilson, 2009</xref>). To determine the root point, we intersected the EPG skeleton with the EB ROI. This process often ‘fractured’ the skeleton, generating several disconnected subgraphs. This was a problem because we rely on the graph representation of the neuron to calculate distances along the arbors. To ‘heal’ these fractures, we took each connected subgraph and repeatedly added the respective parent node from the original full graph back to the subgraph until all subgraphs were connected to each other again. We then pruned down any nodes that were added during the ‘healing’ but were unnecessary to keep this graph connected. This ensures that the parent node of the graph, which will be the root point, is the point closest to the EB for which there exists a path between this point and each of the neuron’s synapse locations in the EB. Note that, for our purposes, any point between this putative spike initiation zone and where the synapses of interest occur will be a sufficient point for the root point as the ordering of the synapses will be consistent relative to any of these points. This analysis is aimed at comparing the electrotonic distance between different synapses and the spike initiation zone for a single neuron. Hence, any stretch of arbor that occurs between the spike initiation zone and all the synapses of interest will necessarily be included in the calculation of electrotonic distance for all synapses and thus will not affect our comparison. The synapses of interest are determined to be those that occur within the EB ROI.</p><p>With the root point identified, we calculated the electrotonic distance between each synapse and this point using functions from the igraph package. Since the width of the arbor changes, we calculated the length constant <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf19"><mml:mi>λ</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula> for each edge separately (prescribing the width of the edge to be the width at the terminating vertex of the edge). The electrotonic distance of that edge then is the length of the edge normalized by the edge’s length constant. To determine the electrotonic distance between a given synapse and the root point, we summed the electrotonic distances of all edges between the root point and that synapse. For example, suppose the length constants of the edges in the path between a particular synapse and the root point are given by <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf20"><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>λ</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>λ</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mo>…</mml:mo><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>λ</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>n</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:math></inline-formula> and the lengths (or weights) of these edges are <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf21"><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>w</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>w</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mo>…</mml:mo><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>w</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>n</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:math></inline-formula> , then the electrotonic distance between this synapse and the rootpoint is given by <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf22"><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>w</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>λ</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>w</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>λ</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mo>…</mml:mo><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>w</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>n</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>λ</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>n</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac></mml:math></inline-formula> .

Hence, we did not need to include these values in our computation of the length constants as they become a constant factor on each electrotonic distance. Since we are comparing the electrotonic distances of synapses on the same neuron, this factor will not affect their relation. The distributions of lengths between synapses and rootpoints were unimodal for all EPG neurons (n=44) included in this analysis. The two EPG neurons that innervate the R1 glomeruli of the PB had bimodal distributions of lengths between synapses and rootpoints (not shown here), and as such were excluded from this analysis. The EPGt neurons were also excluded from this analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Analysis of synapse locations: 2D histograms, synapse densities, and mean synapse locations</title><p>The hemibrain database contains information regarding the spatial location of every synapse, along with the identity of the presynaptic and postsynaptic neuron. In addition, each neuropil has an associated mesh that defines its boundary in three dimensions, which can be used to restrict a neuron’s synapses to the subset contained within a given ROI. We used these two sources of information to quantify and visualize the spatial extent of neuronal innervation patterns in various ROIs. Our plots showing synapse locations or distributions are viewed from an ROI-specific perspective, which is in most cases different from the front, top, and side views defined by the x, y, and z axes used by the hemibrain database. For example, to visualize the concentric innervation pattern of EB ring neurons, it helps to view the EB from directly above, looking through its central canal (e.g., <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10s1">Figure 10—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Similarly, an FB neuron’s columnar location is most easily seen by choosing a perspective that places the FB’s layer in the image plane (e.g., <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig29">Figure 29C</xref>). To define these perspectives, we first performed PCA on the x, y, and z locations of all synapses within the ROI. In most cases, the individual principal components defined the major axes of each structure but in some cases, small rotations were performed to manually adjust PCA-derived axes. Finally, a coordinate transformation was used to convert each synapse location from the hemibrain reference frame to the PCA-derived reference frame. For some ROIs, synapse distributions are shown from several orthogonal perspectives (e.g., <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). The approximate direction of the anterior-posterior, dorsal-ventral, or medial-lateral directions is indicted for each plot. For anterior-radial projections along the EB circumference, the distance of each synapse from the center of mass of the EB ROI mesh was used as an additional coordinate. The outline of each ROI was computed by finding a convex hull that traced the border around the vertex locations of the ROI mesh using the ‘ahull’ function from the R package ‘alphahull.’ To visualize projections of synapse distributions, we used two-dimensional histograms of synapse counts (e.g., <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10s1">Figure 10—figure supplement 1A</xref>) and normalized synapse densities (e.g., <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>) generated with R’s ggplot2 package. In some analyses, such as for defining the columnar structure of FB neuron types (e.g., <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig29">Figure 29C</xref>), we approximated the spatial location of a neuron’s arbor in a given ROI as the average location of all of its synapses.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>EB modularity analysis</title><p>We used Pearson’s correlation to compute the similarity between the ring neuron inputs to two different EPG neurons. <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf25"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>ρ</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mi>b</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mover><mml:mi>w</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">¯</mml:mo></mml:mover></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>a</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>⋅</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mover><mml:mi>w</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">¯</mml:mo></mml:mover></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>b</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mo>/</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mo symmetric="true">‖</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mover><mml:mi>w</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">¯</mml:mo></mml:mover></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>a</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo symmetric="true">‖</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mo symmetric="true">‖</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mover><mml:mi>w</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">¯</mml:mo></mml:mover></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>b</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo symmetric="true">‖</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mrow><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula> , where <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf26"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mover><mml:mi>w</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">¯</mml:mo></mml:mover></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>a</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>w</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>a</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mi>n</mml:mi></mml:mfrac><mml:munderover><mml:mo>∑</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>n</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:munderover><mml:msub><mml:mi>w</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula> is the mean-subtracted vector of inputs onto neuron <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf27"><mml:mi>a</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula>, and <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf28"><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mover accent="true"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>w</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mo>´</mml:mo></mml:mover></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>b</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:math></inline-formula> is the mean-subtracted vector of inputs onto neuron <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf29"><mml:mi>b</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula> for the same set of inputs.

Conversely, a value of 0 indicates that correlations within each cluster are no stronger than would be expected by chance, given the average correlation of each EPG with all other EPG neurons. To measure the statistical significance of modularity values, we computed the distribution of modularity values for shuffled version of the connectivity matrix from ring neurons onto EPG neurons. For each shuffling, we randomly permuted the connections from each ring neuron onto its set of EPG outputs and repeated this independently for each ring neuron. We then recomputed the adjacency matrix and the corresponding modularity. We reported p-values as the fraction of 1000 permutations for which the shuffled connectivity matrix had a higher modularity value than the unshuffled matrix. We repeated this analysis using both the relative weight and the synapse count as a measure of connectivity, and using connections from rings neurons to EPG neurons and vice versa. MATLAB (MathWorks Inc, Natick, MA) was used for this analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>Analyzing the Δ7 connectivity profile</title><p>Each Δ7 neuron outputs in two or three glomeruli that are spaced seven glomeruli apart and receives varying input from the EPG neurons in the glomeruli in between. This creates a double-peaked EPG to Δ7 connectivity profile. To find the mean profile shape, the EPG inputs were first grouped by PB glomerulus and the Δ7 neurons were grouped by the glomeruli in which they output. The peaks of the connectivity profiles were then circularly shifted to bring them into alignment. The mean and standard deviation of the aligned profiles was then calculated.</p></sec><sec id="s4-15"><title>Propagating fictive EPG activity through the Δ7 neurons</title><p>The EPG activity was assumed to have one of two shapes: a von Mises or an impulse profile. In the former case, the 16 wedges of the EPG were each assigned a value from 0 to 2π, and a von Mises function with κ = 2.5 was assumed. The profile was normalized so that the fictive activity ranged from 0 to 1. For the impulse function, all EPG neurons that arborize within a given PB glomerulus were assumed to have an activity of 1 while all others were assumed to have an activity of 0. When generating the summary statistic, the mean of the von Mises function or the location of the impulse were each shifted to cover all 16 possible permutations (one for each glomerulus).</p><p>The fictive EPG activity was then converted into a vector. This vector was first multiplied by the EPG to Δ7 connectivity matrix and then by the Δ7 to X connectivity matrix, where X is a columnar PB-EB or PB-FB neuron. The activity was then averaged across all neurons within each glomerulus. This generated a 16 × Y matrix, where Y is the number of glomeruli that each columnar type X covers in the PB. The 16 comes from the 16 different permutations. The 16 activity profiles were then aligned by circularly permuting them by their order in the permutation (e.g., the first profile was not changed, the second was shifted by one glomerulus, the third by two, etc.). Additional alignment corrections were made to those neuron types that arborize in all PB glomeruli (the PFGs and PEG neurons) or those that arborize in fewer than 16 glomeruli (the PFL1, PFL3, and PFR_b neurons) as appropriate. The mean of the aligned profiles was then calculated. A cosine was fit to either the right or the left mean PB activity using the ‘nls’ function in R, and the mean of the residual from the two sides was taken as the summary statistic.</p></sec><sec id="s4-16"><title>Determining the offset between Δ7 inputs and outputs</title><p>EPG neurons were assigned angles based on the wedge they innervate in the EB. The number of synapses from each EPG neuron to each ∆7 neuron in the PB was then used to weight these angles, and a circular mean of the weighted angles was calculated to determine the average directional tuning of each ∆7 neuron. We then compared this tuning to the ∆7 neuron’s average directional output tuning on either the right or the left side of the PB. The output tuning was calculated in a similar manner to the input tuning, with the angle of each glomerulus being taken from the EPG neurons that arborize there, and the weights now being the number of synapses from the ∆7 neuron to the EPG neurons in the given glomerulus.</p></sec><sec id="s4-17"><title>Assigning neurons to FB columns</title><p>FB columnar neurons were assigned to FB columns using several complementary methods that depended on cell type. First, neurons belonging to an FX type (FS, FR, or FC) were manually assigned to one of nine columns (C1–C9) by viewing population morphological renderings in 3D. Several types, such as FR1 and FC2A, are composed of 18 neurons total with two neurons per column, which made columnar assignments unambiguous. For types with a less clear columnar structure, direct comparisons to strongly columnar types could be used to aid in column assignment. FX types were assigned to columns first since they collectively innervate all FB layers and could therefore be used as a backbone for defining the average position of the nine FB columns. Second, PB-FB-* and vΔ neurons were assigned to FB columns using an automated approach. For each type, we began by finding the FB layer that contained the most synapses (presynaptic and postsynaptic) and then calculated each neuron’s average synapse location using all three dimensions and assigned it an FB column corresponding to the closest FX-defined column from that layer. Automated column assignments were manually checked by viewing 3D population morphological renderings and plots of average neuron locations (e.g., <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig29">Figure 29</xref>). vΔ types contain individual neurons that innervate both C1 and C9. These neurons were manually identified and assigned to the ‘C0’ column as a way to separate them from neurons that innervate single columns (C1–C9). Third, hΔ types form a variable number of FB columns that depends on cell type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig31s2">Figure 31—figure supplement 2</xref>), ranging from 6 to 12 columns. Many types, such as hΔA and hΔG, have as many neurons as they have columns, and each column shows minimal overlap with neighboring columns, which made columnar assignments unambiguous. Other types show a less clear columnar structure, such as hΔC. These types were manually assigned to a 12-column scheme by finding leftward and rightward projecting pairs that were approximately mirror symmetric.</p><p>Every FB columnar neuron in the database contains its FB column assignment as part of the ‘instance field,’ but each type’s total column number needs to be taken into account, since ‘C2’ for an FX type is not the same as ‘C2’ for an hΔ type. In addition, it is important to recognize that for many types column assignments are discrete, despite spatial variation in neuron locations that are rather continuous.</p></sec><sec id="s4-18"><title>Connectivity-based estimates of FB neuron directional tuning and PB-FB phase shifts</title><p>We used an approach similar to that developed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib218">Lyu et al., 2020</xref> to estimate the average directional tuning of FB columnar neurons (v∆, h∆, and FX types) as well as the magnitude of PB-FB phase shifts. Every PB glomerulus was assigned an angle based on the EB-to-PB projection pattern of EPG neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib391">Wolff et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig16">Figure 16</xref>). Glomeruli R9 and L9 do not receive direct EPG input but were assigned the same angles as R1 and L1, respectively. This preserves the 45° sampling interval between adjacent glomeruli in the left and right PB. However, the angles assigned to R9 and L9 are different from those predicted by their input from EPGt neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig18">Figure 18</xref>), though other neurons belonging to the P6-8P9 and ∆7 types may also impact the directional tuning of these lateral glomeruli (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig20">Figures 20</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig21">21</xref>). Overall, these angular assignments indicate that the directional tuning of the left and right PB are shifted by 22.5°, a prediction supported by recent physiological recordings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib218">Lyu et al., 2020</xref>). Next, PB-FB connectivity was used to estimate the average directional tuning of the postsynaptic FB neurons that belong to the v∆, h∆, and FX types. The average directional tuning of each postsynaptic FB neuron was computed by taking a circular mean across the angles it inherits from its PB-FB inputs, weighted by connection strength (i.e., number of synapses). This average was computed for each PB-FB input type separately, so each FB neuron could have several directional tuning estimates, one for each presynaptic type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig34">Figure 34D</xref>). Similarly, to compute the magnitude of the PB-FB phase shift, we calculate the angular difference between the average phase inherited from the left PB population compared to the right PB population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig34">Figure 34E</xref>). Only neurons that receive input from both and left and right PB populations were used for these estimates. In addition, only neurons belonging to significant type-to-type connections that involved at least 80% of the neurons in the postsynaptic population were used. Finally, we excluded all connections where the presynaptic PB-FB type contacts postsynaptic h∆ neurons on both their axonal and dendritic compartments, which complicates phase estimates. Together, these criteria prevented accurate estimates for PFR_b, PFNp_a, and PFNp_d types.</p></sec><sec id="s4-19"><title>FB motif analysis</title><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig37">Figure 37</xref> employs PCA on column-to-column FB connectivity matrices, establishing the existence of three connectivity motifs. This analysis starts with column-to-column connectivity matrices, three examples of which are shown in the bottom panels of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig37">Figure 37B</xref>. These matrices were constructed by averaging relative weights across presynaptic and postsynaptic neuron pairs, grouped by their columnar locations. Because of this, the analysis does not take into account PB-FB offsets, only how neurons in each FB column connect to one another. Next, since FB neurons have type-specific column numbers, all column-to-column connectivity matrices were coerced to a nine-column scheme by rounding to the nearest column. For example, hΔB has a total of 12 columns, and neurons in C11 (in the 12-column scheme) would get mapped to C8 (in the 9-column scheme), since <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf46"><mml:mn>9</mml:mn><mml:mfenced separators="|"><mml:mrow><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mn>11</mml:mn></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>12</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac></mml:mrow></mml:mfenced><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>8.25</mml:mn></mml:math></inline-formula>, which rounds to C8 (in the 9-column scheme). To these 9 × 9 column-to-column connectivity matrices were added a C0 column to include those vΔ neurons that innervate C1 and C9. Together, this produced 903 column-to-column connectivity matrices that all had the same dimensions: 10 × 10. Next, every column-to-column connectivity matrix was transformed into a vector by concatenating rows, and the resulting vectors were grouped into a new matrix whose dimensions were 903 × 100. We refer to this grouped matrix as the ‘connectivity feature matrix’ since each row in the matrix contains a vectorized column-to-column connectivity matrix between two FB neuron types. Because strong connections will account for more variance than weak connections, even though their column-to-column structure could be the same, we performed PCA on the binarized connectivity feature matrix. As discussed in the ‘Results’ section (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig37">Figure 37</xref>), the first two PCs accounted for much more variance than any of the subsequent PCs. To visualize the column-to-column connectivity space, each row in the connectivity feature matrix was projected onto the first two PCs to generate the scatter plot shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig37">Figure 37C</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s4-20"><title>FB columnar steps from inputs to outputs</title><p>To count the steps between FB columnar inputs and outputs (shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig33">Figure 33B</xref>), the connectivity matrix shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig33">Figure 33B</xref> was converted to a network. The shortest path between the input node and the output node was then used to determine the number of steps that connected inputs to outputs.</p></sec><sec id="s4-21"><title>Identification of R23E10 and PPL1 dopaminergic dorsal FB tangential neurons</title><p>To assign neurons in a GAL4 driver line to their EM-defined neuron types, we warped raw confocal stacks to a standard reference brain, which allowed for a direct comparison between light- and EM-level morphologies using VVDviewer. For neurons contained in R23E10 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig48">Figure 48</xref>) and PPL1 dopaminergic types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig49">Figure 49</xref>), we began by identifying potential EM candidates based on broad agreement in overall morphology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig48s5">Figure 48—figure supplements 5</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig48s7">7</xref>). Two anatomical features of R23E10 neurons – the lateral location of their soma and a fiber track that enters the FB slightly medial to the lateral border – unambiguously identified 14 candidate tangential neuron types with processes in layers 6 and 7 whose general morphology matched that of the R23E10 pattern (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig48s2">Figure 48—figure supplement 2</xref>). Next, directly comparing the light-level morphology of individual R23E10 neurons, generated by MCFO stochastic labeling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib249">Nern et al., 2015</xref>), to the 14 candidate EM neuron types allowed us to exclude 5 of the 14 candidates based on the presence of arbors that lie well outside the R23E10 pattern (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig48s4">Figure 48—figure supplement 4</xref>). Of the remaining nine candidates, seven neuron types had one or more high-quality matches between individual R23E10 neurons and corresponding EM morphologies: FB6A, FB6C_a, FB6C_b, FB6E, FB6G, FB6I, and FB6Z (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig48s3">Figure 48—figure supplement 3</xref>). The remaining two candidates – FB7A and FB7K – are also likely to be in the R23E10. Not only does R23E10 contain processes in layer 7, but we were able to identify high-quality matches with a subset of FB7A neurons and a moderate-quality match to FB7K. As presently defined, the FB7A neuron type contains three neurons per hemisphere. Two of these neurons send processes to the lateral portion of the SMP/SIP/SLP – a feature not observed in R23E10 – while the remaining neuron showed a high-quality match to several individual R23E10 neurons. Therefore, we include all FB7A neurons while recognizing that future work may further refine this neuron type and its relation to the R23E10 line.</p><p>Similarly, several lines of evidence support the identification of FB5H, FB6H, and FB7B as the three PPL1 dopaminergic types in the dorsal FB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig48s2">Figure 48—figure supplement 2</xref>). First, a stable split GAL4 that uses a 10 kb segment of the TH genomic region as one of its hemidrivers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Aso et al., 2014a</xref>) labels three neurons per hemisphere whose cell bodies express tyrosine hydroxylase (TH). Matching morphologies of individual neurons from this split to EM morphologies yielded high-quality matches to FB5H, FB6H, and FB7B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig49">Figure 49</xref>). Second, a driver line that specifically targets DANs, TH-GAL4, contains individual neurons whose morphology matches that of FB6H and FB7B (Fly Circuit TH collection, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Chiang et al., 2011</xref>). Third, although the general morphology of the FB5H, FB6H, and FB7B neuron types is similar to that of R23E10 neurons, all three neuron types have arbors that lie partly outside the R23E10 pattern, demonstrating that these DAN types are not present in R23E10. These PPL1 DANs are likely the primary wake-promoting DANs of the dFB, as previously indicated by experimental studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib213">Liu et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib366">Ueno et al., 2012</xref>). Although additional DANs in the PPM3 cluster – FB2A, FB4L, FB4M – innervate more ventral FB layers, there is as yet no data to indicate that they regulate sleep. However, it remains possible that unidentified DANs in the dFB, perhaps belonging to the PPM3 cluster, may also be involved.</p></sec><sec id="s4-22"><title>ROI groups</title><p>For the analysis in the Output section, all ROIs on the right side of the brain (with the exception of the CX) were grouped as a super-ROI.

We chose this metric as it is suitable for very sparse vectors while still conveying information about the proportions in which a neuron contacts its targets. Similarity matrices were ordered (and in some cases clustered) by using hierarchical clustering based on the complete linkage algorithm.</p></sec><sec id="s4-24"><title>Lateralizing neuron types</title><p>For some analyses, we subdivided types into left and right populations (respectively post-fixed with _L or _R). Right or left lateralization was determined by the position of the cell bodies, as taken from the ‘name’ field in neuprint. The only exception to this rule was made for PFL1, PFL3, PFR_a, and PFR_b. For these types, their assigned side corresponds to the side opposite to the hemisphere that the neuron innervates outside of the CX (the LAL or the round body). In a few instances, this side assignment differs from the cell body side.</p></sec><sec id="s4-25"><title>Pathways</title><p>Pathways between neuron types were determined by walking downstream (or upstream) of a set of types of interest. All significant downstream (upstream) types were determined, then all significant downstream (upstream) types of those types were found, and so on, for a defined number of steps. For the analysis in the Output section, for example, five steps were considered. Further, for this output analysis, type-to-type significance was determined using the criterion described above, which is a t-test on the vector of the type-to-type relative weights for connections to postsynaptic types containing multiple neuron instances, or a type-to-type connection whose relative weight exceeds 0.01 for connnections to postsynaptic types (or half-type as they are lateralized) constituted of a single instance (see section ‘Quantification of connectivity between neuron types’). Moreover, since the output pathways contain a lot of types constituted by a single very large neuron for which relative input weights can get very small, we also kept all type-to-type connections containing more than 50 synapses. Finally, to eliminate spurious connections stemming from small neuronal processes crossing ROI boundaries, we did not consider any connection to types containing less than 20 synapses in the super-ROI used (see above, ROI groups).</p><p>For sleep pathway analysis, significance was defined as any type-to-type connection whose relative weight exceeded 0.01. We adopted this alternative criterion because some FB tangential types are composed of only two neurons that can have strong but variable connections with neurons of another type, and these connections would occasionally be filtered out by our first criterion. This procedure leads to a connectivity graph, which we processed further as described below.</p><p>In the output analysis, we extended the connectivity graph by simulating contralateral connections at every step. These simulations mitigate the incompleteness of the EM volume on the left side. For example, if A_R contacts B_R with weight <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf54"><mml:mi>w</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula> in a lateralized region (in this case, the full right side of the brain excluding the CX), we added to the graph an equivalent connection from A_L to B_L on the other side. This was particularly useful when neurons crossed over the midline, but did not propagate if the symmetric neuron was not identified in the dataset.</p></sec><sec id="s4-26"><title>Pathway weight</title><p>Given two types A and B in a connectivity graph, we defined the <italic>pathway weight</italic> from A to B as the summed weight over all pathways, where the weights of individual pathways were obtained by multiplying relative weights along the steps of a given pathway, that is, <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf55"><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>W</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>p</mml:mi><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mi>h</mml:mi><mml:mi>w</mml:mi><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mi>y</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:msubsup><mml:mo>∑</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mi>p</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>P</mml:mi><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mi>h</mml:mi><mml:mi>w</mml:mi><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mi>y</mml:mi><mml:mi>s</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msubsup><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:msubsup><mml:mo>∏</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mi>s</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>S</mml:mi><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>p</mml:mi><mml:mi>s</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msubsup><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>w</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>p</mml:mi><mml:mi>s</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> . <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf56"><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>w</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>p</mml:mi><mml:mi>s</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:math></inline-formula> is the weight between partners <italic>p</italic> at step <italic>s</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig3">Appendix 1—figure 3</xref>). This is equivalent to multiplying the adjacency matrix <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf57"><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>A</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>g</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:math></inline-formula> with itself. In practice, because of recurrence, there are infinitely many pathways, and we therefore cannot loop over all of them. For the sleep pathway analysis, we used pathways that are no longer than the number of steps used to build the graph in the first place. For the output pathway analysis, given the high recurrence in the circuit, we multiplied <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf58"><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>A</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>g</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:math></inline-formula> until its norm converged to 0 (in practice when it becomes smaller than <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf59"><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:msup><mml:mrow><mml:mn>0</mml:mn></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mo>-</mml:mo><mml:mn>8</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msup></mml:math></inline-formula>). This multiplication always converges because the metric used (the relative weight) is smaller than 1.</p><p>To determine the relative contribution a neuron makes to a set of pathways, we ran the same computation but instead of using <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf60"><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>w</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>p</mml:mi><mml:mi>s</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:math></inline-formula> , we used the weight relative normalized by the sum of weight relative contributed by the presynaptic type. This yielded a metric that sums to 1 if all the pathways emanating from a given type are summed. The CX-to-CX fraction of individual synapses in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig56">Figure 56C</xref> is the relative contribution made to CX neurons by the neuron targeted by the synapse considered.</p><p>When considering pathways from the CX, we ended pathways as soon as they looped back to the CX. When considering pathways to a set of known types, we ended pathways as soon as a known neuron was reached. This was done by removing the corresponding line (column) in the resulting matrix to be recursively multiplied by the adjacency matrix.</p></sec><sec id="s4-27"><title>Immunohistochemistry</title><p>To determine whether neurons in the SS56699 split GAL4 line expressed TH, immunohistochemical processes was performed as described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Aso et al., 2014b</xref>. Briefly, 10 GFP-expressing brains were fixed (2% paraformaldehyde in Schneider’s medium), permeabilized in PBT (0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS), and blocked (5% normal goat serum for 90 min). Subsequently, brains were incubated in primary antibodies (diluted in 5% serum in PBT at 4°C for 2–4 days). Chicken anti-GFP (Abcam ab13970; 1:1000); anti-TH mouse monoclonal (Sigma MAB318; 1:200); anti-TH rabbit polyclonal (Sigma AB152; 1:200). After several washes (PBT for 30 min), brains were then incubated in secondary antibodies (diluted in 5% serum in PBT at 4°C for 2–4 days). Alexa 488 anti-chicken IgY (Invitrogen A11039; 1:400); Atto 647N anti-mouse IgG (Rockland 610-156-121; 1:400); Alexa 568 anti-rabbit IgG (Invitrogen A11036; 1:400). Finally, brains were washed thoroughly (PBT four times for 30 min or longer) and mounted on glass slides for confocal imaging.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf2"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology, Software, Validation, Visualization, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology, Software, Validation, Visualization, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology, Resources, Software, Validation, Visualization, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology, Software, Validation, Visualization, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Contributed to Figure 56-figure supplement 1, Methods Figure 1 and 2, and Table 2 and 3.

Intuitively, when considering long paths, connectivity gets very weak and diffuse. As a consequence, the pathway weights matrix, which is the sum of T<sub>N</sub> converges to a stable value.</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-66039-app1-fig3-v4.tif"/></fig></app></app-group></back><sub-article article-type="decision-letter" id="sa1"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.66039.sa1</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision letter</article-title></title-group><contrib-group content-type="section"><contrib contrib-type="editor"><name><surname>Calabrese</surname><given-names>Ronald L</given-names></name><role>Reviewing Editor</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/03czfpz43</institution-id><institution>Emory University</institution></institution-wrap><country>United States</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="reviewer"><name><surname>Heinze</surname><given-names>Stanley</given-names></name><role>Reviewer</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/012a77v79</institution-id><institution>Lund University</institution></institution-wrap><country>Sweden</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="reviewer"><name><surname>Pipkin</surname><given-names>Jason</given-names></name><role>Reviewer</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/05abbep66</institution-id><institution>Brandeis University</institution></institution-wrap><country>United States</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><boxed-text id="box1"><p>Our editorial process produces two outputs: (i) <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://sciety.org/articles/activity/10.1101/2020.12.08.413955">public reviews</ext-link> designed to be posted alongside <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.12.08.413955v1">the preprint</ext-link> for the benefit of readers; (ii) feedback on the manuscript for the authors, including requests for revisions, shown below.

The full connectome of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> central complex is both the beginning and the end of an era. It provides the first comprehensive dataset of arguably the most enigmatic brain region in the insect brain. This endeavor has generated ground truth data for years of functional work on the neural circuits the connectome outlines and constitutes an unparalleled foundation for exploring the structure function relations in nervous systems in general. While significantly going beyond models of central-complex function that existed previously, the authors have to be much credited for incorporating huge amounts of existing knowledge and data into their interpretations, not only work from <italic>Drosophila</italic>, but also from many other insects. This effort makes this paper not only an invaluable resource on the connectome of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> central complex, but also a most comprehensive review on the current state of the art in central-complex research. This unifying approach of the paper clearly marks a reset of central-complex research, essentially providing a starting point of hundreds of new lines of enquiry, probably for decades to come.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;A connectome of <italic>Drosophila</italic>'s central complex reveals network motifs for flexible navigation and context-dependent action&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 2 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Ronald Calabrese as the Senior and Reviewing Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Stanley Heinze (Reviewer #1); Jason Pipkin (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The reviewers were impressed with the quality of the data and the presentation and have only a few substantive concerns, which should be addressed as detailed in &quot;Recommendations for the authors.&quot;</p><p>1) Address the concern of Reviewer #1 about how synaptic strength is reflected in the connectome and the effect of experience/plasticity on the connectome and synaptic strength. Please include information on the sex and life experience of the fly from which the hemibrain was taken.</p><p>2) Address the concern of review #1 about additional data on neurite diameter and Neurite position for neurons originating from the w,x,y,z neuroblasts.</p><p>3) It would be helpful to reprise Table 1 from Scheffer et al. 2020 with names of brain regions (perhaps limited just to the CX regions).</p><p>4) Reviewer #2 has feedback on neuPrint generated figure that would make the manuscript more accessible and useful as a tool.</p><p>5) The paper is very well written and beautifully illustrated but is such a massive undertaking, it is to be expected that some minor details remain to be fixed. Please address all the minor concerns of the reviewers.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1) When covering the sensory input of the CX, especially when discussing how information from the anterior optic pathway is incorporated into the ellipsoid body (and hence the head direction circuit), there is much emphasis on hierarchies established by differences in synaptic strengths. Yet, at the same time it is clear that these exact synapses are subject to considerable plasticity, in particular synaptic depression based on visual input (needed for shaping visual scenes into a head direction signal). One wonders then what the particular fly used for obtaining the connectome has actually experienced before it was dissected. In particular, the fly has likely not been exposed to any polarized light signals, or other naturalistic features present in the outside world. The question arises whether the synaptic modulations shaping the ER-EPG connections have taken place in only a subset of pathways and hence the visible hierarchies and synaptic strengths are a mixture of default wiring (not shaped by experience) and wiring that has been sculpted by experience, giving a potentially distorted picture of the connection strengths. Information about the particular fly's sensory history should thus be provided and the potential implications, in particular to sensory input mapping, should be discussed.</p><p>2) While many dimensions of the data have been superbly analyzed in the paper, I am missing data on two aspects. Firstly, neurons of the CX are quite variable in their fiber diameter, and much data from other species is biased towards neurons with large main neurites. To aid interspecies comparisons, I wonder if diameter data can be provided for the cell types presented in the paper. For columnar cells, diameters could be measured in the bundle connecting the PB and CB, while for tangential cells, the main midline crossing neurite could be informative (as for hDelta cells). Given the large-cell bias in other insects, if large diameter cells from <italic>Drosophila</italic> are not found in other insects, they are more likely to not exist there, than if neurons with very small fiber diameters are not yet reported. Second: For neurons originating from the w,x,y,z neuroblasts, presenting the relative location of their main neurite within the w,x,y,z bundles would be informative for interspecies comparison as well, as the sequence of cells in the bundles from anterior to posterior roughly corresponds to the birth order of the neurons (for columnar, hDelta, and vDelta cells). I thus suggest to include one more figure illustrating the location of these cells within their bundle, and combine this with data about the diameter of the main neurites.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>I have no substantive scientific criticisms; the work is beyond thorough, and the analyses are well-founded. The biggest challenge for this paper is its length. There's very interesting analysis throughout, and particularly in the Discussion, alongside a whole lot of careful mapping that can be a lot drier (but of course, explaining the map properly is the whole point).</p><p>Here are my suggestions to the authors:</p><p>– It would be helpful to reprise Table 1 from Scheffer et al. 2020 with names of brain regions (perhaps limited just to the CX regions) for those readers that are not fly aficionados already. Such a table could be referenced near the top of the paper.</p><p>– The figures are uniformly beautiful. In fact I found myself wanting to interact with the 3D reconstructions (to zoom in, flip them around, and so forth). I understand that these were not generated solely in neuPrint, but is it possible to perhaps provide a hyperlink in the figure legend to the cells involved in neuPrint? That way people could at least look at the skeletons without searching for the cell name themselves. If it's possible to link to multiple cells at once and region highlights as well so that you basically recreate the entire figure (at least with skeletons) that would be excellent, and I think would also serve to increase familiarity with using neuPrint for the grad students and so on in fly labs everywhere that are going to be referring to this paper for years to come.</p><p>– There are likely a few minor typos here and there; I did not exhaustively search for them. The only thing I spotted that seemed remotely confusing was in the legend for Figure 66, panels Di and Dii are indicated by Ci and Cii.</p><p>To both the editors and the authors:</p><p>– I think it would be really useful if the online article featured an alt-text feature such that when your cursor hovers over an abbreviated neuron's name or brain region in the text, you saw (after a little delay) some information pop up in a small box that spells out what the brain region is or what the neuron's full name is. This could be as rich or as simple as you think fitting.</p><p>As you can see, my only concerns are on how to improve the practical usefulness of the paper – perhaps these suggestions are impossible or too time-consuming to implement! But thinking down the road, this is the kind of paper like John White's 1986 <italic>C. elegans</italic> connectome that labs are going to keep returning to. And because it will live online, primarily, and because the dataset itself is evolving online, I think anything that can be done to make it easier to use would be worthwhile.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.66039.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Address the concern of Reviewer #1 about how synaptic strength is reflected in the connectome and the effect of experience/plasticity on the connectome and synaptic strength.</p></disp-quote><p>We discuss our use of synapse counts to assess synaptic strength in the Results section that examines ring-neuron to EPG neuron connectivity patterns.
