Sphingolipids are particularly abundant in the brain, and defects in sphingolipid degradation are associated with several human neurodegenerative diseases. However, molecular mechanisms governing sphingolipid metabolism remain unclear. Here, we report that sphingolipid degradation is under transcriptional control of SIRT1, a highly conserved mammalian NAD<sup>+</sup>-dependent protein deacetylase, in mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs). Deletion of SIRT1 results in accumulation of sphingomyelin in mESCs, primarily due to reduction of SMPDL3B, a GPI-anchored plasma membrane bound sphingomyelin phosphodiesterase. Mechanistically, SIRT1 regulates transcription of <italic>Smpdl3b</italic> through c-Myc. Functionally, SIRT1 deficiency-induced accumulation of sphingomyelin increases membrane fluidity and impairs neural differentiation in vitro and in vivo. Our findings discover a key regulatory mechanism for sphingolipid homeostasis and neural differentiation, further imply that pharmacological manipulation of SIRT1-mediated sphingomyelin degradation might be beneficial for treatment of human neurological diseases.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>All cells in the brain start life as stem cells which are yet to have a defined role in the body. A wide range of molecules and chemical signals guide stem cells towards a neuronal fate, including a group of molecules called sphingolipids.

Defects in these enzymes can result in excess levels of sphingolipids, which can lead to neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s and Huntington’s disease.

To help answer this question, Fan et al. studied an enzyme called SIRT1 which has been shown to alleviate symptoms in animal models of neurodegenerative diseases.</p><p>Stem cells were extracted from a mouse embryo lacking the gene for SIRT1 and cultured in the laboratory. These faulty cells were found to have superfluous amounts of sphingolipids, which made their membranes more fluid and reduced their ability to develop into neuronal cells. Further investigation revealed that SIRT1 regulates the degradation of sphingolipids by promoting the production of another enzyme called SMPDL3B. Fan et al. also found that when female mice were fed a high-fat diet, this caused sphingolipids to accumulate in their embryos which lacked the gene for SIRT1; this, in turn, impaired the neural development of their offspring.</p><p>These findings suggest that targeting SIRT1 may offer new strategies for treating neurological diseases. The discovery that embryos deficient in SIRT1 are sensitive to high-fat diets implies that activating this enzyme might attenuate some of the neonatal complications associated with maternal obesity.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>SIRT1</kwd><kwd>sphingomyelin degradation</kwd><kwd>embryonic stem cells</kwd><kwd>neural development</kwd><kwd>embryogenesis</kwd><kwd>c-Myc</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000066</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Z01 ES102205</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Li</surname><given-names>Xiaoling</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>31730110 and 31661143031</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Zefeng</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01CA230631 and R01DK111430</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Xu</surname><given-names>Jian</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002858</institution-id><institution>China Postdoctoral Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2020M681437</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Fan</surname><given-names>Xiaojuan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>SIRT1, a cellular metabolic sensor, transcriptionally promotes sphingomyelin degradation in embryonic stem cells, which in turn modulates their membrane fluidity and neural differentiation.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>First isolated from brain extract in the 1880s, sphingolipid is a class of natural lipids containing a backbone of sphingoid base sphingosine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chen et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Merrill et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Pralhada Rao et al., 2013</xref>). Sphingolipids not only are the structural components of cell membranes, but also act as signaling molecules to control various cellular events, including signal transduction, cell growth, differentiation, and apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hannun and Obeid, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">van Meer et al., 2008</xref>). Particularly, sphingolipids are enriched in microdomains/lipid rafts, a liquid-ordered phase in plasma membrane, where sphingomyelin, glycosphingolipids, and cholesterol form unique platforms for many different proteins that are important for nutrient transport, organelle contact, membrane trafficking, and homotypic fusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brown and London, 1998</xref>).</p><p>The homeostasis of sphingolipids is maintained by a highly coordinated metabolic network that links together various pathways with ceramide as a central node (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Firstly, ceramide can be de novo synthesized in endoplasmic reticulum (ER), starting from the condensation of serine and fatty acyl-CoA by serine palmitoyltransferase (SPT). Ceramide is then transported to the Golgi complex and further converted into more complex forms of sphingolipids, such as glycosphingolipids or sphingomyelin. Secondly, ceramide can be regenerated by hydrolysis of complex sphingolipids in the Golgi complex and plasma membrane, which is catalyzed by a class of specific hydrolases and phosphodiesterases. For example, regeneration of ceramide from sphingomyelin can be mediated by plasma-membrane-bound sphingomyelin phosphodiesterases (SMPDs), including SMPDL3B, a GPI-anchored lipid raft SMPD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Heinz et al., 2015</xref>). By degrading sphingomyelin, SMPDL3B regulates plasma membrane fluidity, which in turn impacts TLR-mediated innate immunity in macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Heinz et al., 2015</xref>) and modulates insulin receptor signaling in podocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Mitrofanova et al., 2019</xref>). Sphingolipid metabolism is highly sensitive to environmental/nutritional perturbations. Sphingolipid biosynthesis and accumulation can be induced by high-fat diet (HFD) feeding in multiple tissues in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Choi and Snider, 2015</xref>). Sphingolipids are also accumulated during aging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Giusto et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lightle et al., 2000</xref>), and caloric restriction, a dietary regimen known to extend life span and delay a number of age-associated diseases, decreases sphingolipid accumulation by reducing the activity of SPT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Tacconi et al., 1991</xref>). Dietary serine restriction also alters sphingolipid diversity and synthesis to constrain tumor growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Muthusamy et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>Disruption of sphingolipid homeostasis has been involved in the pathogenesis of a number of human diseases, such as Niemann-Pick disease and neurodegenerative Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, and Huntington’s diseases. These human diseases are generally the outcomes of defect in enzymes that degrade the sphingolipids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brice and Cowart, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alvarez-Vasquez et al., 2005</xref>). Such degradation defect leads to accumulation of sphingolipids, which in turn dramatically alters cellular membrane structure and signaling, thereby triggering various diseases. Consequently, manipulation of one enzyme or metabolite in sphingolipid degradation pathways may result in unexpected changes in cellular metabolic programs and related cellular functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brice and Cowart, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alvarez-Vasquez et al., 2005</xref>). However, molecular mechanisms that regulate the expression of these sphingolipid degrading enzymes remain unclear.</p><p>In the present study, we investigated the role of SIRT1 in regulation of sphingolipid degradation in mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) and mouse embryos. SIRT1 is an NAD<sup>+</sup>-dependent protein deacetylase critical for multiple cellular processes, including metabolism, inflammation, stress response, and stem cell functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Houtkooper et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Tang et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Han et al., 2008</xref>). SIRT1 is also a key regulator of animal development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">McBurney et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cheng et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Wang et al., 2008</xref>) and is particularly important in the central nervous system. For instance, SIRT1 has a major influence on hypothalamic function, and cell-type specific SIRT1 mutations result in defects in systemic energy metabolism, circadian rhythm, and the lifespan of the animal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dietrich et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Ramadori et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Ramadori et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Satoh et al., 2013</xref>). SIRT1 also modulates dendritic and axonal growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hisahara et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Michán et al., 2010</xref>), and regulates synaptic plasticity and memory formation in adult brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gao et al., 2010</xref>). Moreover, SIRT1 has been shown to ameliorate neurodegenerative phenotypes in animal models of Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, and Huntington’s disease (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Herskovits and Guarente, 2014</xref>). However, despite multiple mechanisms proposed for these critical roles of SIRT1 in the brain, how SIRT1 regulates neural development and functions remains unclear. Through global metabolomics and cellular metabolic characterizations, we discovered that SIRT1 deficiency in mESCs results in abnormal accumulation of sphingolipids, primarily due to reduced degradation of these lipids. We further found that this abnormal accumulation of sphingolipids does not affect the maintenance of pluripotent mESCs, but delays their neural differentiation during in vitro neural differentiation and in vivo mouse embryogenesis. Moreover, we provide evidence that SIRT1 regulates sphingolipid metabolism through deacetylation of c-Myc transcription factor, which promotes the expression of SMPDL3B and subsequent sphingomyelin degradation in mESCs. Together, our study identifies the SIRT1-c-Myc axis as an important regulatory mechanism for cellular sphingolipid metabolism and neural differentiation.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Deletion of SIRT1 in ESCs results in accumulation of sphingomyelin</title><p>During a large-scale unbiased metabolomic analysis of WT and SIRT1 KO mESCs cultured in a serum-containing M10 medium, we discovered that SIRT1 KO mESCs display altered lipid metabolism, particularly metabolites involved in sphingolipid metabolism (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>), in addition to previously reported metabolic defects in methionine metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Tang et al., 2017</xref>).

Further bioinformatic analysis showed that this locus is overlapped with previously mapped binding regions of two TFs, c-Myc and EZH2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2A</xref>, bottom). c-Myc is a known SIRT1 deacetylation substrate, and deacetylation of c-Myc by SIRT1 has been reported to increase its stability and activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Menssen et al., 2012</xref>).

Moreover, inhibition of c-Myc activity by 10058-F4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Yin et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>) or knocking down c-Myc with siRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>) significantly reduced the mRNA abundance of <italic>Smpdl3b</italic> in WT mESCs but not or to a less extend in SIRT1 KO mESCs, indicating that c-Myc is a key transcription factor in SIRT1-mediated regulation of <italic>Smpdl3b</italic>. Furthermore, SIRT1 promoted the transcription of <italic>Smpdl3b</italic> in part through deacetylating c-Myc, as a c-Myc mutant with its major acetylation site mutated to R to mimic deacetylated c-Myc (K323R, KR), partially rescued the expression of <italic>Smpdl3b</italic> in SIRT1 KO mESCs compared to empty vector (V), WT c-Myc, and a c-Myc mutant with its major acetylation site mutated Q to mimic acetylated c-Myc (K323Q, KQ) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>).

We provide evidence that the SIRT1-Myc axis is vital for transcriptional activation of SMPDL3B, a major GPI-anchored plasma-membrane-bound sphingomyelin phosphodiesterase in mESCs. This transcriptional regulation directly impacts cellular levels of sphingomyelin and membrane fluidity, and is important in regulation of neural differentiation in response to developmental signals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9E</xref>). Our findings therefore identify a unique genetic regulatory pathway for sphingolipid homeostasis. Given the high sensitivity of SIRT1 to nutritional and environmental perturbations (e.g. activation upon caloric restriction and repression after HFD feeding or during aging <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cantó and Auwerx, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Imai, 2009</xref>), our study further suggests that SIRT1-Myc-regulatetd sphingolipid degradation may be an important element in mediating reported environmental influence on sphingolipid metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Choi and Snider, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Giusto et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lightle et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Tacconi et al., 1991</xref>). It will be of great interest to test this possibility in future studies.</p><p>As the most conserved mammalian NAD<sup>+</sup>-dependent protein deacetylase, SIRT1 has a number of important functions in the brain, including regulation of late stage of neural development and protection against a number of neurodegenerative diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Herskovits and Guarente, 2014</xref>). In particular, SIRT1 has been shown to modulate the neural and glial specification of neural precursors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Prozorovski et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kang et al., 2010</xref>) and repress low glucose induced proliferation and neurogenesis of neural stem and progenitor cells (NSCs) in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fusco et al., 2016</xref>). Our observations in the present study demonstrate that SIRT1 is also a key metabolic regulator for the differentiation of neural progenitors/NSCs from ESCs. Our results show that SIRT1 is highly expressed in mESCs cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>), where it functions to promote c-Myc-mediated transcriptional activation of SMPDL3B and sphingomyelin degradation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref>). This action of SIRT1 appears to have minimal impacts on the pluripotency of mESCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B and C</xref>), but instead is important for maintenance of a proper membrane fluidity for normal neural differentiation in response to nutritional/developmental cues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9E</xref>). Thus, by interacting with different protein factors, SIRT1 is important for neural differentiation and development at multiple stages.</p><p>How impaired degradation of sphingomyelin might influence the differentiation of ESCs remains unclear. Our observations that SMPDL3B deficiency in SIRT1 KO mESCs is associated with increase of membrane fluidity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>) and that pathways involved in cell surface receptor signaling pathway are one of the most significantly downregulated biological processes in SIRT1 KO mESCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>) suggest that impaired signaling transduction may underlie the impaired neural differentiation of these cells. This idea is consistent with the notion that sphingomyelin is important for formation of microdomains/lipid rafts on the plasma membrane for organization of many signaling proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brown and London, 1998</xref>). Future studies are needed to directly test whether the plasma membrane/microdomain association of signaling proteins involved in neural differentiation (e.g. insulin and/or bFGF signaling pathways) is disrupted and whether the phosphorylation of downstream signal transduction factors is reduced in SIRT1 KO mESCs upon induction of neural differentiation. Our findings further suggest that an appropriate content of sphingomyelin, thereby a suitable degree of membrane fluidity, is required to maintain a proper signaling transduction for normal neural differentiation, as too much sphingomyelin resulted from direct sphingomyelin supplementation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>) or SMPDL3B knockdown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8F</xref>) and too little sphingomyelin resulted from SMPDL3B overexpression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B and D</xref>) all impair the expression of neural markers and differentiation.</p><p>Our observations that <italic>Smpdl3b</italic> promoter is targeted by both c-Myc and EZH2, consequently with ‘co-localization’ of antagonistic epigenetic marks H3K4me3 and H3K27me3 at the same locus near its TSS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref> and S5A), suggest that <italic>Smpdl3b</italic> in mESCs might be a bivalent promoter-associated gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bernstein et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Sanz et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Vastenhouw and Schier, 2012</xref>). The bivalent chromatin domains in ESCs often mark lineage regulatory genes, and it has been proposed that bivalent domains might repress lineage control genes by H3K27me3 during pluripotency while keeping them poised for activation upon differentiation with H3K4me3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Vastenhouw and Schier, 2012</xref>). Interestingly, the bivalent chromatin domain on <italic>Smpdl3b</italic> appears to keep it active in mESCs while poising it to be repressed upon differentiation. Moreover, while long-recognized as a transcription repressor through deacetylation of histones, SIRT1 plays an active role in remodeling this bivalent domain by stabilizing c-Myc while restricting EZH2-induced H3K27me3 in mESCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9E</xref>). Our present study reveals that this SIRT1/c-Myc/EZH2-regulated bivalent domain remodeling enables swift membrane remodeling in response to developmental signals, allowing more efficient and synchronous neural differentiation. Premature disruption of this chromatin remodeling complex in mESCs alters membrane fluidity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>), which may in turn affect developmental signaling transduction (e.g. insulin, bFGF) and impair neural differentiation. Future studies will be needed to elucidate the general role of this bivalent chromatin switch in regulation of pluripotency vs lineage genes, as well as in process of somatic cell reprogramming and/or transformation.</p><p>The transcriptional regulation of sphingolipid metabolism and neural differentiation by the SIRT1-Myc axis in mESCs revealed in our present study is very intriguing, as we have previously reported that the same regulatory axis is key for methionine metabolism and maintenance of pluripotency in mESCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Tang et al., 2017</xref>). While our data show that accumulation of sphingomyelin in SIRT1 KO mESCs is independently of methionine metabolism (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>), additional studies are needed to assess how the SIRT1-Myc regulatory axis coordinates diverse metabolic processes to shape stem cell fates in response to different environmental signals. It is also worth noting that SIRT1 KO mESCs have additional lipid metabolic defects, including depletion of monoacyglycerols, accumulation of plasmalogens, acetylcholine, and monohydroxy fatty acids, and altered phospholipids, regardless of medium methionine concentrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). It will be of importance to evaluate the contribution of these lipid metabolic defects to the observed hypersensitivity of SIRT1 KO embryos to maternal HFD feeding-induced intrauterine growth retardation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A</xref>) in future studies.</p><p>Our study has a few important implications. Firstly, the previously uncharacterized transcriptional regulation of SIRT1 on sphingomyelin degradation directly links cellular levels of sphingomyelin and membrane fluidity with cellular energy status, and provides a possible molecular mechanism for the beneficial impacts of SIRT1 small molecule activators and/or NAD<sup>+</sup>-boosting dietary supplements on human neurodegenerative diseases. Secondly, given the prevalence of obesity and metabolic syndrome in the reproductive population in modern society, the hypersensitivity of SIRT1 KO embryos to maternal HFD feeding-induced intrauterine growth retardation and neurodevelopmental defects suggests that pharmacological activation of SIRT1 by small molecule activators and/or NAD<sup>+</sup>-boosting dietary supplements might be able to attenuate maternal obesity-associated neonatal complications and defective childhood neurodevelopment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Iessa and Bérard, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Helle and Priest, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Tong and Kalish, 2021</xref>).</p><p>In summary, our study uncovers a SIRT1-Myc-mediated transcriptional regulation of sphingomyelin degradation that modulates neural differentiation of ESCs. This finding highlights the importance of SIRT1 and its regulation in mESC differentiation and embryonic development, and may have important implications in potential therapeutic strategies again human neurodegenerative diseases and/or maternal obesity-induced adverse developmental outcomes.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Key Resources Table</title><p>Please see the appendix.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Mammalian cell lines</title><p>WT ad SIRT1 KO mESCs generated in R1 mESC line have been reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Tang et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">McBurney et al., 2003</xref>).

The paper defines mechanistic connections between SIRT1, sphingolipids, and stem cell differentiation. The data generated from multiple complementary experimental approaches are of high quality and convincingly support the claims made.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;SIRT1 regulates sphingolipid metabolism and neural differentiation of mouse embryonic stem cells through c-Myc- SMPDL3B&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 2 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Matt Kaeberlein as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>The reviewers appreciated the interest of the findings and the high quality the experiments. Most of the reviewers' specific comments can be addressed with text clarifications and discussions. Major new experimental studies are not required.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1. A discussion about how impairing the degradation of sphingomyelin might influence the differentiation of ESCs (signaling, protein localization in membranes etc.) would be a valuable addition to the manuscript.</p><p>2. With respect to Figure 6C please comment on why SM treatment increases protein levels of Nestin in WT ESC but decreases protein levels of Nestin in Sirt1 KO ESCs. Would removing SM with SMase also lower the protein levels of Nestin in Sirt1 ESCs?</p><p>3. The labeling in Figure 8 is very confusing and there are apparent inconsistencies between the data presented here and the data in Figure 6. The four panels in the top left of Figure 8B (staining for TUBB3) seem to show more TUBB3 (or at least equal amounts) in the Sirt1 KO cells, and reintroduction of Smpdl3 to the Sirt1 KO cells appears to lower TUBB3. This is inconsistent with the text. TUBB3 staining is also presented in the four panels on the top right of Figure 8B. The label under the graph says 6 weeks induction but there is no indication in the text or the methods what this means. The TUBB3 staining in these four panels (top right of Figure 8B) shows that TUBB3 is lower in the Sirt1 KOs (empty vector). This set of panels is consistent with the text but its not clear what the difference is between the TUBB3-stained panels on the top right and the TUBB3-stained panels on the top left. In the bottom left four panels of Figure 8B, Nestin staining is lower in the Sirt1 KOs compared to WT treated with vector control. This is inconsistent with Figure 6C which shows that Nestin is higher in the Sirt1 KOs.</p><p>4. The authors present strong evidence that sphingomyelin degradation is mediated via SMPDL3B, but its enzymatic activity has not been directly investigated. Could SMPDL3B phosphodiesterase activity be detected in cellular assays or the requirement for its enzymatic activity demonstrated in rescue experiments?</p><p>5. Was Smpdl3b expression kinetics determined in the neural differentiation experiment shown in Figure 7B? The expression pattern from pluripotent to more committed cells (which I expect to follow SIRT1) would be informative for potential temporal effects during neural development.</p><p>6. The authors mainly focus on the murine system, but also provide evidence for accumulation of sphingomyelin in human ES cells upon SIRT1 knockout. However, this effect seems to be less striking in human than in murine cells (Table S2). Is there a reason why the metabolomics experiment was performed in presence of serum for the murine and in serum-free conditions for the human datasets? Could this be a reason for the observed discrepancy?</p><p>7. In Figure S5, the functional annotation analysis has been performed using all 2839 genes downregulated in SIRT1 KO ES cells, without considering their significance (padj). I suggest performing this analysis considering only genes that show a significant reduction in SIRT1 KO. It could also make sense to intersect significantly down-regulated genes with genes involved in lipid metabolism to identify potential candidates contributing to SIRT1/SMPDL3B-function.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.67452.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1.

We added a paragraph of discussion on the possible molecular mechanisms underlying defective ESC differentiation caused by impaired sphingomyelin degradation (Page 17, Line 403-415):</p><p>“How impaired degradation of sphingomyelin might influence the differentiation of ESCs remains unclear. […] Future studies are needed to directly test whether the plasma membrane/microdomain association of signaling proteins involved in neural differentiation (e.g. insulin and/or bFGF signaling pathways) is disrupted and whether the phosphorylation of downstream signal transduction factors is reduced in SIRT1 KO mESCs upon induction of neural differentiation.”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. With respect to Figure 6C please comment on why SM treatment increases protein levels of Nestin in WT ESC but decreases protein levels of Nestin in Sirt1 KO ESCs. Would removing SM with SMase also lower the protein levels of Nestin in Sirt1 ESCs?</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for the insightful question. Based on our observations in this study, we believe that an appropriate content of sphingomyelin, thereby a suitable degree of membrane fluidity, is required to maintain a proper signaling transduction for normal maintenance of pluripotent stem cells as well as for normal neural differentiation. Specifically, for the results in Figure 6C, since WT ESCs have a low level of sphingomyelin, we speculate that supplementation with exogenous sphingomyelin increases membrane contents of sphingomyelin, which may in turn increase the microdomain formation and inappropriately enhance neural differentiation signaling. SIRT1 KO mESCs, on the other hand, already have accumulation of sphingomyelin. Further treatment with exogenous sphingomyelin may disrupt the membrane structure, leading to impaired expression of Nestin. Yes, removing sphingomyelin by SMPDL3B in SIRT1 KO mESCs could lower the protein levels of Nestin. As shown in our new Figure 6D, overexpression of WT but not H135A mutant SMPDL3B reduced the expression of Nestin in SIRT1 KO mESCs. We added a few sentences in the Discussion (Page 18, Line 415-421) on the importance of an appropriate sphingomyelin content/membrane fluidity in pluripotent stem cells and neural differentiation:</p><p>“Our findings further suggest that an appropriate content of sphingomyelin, thereby a suitable degree of membrane fluidity, is required to maintain a proper signaling transduction for normal neural differentiation, as too much sphingomyelin resulted from direct sphingomyelin supplementation (Figure 6C) or SMPDL3B knockdown (Figure 8F) and too little sphingomyelin resulted from SMPDL3B overexpression (Figure 8B and 8D) all impair the expression of neural markers and differentiation.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. The labeling in Figure 8 is very confusing and there are apparent inconsistencies between the data presented here and the data in Figure 6. The four panels in the top left of Figure 8B (staining for TUBB3) seem to show more TUBB3 (or at least equal amounts) in the Sirt1 KO cells, and reintroduction of Smpdl3 to the Sirt1 KO cells appears to lower TUBB3. This is inconsistent with the text. TUBB3 staining is also presented in the four panels on the top right of Figure 8B. The label under the graph says 6 weeks induction but there is no indication in the text or the methods what this means.

This is inconsistent with Figure 6C which shows that Nestin is higher in the Sirt1 KOs.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for the confusion caused by data in Figure 6 and Figure 8.</p><p>Firstly, please let us to clarify that the data Figure 6 is from undifferentiated mESCs, in which deletion of SIRT1 leads to increased expression of neural differentiation markers (which should be silenced at the pluripotent stage). On the other hand, data in Figure 8 is from cells after 4 weeks of neural differentiation (excepted for the right four panels in Figure 8B). Our data indicate that although SIRT1 KO mESCs have an increased expression of neural marker at the stem cell stage, upon differentiation, the induction of these markers is blunted. Therefore, both the reduction of pluripotency markers and the induction of NSC/neural differentiation factors were significantly blunted when SIRT1 was deleted, which is consistent with our qPCR data in Figure 7B.</p><p>Secondly, the two TUBB3 staining in Figure 8B are from different time points after differentiation. The left four panels are after regular 4 weeks of neural differentiation, while the right four panels are after 6 weeks of neural differentiation for a better morphological analysis. The primary purpose of the TUBB3 staining was to show the atypical morphology of these TUBB3 positive neurons differentiated from SIRT1 KO mESCs. They were not meant to show their overall expression levels. The overall expression of TUBB3 in 4-week neural differentiation culture was quantified by FACS in original Figure 8D (new Figure 8C).</p><p>To avoid further confusion, we rearranged Figure 8 in the revision. We split the original Figure 8B into two parts, with TUBB3 staining as new Figure 8B for neuronal morphological alteration. The Nestin and GABA staining images are now new Figure 8D for neural marker expression alteration.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. The authors present strong evidence that sphingomyelin degradation is mediated via SMPDL3B, but its enzymatic activity has not been directly investigated. Could SMPDL3B phosphodiesterase activity be detected in cellular assays or the requirement for its enzymatic activity demonstrated in rescue experiments?</p></disp-quote><p>Great suggestion. To address this question, we generated a catalytic inactive mutant of SMPDL3B (H135A), then overexpressed it into WT and SIRT1KO mESCs and analyzed its impact on cellular levels of sphingomyelin and expression of Nestin in mESCs. Our data indicate that the activity of SMPDL3B is required to reduce cellular levels of sphingomyelin in WT, particularly SIRT1 KO, mESCs (Figure 3D, 3E, and 3F). Its activity is also required to rescue (repress) the abnormal activation of Nestin in undifferentiated SIRT1 KO mESCs (Figure 6D). Unfortunately, due to the visa renewal issue of Dr. Fan, we did not have sufficient time to test whether the enzymatic activity of SMPDL3B is required to rescue the neural differentiation defects in SIRT1 KO mESCs.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. Was Smpdl3b expression kinetics determined in the neural differentiation experiment shown in Figure 7B? The expression pattern from pluripotent to more committed cells (which I expect to follow SIRT1) would be informative for potential temporal effects during neural development.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for the suggestion. We analyzed the mRNA levels of <italic>Smpdl3b</italic> during the 4-week of neural differentiation, and the result is shown in new Figure 7B. Yes, the expression pattern of <italic>Smpdl3b</italic> is similar to that of SIRT1 during in vitro neural differentiation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. The authors mainly focus on the murine system, but also provide evidence for accumulation of sphingomyelin in human ES cells upon SIRT1 knockout. However, this effect seems to be less striking in human than in murine cells (Table S2). Is there a reason why the metabolomics experiment was performed in presence of serum for the murine and in serum-free conditions for the human datasets? Could this be a reason for the observed discrepancy?</p></disp-quote><p>Yes, the reviewer is correct that the accumulation of sphingomyelin in SIRT1 KO mESCs is much more striking than that in SIRT1 KO hESCs. We also believe this difference is primarily due to the presence of serum in mESC culture, as serum is the major source of lipids for cultured cells.</p><p>The reason for why mESCs were cultured in serum-containing medium while hESCs were cultured in serum-free medium for the metabolomics experiments was primarily technical. As mentioned in Figure 1, the metabolomics experiments were first performed to assess the impact of methionine on the maintenance of SIRT1 KO ESCs for one of our previous studies (30). We had to use serum-containing medium for methionine restriction in mESCs due to the unavailability of methionine-restricted serum-free ESGRO medium. hESCs, on the other hand, can only be maintained in serum-free medium as serum will induce their differentiation. We were able to make methionine-restricted serum-free medium for hESCs.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7. In Figure S5, the functional annotation analysis has been performed using all 2839 genes downregulated in SIRT1 KO ES cells, without considering their significance (padj).

It could also make sense to intersect significantly down-regulated genes with genes involved in lipid metabolism to identify potential candidates contributing to SIRT1/SMPDL3B-function.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks again for the suggestion. We reanalyzed our RNA-seq data using an improved reads count algorithm (FeatureCounts in Subread) and updated the Table S3 with a new DEG list generated with q (padi)&lt;0.01 as a cutoff. GO analysis of the 2541 significantly downregulated genes in SIRT1 KO mESCs revealed that pathways involved in cell surface receptor signaling pathway and intracelluar signal transduction were among the most significantly disrupted GO Biological Process (GO BP) in SIRT1 KO mESCs when compared with WT mESCs (new Figure S6A). Interestingly, <italic>Smpdl3b</italic> was grouped in three overlapping pathways involved in phosphorus metabolism (highlighted in red). Future studies are needed to explore the intriguing link between sphingomyelin degradation and phosphorus metabolism, including phosphate transport, production, and protein phosphorylation-mediated signaling.</p></body></sub-article></article>
