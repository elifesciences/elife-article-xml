social rather than biological constructs. Genetic ancestry has been suggested as an alternative to this categorization. Herein, we typed over 450,000 CpG sites in whole blood of 573 individuals of diverse Hispanic origin who also had high-density genotype data. We found that both self-identified ethnicity and genetically determined ancestry were each significantly associated with methylation levels at 916 and 194 CpGs, respectively, and that shared genomic ancestry accounted for a median of 75.7% (IQR 45.8% to 92%) of the variance in methylation associated with ethnicity. There was a significant enrichment (p=4.2×10<sup>-64</sup>) of ethnicity-associated sites amongst loci previously associated environmental exposures, particularly maternal smoking during pregnancy. We conclude that differential methylation between ethnic groups is partially explained by the shared genetic ancestry but that environmental factors not captured by ancestry significantly contribute to variation in methylation.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.20532.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.20532.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.20532.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Whether a person develops a particular disease can depend on both genetic and environmental factors. Many studies have found that people of different races and ethnicities have different likelihoods of acquiring certain diseases. Race and ethnicity are social constructs; that is, they are not necessarily defined biologically. However, shared ancestry will produce genetic links between members of a group. In addition, members of an ethnic group often share a culture or environment that may influence their risk of disease. For example, the ‘Mediterranean diet’ inspired by the dietary habits of Southern Italians has been shown to reduce the risk of heart disease, diabetes and cancer.</p><p>The addition of chemical groups – such as methyl groups – to DNA strands can affect the activity of nearby genes. Methylation is controlled by both genetic and environmental factors, and altered patterns of DNA methylation are seen in some diseases. It is therefore an ideal biological process to study to determine how race/ethnicity and ancestry contribute to a person’s susceptibility to disease.</p><p>Galanter et al. have now studied the patterns of methylation found in the blood of 573 people from diverse Latino ethnic sub-groups. The different groups displayed significantly different patterns of methylation at hundreds of locations across the genome. Genetic ancestry explained approximately 75% of the variation in methylation between the sub-groups. In addition, the methylation patterns at DNA locations known to be affected by environmental exposures – for example, by exposure to tobacco while in the womb – were disproportionately likely to be methylated differently in different sub-groups.</p><p>Now that more is known about the relative effects of race/ethnicity and genetic ancestry on methylation, the next step is to apply this knowledge to disease processes. This will help us to better understand the source of health disparities across different groups of people.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.20532.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.20532.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>methylation</kwd><kwd>epigenetics</kwd><kwd>ethnicity</kwd><kwd>Latinos</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>multiple</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Galanter</surname><given-names>Joshua M</given-names></name><name><surname>Gignoux</surname><given-names>Christopher R</given-names></name><name><surname>Thakur</surname><given-names>Neeta</given-names></name><name><surname>Farber</surname><given-names>Harold J</given-names></name><name><surname>Kumar</surname><given-names>Rajesh</given-names></name><name><surname>Seibold</surname><given-names>Max A</given-names></name><name><surname>Burchard</surname><given-names>Esteban G</given-names></name><name><surname>Zaitlen</surname><given-names>Noah</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100008925</institution-id><institution>American Asthma Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Burchard</surname><given-names>Esteban G</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Sandler Family Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Burchard</surname><given-names>Esteban G</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100005188</institution-id><institution>Tobacco-Related Disease Research Program</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>24RT-0025</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Burchard</surname><given-names>Esteban G</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100005640</institution-id><institution>Flight Attendant Medical Research Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Burchard</surname><given-names>Esteban G</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Hewett Fellowship</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Galanter</surname><given-names>Joshua M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Parker B.

For example, race- and ethnicity-specific clinical reference standards are based on population-based sampling on a given physical trait such as pulmonary function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hankinson et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Quanjer et al., 2012</xref>). However, because race and ethnicity are social constructs and poor markers for genetic diversity, they fail to capture the heterogeneity present within racial/ethnic groups and in admixed populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Borrell, 2005</xref>). To account for these heterogeneities and to avoid social and political controversies, the genetics community has grouped individuals by genetic ancestry instead of race and ethnicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Yudell et al., 2016</xref>). Indeed, recent work from our group and others have demonstrated that genetic ancestry improves diagnostic precision compared to racial/ethnic categorizations for specific medical conditions and clinical decisions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kumar et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Udler et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Nalls et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>However, racial and ethnic categories also reflect the shared experiences and exposures to known risk factors for disease, such as air pollution and tobacco smoke, poverty, and inadequate access to medical services, which have all contributed to worse disease outcomes in certain populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Nguyen et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Evans and Kantrowitz, 2002</xref>). Thus, it is unclear whether defining groups through genetic ancestry can capture these shared exposures. In this work we seek to explore the contributions of genetically defined ancestry and social, cultural and environmental factors to understanding differential methylation between ethnic groups.</p><p>Epigenetic modification of the genome through methylation plays a key role in the regulation of diverse cellular processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Smith and Meissner, 2013</xref>). Changes in DNA methylation patterns have been associated with complex diseases, including various cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kulis and Esteller, 2010</xref>), cardiovascular disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Udali et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kato et al., 2015</xref>), obesity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bell et al., 2010</xref>), diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chambers et al., 2015</xref>), autoimmune and inflammatory diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Liu et al., 2013</xref>), and neurodegenerative diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lardenoije et al., 2015</xref>). Epigenetic changes are thought to reflect influences of both genetic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bell et al., 2011</xref>) and environmental factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Feil and Fraga, 2011</xref>), and have been shown to vary between racial groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Barfield et al., 2014</xref>). The discovery of methylation quantitative trait loci (meQTL’s) across populations by Bell et al. established the influence of genetic factors on methylation levels in a variety of tissue types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bell et al., 2011</xref>), with meQTL’s explaining between 22% and 63% of the variance in methylation levels. Multiple environmental factors have also been shown to affect methylation levels, including endocrine disruptors, tobacco smoke (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Joubert et al., 2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">2016</xref>), polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, infectious pathogens, particulate matter, diesel exhaust particles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jiang et al., 2014</xref>), allergens, heavy metals, and other indoor and outdoor pollutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Ho et al., 2012</xref>). Psychosocial factors, including measures of traumatic experiences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chen et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Ressler et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">van der Knaap et al., 2014</xref>), socioeconomic status (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lam et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Borghol et al., 2012</xref>), and general perceived stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Vidal et al., 2014</xref>), also affect methylation levels. Since both genetic and environmental exposures affect methylation, this represents an ideal phenotype to explore the contributions of these two factors on differential methylation between ethnic groups.</p><p>In this work, we leveraged genome-wide methylation data in 573 Latino children of diverse Latino sub-ethnicities enrolled in the Genes-Environment and Admixture in Latino Americans (GALA II) study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Oh et al., 2012</xref>) whose genetic ancestry had been determined from dense genotyping arrays. This allowed us to explore the extent to which the differences in methylation between Latino sub-groups could be explained by their shared genetic ancestry. We found that many of the methylation differences associated with ethnicity could be explained by shared genetic ancestry. However, even after adjusting for ancestry, significant differences in methylation remained between the groups at multiple loci, reflecting social and environmental influences upon methylation.</p><p>Our findings have important implications for both the use of ancestry to capture biological changes and of race/ethnicity to account for social and environmental exposures. Epigenome-wide association studies in diverse populations may be susceptible to confounding due to environmental exposures in addition to confounding due to population stratification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Michels et al., 2013</xref>).

To rule out any residual confounding due to recruitment sites, we conducted an additional analysis on the effect of recruitment site on methylation both for the overall study and for the Mexican participants (the largest study population in this analysis). We observed no significant independent effect of recruitment site suggesting that confounding due to recruitment region was limited, at least within the United States.</p><p>To explore the effect of departures from a linear association between ancestry and methylation, we incorporated both higher order polynomials and cubic splines of ancestry into our models. We observed a significant departure from linearity (p&lt;0.05) in only 26 (for splines) and 25 (for polynomials) of the 314 CpG’s where an association between ethnicity and methylation remained after adjusting for ancestry; however, the association between ethnicity and methylation remained even after adjusting for non-linearity at all sites (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1C,D</xref>).</p><p>Environmental differences between geographic locations or recruitment sites are a potential non-genetic explanation for ethnic differences in methylation. We investigated the independent effect of recruitment site on methylation by analyzing the associations between recruitment site and individual methylation loci after adjusting for ethnicity. We did not find any loci significantly associated with recruitment site at a significance threshold of 1.6×10<sup>−7</sup>. We then performed an analysis to assess the effect of recruitment sites on methylation stratified by ethnicity. We did not find any loci significantly associated with recruitment site and methylation among Mexican participants. We were underpowered to perform a similar analysis for Puerto Ricans because there were only 27 Puerto Rican participants recruited outside of Puerto Rico. To ensure that the absence of association in Mexicans was not due to the loss of power from the smaller sample size, we repeated our analysis of the association between ethnicity and ancestry randomly down-sampling to 276 participants to match the sample size in the analysis of geography in Mexicans. While down-sampling the study to this degree resulted in a loss of power, 128 methylation sites were still associated with ancestry. We conclude that recruitment site was unlikely to be a significant confounder of our associations between ethnicity and methylation and was not a significant independent predictor of methylation.</p><p>While most population substructure in Latinos would be expected to arise from differences in continental ancestry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Galanter, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bryc et al., 2010</xref>), there is evidence of finer scale (sub-continental) ancestry in Latino populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Moreno-Estrada et al., 2014</xref>). We tested for the effect of fine scale substructure by calculating principal components for all participants with genotyping data using Eigensoft (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Patterson et al., 2006</xref>). We found significant associations between principal components 3–10 (PC’s 1 and 2 were almost perfectly collinear with ancestry, with an adjusted R<sup>2</sup> &gt; 0.998 for all three ancestry proportions, and were therefore excluded) and ethnicity. We therefore added these 8 PC’s to models of ethnicity and methylation, and found an association between these genetic PC’s and methylation in 63/314 CpG’s that had remained associated with ethnicity after adjusting for ancestry.

While genomic ancestry can explain the association between ethnicity and methylation at 66% of the 916 loci associated with ethnicity, factors other than shared ancestry that correlate with ethnicity, such as social, economic, cultural and environmental exposures account for the association between ethnicity and methylation at 34% (314/916) of loci.</p><p>We conclude that systematic environmental differences between ethnic subgroups likely play an important role in shaping the methylome for both individuals and populations. Loci previously associated with diverse environmental exposures such as <italic>in utero</italic> exposure to tobacco smoke (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Joubert et al., 2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">2016</xref>), as well as diesel exhaust particles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jiang et al., 2014</xref>) and psychosocial stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chen et al., 2013</xref>) were enriched in our set of loci where methylation was associated with ethnicity. Twenty-seven of the loci associated with maternal smoking during pregnancy in a large consortium meta-analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Joubert et al., 2016</xref>) were differentially methylated between Latino sub-groups at a genome-wide significance threshold of 1.6 × 10<sup>−7</sup>. Interestingly, this included both loci whose association persisted after adjustment for ancestry and fine-scale population substructure and are thus presumed to be due to environmental differences between ethnic groups and loci in which the association between ethnicity and methylation could be fully explained by genetically defined ancestry.</p><p>There are a number of plausible reasons for overlap between CpG’s associated with ancestry and those associated with environmental exposure. It is possible that this represents a gene-environment interaction, and that individuals with certain genetic backgrounds are more susceptible to the effects of environmental exposures such as <italic>in utero</italic> tobacco smoke than those of other genetic backgrounds. It has been previously reported that Hispanic smokers with high Native American ancestry had reduced risk of methylation across 12 genes, suggesting an ancestry by smoking interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Leng et al., 2013</xref>). Because the majority of studies that comprised the consortium that identified differentially methylated regions enrolled participants of European descent, such interactions might not have been evident in their study.</p><p>It is also possible that environmental exposures correlate with ancestry and that participants with certain ancestral backgrounds may have been more exposed to <italic>in utero</italic> tobacco smoke than those of other backgrounds. Several studies have shown correlations between genetic ancestry and environmental exposures, including socioeconomic status (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Florez et al., 2011</xref>), overweight and obesity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Ziv et al., 2006</xref>), and birth site and country of residence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">González Burchard et al., 2005</xref>).</p><p>Though our analysis of global ancestry showed that a majority of the variance explained jointly by local and global ancestry can be traced to specific loci in the genome acting in –cis, a substantial proportion cannot. Some of the residual association between global ancestry and methylation may be due to genetic effects acting in –trans; however, the possibility that some of it may be due to environmental exposures correlating with global ancestry cannot be excluded. Thus, it is plausible that genomic ancestry is acting as a proxy for both genetic and environmental effects in our study. If this is the case, our study likely underestimates the degree to which environmental factors explain differential methylation between ethnic groups.</p><p>Finally, it is possible that our analysis identified DMRs that are independently modifiable by both genetic and environmental exposures. Thus, regions of the genome that are differentially methylated due to genetic polymorphisms may also be more susceptible to differential methylation due to environmental exposures.</p><p>Thus, inclusion of relevant social and environmental exposures in studies of methylation may help elucidate racial/ethnic disparities in disease prevalence, health outcomes and therapeutic response. However, in many cases, a detailed environmental exposure history is unknown, unmeasurable or poorly quantifiable, and race/ethnicity may be a useful, albeit imperfect proxy. However, if a comprehensive catalog of the effects of exposures can be compiled, it may be possible to use genome-wide methylation analysis as a biomarker of exposure long after the exposure has passed and can no longer be measured.</p><p>Our comprehensive analysis of high-density methyl- and genotyping from genomic DNA allowed us to investigate the genetic control of methylation in great detail and without the potential destabilizing effects of EBV transformation and culture in cell lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Grafodatskaya et al., 2010</xref>). The strongest patterns of methylation are associated with cell composition in whole blood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lam et al., 2012</xref>). However, the specific type of Latino ethnic-subgroups (Puerto Rican, Mexican, other, or mixed) is also associated with principal coordinates of genome-wide methylation.</p><p>Our approach has some potential limitations. It is possible that fine-scale population structure (sub-continental ancestry) within European, African, and Native American populations may contribute to ethnic differences in methylation, as we had previously reported in the case of lung function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Moreno-Estrada et al., 2014</xref>). However, despite the presence of additional substructure among the GALA II participants, PC’s 3–10 explained the association between ethnicity and ancestry at only 51 loci. PCs from chip-based genotypes will not capture all forms of genetic variation. Clusters of ethnicity specific rare variants of large effect or strong ethnicity-specific selective sweeps in the last 8–12 generations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Galanter et al., 2012</xref>) could also give rise to methylation differences, but these are inconsistent with existing rare variant and selection analyses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hernandez et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Tang et al., 2007</xref>). Our models of genetic ancestry assumed a linear effect of ancestry on methylation, whereas a nonlinear association or other model misspecification could have led to incomplete adjustment for genetic ancestry, and thus, led to a residual association between ethnicity and methylation. However, when we added second and third order polynomials or cubic splines to our models, we found evidence for a nonlinear association between ancestry and methylation at only 25 and 26 loci, respectively, and it did not affect the association between ethnicity and methylation. Although it is impossible to account for all types of non-linearity and non-additivity (such as gene by gene or gene by environment interaction), our analysis suggests that non-linear effects are unlikely to be significant. Since our study was geographically diverse, recruiting participants at five recruitment sites in the United States and Puerto Rico, it is possible that systematic differences associated with site of recruitment might have influenced observed methylation differences between ethnic groups. However, when we included recruitment site as a covariate, we found no significant effect on methylation independent of ethnicity.</p><p>The presence of a strong association between genetic ancestry and methylation raises the possibility that epigenetic studies can be confounded by population stratification, similar to genetic association studies, and that adjustment for either genetic ancestry or selected principal components is warranted. This possibility was first demonstrated in a previous analysis of the association between self-described race and methylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Barfield et al., 2014</xref>). However, the study only evaluated two distinct racial groups (African Americans and Whites), while the present study demonstrates the possibility of population stratification in an admixed and heterogeneous population with participants from diverse Latino national origins. The tendency to consider Latinos as a homogenous or monolithic ethnic group makes any analysis of this population particularly challenging. Our finding of loci whose methylation patterns differed between Latino ethnic subgroups, even after adjusting for genetic ancestry, suggests that any analysis of these populations in disease-association studies without adjusting for ethnic heterogeneity is likely to result in spurious associations even after controlling for genomic ancestry. However, the methylation loci identified in this study, as well as studies of environmental exposures, could be particularly interesting loci for the study of biomedical outcomes, particularly those with disparate prevalence between racial/ethnic groups, such as asthma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Barr et al., 2016</xref>). If methylation loci associated with ethnicity or ancestry were shown to be associated with a biomedical outcome, it could help explain racial/ethnic disparities in disease.</p><p>In summary, this study provides a framework for understanding how genetic, social and environmental factors can contribute to systematic differences in methylation patterns between ethnic subgroups, even between presumably closely related populations such as Puerto Ricans and Mexicans. Methylation QTL’s whose allele frequency varies by ancestry lead to an association between local ancestry and methylation level. This, in turn, leads to systematic variation in methylation patterns by ancestry, which then contributes to ethnic differences in genome-wide patterns of methylation. However, although genetic ancestry has been used to adjust for confounding in genetic studies, and can account for much of the ethnic differences in methylation in this study, ethnic identity is associated with methylation beyond the effects of shared genetic ancestry. This is likely due to social and environmental effects captured by ethnicity. Indeed, we find that CpG sites known to be influenced by social and environmental exposures are also differentially methylated between ethnic subgroups. These findings called attention to a more complete understanding of the effect of social and environmental variables on methylation in the context of race and ethnicity to fully understanding this complex process.</p><p>Our findings have important implications for the independent and joint effects of race, ethnicity, and genetic ancestry in biomedical research and clinical practice, especially in studies conducted in diverse or admixed populations. Our conclusions may be generalizable to any population that is racially mixed such as those from South Africa, India, and Brazil, though we would encourage further study in diverse populations, and likely has implications for all studies of diverse populations. As the National Institutes of Health (NIH) embarks on a precision medicine initiative, this research underscores the importance of including diverse populations and studying factors capturing the influence of social, cultural, and environmental factors, in addition to genetic ones, upon disparities in disease and drug response.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Participant recruitment</title><p>All research on human subjects was approved by the Institutional Review Board at the University of California and each of the recruitment sites (Kaiser Permanente Northern California, Children’s Hospital Oakland, Northwestern University, Children’s Memorial Hospital Chicago, Baylor College of Medicine on behalf of the Texas Children’s Hospital, VA Medical Center in Puerto Rico, the Albert Einstein College of Medicine on behalf of the Jacobi Medical Center in New York and the Western Review Board on behalf of the Centro de Neumologia Pediatrica), and all participants/parents provided age-appropriate written assent/consent.

We performed both a simple correlation analysis of these principal coordinates to demographic factors (age, sex, ethnicity), estimated cell counts and technical factors (batch, plate, and position) to identify factors that correlated with global methylation patterns [see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). In addition, we performed a multiple regression analysis of methylation principal coordinates by ethnicity and ancestry, adjusting for case status, age, sex, estimated cell counts, and plate and position (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1A</xref>).</p><p>We also sought to establish the extent to which global differences in methylation between Puerto Ricans and Mexicans could be explained by differences in ancestry between the two groups. We estimated the proportion of the ethnicity association that was mediated by genomic ancestry using the R package ‘mediation’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Tingley et al., 2014</xref>) for methylation principal coordinates, which demonstrated a significant association with ethnicity.</p><p>We also sought to correlate ethnicity and methylation at a locus-specific level. We thus performed a linear regression between methylation at each CpG site and self-reported ethnicity (Mexican, Puerto Rican, Mixed Latino, and Other Latino), followed by a three degree of freedom analysis of variance to determine the overall effect of ethnicity on methylation We repeated the analysis excluding the 16 participants that were self-described as ‘Mixed Latino’, and tested for non-linearity in two ways: by adding second and third order polynomials to the model, and by adding a 3-degree of freedom cubic spline and comparing models with the non-linear terms to those without using a nested ANOVA. At loci where there was evidence for non-linearity, we tested whether ethnicity remained associated with methylation after adjusting for ancestry as well as the deviations from linearity. Finally, we tested for the presence of population sub-structure beyond that conveyed through ancestry by adding the genetic principal components 3–10 (PCs 1 and 2 were co-linear with ancestry with a coefficient of determination R<sup>2</sup> &gt; 0.998) and comparing models with those PCs to those without. At loci where there was evidence for association between PC’s 3–10 and methylation, we tested whether ethnicity remained associated with methylation after adjusting for ancestry as well as the PC’s 3–10.</p><p>We calculated the proportion of variance in methylation explained by ethnicity and genomic ancestry at each site where ethnicity was significantly associated with methylation. To do this, we fit a model that included both ethnicity and global ancestry as well as the confounders described above and calculated the proportion of variance explained by multiplying the ratio of the variance between predictors (ethnicity and genomic ancestry) and outcome (methylation) by the square of the effect magnitude (ß).</p><p>We also examined whether differences in methylation patterns by ethnicity could be associated with known loci that had previously been reported to vary based on common environmental exposures, including maternal smoking during pregnancy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Joubert et al., 2012</xref>), diesel exhaust particles (DEP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jiang et al., 2014</xref>), and exposure to violence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chen et al., 2013</xref>). We have previously shown that exposure to these common environmental exposures or similar exposures varied by ethnicity within our own GALA II study populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Oh et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Nishimura et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Thakur et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>In addition, we examined the association between global ancestry and methylation across all CpG loci using a two-degree of freedom likelihood ratio test as well as by examining the association between individual ancestral components (African, European, and Native American) and methylation at each CpG site. At each site where methylation was significantly associated with genomic ancestry proportions, we determined the relative effect of global ancestry (θ, theta) and local ancestry (γ, gamma) in a joint model by calculating the proportion of variance explained as above.</p><p>To determine whether ancestry associations with methylation were due to variation in local ancestry, we correlated local ancestry at each CpG site with methylation at the site. Because ancestry LD is much stronger than genotypic LD, it is possible to accurately interpolate ancestry at each CpG site based on the ancestry estimated at the nearest SNPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Galanter et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Rosenberg et al., 2010</xref>). Measures of locus-specific ancestry were correlated with local methylation using linear regression. We performed a two-degree of freedom analysis of variance test evaluating the overall effect of all three ancestries as well as single-ancestry associations comparing methylation at a given locus with the number of African, European and Native American chromosomes at that CpG site.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors acknowledge the families and patients for their participation and thank the numerous health care providers and community clinics for their support and participation in GALA II.

Your article has been reviewed by Frank Johannes, Mark Shriver, and Marcus Nordborg (who is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors) and the evaluation has been overseen by Mark McCarthy as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>A very clear paper that convincingly argues that self-described ethnicity explains methylation variation between individuals even after genetic ancestry has been taken into account, presumably because shared ethnicity implies shared environment. Although there is no demonstration that the findings have clinical importance, our consensus opinion is that the work is fundamentally interesting.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Principal component analysis of global patterns of methylation showed that when genetic ancestry was adjusted for, self-identified ethnicity remain significant for PC 6, suggesting that this measured contains other, non-genetic, factors. In an effort to identify specific DMRs that are associated with self-identified ethnicity you performed a EWA scan. This scan initially uncovered 916 genome-wide significant CpG sites. However, repeating this analysis after adjusting for genetic ancestry yielded only 314 significant associations. Hence, most of the initial 916 associations were due to genetic effects. Variance component of the remaining 314 sites showed that &quot;genomic ancestry explained a median of 4.2% (IQR 1.8% to 8.3%) of the variance in methylation at these loci and accounts for a median of 75% (IQR 45.8% to 92%) of the variance in methylation explained jointly by ethnicity and ancestry&quot;. In the Abstract of the manuscript, you only report that &quot;[…] shared genomic ancestry accounted for a median of 75.7% (IQR 45.8% to 92%) of the variance in methylation associated with ethnicity.&quot; Hence, we find the use of these results slightly misleading. Translating the 75% into effect sizes means that genetic ancestry and ethnicity jointly explain a median of 5.6% of the variance in DNA methylation at the 314 identified CpG sites, and that ethnicity explains merely 1.4% (median) of the variation. These effect sizes seem very modest, particularly the effects of ethnicity. It is also not clear to which extent these associations are independent. You should show the extent to which methylation scores at the 314 CpG sites are correlated.</p><p>2) You used Eigensoft to detect fine-scale sub-continental genetic ancestry. Eight of the Eigensoft PCs were used in a re-analysis of the 314 CpGs. Interestingly, an additional 51 loci seem to be explained by fine-scale genetic diversity; thus leaving 263 loci where ethnicity had significant marginal effects. You do not report the relative contribution of ethnicity from this re-analysis (i.e. are we still talking about 1.4% (median) variance explained, or is it now less?). This should probably be done.</p><p>3) Starting in subsection “Ethnic differences in environmentally-associated methylation sites”, you search for overlaps between the 916 DMRs from their initial EWA scan and CpGs sites previously shown to be associated with specific environmental variables. The motivation for this analysis seems to follow from the fact that (at least some of) these CpG sites are associated with ethnicity and are likely mediate uncharacterized environmental exposures. You do indeed find a significant enrichment with CpG sites shown to be correlated with maternal-smoking, diesel-exhaust particle exposure and heavy trauma exposure in adults. You conclude that &quot;these results are supportive of our hypothesis that environmental exposures may be responsible for the observed differences in methylation between ethnic groups and are presented in Table S8&quot;. We don't understand why you go back to the 916 CpG sites for this analysis, considering that you already established that 916-263 = 653 of these are explained by genetic ancestry? Are you suggesting that there is genotype x environmental correlation? Furthermore, which of the 916 show enrichment with the environmental-associated CpG sites from previous studies? Are these mostly the 263 CpGs for which we have evidence that they are not fully explained by genetic ancestry? Or are we talking about many CpG sites that are strongly affected by genetic ancestry? The later would indeed imply that environmental associations of previous studies are mediated by genetic effects. If this is the case, the conclusions of this manuscript (and probably those of previous studies) would substantial change. This consideration should be thoroughly investigated and discussed.</p><p>4) You state in the Introduction that it is desirable to replace self-identified ethnicity (a social-construct) which biological constructs in biomedical research, because the latter are potentially better (and less biased) predictors of disease outcomes. Self-identified ethnicity subsumes genetic ancestry as well complex environmental variables such as social-economic status, diet, exposures to toxins, life-style choices, etc. Your earlier work already showed that genetic ancestry (inferred to genotype data) can be a better predictor of biomedical outcomes than self-identified ethnicity. The reason is that these self-reports poorly tag true genetic ancestry. Similarly, one can expect that these self-reports do not adequately tag specific environmental factors. If such environmental factors impact biomedical outcomes via their effects on DNA methylation it would be sensible to try to use DMRs directly as predictors of biomedical outcomes, in addition to genetic ancestry, even if these DMRs are not associated with self-identified ethnicity. Conversely, many of the 916 CpGs the authors identified in their EWAs analysis should be ideally be assessed for their impact on biomedical outcomes. It may well be that their effects are mostly neutral, or that their effect sizes are too small. This also applies to DMRs at CpGs that have been shown to be associated with maternal smoking. If this cannot be done, it should at least be discussed.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.20532.019</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Essential revisions:</italic> </p><p><italic>1) Principal component analysis of global patterns of methylation showed that when genetic ancestry was adjusted for, self-identified ethnicity remain significant for PC 6, suggesting that this measured contains other, non-genetic, factors.

You should show the extent to which methylation scores at the 314 CpG sites are correlated.</italic> </p><p>Ancestry and ethnicity jointly explain a median of 6.8% of the variance in methylation (IQR 4.5% to 10.0%); the discrepancy from the reviewers’ calculation is due to the fact that the median of the sum is different than the sum of medians. The observed effect sizes appear modest in many cases because the reported numbers include all DMRs that were statistically associated with ethnicity, regardless of effect size. We note that in one CpG (cg09668627), ethnicity and ancestry jointly explained 38.5% of the variance in methylation and there were 17 CpG’s where ethnicity and ancestry jointly explain more 25% of the variance.</p><p>Moreover, because there is imperfect correlation between ethnicity and ancestry on the one hand, and the causative meQTL’s and presumed environmental factors on the other, the observed effects of ancestry and ethnicity on methylation are reduced. Thus, we find larger effect sizes in our analysis of the variance explained jointly by global and local ancestry. We find that among the 194 CpG sites that were associated with global genetic ancestry, local and global ancestry jointly explain a median of 21.4% of the variance (IQR 16.4% to 27.3%). Over 25% of the variance is explained in 65 of the 194 sites. The proportion of variance in methylation explained was as high as 72.2% at cg04922029 in the DARC gene (as one would expect, almost all of the variance is explained by local ancestry). However, when we examine the variance explained by ethnicity and global ancestry at cg04922029, we are able to explain a smaller proportion of the variance (30.7%, almost all of it captured by global ancestry). We hypothesize that a similar effect would be seen with environmental measures since ethnicity is an imperfect proxy for environmental exposure.</p><p>We would like to clarify that the variance component analysis was reported on all 916 CpG’s, not just the 314 that remained significant after adjusting for ancestry. We apologize for any confusion that arose from writing “at these loci”. At the 314 loci that remained associated with ethnicity, the median total variance explained jointly by ethnicity and ancestry was 6.2% (IQR 4.4% to 8.8%); ethnicity accounted for a median of 3.5% of the variance in methylation (IQR 2.2% to 5.1%) while ancestry accounted for a median of 1.8% (IQR 0.8% to 4.0%) and explained 32% (IQR 16.8% to 56.2%) of the total variance accounted for jointly by ethnicity and ancestry. Among the 520 CpG’s that were no longer associated with ethnicity when adjusted for ancestry, the median total variance explained jointly by ethnicity and ancestry was 7.8% (IQR 5.3% to 11.1%); ethnicity explains less than 1% of the variance in methylation, while ancestry explains 6.6% of the variance (IQR 4.0% to 10.2%), corresponding to a median of 88.0% of the variance jointly explained (IQR 75.6% to 95.4%). We added a table (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>) describing these findings and made reference to them in the Results section.</p><p>Generally, there was a moderate amount of correlation between the 314 methylation sites associated with ethnicity after correcting for ancestry. Among the 49,141 pairs of CpGs the median R<sup>2</sup> was 0.044 (IQR 0.010 to 0.125). This is more correlation than was seen between 100 random methylation sites where median R<sup>2</sup> was 0.012 (IQR 0.003 to 0.035), though we would expect greater correlation due to the common effect of ethnicity at the sites. We have made reference to this correlation in the Results section.</p><p><italic>2) You used Eigensoft to detect fine-scale sub-continental genetic ancestry. Eight of the Eigensoft PCs were used in a re-analysis of the 314 CpGs. Interestingly, an additional 51 loci seem to be explained by fine-scale genetic diversity; thus leaving 263 loci where ethnicity had significant marginal effects. You do not report the relative contribution of ethnicity from this re-analysis (i.e. are we still talking about 1.4% (median) variance explained, or is it now less?). This should probably be done.</italic> </p><p>As suggested by the reviewers, we performed a similar analysis among the 314 CpG’s that we examined for higher order associations. Overall, among the 314 CpG’s, that remained associated with methylation after adjustment for ethnicity, the median total variance accounted for by ethnicity, ancestry, and fine-scale substructure was 10.4% (IQR 6.6% to 16.1%), of which ethnicity explained a median of 1.7% (IQR 0.8% to 3.8%), ancestry explained a median of 2.9% (IQR 1.0 to 4.6%) and fine scale substructure explained a median of 3.4% (IQR 2.0% to 4.2%). Among the CpG’s whose ethnicity association was not explained by fine-scale substructure, ethnicity explained a median of 1.9% (IQR 1.0% to 4.0%) and as high as 26.7%, ancestry explained 2.8% (IQR 1.0% to 6.2%), and fine scale ancestry explained 3.2% (IQR 1.9% to 4.7%). Note, however, that we would expect measures of the proportion of variance explained by fine scale population structure to be somewhat inflated due to the inclusion of 8 additional terms for each of the PC’s. This text was added to the Results section.</p><p><italic>3) Starting in subsection “Ethnic differences in environmentally-associated methylation sites”, you search for overlaps between the 916 DMRs from their initial EWA scan and CpGs sites previously shown to be associated with specific environmental variables. The motivation for this analysis seems to follow from the fact that (at least some of) these CpG sites are associated with ethnicity and are likely mediate uncharacterized environmental exposures.

The later would indeed imply that environmental associations of previous studies are mediated by genetic effects. If this is the case, the conclusions of this manuscript (and probably those of previous studies) would substantial change. This consideration should be thoroughly investigated and discussed.</italic> </p><p>Our procedure for looking for enrichment among ethnicity associated loci identified in the Joubert paper is a bit different than what was understood by the reviewers. We first looked to see if there was an enrichment in nominal associations with ethnicity (p &lt;.05) among all the CpG’s associated with in utero tobacco smoke that passed QC in our study (n = 4404). We found that 1341 (30.4% of them) were at least nominally associated with ethnicity, which was highly enriched (p = 2 x 10-16). We also found that 126 of those CpG’s were associated with ethnicity at a Bonferroni corrected p-value of 1.1x10-5 (corrected for 4404 comparisons). It was only then that we examined whether any were among the CpG’s associated with ethnicity at a genome-wide Bonferroni correction, and found that 27 of them were associated with ethnicity. Since we did not perform the ancestry adjustment of ethnicity genome-wide (we only performed it for the 916 loci that were significantly associated with ethnicity), we felt it would be most appropriate to look whether the in utero tobacco associated DMRs were within this larger group.</p><p>In light of the reviewers’ question, we examined the 314 DMRs that were associated with ethnicity even after adjusting for ancestry and found that 14 CpG’s were associated with in utero tobacco smoke in the Joubert et al. paper. We also examined the 263 CpG’s whose association with ethnicity could not be explained by ancestry or fine-scale population structure and found that 12 of them were associated with in utero tobacco smoke in the Joubert et al. paper. Neither of these results are significantly disproportionate to the proportion of CpG’s associated with (unadjusted) ethnicity.</p><p>There are a number of plausible reasons for overlap between CpG’s associated with ancestry and those associated with in utero tobacco smoke (or other environmental exposures). As the reviewers suggest, it is possible that this represents a gene-by-environment interaction, and that individuals with certain genetic backgrounds are more susceptible to the effects of in utero tobacco smoke than those of other genetic backgrounds. Leng et al. (AJRCCM, 2013) have showed that Hispanic smokers with high Native American ancestry had reduced risk of methylation across 12 genes, suggesting an ancestry by smoking interaction. Because the majority of studies in the consortium in the Joubert study enrolled participants of European descent, such interactions might not have been evident in their study.</p><p>It is also possible that environmental exposures correlate with ancestry and that participants with certain ancestral backgrounds may have been more exposed to in utero tobacco smoke than those of other backgrounds. Several studies have shown correlations between genetic ancestry and environmental exposures, including socioeconomic status (Florez et al., 2011), overweight and obesity (Ziv et al., 2006), and birth site and country of residence (Burchard et al., 2005). Though our analysis of global ancestry showed that a majority of the variance explained jointly by local and global ancestry can be traced to specific loci in the genome acting in -cis, a substantial proportion cannot. Although some of the residual association between global ancestry and methylation may be do to genetic effects acting in -trans, we cannot exclude the possibility that some of it may be due to environmental exposures correlating with global ancestry. Thus, it is plausible that genomic ancestry is acting as a proxy for both genetic and environmental effects in our study.</p><p>Finally, it is possible that our analysis identified DMRs that are independently modifiable by both genetic and environmental exposures. Thus, regions of the genome that are differentially methylated due to genetic polymorphisms may also be more susceptible to differential methylation due to environmental exposures.</p><p>At the reviewers’ suggestion, we reported the additional analysis in subsection “Ethnic differences in environmentally-associated methylation sites” and discussed the findings and their implications (Discussion section).</p><p><italic>4) You state in the Introduction that it is desirable to replace self-identified ethnicity (a social-construct) which biological constructs in biomedical research, because the latter are potentially better (and less biased) predictors of disease outcomes. Self-identified ethnicity subsumes genetic ancestry as well complex environmental variables such as social-economic status, diet, exposures to toxins, life-style choices, etc. Your earlier work already showed that genetic ancestry (inferred to genotype data) can be a better predictor of biomedical outcomes than self-identified ethnicity. The reason is that these self-reports poorly tag true genetic ancestry. Similarly, one can expect that these self-reports do not adequately tag specific environmental factors. If such environmental factors impact biomedical outcomes via their effects on DNA methylation it would be sensible to try to use DMRs directly as predictors of biomedical outcomes, in addition to genetic ancestry, even if these DMRs are not associated with self-identified ethnicity. Conversely, many of the 916 CpGs the authors identified in their EWAs analysis should be ideally be assessed for their impact on biomedical outcomes. It may well be that their effects are mostly neutral, or that their effect sizes are too small. This also applies to DMRs at CpGs that have been shown to be associated with maternal smoking. If this cannot be done, it should at least be discussed.</italic> </p><p>We agree with the reviewers that one of the great promises for studies of methylation is their ability to tag environmental factors that may play a role in disease. Even in cases where the effect of an environmental exposure on disease is not directly mediated via methylation, the patterns of methylation that result from the exposure could be used as a lasting biomarker of exposure long after the exposure has passed. For example, in the study by Joubert et al. cited in our paper, measures of in utero exposure to tobacco persisted into childhood. Thus, as the reviewers point out, it would be sensible to perform an analysis examining associations between DMRs, particularly those known to be associated with ethnicity, ancestry and environmental exposures, and relevant biomedical outcomes (Discussion section).</p><p>Although it was beyond the scope of this paper to look at the association between DMRs and biomedical outcomes, we have performed a preliminary epigenome-wide analysis of asthma in this Latino population. Within that analysis, we find no evidence of enrichment in CpG’s associated with asthma among the 916 CpG’s associated with ethnicity in the current manuscript (p = 0.06 for enrichment, minimum p = 0.0009 for cg23702046, Bonferroni adjusted minimum p = 0.8). In the overall EWAS of asthma, we did find one CpG that was significantly associated with asthma, cg02458554 in chromosome 18 (p = 2.9 x 10<sup>-7</sup>). This CpG was not significantly associated with ethnicity (p = 0.4), but intriguingly, it was associated with genetic ancestry (p = 4.5 x 10<sup>-4</sup>). There did appear to be marginal enrichment in CpG’s associated with asthma among the results reported by Joubert et al. (p = 0.01), however, no individual CpG was associated with asthma when corrected for the number of comparisons (min p = 3.3 x 10<sup>-5</sup>, adjusted min-p = 0.1). These findings are awaiting replication and are outside the scope of this manuscript, but as recommended by the reviewers, we have expanded our Discussion along the lines noted.</p></body></sub-article></article>
