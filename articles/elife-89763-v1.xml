concentration and gene expression imbalance. These alterations were usually investigated separately, and the potential rescuing effects of green tea extracts enriched in epigallocatechin-3-gallate (GTE-EGCG) provided disparate results due to different experimental conditions. We overcame these limitations by conducting the first longitudinal controlled experiment evaluating genotype and GTE-EGCG prenatal chronic treatment effects before and after treatment discontinuation. Our findings revealed that the Ts65Dn mouse model reflected the pleiotropic nature of DS, exhibiting brachycephalic skull, ventriculomegaly, neurodevelopmental delay, hyperactivity, and impaired memory robustness with altered hippocampal metabolite concentration and gene expression. GTE-EGCG treatment modulated most systems simultaneously but did not rescue DS phenotypes. On the contrary, the treatment exacerbated trisomic phenotypes including body weight, tibia microarchitecture, neurodevelopment, adult cognition, and metabolite concentration, not supporting the therapeutic use of GTE-EGCG as a prenatal chronic treatment. Our results highlight the importance of longitudinal experiments assessing the co-modulation of multiple systems throughout development when characterizing preclinical models in complex disorders and evaluating the pleiotropic effects and general safety of pharmacological treatments.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Down syndrome</kwd><kwd>integrated development</kwd><kwd>cognition</kwd><kwd>Bone</kwd><kwd>RNA</kwd><kwd>Brain</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004040</institution-id><institution>KU Leuven</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>C24/17/061</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Vande Velde</surname><given-names>Greetje</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100016880</institution-id><institution>Marie-Marguerite Delacroix Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Doctoral Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Llambrich</surname><given-names>Sergi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Ts65dn mice exhibit structural, functional, molecular, and genetic alterations that are modulated but unrecovered by prenatal chronic GTE-EGCG, highlighting the importance of holistic studies to understand complex disorders and treatments.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Down syndrome (DS) is a developmental disorder with structural, functional, molecular, and genetic alterations that show a dynamic onset and severity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Antonarakis et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">de Moraes et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Grieco et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Keeling et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">LaCombe and Roper, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Llambrich et al., 2022a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">McCarron et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib141">Steingass et al., 2011</xref>). The alterations associated with DS simultaneously affect multiple systems that are likely interrelated over development, with changes in one system modulating the others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Llambrich et al., 2022b</xref>). Many studies have provided evidence of these developmental alterations and have demonstrated the ability of dietary supplements such as epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) or green tea extracts enriched in EGCG (GTE-EGCG) to modulate these systems separately (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Catuara-Solarz et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">de la Torre et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Goodlett et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Guedj et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Llambrich et al., 2022b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib122">Rondal, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib134">Stagni et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib138">Starbuck et al., 2021</xref>). However, a holistic evaluation of the simultaneous effects of trisomy and GTE-EGCG in those intertwined systems is missing. The variety in experimental setups and readouts obtained in different preclinical studies hinders the comparison and integration of results and, as a result, evidence is usually contradictory, reporting both positive and negative treatment effects. This lack of consistency can lead to biased interpretations about the etiology of the disorder and the potential effect of pharmacological treatments.</p><p>Much of this DS research was based on the Ts65Dn mouse model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Davisson et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib117">Reeves et al., 1995</xref>), as it was one of the first preclinical models available for DS and has been widely used for experimental testing. These mice carry a segment with approximately 120 genes homologous to Hsa21 (starting upstream of Mrpl39 to the telomeric end of Mmu16), translocated to a small centromeric part of Mmu17 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Duchon et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Herault et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib118">Reinholdt et al., 2011</xref>). Ts65Dn mice are trisomic for about two-thirds of the genes orthologous to Hsa21, but also carry genes originating from the Mmu17 that are not related with DS, including about 46 protein-coding genes, 35 nonprotein-coding genes and 35 pseudogenes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Muñiz Moreno et al., 2020</xref>). These genetic alterations do not fully represent DS’s aneuploidy and other mouse and rat models have been developed recently that more faithfully represent the trisomic nature of DS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Kazuki et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Kazuki et al., 2022</xref>). However, in this study, we used the Ts65Dn mouse model because it recapitulates the main skeletal, brain, cognitive, brain metabolite, and genetic alterations associated with DS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Blazek et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Costa et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Dierssen et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Escorihuela et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Gupta et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Huang et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Llambrich et al., 2022b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Même et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib138">Starbuck et al., 2021</xref>); and the effects of GTE-EGCG pharmacological modulation have been extensively evaluated using this mouse model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Catuara-Solarz et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Goodlett et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Jamal et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Llambrich et al., 2022b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">McElyea et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib135">Stagni et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib138">Starbuck et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib143">Stringer et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>At the structural level, people with DS show skeletal and brain alterations that progress through ontogeny (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Antonarakis et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">de Moraes et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Fischer-Brandies et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Keeling et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">LaCombe and Roper, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">Pearlson et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib138">Starbuck et al., 2021</xref>). Children with DS have a decreased buildup of bone mass and a low bone turnover rate, resulting in more osteoclast than osteoblast activity, smaller bone area, lower bone mineral density (BMD), and an increased risk of osteoporosis at adulthood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Carfì et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Keeling et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">LaCombe and Roper, 2020</xref>). Individuals with DS also present midfacial hypoplasia and flattened nasal bridge along with skull malformations resulting in a shorter, wider, and rounder skull (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Blazek et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">LaCombe and Roper, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib119">Richtsmeier et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib145">Suri et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib149">Thomas and Roper, 2021</xref>). Previous studies have shown the potential of GTE-EGCG to modulate craniofacial and postcranial morphology, as well as the microarchitecture and BMD of the long bones, showing positive, negative or no treatment effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abeysekera et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Blazek et al., 2015a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Jamal et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Llambrich et al., 2022a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">McElyea et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib138">Starbuck et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib143">Stringer et al., 2017</xref>). We previously detected dose-, time-, and anatomical structure-dependent effects in a study using the same mouse model and the same treatment regime with two different GTE-EGCG doses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Llambrich et al., 2022a</xref>). A dose of 100 mg/kg/day of GTE-EGCG exacerbated facial dysmorphologies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib138">Starbuck et al., 2021</xref>), modified the skeletal dysmorphologies associated with DS without rescuing the bones shape (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Llambrich et al., 2022a</xref>), and altered the integration between the skull and the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Llambrich et al., 2022b</xref>). However, a lower dose of 30 mg/kg/day significantly reduced the facial dysmorphologies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib138">Starbuck et al., 2021</xref>) but did not show additional rescuing effects in other skeletal traits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Llambrich et al., 2022a</xref>).</p><p>In DS, the craniofacial size and shape alterations are accompanied with structural brain alterations.

Regarding treatment effects, the combined results from all tests suggested that even though the treatment could have had a positive effect reducing the anxiety of treated mice, it likely altered memory robustness and induced a more hyperactive, explorative, and risk-taking behavior. After treatment discontinuation, when the tests were repeated, all groups of mice presented less locomotor activity and explorative behavior. It is not unlikely that this reduction in activity was due to the stress and anxiety induced by the manipulation and testing during the first round of cognitive evaluation. However, TS untreated mice and both WT and TS treated mice still tended to show increased locomotor activity and explorative behavior compared with WT untreated mice, suggesting that the prenatal chronic treatment could have had permanent adverse effects after one month of discontinuation, or could have reduced the anxiety produced by the first round of testing while mice were treated.

Similarly, TS treated mice presented a larger cerebellum and hyperactivity when compared to WT untreated mice after treatment discontinuation, but only 12 genes were found to be differentially expressed between WT untreated and TS treated mice at that stage. These results can be interpreted as that the altered expression of a few genes was sufficient to alter the brain and cognitive phenotypes, or that the alteration of gene expression during development was no longer detected at adulthood but was sufficient to permanently alter brain volumetry and cognition, which would be in line with previous reports indicating that the altered phenotype in DS was due to small contributions of multiple genes rather than strong effects of a few selected genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Antonarakis et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Chang et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Chrast et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">De Toma et al., 2021</xref>).

As a result, evidence from different studies is challenging to interpret, and can lead to misinterpretations about the course of the disorder and the effects of pharmacological treatments. With our approach, the differences between experimental setups could be accounted for, analyzing the simultaneous development of different systems in the same mice in a controlled experimental setup, and investigating the related effects of trisomy and treatment in multiple related systems.</p><p>Our results support that, overall, the Ts65Dn model reflects the multisystemic nature of DS and recapitulates many characteristics of the trisomic phenotype. As compared to WT mice, Ts65Dn mice presented a trend for reduced body weight over development together with a brachycephalic skull with facial flatness and a trend for reduced BMD in the humerus. These skeletal alterations co-occurred with cognitive delay during early stages of development, hyperactivity, impaired long-term memory, and increased explorative and risk-taking behavior at adulthood. At the molecular and genetic level, Ts65Dn mice presented alterations in the hippocampal metabolite spectra and differential gene expression in the cerebellum. However, our results also revealed phenotypes that did not match the human condition, as Ts65Dn mice did not show altered tibia microarchitecture and showed increased hippocampal, cerebellar, ventricular, and whole brain volumes. Overall, our longitudinal analyses confirm the validity of the model for the structural, functional, molecular and genetic phenotypes associated with DS, but also support the hypothesis of genotypic and phenotypic drift within the Ts65Dn mouse model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib129">Shaw et al., 2020</xref>), as we generally observed a decrease in the magnitude of alterations induced by the genotype compared to previous articles including our earlier work.</p><p>Regarding the treatment effects, our results confirmed that GTE-EGCG modulated most of these systems simultaneously along development. However, our holistic approach revealed that, in general, the treatment did not rescue the trisomic phenotype and even exacerbated some phenotypes over time, such as body weight, tibia microarchitecture, neurodevelopment, adult cognition, and hippocampal metabolite concentration. Although discontinuing the GTE-EGCG administration reduced the treatment effects, it did not rescue the trisomic phenotype, as TS treated mice remained different from WT untreated mice in most systems. Discontinuing the GTE-EGCG treatment for three months only rescued the body weight and brain volume of a few TS mice but increased the weight of WT mice and reduced the BMD of the humerus in both WT and TS mice.

Next, in the Social Preference stage with Subject 1 (S1), the test mouse was placed in the middle chamber for 300 s while one stranger mouse (STR1) was placed in either the left or right chamber, and the other chamber was left empty. Social approach was recorded as time spent close to STR1, and a preference ratio was calculated (Pref=100* Time close to STR1/ (Time close to STR1 +Time close to Empty)).

Exploration time involving sniffing in close proximity (&lt;2 cm) was recorded by an overhead camera and tracking software. Total exploration time was set at minimally 15 s to ensure that object characteristics were encoded. Sixty minutes later, the animals were placed in the arena for 10 min, with one object replaced by a novel object, and exploration time was recorded. Preference for novel object was calculated as ratio (Pref=100* Time novel object / (Time familiar object +novel object)). Objects were randomly assigned as familiar or novel for each mouse, and the left or right position of the novel object was counterbalanced between trials. Exploration time was measured by a camera and ANY-mazeTM Video Tracking System software (Stoelting Co., IL, USA).</p><p>The PA experimental set-up consisted of a transparent box illuminated with an LED lamp leading to a dark box with an electrifiable grid connected to a shocker (LE 100–26, Panlab Bioseb, Spain) and a lid.

The next day, the trial was repeated (without foot shock presentation) and latency to enter the dark compartment was recorded (maximum 300 s). Animals with good memory retention would display a higher latency to enter on day 2. This test was repeated in the same animals after treatment cessation. We noticed that upon re-exposure to the same setup, some animals still remembered the CS-US presentation, and refused to enter the dark box.

As we compared four groups of mice, the LDA created three new axes that were independent among them and explained 100% of variation across groups. In the LDA, the separation among groups was determined by Mahalanobis distances, which account for correlations between standardized variables, and allow to combine measurements with different units in the same analysis.</p><p>If slight or no differences were associated with DS or treatment, the mice groups overlapped in the PCA or LDA scatterplot, showing similar phenotypes. If there were differences, the different groups of mice separated from each other.</p><p>To statistically quantify differences between WT, TS, WT treated and TS treated mice and answer the five scientific questions formulated above, we performed pairwise permutation tests with 10,000 rounds following the PCAs and LDAs. For the craniofacial shape analysis, we obtained the p-values from the permutation tests based on the Procrustes distances between the average shape of pairs of groups at each developmental stage using MorphoJ v1.06d (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Klingenberg, 2011</xref>). For the gene expression analysis, we obtained the p-values from the pairwise comparisons after a one-way PERMANOVA based on Euclidean distances using PAST v4.1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Hammer et al., 2001</xref>). For the tibia microarchitecture tests, brain volumetric tests, neurodevelopmental tests, adult cognitive tests, and hippocampal metabolite concentration tests we obtained the p-values from the pairwise comparisons after a one-way PERMANOVA based on Mahalanobis distances using PAST v4.1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Hammer et al., 2001</xref>).</p><p>Finally, to better understand the differences between groups, we selected the variables that were testing for a certain domain and grouped them into categories for the tibia microarchitecture tests, neurodevelopmental tests and adult cognitive tests. We then repeated the multivariate pairwise permutation analysis. The categories were cortical bone strength, cortical bone size and trabecular bone for the tibia microarchitecture; developmental landmarks, neuromotor tests and reflexes for the neurodevelopmental tests; and anxiety, arousal, and memory for the adult cognitive tests.</p></sec></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Visualization, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Formal analysis, Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Formal analysis</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Formal analysis</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Formal analysis</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Formal analysis</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con8"><p>Formal analysis</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con9"><p>Formal analysis</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con10"><p>Formal analysis</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con11"><p>Resources</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con12"><p>Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con13"><p>Resources, Formal analysis, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con14"><p>Formal analysis</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con15"><p>Resources, Supervision</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con16"><p>Resources, Supervision</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con17"><p>Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con18"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Data curation, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Visualization, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con19"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Data curation, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Visualization, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>All procedures complied with all local, national, and European regulations and ARRIVE guidelines and were authorized by the Animal Ethics Committee of KU Leuven (ECD approval number P120/2019).</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s6"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="supp1"><label>Supplementary file 1.</label><caption><title>Experimental, statistical and methodological details.</title><p>(a) Sample size for each analysis, experiment, and developmental stage. Differences in sample size between stages are due to technical reasons such as micro-CT or MR scanner not operating on the scanning day, movement scanning artifacts, or mouse death during the experiment. For the tibia microarchitecture, differences in sample size are due to mice detected as outliers. For the MRS, differences in sample size are due to signal artifacts. For the adult cognitive tests, differences in sample size are due to artifacts during tracking.

Results of the GTE-EGCG treatment do not support its therapeutic use and instead show that the treatment exacerbated certain DS-related phenotypes.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>The authors performed a rigorous assessment of treatment and examined treatment and genotypic alterations at multiple time points during growth and aging. Detailed analysis shows differences in genotype during aging as well as genotype with treatment. This study is solid in the overarching methodological approach (with the exception of RNAseq, described below). The biggest strength of the study is its approach and dataset, which corroborate results from a multitude of past studies on Ts65Dn mice, albeit on adult specimens. It would be beneficial for the dataset to be made available to other researchers using a public data repository.</p></disp-quote><p>We deeply appreciate the reviewers' positive feedback. Their acknowledgment of the solid methodological approach and the rigorous assessment of genotypic and treatment effects over various developmental stages resonates with our motivation. Their suggestion to make the dataset available in a public data repository for other researchers is well-taken. We are committed to data sharing and we are creating a dedicated platform to facilitate the accessibility of our research data to the scientific community. Given its size and complexity, we currently hold the dataset available upon reasonable request to the corresponding authors.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>There are several primary weaknesses, described below:</p><p>Sex was not considered in the analyses.</p><p>The number of experimental animals of each sex are not clearly represented in the paper, but are buried in supplemental tables, and the Ns for the RNAseq are unclear. No analyses were done to examine sex differences in male/female DS or WT animals with or without treatment. Body measurements will greatly vary by sex, but this was not taken into consideration during assessments. As such, there is a high amount of variability within each cohort measured for body assessments (tibia, body weight, skeletal development etc.). Supplemental table 14 had the list of each animal, but not collated by sex, genotype or treatment, making it difficult to assess the strength of each measurement.</p></disp-quote><p>Our study primarily concentrated on providing a holistic understanding of the impact of trisomy and GTE-EGCG treatment on Down syndrome, and was not explicitly designed to investigate sexual dimorphism. However, instead of reporting on only one sex and thereby obviating sex as a source of variation, as in previously published studies, we decided to include both male and female mice within the study design to represent a more realistic portrayal of the nature of Down syndrome in a heterogeneous population. By encompassing both sexes, we aim to better capture the variability in Down syndrome.</p><p>As we do acknowledge the significance of sex bias in scientific research, we considered performing post-hoc analyses to test the effect of sexual dimorphism, but found that our dataset was underpowered to obtain reliable results, since our experiments were not a priori designed to investigate this question and sample sizes for each sex by separate were not large enough. Nevertheless, considering the reviewer’s comment, we have taken specific steps to improve the representation of sex-related information and to enhance the clarity of our manuscript.</p><p>First, we have redesigned all figures using empty and full symbols to distinguish male from female mice within each analysis, providing readers with an immediate sense of the sex distribution in each experimental group. Moreover, we have modified Supplementary Table 1 to offer a comprehensive breakdown of the number of male and female mice for each test, along with their respective genotypes and treatment groups. This table aims to make the sample size and sex distribution within our study as transparent as possible for our readers. While we acknowledge that our study lacked the statistical power to perform a detailed sex-based analysis, the visual representation of sex in our data shows which systems are mainly affected by sexual dysmorphism. This evidence can guide future investigations directly designed to investigate sexual effects in certain systems or structures.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Key results are not clearly depicted in the main figures</p><p>Rigorous assessment of each figure and the clarity of the figure to convey the results of the analysis needs to be performed. Many of the figures do not clearly represent the findings, with authors heavily relying on supplemental figures to present details to explain results. Figure legends do not adequately describe figures; rather, they are limited to describing how the analysis is performed. For example, LDA plots in Figure 4 do not clearly convey the results of metabolite analysis.</p><p>Overall, the amount of data presented here is overwhelming, making it difficult to interpret the findings. Some assessments that do not add to the overall paper need to be removed. Clarifying the text, figures and trimming the supplement to represent the data in a manner that is easily understood will improve the readability of the paper. For example, perhaps measures which are not strongly impacted by genotype could be moved to the supplement, because they are not directly relevant to the question of whether GTE-EGCG reverses the impact of trisomy on the measures.</p></disp-quote><p>As rightly pointed out by the reviewers, the vast amount of data generated by our holistic and longitudinal approach is one of the primary strengths, but also an important challenge in our study. Our dataset encompasses a comprehensive assessment of the effects of treatment and genotypic alterations at multiple time points during growth and aging. This multi-dimensional evaluation is pivotal to our research, and relegating data to supplementary material would restrict access to this holistic understanding. Our aim is to provide readers with a complete view of the complex interactions we have explored, and retaining this data in the main text is essential to uphold the integrity of our work.</p><p>Indeed, we specifically chose to submit or manuscript to eLife because this journal allows to access supplemental information directly from the text and figures in the main manuscript and best aligned with our approach to data presentation. The eLife format permits us to offer readers a quick and informative overview of all the data within the main figures employing multivariate techniques such as Linear Discriminant Analysis or Principal Component Analysis. Subsequently, we supply more detailed analyses in the supplementary figures for readers who wish to delve deeper into specific aspects. Furthermore, while certain figures may be categorized as supplementary, for us it is crucial, and we would like to emphasize, that every result is comprehensively described in the main text.</p><p>Acknowledging the concerns raised about the density of our paper and the potential challenges in interpreting the findings, we have conducted a thorough review of the text and figure legends. We have made revisions with the goal to enhance clarity and readability. We have made dedicated efforts to ensure that readers can readily grasp the significance of our results and appreciate the intricacies of our findings. We firmly believe that with these revisions, our chosen approach is the most effective means of presenting the richness of our data and maintaining the integrity of our findings.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Lack of clarity in the behavioral analyses</p><p>Behavioral assessments are not clearly written in the methods. For example, for the novel object recognition task, it isn't clear how preference was calculated. Is this simply the percent of time spent with the novel object, or is this a relative measure (novel:familiar ratio)? This matters because if it is simply the percent of time, the relevant measure is to compare each group to 50% (the absence of a preference). The key measures for each test need to be readily distinguished from the control measures.</p><p>There are also many dependent behavioral measures. For example, speed and distance are directly related to each other, but these are typically reported as control measures to help interpret the key measure, which is the anxiety-like behavior. Similarly, some behavioral tests were used to represent multiple behavioral dimensions, such as anxiety and arousal. In general, the measurements of arousal seem atypical (speed and distance are typically reported as control measures, not measures of arousal). Similarly, measures of latency during training would not typically be used as a measure of long-term memory but instead reported as a control measure to show learning occurred. LDA analysis requires independence of the measures, as well as normality. It does not appear that all of the measures fed into this analysis would have met these assumptions, but the methods also do not clearly describe which measures were actually used in the LDA.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewers’ concerns about the clarity of our behavioral analyses and we have thus added information to the methods section to clarify the procedures. Specifically, for SPSN, social approach was recorded as time spent close to STR1, and a preference ratio was calculated as Pref = 100* Time close to STR1/(Time close to STR1 + Time close to Empty). Social recognition memory was scored as preference towards STR2 and calculated as Pref = 100* (time close to STR2) / (Time close to STR1 + Time close to STR2). For NOR, preference for novel object was calculated as Pref=100* Time novel object / (Time familiar object + novel object).</p><p>With regards to the different variables reported for the behavioral protocols, we agree that some measures, such as path length and speed can be used as control measures. For example, in an open field test, path length is an important control measure to assess whether an animal is engaged in the task. However, if an animal is actively moving, the amount of distance covered can but does not have to correlate with the amount of time that a mouse spends in the center of the open field. Using the measure of distance covered as a measure for general arousal and time spent in the center as a measure for anxiety related behavior allows a more nuanced evaluation of animal behavior. For instance, two animals spending similar amounts of time in the center may exhibit differences in the distance they cover. In this scenario, we would argue that anxiety related behavior (defined as exploring the center of an open field) would not reflect well a behavioral difference between the two animals, while the aspect of arousal clearly is a differencing factor.</p><p>Regarding the PA task and the use of latency during training, we agree that typically latency during training can be used as control measure to show that learning occurred. However, our study involved testing animals at two distinct time points. Contextual fear conditioning creates very robust memory traces that can persist for weeks or even months, and therefore the starting premise is very different when repeating the test. Initially, the animals were experimentally naïve and had not yet experienced a foot shock, leading to a rapid entry into the dark box. However, after experiencing the first CS-US presentation, a robust and persistent contextual fear memory trace is formed. Therefore, the latency observed in the second training phase of the PA reflects in essence long-term contextual fear memory, that is robustly displayed in WT animals but less in treated WT and TS animals. We have included this clarification in the methods and results sections.</p><p>Finally, we want to thank the reviewer for noticing the error in the LDAs, as the analysis was indeed performed including dependent variables for some systems. We have re-evaluated the LDAs for the behavioral tests and tibia microarchitecture tests, excluding dependent variables. As a result, the text and significance levels have been adjusted accordingly. To enhance transparency and clarity, we have included Supplementary Table S21, which precisely outlines the variables included in each LDA.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Unclear value of RNAseq</p><p>RNAseq was performed in cerebellum, a relatively spared region in DS pathology at an early time point in disease. Further, the expression of 125 genes triplicated in DS was shown in a PCA plot to highly overlap with WT, indicating that there are minimal differences in gene expression in these genes. If these genes are not critical for cerebellar function, perhaps this could account for the lack of differences between WT and Ts65Dn mice. If the authors are interested in performing RNAseq, it would have made more sense to perform this in hippocampus (to compare with metabolites) and to perform more stringent bioinformatic analysis than assessment by PCA of a limited subset of genes. Supplementary Table S14, which shows the differentially expressed genes, appears to be missing from the manuscript and cannot be evaluated. Additionally, the methods of the RNAseq are not sufficiently described and lack critical details. For example, what was the normalization performed, and which groups were compared to identify differentially expressed genes? It would also be worthwhile to describe how animals were identified for RNAseq-were those animals representative of their groups across other measures?</p></disp-quote><p>We acknowledge the reviewers' comments on the RNAseq analysis and would like to provide additional insights into our rationale and choices for this analysis. The primary aim of our RNAseq analysis was to offer supplementary evidence in support of the broader context of our paper. Rather than focusing on specific genes, our aim was to assess potential alterations in transcription within genes triplicated in the mouse model and explore differentially expressed genes across the entire genome. Therefore, we conducted a global analysis of the triplicated genes using a PCA and analyzed the differentially expressed genes across the entire genome as shown in Supplementary Table S14. The table was originally included as a separate Excel file but apparently it was not received by the reviewers. We have contacted the eLife editorial to ensure its inclusion in the current version. Furthermore, we have modified the text to clarify that both the triplicated genes and the entire genome were analyzed.</p><p>Regarding the use of cerebellum instead of hippocampus, we agree with the reviewers that the hippocampus is a major tissue of interest in the study of Down Syndrome since it mostly relates to cognition. Trisomic patients, however, also display other typical features such as for example a delay in the acquisition of motor skills. Here we decided to focus on the cerebellum as it is primarily associated to the locomotor system but also plays a role in other cognitive functions such as language processing and memory. Furthermore, at the time of the RNAseq analysis, the mice were 8 months old, equivalent to the adult human stage, and previous studies have shown transcriptomic alterations in this tissue and mouse model (Olmos-Serrano et al., 2016; Saran et al., 2003).</p><p>The lack of observable differences between WT and Ts65Dn mice in our PCA analysis may be attributed to several factors as discussed in our article. First, the high variability within each group, inherent to the complexity of DS, may obscure inter-group differences. Additionally, the subtlety of gene expression differences between WT and trisomic mice in the set of triplicated genes, as suggested by other transcriptomics studies on DS (Aït Yahya-Graison et al., 2007; Lyle et al., 2004; Olmos-Serrano et al., 2016; Saran et al., 2003), may contribute to the limited distinctions observed. Furthermore, regarding treatment effects, the timing of the RNAseq analysis should be considered since it was conducted at the endpoint, three months after treatment cessation. This temporal aspect could imply that the effects of the drug are not persistent, and a molecular memory might not be formed and maintained.</p><p>Nevertheless, we appreciate the reviewers' constructive comments and acknowledge the potential for more stringent bioinformatic analyses. While our intention was to provide an initial, global perspective, we are eager to support further investigations that delve deeper into the complexities of DS-related molecular mechanisms. Consequently, the dataset is available for other researchers to explore more specific questions upon request.</p><p>Finally, we have updated the methods section of the article to offer more detailed information on RNAseq processing and analysis. We have also clarified that all the surviving mice were included in the analysis.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Recommendations for the authors:</bold></p><p>(1) Please add power calculations for each of the assessments.</p></disp-quote><p>We would like to clarify that we had already conducted power calculations as part of the initial planning and design phase of our study. After data acquisition and analysis, we have utilized appropriate statistical methods to interpret the results based on the data we have collected. Given that we had conducted a priori power calculations prior to data collection and that our analysis is based on the acquired data, we do not see the added value in including post hoc power calculations. Our primary focus has been on performing the correct statistical analyses to accurately interpret the results and draw meaningful conclusions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) Introduction has some excessive references for each statement, which are not necessary. For instance: lines 67-73 are only references for 1 statement and lines 74-76 are references for a 2nd statement in the same sentence.</p></disp-quote><p>We have removed redundant references.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) Introduction: Lines 136-146 Gene names need to be spelled out, not just the IDs. Were these studies done in human or mouse models of DS?</p></disp-quote><p>We have spelled out the names of the genes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) Why was brain volume and brain structure size normalized to body weight, not clearly explained?</p></disp-quote><p>The choice to normalize brain volume and brain structure size to body weight was a deliberate decision made to address potential confounding factors in our study. In the case of trisomic (TS) mice, they are generally smaller in size compared to their wild-type (WT) counterparts. The same may hold true for sex-related size differences. Without normalization, assessing brain volume and structure size could be misleading, as it might reflect the differences in overall body size rather than providing insights into the specific aspects of brain structure that we aimed to investigate. We have clarified this in the methods section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) In cognitive tests, some of the WT data represented in Figure 3 does not match supplemental findings. Again power calculations may indicate a higher number of WT mice are needed to clarify this discrepancy.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewers' observation regarding the disparities between the data presented in Figure 3 and the supplemental figures. We would like to clarify that these variations are a result of the distinct analytical approaches employed in the two sets of data.</p><p>In Figure 3 and all main figures, the data were analyzed using multivariate tests, which consider multiple variables simultaneously and are particularly suited for investigating the collective impact of multiple factors. Conversely, the results shown in the supplementary figures were derived from univariate tests, which focus on individual variables and are well-suited for addressing specific questions related to each variable in isolation. The discrepancies between the data in the main figures and the supplementary figures can be attributed to the differences in the analytical methods chosen.</p><p>As for the suggestion of conducting power calculations to address the observed differences, we believe that the differences in data are inherent to the distinct analytical strategies and the specific research questions each analysis intended to answer. Power calculations may not be the most suitable approach in this context, as they pertain to sample size planning for hypothesis testing and may not reconcile the inherent dissimilarity between multivariate and univariate analyses.</p><p>Aït Yahya-Graison, E., Aubert, J., Dauphinot, L., Rivals, I., Prieur, M., Golfier, G., . . .
